 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a three-day
losing streak on Wednesday, as recent underperformers and
energy shares led a rally as oil climbed above $100 on supply
concerns.
 The euro sank to a record low against the Swiss franc on
uncertainty over the Greek debt crisis and edged lower against
the dollar and the yen.
 Gold touched three-week highs, while bonds dipped on
reduced flows due to the gains in stocks.
 ""Investors are tired of selling the market, especially with
commodities finding their feet,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior
market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich,
Connecticut.
 In Europe shares rose, led by banking stocks, but the
problems in Greece and other debt-laden European countries cast
a long shadow over markets.
 Europe's policy options to avert a Greek debt default
appeared to be dwindling quickly, fueling fears of a chain
reaction affecting other heavily indebted countries in the
17-nation currency bloc.
 ""The growing consensus of an eventual technical default by
Greece is contributing to uncertainty, which is increasingly
undermining the euro,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 Investors expect Athens, which saddled by massive debts, to
have difficulty implementing more austerity measures as the
government's main opposition party opposes such a move.
 ""For now, there is euro demand around $1.40, but it's just
a matter of time before it goes significantly lower,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting.
 ""What's happening in Europe is the beginning of a prolonged
sovereign debt crisis that will play out this summer,"" he
added. ""Polls suggest 80 percent of Greeks oppose more
austerity, so if the government forces the issue, it will
fall,"" which could increase the risk of a debt default.
 The euro was last down 0.1 percent at $1.4083  ,paring earlier losses after a slide halted at $1.4011.
 It fell to a record low against the Swiss franc at 1.2270
francs , down some 1 percent from late Tuesday.
 EQUITY BOUNCE
 On Wall Street, the thinly traded rally on Wednesday wasn't
seen as strong enough to overcome worries about waning global
demand.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 38.45
points, or 0.31 percent, at 12,394.66. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 4.19 points, or 0.32 percent, at
1,320.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 15.22
points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,761.38.
 Energy shares gained on an unexpected drop in distillate
stockpiles, which boosted heating oil futures. The S&P energy
index <.GSPE> advanced 1.5 percent, by far the biggest
percentage gainer among S&P 500 sectors. Dow component Exxon
 Bespoke Investment Group said breadth in the S&P 500 was
very close to extremely oversold levels and that it was a
buying opportunity the last time those levels were reached, in
March.
 Despite that, further upside was seen as limited given
headwinds from Europe and the prospect of an environment
without supportive monetary policy.
 ""There's a lot of listlessness given the euro-zone issues
and the volatility both ways in commodities, which is
unsettling,"" said Rob McIver, co-portfolio manager of the
Jensen Portfolio in Portland Oregon.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.3 percent while
the pan-European FTSEurofirst index <.FTEU3> of top shares
rose 0.7 percent, with anxiety about the potential for further
Greek contagion limiting gains.
 Japan's Nikkei closed 0.6 percent lower.
 In the oil market, U.S. data showing a drop in distillate
inventories overshadowed worries over a pullback in gasoline
demand. U.S. crude <2CLc1> rose $1.73, or 1.74 percent, to
settle at $101.32 a barrel, while July Brent crude  was
up 2 percent at $114.88.
 ""The core fundamentals in crude are not deteriorating. They
are still pretty good,"" said Barry Knapp, head of U.S.
portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital in New York.
 Gold touched fresh three-week highs. Bullion priced in
euros struck a record high on concerns about the impact of a
possible debt default by Greece on other euro zone economies.
 Spot gold was last bid at $1,524.49 an ounce, down from
$1,525.75 in New York late on Tuesday. Earlier, it hit a
three-week high of $1,532.10.
 Appetite for stocks and commodities curbed the safe-haven
demand for U.S. and German government bonds.
 The 10-year Bund yield  was just above the
significant 3.0 percent level and could soon breach it given
the unresolved debt crisis.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield  was edged up to
3.13 percent. It was still within striking distance of its
200-day moving average of 3.09 percent, which if breached would
signal a further rally for U.S. bonds.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks rose
on Wednesday after recent sell-offs, while the euro slid to a
record low against the Swiss franc on uncertainty over the
Greek debt crisis.
 Oil rose above $100 a barrel after U.S. data showed a big
drop in inventories of diesel fuel, heating oil and other
distillates, igniting concerns about supply.
 In Europe, banking shares led gains, but the problems in
Greece and other debt-laden European countries cast a long
shadow over markets.
 ""The focus right now is on whether Greece will follow
through on agreed-upon austerity measures amidst widespread
local dissent,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 ""The growing consensus of an eventual technical default by
Greece is contributing to uncertainty, which is increasingly
undermining the euro,"" he added.
 Europe's policy options to avert a Greek debt default

reaction affecting other heavily indebted countries in the
17-nation currency bloc.
 In other developments, Finland approved a bailout for
debt-laden Portugal. The Finnish parliament, unlike others in
the region, has the right to vote on EU requests for bailout
funds. For more see: [ID:nHEL010189]
 Analysts still expect the euro to fall below key support
around $1.40 in the next few days, which would open the door to
further selling toward $1.35.
 Investors expect Athens, which is digging its way out of
massive debts, to have difficulty implementing more austerity
measures as the government's main opposition party opposes such
a move. [ID:nLDE74O0PW]
 ""We do not think Greece's debt will be restructured any
time soon,"" said Barry Knapp, head of U.S. portfolio strategy
at Barclays Capital in New York.
 The euro  last traded at $1.4075, down from Tuesday's
close of $1.4100. The euro zone single currency briefly posted
a 0.08 percent gain against the dollar. [FRX/]

 Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic staged a comeback on
the strength of U.S. energy and material shares and
bargain-hunting in European bank stocks.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 35.46

(Updates prices, adds comments, details)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro hit a record low
against the Swiss franc on Wednesday as investors fretted about
Greece's ability to repay its debts, and traders said it was
likely to fall further against the U.S. dollar this week.
 Investors fear Athens, which is digging its way out from
under massive debt, will struggle to implement more austerity
measures given stiff political opposition. [ID:nLDE74O0PW]
 That raises the prospect of Greece having to restructure
its outstanding debt and, traders said, should push the euro
below $1.40, an important support level, in the coming days.
 A breach of that level would grease the skids for a move to
$1.35, a level last seen in February, unless policymakers can
come up with a credible solution to Greece's problems.
 The euro was last down 0.1 percent at $1.4080 ,
paring earlier losses after a slide halted at $1.4011.
 ""For now, there is euro demand around $1.40, but it's just
a matter of time before it goes significantly lower,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting.
 ""What's happening in Europe is the beginning of a prolonged
sovereign debt crisis that will play out this summer,"" he
added. ""Polls suggest 80 percent of Greeks oppose more
austerity, so if the government forces the issue, it will
fall,"" which could increase the risk of a debt default.
 The euro had an even rougher day against the Swiss franc,
falling to a record low of 1.2270 francs , down
some 1 percent from late Tuesday.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent to 81.99 yen , while the
euro slipped 0.1 percent to 115.44 yen .
 Traders said worries about U.S. public finances and signs
of slower growth -- data on April durable goods orders was the
latest report to show the economy may be hitting a soft patch
-- limited the volume of dollar buying against the euro.

 EURO DOWNSIDE
 The single currency also pared losses after Finland
approved an EU/IMF bailout for Portugal, while demand from
hedge funds also prompted a squeeze in euro short positions.
 Offers from sovereign investors could start appearing
around $1.4100, which will limit euro upside. Further
resistance is seen around $1.4195, traders said.
 A move by clearing house LCH.Clearnet to raise the
additional margin required on Irish government bonds also
provided a modest euro boost, as analysts said it would require
more euro buying in the short-term. [ID:nLDE74O1Z8]
 However, Citigroup said in a note that its index on hedge
fund positioning showed these investors had unwound long bets
on the euro in the past few weeks but they were still in
""overextended territory,"" implying further euro losses.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Support lies around the psychologically important level of
$1.4000, which also marks the 200-week moving average. Analysts
said the euro could break that level later this week, when
interest to defend options around that region evaporates.
 Below that, the euro/dollar could find support near
$1.3985, the 100-day moving average, before sliding toward the
$1.3770 area, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
euro's rise from June 2010 to May 2011.
 Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup in
New York, said it is ""increasingly difficult"" to see how things
will hold together to resolve the sovereign borrowing issues.
 ""The euro at $1.40 is expensive given these pressures.
However, it more likely faces a grind lower rather than a cliff
jump,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. shares fell on Wednesday
on anxiety over slowing economic growth, while the euro
declined on nagging worries about the euro zone's spreading
debt crisis.
 U.S. oil prices fell on concerns that a slowing economy
will curb gasoline demand ahead of the U.S. driving season.
 Uneasy investors shifted cash into safehaven investments,
pushing gold to three-week highs and benchmark U.S. government
bond yields near their five-month lows.
 ""At the end of the day, we still have a long way to go
before this economy rebounds,"" said Sharon Stark, chief fixed
income strategist at Sterne Agee & Leach in Birmingham,
Alabama. ""Europe is a lingering problem. I don't think that
(debt) problem will go away anytime soon.""
 Europe's policy options to avert a Greek debt default
appear to be dwindling fast, fuelling fears of a chain reaction
affecting other heavily indebted countries in the 17-nation
currency bloc.
 Finland approved a bailout for debt-laden Portugal. The
Finnish parliament, unlike others in the region, has the right

the euro needs a far bigger catalyst to see it move towards

 The euro  last traded at $1.4045 after bouncing up
$1.4092 after the Finnish news. The single currency was still
0.2 percent lower on the day.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro suffered broadly on
Wednesday, plumbing a record low versus the Swiss franc as
Greece's struggle for political consensus to salvage its
finances underlined the possibility that the euro zone debt
crisis will knock the single currency lower.
 Finland's approval of an EU/IMF bailout for Portugal helped
the euro to pare some losses versus the dollar, but did little
to stop the euro from falling to 1.2298 francs, the weakest
since the single currency was launched in 1999.
 Demand from hedge funds also prompted a short squeeze in the
single currency versus the dollar, but analysts say the euro is
tainted by ongoing uncertainty surrounding the euro zone debt
crisis, and that a fall below $1.40 is imminent.
 Investors expect Athens, which is digging its way out of
massive debts, will have a hard time implementing more austerity
measures as the government's main opposition party opposes such
a move. [ID:nLDE74O0PW]
 A government spokesman said Greece has no immediate plans to
hold a referendum on austerity measures, quashing earlier
speculation of a possible vote. [ID:nATH006104]
 ""The differences between Greek political parties is
undoubtedly negative for the euro,"" said Adam Myers, currency
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, adding that the brief squeeze
up in the euro did little to change its downward trend.
 ""Everyone thinks the euro will go down, so it has become
more sensitive to bad news from the euro zone,"" he said, adding
that the euro will break below $1.40 later this week, when
interest to defend options around that region evaporates.
 The euro  traded 0.2 percent lower on the day at
$1.4074, pulling back from $1.4092 hit after the Finland news.
[ID:nLDE74O08X]
Traders had said demand from macro funds and other fund
managers had also pushed the euro up, adding that gains
accelerated after stop-loss orders were triggered above $1.4060.
 Though Finland's approval removed one uncertainty in the
euro zone debt crisis, analysts said underlying sentiment
towards the euro was bearish as differences between the European
Central Bank and region's politicians grew on whether Greek debt
should be restructured or not. [ID:nLDE74O02E]
 ""The Finland news is providing some relief to the euro, but
the euro needs a far bigger catalyst to see it move towards
$1.43,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman, EMEA head of currency
strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank.
 ""In the near term, the euro is very much skewed towards the
downside and looks very choppy.""
 Traders citied offers from sovereign investors above
$1.4100, which were also seen limit any upside in the euro.
 
 EUR/CHF SUFFERS
 The single currency  traded 0.6 percent lower at
1.2325 francs by 1124 GMT, trimming some losses, but analysts
see more gains in the Swiss franc, which is a popular investment
choice during times of uncertainty.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies
to 75.983 <.DXY>, not far from a high of 76.366 hit earlier this
week, its highest since April 1. It rose slightly versus the yen
to 82.04 yen .
 The Australian dollar  was down 0.6 percent at
$1.0494, having fallen as low as $1.0440 after news that GE
Capital  was selling its Australian mortgage book stoked
speculation that more investors could dump Australian assets.
 Market participants said sovereign-related demand from the
Mideast helped the Aussie to pare early losses.
 For the moment, the euro is drawing support against the
dollar at the bottom of a cloud on the daily Ichimoku chart, a
Japanese technical analysis tool popular among traders, and the
euro's 100-day moving average, both of which are nestled near
$1.3985.
 A fall below this could open the way for more losses
especially since stop-loss orders are said to be lurking below
$1.3968, a two-month low struck on EBS on Monday.
 Citi said in a note that its index on hedge fund positioning
showed these investors had unwound long bets on the euro in the
past few weeks but they were still in 'overextended territory',
implying further losses for the euro.

 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - European shares rebounded and the
euro pared losses on Wednesday after Finland approved a bailout
for debt-laden Portugal but nagging worries about the euro
zone's spreading debt crisis capped further advances.
 Oil prices bounced back above $112.00 a barrel as the euro
briefly reversed losses after the Finnish parliament approved
the 78 billion euro bailout from the European Union and the IMF,
with critics outnumbered by supporters of the deal.
 Finland's parliament, unlike others in the region, has the
right to vote on EU requests for bailout funds. [ID:nHEL010189]
 Though the move provided provided temporary relief for the
euro, investors were still nervy as Europe's policy options to

fears of a chain reaction affecting other heavily indebted

 ""The Finland news is providing some relief to the euro, but

 But Brent prices remained stuck below $113 a barrel on
concern about weak gasoline demand ahead of the U.S. driving

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Antoni Slodkowski
 TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday,
pressured by selling by hedge funds and stop-loss offers as
worries over Greece's finances cast a pall over the single
currency, bringing it closer to testing crucial support levels
on charts.
 Speculative selling of the euro intensified as rumours
swirled about Greece and investors trimmed risky positions,
with a drop in U.S. stock index futures   and oil
 adding to pressure on the euro.
 Traders cited rumours that Greece may call a snap election,
as well as a rumour that Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou
may resign, as factors that dragged the euro lower.
 On Tuesday, Papandreou had failed to get consensus from
opposition leaders on new austerity measures aimed at averting
a default by Greece. [ID:nLDE74N139]
 The euro seemed poised for a test of chart support
following its latest drop, with the bottom of the cloud on the
daily Ichimoku chart, a Japanese technical analysis tool
popular among traders, and the euro's 100-day moving average
both nestled near $1.3985.
 A clear breach of such levels may open the way for a
further drop in the euro, especially since stop-loss offers are
said to be lurking near $1.3968, a two-month low struck earlier
this week on trading platform EBS.
 ""The market consensus is that the euro will fall to $1.38
within the next 1-2 weeks or sooner,"" said a customer trader at
a Japanese bank.
 ""This fall may be accelerated after it hits stop losses
seen around 1.3969-70, near its recent lows. Once that level is
broken the euro can go all the way down to $1.38,"" the trader
said.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.4028 .
 A customer dealer for a major Japanese bank said there was
talk of active euro-selling by hedge funds, with stop-loss
selling adding to the euro's decline. Another trader cited euro
selling by proprietary traders.
 Traders said euro-buying by Asian investors such as Asian
central banks helped lend some support to the single currency.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The dollar rose broadly as investors cut back on risk
taking, with the Australian dollar falling 1 percent to $1.0452
.
 Traders said the Australian dollar took a hit from news
that GE Capital  was selling its Australian mortgage book
to Pepper Home Loans, marking its exit from the segment in the
country. [ID:nS9E7GB02M]
 Underscoring its broad gains, the dollar rose 0.4 percent
against a basket of currencies to 76.206 <.DXY>, near a high of
76.366 hit earlier this week, its highest since April 1.
 That brought the dollar index closer to resistance on the
daily Ichimoku chart at 76.573, the top of the cloud. A clear
breach of the cloud top would be bullish for the dollar.
 The dollar is also near the top of the daily Ichimoku cloud
against the yen, with resistance at 82.343 yen.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 81.80 yen
, not far from a one-month high of 82.232 yen hit last
week.
 The yen took in its stride data showing that Japan posted a
smaller than expected trade deficit in April. [ID:nL3E7GP05O]
 ""More than the numbers themselves, I think the more
important issue is how long this type of situation will
persist,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange
research for Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo, referring to
the disruptions to production caused by the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami.
 For dollar/yen to add to its recent gains, financial
markets would likely need to return to more of a risk-taking
mode, Fukaya said, adding that recent declines in U.S. Treasury
yields may for now temper gains in the dollar against the yen.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the
dollar on Wednesday, inching back towards a two-month low hit
earlier this week as worries over Greece's finances and
Europe's spreading debt crisis continued to cast a pall over
the single currency.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.4061 , gaining
momentum after triggering stop-loss offers near $1.4070, and
edging back in the direction of a two-month low of $1.3968
marked on trading platform EBS earlier this week.
 The single currency has support on charts near $1.4000,
right around the bottom of the cloud on the daily Ichimoku
chart and its 200-week average.
 The euro, which has slid roughly 6 percent from a peak just
above $1.4940 hit in early May, did get some respite the
previous day after a report showed German business sentiment
was firmer than expected in May.
 ""The sovereign debt problem is a political issue but is
ultimately also affected by economic conditions among the core
euro zone countries,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist for
SMBC Nikko Securities.
 ""As long as an economic recovery among the core countries
continues, it will be easier to gain political consensus for
any needed aid and back-up (for other euro zone countries),"" he
said.
 Over the next two or three weeks, the euro may trade in a
range of around $1.39 to $1.435, Noji said, adding that the
euro will likely find some support at the base line on weekly
Ichimoku charts that now lies near $1.39.
 On Ichimoku charts, a Japanese form of technical analysis
widely used among market players, the base line can act as
either support or resistance depending on its location.

 SINGAPORE, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro and oil slipped on
Wednesday as a rally the previous day fizzled on fears about
Europe's spreading debt crisis and the potential for a further
reduction of positions in risky assets.	
 Asian stocks also fell, tracking weakness on Wall Street as
firmer commodity prices were offset by lingering concerns over
the economic outlook for the United States as well as euro zone
debt woes.	
 The euro, which had rallied after better-than-expected
German business confidence data on Tuesday, edged back in the
direction of a two-month low of $1.3968 hit earlier this week as
worries over Greeces's finances cast a pall over the single
currency. It has lost roughly 6 percent since early May.

states and could push Portuguese and Irish debt into junk
territory, Moody's said on Tuesday, warning it would classify
most forms of restructuring as a default. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ] 
 As investors reduced exposure to riskier assets, MSCI's
index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
0.7 percent while the Nikkei closed down 0.6
percent .	
 According to research by TrimTabs, global equity ETF
investors are increasingly bearish on Asia and Asia equity ETFs
redeemed $499 million in the past week, the heaviest weekly
outflow in a year.	
 South Korea, Japan, China, and India ETFs posted the largest
outflows, while Indonesia ETFs managed to take in money.  Mutual
fund investors are also selling Asia. 	
 Oil slid as the dollar rebounded against the euro, giving up
some of its 2 percent rise overnight after Goldman Sachs raised
its price forecasts for Brent crude. Brent crude for July
delivery  fell below $112 a barrel.	
 Gold inched down after having rallied to its highest level
in three weeks in the previous session, but bullion priced in
euro struck a record on concerns about the impact of a possible
debt default by Greece on other euro zone economies. 
 Spot gold fell to $1,522.42 an ounce after rising as
high as $1,527.45 on Tuesday, its strongest since May 4.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Oil jumped about 2 percent on
Tuesday after Goldman Sachs forecast robust fuel demand growth,
while the euro pulled away from a two-month low against the
dollar on better-than-expected German data.
 Nagging euro zone debt fears kept market sentiment fragile,
however, curbing gains in the euro and driving gold prices to a
20-day high.
 Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential institutions in
the global oil spot market, raised its 12-month price forecast
for Brent crude to $130 a barrel, citing global economic growth
and tight OPEC spare capacity. For details, see
[ID:nL3E7GO153]
 ""Investors are realizing that, at the end of the day,
there's more demand for commodities than there is supply. That
means the long-term trend is higher,"" said Oliver Pursche,
president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New
York.
 U.S. crude oil  ended up 1.89 percent at $99.59 a
barrel, while Brent crude  rose 2 percent to $112.53 a
barrel.
 Energy-related shares gained with oil prices and provided a
small boost to global equities, driving the MSCI All-Country
World index <.MIWD00000PUS> 0.26 percent higher, a day after it
dropped 1.8 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed up 0.2 percent, though it remained 0.28 percent lower
for the year to date. Miners were among the biggest gainers.
 Energy shares also rose on Wall Street, but key U.S. stock
indexes fell with technology and industrial shares, as concerns
about the U.S. economic recovery still haunted investors.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 25.05
points, or 0.20 percent, at 12,356.21, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> dipped 1.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to
end at 1,316.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 12.74
points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,746.16.
 The U.S. stock market had closed at its lowest in a month
on Monday.
 A Reuters poll of top financial institutions found that
economists have cut back their expectations for U.S. economic
growth this year. For details, see [ID:nN2439520]
 The median of forecasts from economists at 18 of 20 primary
dealers was for an annualized gross domestic product growth of
2.85 percent this year, down from a median of 2.95 percent in a
similar poll on April 1.
 ""There isn't much for the market to get excited (about) at
this point, especially going into summer months and the QE
coming to an end soon,"" said Randy Frederick, director of
trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial
Research in Austin, Texas.
 Next month's end of the Federal Reserve's massive
bond-buying program, also known as quantitative easing, or QE2,
is expected to weigh on stocks and the euro, a Reuters poll
showed last week. [ID:nSLAJGE7U1]
 EURO RECOVERS
 The euro  rose as high as $1.4133, a day after
touching a two-month low against the dollar, as data showed
German business morale held steady in May. Most economists
polled by Reuters had expected a decline in the index of
consumer confidence from the Munich-based Ifo think-tank.
 The euro's gains were said to be contained by concerns
about the impact of a possible debt default by Greece in other
peripheral euro-zone economies.
 Monday's sell-off of the euro followed another credit
downgrade of Greece, a ratings warning about Italy and a
Spanish voter revolt against austerity measures designed to
address the country's debt. [ID:nLDE74M0V7]
 Underscoring those risks, Moody's Investors Service said on
Tuesday a debt default by Greece could knock the ratings of
Portugal and Ireland into junk territory. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]
 ""A Greek default would be highly destabilizing and would
have implications for the creditworthiness of issuers across
Europe,"" Moody's EMEA chief credit officer Alastair Wilson told
Reuters.
 Gold prices  rose on concerns about the euro-zone
debt crisis spreading, hitting a high of $1,527.45 an ounce,
its highest since May 4. It was later bid at $1,525.49 an
ounce, or 0.6 percent higher on the day.
 Silver , considered an cheaper safe-haven option,
jumped 4.4 percent to $36.59 an ounce.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early losses after an
auction of $35 billion of two-year notes found solid demand.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 2/32 in price, with
their yield at 3.1194 percent.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro pulled away from a
two-month low against the dollar on Tuesday after
better-than-expected German data, but traders said fears about
Greece's finances and Europe's spreading debt crisis continue
to cast a long shadow of doubt.
 One day after hitting a two-month low of $1.3968, the euro
rose as high as $1.4133  after a report showed German
business sentiment was firmer than expected in May. It was last
trading at $1.4102. For details, see [ID:nLDE74N0T6]
 The euro, however, is down 5 percent against the dollar
since early May, and traders said the chance that Greece may
restructure its debt would keep it under pressure. Markets were
also fretting about the finances of Spain and Italy.
 ""Concern about Spain and Italy might be overblown, but the
Greece issue is not going away, and if Greece restructures,
that may open the door for Ireland and Portugal."" said Brian
Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com. ""So I look at this as a
short-term euro recovery.""
 A Greek debt default would hurt other peripheral euro zone
states and could push Portugal and Ireland into junk territory,
Moody's said on Tuesday, warning it would classify most forms
of restructuring as a default. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]
 The euro pared gains after the leader of Greece's
conservative political opposition rejected the government's new
package of fiscal measures to slash deficits. [ID:nATH006097]
 Greece will not be able to honor its obligations without
the next tranche of a bailout loan, and the International
Monetary Fund has made clear it cannot disburse money if
Greece's 2012 EU funding is not assured, Greece's finance
minister said. [ID:nLDE74M21J]
 Greece faces a 13.4 billion euro ($18.85 billion) funding
crunch next month.
 Any Greek debt restructuring plan would open the door to
euro selling toward $1.30, analysts said, by hitting European
banks and private investors and raising questions about the
euro zone's overall credit-worthiness. [ID:nLDE74N0U1]
 Traders reported stop-loss orders from $1.4125, with more
around Monday's high of $1.4146. Support is seen around the
100-day moving average at around $1.3975. The euro has traded
above its 100-day average since February.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 81.85 yen
. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against
a basket of currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 75.933 <.DXY>,
near a seven-week high set on Monday.
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.8 percent to $0.7977 
after a quarterly survey showed inflation expectations rose in
the second quarter. [ID:nL3E7GO06Y]
 CONTAGION RISK
 Fears of euro-zone debt contagion mounted after ratings
agencies downwardly revised outlooks for Italy and Belgium,
while Spain's Socialist Party lost in regional elections,
raising doubts about Madrid's commitment to fiscal austerity.
 Spain's ""proposed budget cuts had kept the region's
fourth-largest economy off the debt crisis radar until now,""
said James Percival, market strategist at Western Union
Business Solutions in Victoria, British Columbia.
 ""Traders now fear this is a sign of things to come, as a
national-level electoral turnaround that undoes the austerity
measures in Spain, or an outright rating cut in Italy,
threatens to bring about a crisis in a country too big to be
rescued.""
 Spain has come under intense market scrutiny in recent
days, though it sold 2.3 billion euros of short-term debt
easily on Tuesday with borrowing costs largely unmoved from the
last auction.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Oil jumped more than 2 percent
on Tuesday, driving world stocks up, after Goldman Sachs
forecast strong fuel demand growth and Germany's business
sentiment in came above expectations, easing concerns about the
pace of the global economic recovery.
 The euro also rebounded on the German data, although
sentiment remained fragile due to fears of an imminent debt
default by Greece.
 Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential institutions in
the global oil spot market, raised its 12-month price forecast
for Brent crude to $130 a barrel from $107 and increased its
end-2012 forecast to $140 a barrel from $120, citing global
economic growth and tight OPEC spare capacity. For details, see
[ID:nL3E7GO153].
 U.S. crude  and Brent futures  jumped more
than 2 percent on the news. They were both trading higher some
1.8 percent later, at $99.55 and $112.13 per barrel,
respectively.
 Energy shares rose with the higher oil prices and provided
a small boost to world stocks, driving the MSCI All-Country
World index <.MIWD00000PUS> 0.4 percent higher, a day after
dropping 1.8 percent.
 On Wall Street, stocks struggled to clawed out gains,
despite losses in technology and industrial shares.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 5.23 points,
or 0.04 percent, at 12,386.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 2.55 points, or 0.19 percent, at 1,319.92. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 0.80 point, or 0.03
percent, at 2,758.10.
 The market closed at its lowest in a month on Monday.
 ""The move today is as much of a reaction to yesterday as
anything else,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment
Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It's especially helpful
to have energy higher today, since that was one of the worst
performing sectors yesterday.""
 European shares -- still in the red for the year -- edged
higher, with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares
up 0.19 percent.
 EURO RECOVERS
 The euro recovered after hitting a two-month low against
the dollar on Monday, up 0.4 percent at $1.4103 , but
gains were contained by lingering concerns about the euro zone
debt crisis.
 Data showing German business sentiment stabilizing
unexpectedly in May helped push the euro briefly back above
$1.4100; it had hit a low on Monday of $1.3968.
 The European single currency had sold off on Monday
following another credit downgrade of Greece, a ratings warning
about Italy and a Spanish voter revolt against austerity
measures designed to address the country's debt.
[ID:nLDE74M0V7]
 The risks faced in Europe were underlined again on Tuesday
as Moody's Investors Service said that a Greek debt default
would put Portugal and Ireland at risk of multi-notch credit
downgrades. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]
 ""A Greek default would be highly destabilizing and would
have implications for the credit-worthiness of issuers across
Europe,"" Moody's EMEA chief credit officer Alastair Wilson told
Reuters.
 German government bonds fell as investors cashed in on
Monday's rally of core euro zone debt and digested the German
business sentiment data that suggested Europe's top economy
might retain its strong growth momentum longer than thought.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices declined ahead of an auction of
new notes and as firmer stocks drew demand away from safe-haven
assets. Benchmark 10-year notes were down 3/32 in price,
driving their yield up to 3.1396 percent.

 By Al Yoon and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Financial markets
steadied on Tuesday after being battered a day earlier by euro
zone debt concerns, as corporate reports and rising commodity
prices suggested global growth was on track.
 Analysts said the longer-term outlook for equities was
positive, with global growth weathering the euro-zone crisis.
 ""The global economy is still doing well. Companies are very
healthy and have a lot of cash in their balance sheets. As long
as they continue to deliver profits, that's going to be helpful
for the market,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP
Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.
 Gijsels recommended investors should pare back holdings
somewhat, and raise cash, however.
 Wall Street opened higher after its main indexes lost more
than 1 percent on Monday.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed 25.81
points, or 0.21 percent, to 12,407.07. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> increased 3.94 points, or 0.30 percent, to
1,321.31 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 4.52
points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,763.42.
 European shares -- still in the red for the year -- edged
higher and the euro sat above two-month lows versus the dollar,
both boosted somewhat by better than expected German business
sentiment. The FTEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.4 percent.
 U.S. crude and Brent futures rose nearly 2 percent after
Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for oil, citing strong fuel
demand growth. U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.58 to
$99.28 per barrel. For more details, see [nL3E7GO0EV]
 Copper also rallied, gaining 1.4 percent after Goldman
forecast an increase in Chinese purchases in the coming months.
Gold prices rose 0.4 percent while the U.S. dollar index <.DXY>
fell 0.2 percent.
 ""Investors are realizing that at the end of the day,

 U.S.-listed shares of Sony Corp <6758.T>  rose more
than 4 percent to $27.67 after the electronics maker said this
year's operating profit would match last year's, easing worries
about the impact of the March earthquake. Those concerns have
contributed to recent weakness in the stock. [nL3E7GO018]
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.5
percent, but only after hitting two-month lows during Monday's
sell-off on concern that a Greek debt default could drag a new
range of countries -- including Group of Eight member Italy --
into similar troubles.
 Monday's selloff was triggered by another credit downgrade
of Greece, a ratings outlook warning about Italy and a Spanish
voter revolt against austerity. [ID:nLDE74M0V7]
 Debt rating company Moody's Investors Service underlined
the issue again on Tuesday, saying that a Greek debt default
would put Portugal and Ireland at risk of multi-notch credit
downgrades. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]
 ""A Greek default would be highly destabilising and would
have implications for the creditworthiness of issuers across
Europe,"" Moody's EMEA chief credit officer Alastair Wilson told
Reuters.
 Euro zone governments and central bankers are at
loggerheads over what is needed to stave off default or
restructuring in Greece, primarily over the unwelcome precedent
it would set for the currency bloc and its other highly
indebted countries.
 The euro hovered above its two-month low against the
dollar, with its rise capped by the contagion worries. It was
up 0.3 percent on the day at $1.4097 . Against the
Japanese yen, the dollar  rose 0.20 percent to 82.09
 ""The amount of euro selling in the past few days has been
huge. So I suspect a lot of euro long positions have been
cleared. Some may probably be caught in short positions,"" said
a trader at a U.S. bank.
 German government bonds fell as investors cashed in on the
previous day's rally of core euro zone debt and digested Ifo
business sentiment data suggesting Europe's top economy might
retain its strong growth momentum longer than thought.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices also declined ahead of an auction
of new notes and as firmer stocks drew demand away from
safe-haven assets. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose 0.02
percentage point to 3.15 percent.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Upbeat data from Germany helped
the euro recover from a two-month low against the dollar on
Tuesday, but it remained fragile due to fears that the euro
zone's debt crisis could spread.
 Data from the Ifo think-tank showed German business
sentiment stabilising unexpectedly in May, pushing the euro
briefly back above $1.4100 , away from Monday's two-month
low of $1.3968. [ID:nLDE74N0ND]
 It dropped again, however, after the leader of Greece's
conservative political opposition rejected the government's new
package of fiscal measures to slash deficits. [ID:nATH006097]
 The government has a comfortable majority in parliament and
analysts said the euro's reaction demonstrated how jittery
markets are. Although holding above $1.4000, they said the euro
was vulnerable to a break lower, especially if the debt crisis
looks likely to spread to heavyweights like Spain and Italy.
 Many analysts say the euro could fall to as low as $1.30 in
the event of a Greek restructuring. [ID:nLDE74N0U1]
 ""Barring any negative comments out of Spain or Italy I would
expect the euro to stay above $1.4000. But although it remains
supported above that level the rallies are getting thinner,""
said Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at FOREX.com.
 She added she expected the euro to stay below Monday's high
around $1.4145.
 The euro last traded up 0.2 percent on the day at $1.4077,
off a session high of $1.4117 when it ran into persistent
selling from Middle-East accounts. Traders reported stop loss
orders just ahead of the day's high up to $1.4125, with more
around Monday's high.
 Technical analysts said the euro's 100-day moving average
was still key support, coming in around $1.3974 on Tuesday. The
euro has traded above its 100-day average since February. The
closely watched Japanese Ichimoku cloud base also comes in
around the same area.
 ""We have seen some buying of dips around the lows yesterday
and today, but the euro is not yet a buy,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 Equity and commodity markets paused for breath following a
recent bout of risk reduction which had helped push the dollar
to a seven-week high on Monday against a basket of currencies of
76.366 <.DXY>. It was last down 0.1 percent at 76.032.

 GREEK WORRY
 A Greek debt default would hurt other peripheral euro zone
states, ratings agency Moody's said in a statement on Tuesday,
becoming the last of the three major rating agencies to say most
forms of restructuring would constitute default. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]
 Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to ""negative""
from ""stable"" on Saturday, while a crushing defeat for Spain's
ruling socialists in local elections raised worries about Prime
Minister Jose Luiz Rodrigo Zapatero's ability to meet fiscal
targets. Madrid has been seen as an example of fiscal reform.
 ""We could have a period of consolidation in the near-term
for the euro, but it's not likely to last,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 ""Underlying pressures are still to the downside. The
sovereign debt crisis is still unresolved and the risks are that
it escalates later in year,"" he added.
 The New Zealand dollar gained more than 1 percent on the day
to $0.7996  after a quarterly survey on behalf of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) showed inflation expectations
in the country rose in the second quarter. [ID:nL3E7GO06Y]
 The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent to $1.0542
, off a one-month low of $1.0478 hit on Monday.
 The dollar slipped 0.15 percent to 81.80 yen , though
some traders said the dollar's recent strength could help the
pair test a March 19 high of 82.23 yen.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Financial markets steadied on
Tuesday after being battered a day earlier by euro zone debt
concerns, but were forced to take in new warnings that the
crisis may be heading for a still more dangerous phase.
 European shares -- still in the red for the year -- edged
higher and the euro sat above two-month lows versus the dollar,
both boosted somewhat by better than expected German business
sentiment.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher after its main indexes
lost more than 1 percent on Monday.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.3
percent, but only after hitting two-month lows during Monday's
sell-off, wiping out a good portion of their spring rally.
 The main driver behind Monday's shake-out was concern that a
Greek debt default could drag a new range of countries --
including Group of Eight member Italy -- into trouble.
 It was triggered by another credit downgrade of Greece, a
ratings outlook warning about Italy and a Spanish voter revolt
against austerity. [ID:nLDE74M0V7]
 Rating agency Moody's underlined the issue again on Tuesday,
saying that a Greek debt default would put Portugal and Ireland
at risk of multi-notch credit downgrades. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]
 ""A Greek default would be highly destabilising and would
have implications for the creditworthiness of issuers across
Europe,"" Moody's EMEA chief credit officer Alastair Wilson told
Reuters.
 ""This would result in more highly polarised creditworthiness
and ratings among euro zone sovereigns.""
 Euro zone governments and central bankers are at loggerheads
over what is needed to stave off default or restructuring in
Greece, primarily over the unwelcome precedent it would set for
the currency bloc and its other highly indebted countries.
""The huge storm of risk reduction will rip through markets
if the focus turns to Spain and Italy. It's clear they don't
have money to bail out these countries,"" said Ayako Sera, a
market economist at Sumitomo Trust and Banking.
 ""What we are seeing now could just be the beginning of it.""
 
 EYE OF STORM?
 As is often the case after a heavy market day, investors
took something of a breather on Tuesday, but without any sign
that the underlying issue has been dealt with.
 The euro hovered above its two-month low against the dollar,
with its rise capped by the contagion worries. It was up 0.3
percent on the day at $1.4089 .
 ""The amount of euro selling in the past few days has been
huge. So I suspect a lot of euro long positions have been
cleared. Some may probably be caught in short positions,"" said a
trader at a U.S. bank.
 European shares drifted higher, with the FTEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> up 0.3 percent. The index fell 1.7 percent on Monday.
 Analysts said longer-term outlook was positive, but
short-term events could make equities volatile.
 ""The global economy is still doing well. Companies are very
healthy and have a lot of cash in their balance sheets. As long
as they continue to deliver profits, that's going to be helpful
for the market,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP
Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.
 ""But I would caution people to be careful and take some
money off the table and make sure they have some cash in hand.""
 German bonds were lower as investors cashed in on the
previous day's rally of core euro zone debt and digested Ifo
business sentiment data suggesting Europe's top economy might
retain its strong growth momentum longer than thought.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default rose again.
It costs 1.435 million euros ($2 million) to protect 10 million
euros of exposure to Greek bonds.
 Other peripheral credit default swaps were little changed.

 SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on
Tuesday and stocks in Asia steadied but the euro remained on the
defensive on worries that the euro zone's debt crisis was
deepening and could spread to heavyweights such as Spain.	
 Volatile commodity prices also kept investors on edge, with
gold firming to a near two-week high as buyers looked to
safe-haven assets.	
 Moody's Investors Service said other stressed European
sovereign debt would be affected in case of a Greek default, and
separately reported it was reviewing the rating of some UK banks
for a possible credit rating downgrade. [ID:nATH006094]
[ID:nWNA9309]	
 Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to ""negative""
from ""stable"" on Saturday, while a crushing defeat for Spain's
ruling socialists in local elections raised worries about the
government's ability to curtail debt.	
 Madrid, which will auction more short-term debt later on
Tuesday, has been seen as an example of fiscal reform.	
 ""The huge storm of risk reduction will rip through markets
if the focus turns to Spain and Italy. It's clear they don't
have money to bail out these countries,"" said Ayako Sera, a
market economist at Sumitomo Trust and Banking. 
""What we are seeing now could just be the beginning of it,""
she added.	
 The dollar hit an eight-week high against the pound and
edged closer to a 10-week high versus the euro on euro zone's
debt crisis worries.	
 The euro was last at $1.4042 and the index of the
dollar against six major currencies was up 0.1 percent at
76.178 points. On Monday, when the local market closed the euro
had been at $1.4017.	
 But euro buying from Asian central banks as well as stable
commodity and regional share prices helped stem the euro's
decline in Asian trade, with some traders saying that in the
near-term there might be a small rebound for the single
currency. 
The euro fell to a two-month low of $1.3968 on Monday, where
it had support from its 100-day moving average. 
 The euro has been suffering from a lack of
consensus among European policy-makers on how to deal with
Greece, with many opposing the idea of debt restructuring while
some market players think it is inevitable. 
""The euro may not stop falling until European policy-makers
come up with a more reassuring stance on debt problems. Before
that happens, the euro could fall to around $1.35,"" Sumitomo
Trust's Sera said.

 
 Despite the euro zone debt woes, Asian stocks were mostly
steady with MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks
outside Japan up 0.1 percent and Japan's benchmark Nikkei
closing up 0.2 percent after earlier hitting a
fresh five-week low. 
 Seoul shares rebounded 0.3 percent after sharp falls in the
previous session,d helped by techs and refiners, but trade was
cautious amid worries about Europe and a weakening global
economic backdrop.	
 ""It appears that a lot of selling is coming from European
funds, as worries about the region's debt issues deepens,"" said
Kim Seong-hong, a market analyst at Samsung Securities. 
 ""Although the market is bouncing, momentum is pretty
fragile. Direction can change anytime,"" Kim added. 
 Gold rose to its highest level in almost two weeks on
worries that Europe's debt crisis was spreading, sending
euro-denominated bullion to a record above 1,081 euros an ounce.	
 Spot gold was last at $1,517.81 an ounce,
having hit an intraday high at $1,517.74 an ounce, its strongest
since May 11. 
 Brent crude futures rebounded from the previous day's sharp
fall as expectations that strong oil demand was trimming
inventories overrode concerns about Europe's debt crisis. 
Brent crude for July  was up 59 cents at $110.69 a
barrel by 0309 GMT. U.S. crude  for July gained 60 cents
to $98.28 a barrel. Both benchmarks had fallen by over $2 on
Monday to end below their 100-day moving averages.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro hovered above a
two-month low against the dollar on Tuesday but is seen capped
by worries that the euro zone's debt crisis could spread to
heavyweights like Spain that had been considered safe from
contagion.
 Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to ""negative""
from ""stable"" on Saturday, while a crushing defeat for Spain's
ruling socialists in local elections raised worries about Prime
Minister Jose Luiz Rodrigo Zapatero's ability to meet fiscal
targets. Madrid has been seen as an example of fiscal reform.
 ""The huge storm of risk reduction will rip through markets
if the focus turns to Spain and Italy. It's clear they don't
have money to bail out these countries,"" said Ayako Sera, a
market economist at Sumitomo Trust and Banking.
 ""What we are seeing now could just be the beginning of it,""
she added.
 But euro buying from Asian central banks as well as stable
commodity and regional share prices helped stem the euro's
decline in Asian trade, with some traders saying that in the
near-term there might be a small rebound for the single
currency.
 The euro ticked up 0.15 percent in Asia to $1.4070 
after falling to a two-month low of $1.3968 on Monday, where it
had support from its 100-day moving average.
 ""The amount of euro selling in the past few days has been
huge. So I suspect a lot of euro long positions have been
cleared. Some may probably be caught in short positions,"" said
a trader at a U.S. bank.
 ""I expect the euro to rebound in the near term, though I
still think it's in a downtrend in the longer run,"" he said.
 Some market players think worries about Spain and Italy may
be overblown. The premium investors are demanding for holding
Spanish and Italian bonds over German debt is still way below
peaks hit late last year even though their credit spreads
widened in the past week.
 Still, the euro has also been suffering from a lack of
consensus among European policymakers on how to deal with
Greece, as many oppose the idea of debt restructuring while
some market players think it is inevitable.
 ""The euro may not stop falling until European policymakers
come up with a more reassuring stance on debt problems. Before
that happens, the euro could fall to around $1.35,"" Sumitomo
Trust's Sera said.
 Its immediate resistance is seen at around $1.4070-80 and
$1.4150.
 The euro is also vulnerable to fear that investor
disenchantment with riskier assets in the past month could
continue as the U.S. Federal Reserve winds up quantitative
easing, effectively ending its aggressive money-printing, in
June.

 As worries about the euro zone's debt problems spread,
other European currencies also came under pressure. The pound
slipped to an eight-week low of $1.6055  before erasing
gains.
 The dollar also gained 0.3 percent against the safe-haven
Swiss franc to 0.8860 franc , having scaled a one-week
peak of 0.8895 franc at one point.
 SWISSIE HURT
 The Swiss currency was hurt by comments from Swiss National
Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan that he is ""very worried""
about the rise in the franc and that the bank will take action
if deflationary pressure emerges as a result of a higher
franc.[ID:nN23195284]
 The New Zealand dollar gained after a quarterly survey on
behalf of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) showed
inflation expectations in New Zealand rose in the second
quarter.
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.7 percent to $0.7960
, and the Australian dollar also gained 0.3 percent to
$1.0540 , after having hit a one-month low around
$1.0480.
 The dollar slipped a tad against the yen to 81.82 yen
, though some traders said the dollar's broad rally could
help the pair to test a March 19 high of 82.23 yen.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - A wave of fear that Europe's
debt problems are spreading out of control unnerved markets on
Monday, knocking the euro to its lowest level in two months
against the dollar and dragged down equities in Europe and the
United States.
 Ratings actions on Greece and Italy and regional election
results in Spain that raised doubts about measures to curb the
country's deficit spurred investors to unload riskier assets.
 Following a three-notch cut of Greek debt by Fitch Ratings
on Friday, which pushed the country's rating deeper into junk
status, rival Standard & Poor's revised its outlook for Italy
to ""negative"" from ""stable"" on Saturday. For details, see
[ID:nLDE74M0V7]
 ""We have a confluence of negative events that have taken
place over the weekend. All of that is compounding to create
this toxic mix for the euro."" said Mark McCormick, currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Investors reversed bullish bets and sought safer havens,
shifting funds into U.S. government debt, gold and the dollar.
 Commodities suffered another rout as the dollar
strengthened, with oil prices slumping 2.4 percent and copper,
grains, sugar and cocoa also falling.
 U.S. stocks closed at their lowest levels in a month. The
Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 130.78 points, or 1.05
percent, to 12,381.26. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was down 15.90 points, or 1.19 percent, to 1,317.37 and the
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slumped 44.42 points, or 1.58
percent, to 2,758.90.
 ""Unlike before, I don't see the market brushing off the
European issues this time because there are heightened concerns
about the global industrial slowdown,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.
 Increasing doubts that equity markets can weather recent
weakness in global manufacturing and demand added to the
weakness after Germany and China reported disappointing
manufacturing figures.
 Industrial, energy and technology stocks, closely related
to growth, were among the day's top decliners.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index hit a five-week
closing low and turned negative for the year, losing 1.7
percent to end at 1,116.52 points. Emerging market equities
<.MSCIEF> slumped 2.3 percent and leading world stocks
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.8 percent, the biggest daily decline in
more than two months.
 The euro fell to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss
franc . Against the dollar it fell as low as $1.3968
, its weakest showing since mid-March, after breaking
below $1.40, a key psychological level and roughly its 200-week
moving average. The euro was last down 0.7 percent against the
dollar  at $1.4048.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  rose 0.38
percent to 82 yen.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose nearly 1 percent, which dented
commodity prices and shares of commodity-sensitive shares.
Alcoa Inc  lost 1.8 percent to $15.98. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold  fell 2 percent to $47.42.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell $2.40, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $97.70 per barrel, and gold  rose
$4.69 to $1,516.20 an ounce.
 A stronger dollar often pressures dollar-denominated oil
prices by raising the price for consumers using other
currencies and pulling investment from commodities.
 Chevron Corp  dipped 1.2 percent to $101.37, while
the PHLX oil service sector index <.OSX> shed 2.2 percent.
 Europe's crisis appeared to deepen as the ruling Spanish
Socialists were hit by stinging losses in local elections and
now face walking a tightrope between voter anger over sky-high
unemployment and investor demands for strict austerity
measures.
 Investors are increasingly concerned that voter rebellions
against austerity plans could cause bailouts and budgetary pact
agreements to unravel, leaving large swathes of debt in
jeopardy of default.
 Speculation also mounted over a possible restructuring of
Greek debt, pressuring the euro.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou discussed new
emergency measures to cut Greece's deficit in a bid to convince
leaders the country can avoid a restructuring.
 The premiums charged by investors to hold Italian and
Spanish 10-year bonds rather than safe-haven German bunds rose
to their highest levels since January, at 186 and 261 basis
points respectively. [ID:nLDE74M094]
 Government bonds outside the euro-zone periphery rallied as
investors sought higher-quality and easily traded assets.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields edged lower
by 0.02 percentage point to 3.13 percent, after earlier
touching a five-month low of 3.09 percent.
 ""The key point is that the crisis seems to be taking hold
even of peripheral countries regarded as solid,"" said WestLB
rate strategist Michael Leister. ""Sentiment is that there
appears to be no end to it now Italy is being scrutinized by
the ratings agencies.""
 Also on Monday, Fitch became the second rating company to
threaten Belgium with a credit downgrade, saying its lack of a
fully fledged government undermined budget efforts in one of
the euro zone's most indebted states. Belgium, however, sold
3.4 billion euros of bonds with relative ease on Monday, and
Fitch said it still had many characteristics of a stronger
""core"" euro zone member. [ID:nN23218201]

 NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - A wave of fear that Europe's

to 2,768.59.
 ""There are some signs that suggest the market is oversold

1,280 levels,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM

<.MIWD00000PUS> were down 1.6 percent.
 Worries about the path of the global economy also weighed
after data showed marginally slower growth in the euro zone and
in China for the second quarter.
 The euro fell to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss
franc . Against the dollar it fell as low as $1.3968

 NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Fear Europe's debt crisis was
spreading sent the euro to a two-month trough against the
dollar and a record low against the Swiss franc on Monday, and
traders said the currency's decline may not be over yet.
 Markets worried about Spain's commitment to fiscal
austerity after the ruling Socialist Party lost in regional
elections. Italy suffered a credit outlook downgrade. For
details, see [ID:nLDE74L02S] and [ID:nLDE74L0K5]
 That added to worries about Greece. Even with its
government pledging to speed up privatization of state firms,
investors worry it may yet have to restructure debt.
[ID:nLDE74M0F4]
 Traders responded by pushing the euro through important
support at $1.40, and analyst said selling should continue this
week, provided U.S. economic does not disappoint investors.
 ""We have a confluence of negative events....All of that is
compounding to create this toxic mix for the euro."" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3968 , its weakest
showing since mid-March, after breaking below $1.40, a key
psychological level and roughly its 200-week moving average.
 It bounced back to $1.4030, partly helped by bids from
Asian central banks, but remained down 0.9 percent on the day.
 The euro fell to 1.2323 Swiss francs , its lowest
since the euro zone single currency was launched in 1999.
Selling accelerated after stop-loss orders were triggered below
1.24, while an option barrier was taken out at 1.2350.
 It was also down 0.8 percent at 114.81 yen . The
dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 81.79 yen .
 Euro selling pressure grew after spreads on benchmark
Spanish, Italian and Greek government bonds widened against
German benchmarks as investors dumped the bonds of weaker euro
zone countries in favor of safer German debt. [GVD/EUR]

 OPTIONS SIGNAL DOWNSIDE
 Weaker economic data added to the euro's woes as German and
euro zone purchasing managers' indexes for May fell more than
expected. [ID:nSLAKGE7U5] and [ID:nSLAKGE7U4]
 The options market suggested the risks for the euro were
more towards the downside. Euro/dollar one-month implied
volatility  jumped to 13.1 percent from 11.70 percent
Friday, suggesting trading may get more erratic if euro selling
continues.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals  rose to
1.8 from 1.45 in favor of euro puts. The rising premium to
protect against more euro losses suggests more selling ahead.
 Brad Bechtel, managing director of Faros Trading, said the
euro/dollar is likely trading at the bottom of a new range and
the consolidation could continue in coming weeks with ""plenty
of nasty head fakes"" in both directions.
 ""Keep your seatbelt fastened for now and expect short-term
choppiness on any new risk positions,"" he said.
 The dollar was a big beneficiary of euro weakness, hitting
a seven-week high of 76.366 <.DXY> against a currency basket.
 But dollar gains could be brief if concerns about the U.S.
fiscal deficit and patchy economic data resurface. U.S. durable
goods, housing and GDP data are due this week.
 ""It's possible that people will be reminded that the Fed is
going to remain on hold and the European Central Bank is
probably going to hike in July. Maybe we can form a base around
$1.39 and push the euro back up,"" said BBH's McCormick.

 NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - A wave of fear that Europe's
debt problems are spreading out of control hammered markets on
Monday, knocking the euro to its lowest level in two months
against the dollar and pummeling equities in Europe and the
United States.
 Ratings actions on Greece and Italy and regional election

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month low
versus the dollar and a record trough against the Swiss franc on
Monday, as investors unwound bullish bets on mounting worries
about the region's debt with many expecting more losses.
 The euro  fell to as low $1.3968 on trading platform
EBS, its weakest since mid-March, on doubts about Spanish
austerity measures after Madrid's ruling Socialist party was
defeated in regional elections, while Italy suffered a credit
outlook downgrade and speculation mounted over some sort of
Greek debt restructuring.
 The single currency was last down 1 percent at $1.4010,
having broken support at $1.40, a key psychological level which
was also its 200-week moving average. 
 Its rout was stopped by bids from Asian central banks at
around $1.3965, the 100-day moving average which offered another
support level. Traders cited stop-losses building below that
level while pricing in the options market suggested the risks
for the euro were more towards the downside.
 ""The euro breaking past the big $1.40 level saw stops being
triggered which added to its losses,"" said Ankita Dudani, G10
currency strategist at RBS Global Banking. ""The developments in
Spain have now come to the radar in addition to the problems
already facing Greece. Also, the PMI numbers have been soft.""
 Weaker economic data added to the euro's woes as German and
euro zone purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) for May fell more
than expected. [ID:nSLAKGE7U5] [ID:nSLAKGE7U4]
 While the latest batch of bad news did little to change the
fundamental outlook for the euro zone, analysts said it had
offered a chance for speculators to wind back their short
positions in the dollar, which remain high. [IMM/FX]
""(Today's euro selling) is a short-term reallocation into
the dollar. People are moving assets to the U.S. because they
think growth there may outperform the euro zone,"" said Geoffrey
Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 ""Speculative positions are bailing out, while real money is
still in (the euro).""
 
 SWISS FRANC RALLIES
 The euro  fell to 1.2323 Swiss francs, its lowest
since the single currency was launched in 1999. Selling
accelerated during the Asian session after stop-loss orders were
triggered below 1.24, while an option barrier was taken out at
1.2350.
 The euro's move led to a jump in one-month implied
volatility  to around 13.1 percent, much higher than
11.45 percent on Friday and suggesting that trading may get even
more erratic if euro selling continues in the near term.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals  shot up
to 1.8 from 1.5 in favour of euro puts. The rising premium
required to protect against more euro selling suggests that the
euro could fall even more.
 Societe Generale said in a note that the one-month to
three-month volatility slope for euro/dollar was flat, with the
one-month vols rising at a much faster pace. They added there
was increased demand for downside strikes in euro/dollar
options.
The dollar was a big beneficiary of euro losses, rising to a
seven-week high of 76.366 <.DXY> versus a currency basket.

 Euro selling pressure grew after spreads on benchmark
Spanish, Italian and Greek government bonds widened against

 Investors ditched Spanish assets on concerns that the ruling
party's regional election defeat could make it harder for Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to impose more austerity
measures, if needed, to cut the budget deficit. [ID:nLDE74L02S]
 At the same time, ratings agency Standard & Poor's move at
the weekend to slap a negative outlook on Italy's sovereign
rating highlighted concerns about weakness in the euro zone's
third-largest economy. [ID:nLDE74L0K5]
 Analysts say that although the outlook for the euro appeared
grim as a host of negative factors compounded concerns that
Greece may require some form of restructuring on its massive
debts, the dollar's gains could be shortlived given concerns
about the U.S. fiscal deficit and patchy economic data.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Doubts about Europe's ability to
manage its debt hammered markets on Monday, knocking the single
currency, driving up bond yields and dragging down equities in
Europe and elsewhere.
 Wall Street looked set to join in the flight from risk. U.S.
stock index futures pointed to losses at the open.
 Economic data in Europe and China pointed to marginally
slower growth in the second quarter. [ID;nLDE74M0H9]
 But investors were mainly digesting a block of bad news
about the euro zone crisis, a political and fiscal struggle to
bring the huge debt in peripheral economies to heel.
Following a three-notch cut of Greek debt by Fitch Ratings
on Friday, which pushed the country deeper into junk status,
rival Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to ""negative""
from ""stable"" on Saturday. [nLDE74J1K7]
 Markets have generally separated Italy from other parts of
the euro zone periphery during the crisis, which has led to
bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
 Spanish voters, meanwhile, added to the angst, becoming the
latest electorate to punish sitting European governments for the
current economic climate. [ID:nLDE74L02S]
 Investors are increasingly concerned that voter rebellions
against austerity plans could cause bailouts and budgetary pact
agreements to unravel, leaving large swathes of debt in
jeopardy.
 The ruling Spanish Socialists were hit by stinging losses in
local elections and now face walking a tightrope between voter
anger over sky-high unemployment and investor demands for strict
austerity measures.
 ""There's a risk of everything becoming excessively
politicised which will be detrimental for the economy,"" said
Carlos Berzosa, professor of applied economy at Madrid's
Complutense university.
 Investors reacted to the various events with a burst of risk
aversion, shifting funds into U.S. government debt, gold and the
dollar.
The euro fell to a record low against the generally
safe-haven Swiss franc.  It was down around 1 percent
against the dollar  and recovered from steeper losses
against the yen  to stand 0.9 percent lower.
 Worries about some form of debt restructuring by Greece was
a key element in the sell-off.
 If Greece were to restructure, that could prompt
Ireland and Portugal to follow with restructurings of their
own, Adrian Foster, head of financial markets research for
Asia-Pacific for Rabobank International in Hong Kong, said in a
research note. 
 ""It is difficult to imagine them proceeding with
economically (and politically) painful fiscal austerity whilst
Greece gets debt forgiveness,"" he said.
 
 WEAK SHARES
 European shares suffered the same fate as the euro, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index selling off 1.4 percent.
 ""It's more than Greece now. This is more a reflection of the
inability of the EU to sort out anything, and that makes people
worry beyond Greece,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief investment
officer at Octopus Investments.
 Risk aversion spread beyond Europe. World stocks as measured
by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down 1.2 percent, particularly hit
by emerging markets losses. The MSCI emerging market stock index
<.MSCIEF> was down more than 2 percent, for a year-to-date loss
of more than 3 percent.
 Emerging markets, despite the strong economic conditions
that some of them enjoy, are still seen as relatively risky
investments and therefore sell off when sentiment turns
cautious.
 Yields on peripheral euro zone bonds rose.
 The spread between the yields on 10-year Spanish and Italian
bonds and their German counterparts reached their widest levels
since January.
 Investors, however, bought core euro zone debt and the June
Bund future hit its highest level since January.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Masayuki Kitano	
 TOKYO, May 23 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a two-month low
against the dollar and hit a record low against the Swiss franc
on Monday, hurt by ongoing worries about the potential for debt
restructuring by Greece, with market positioning pointing to the
chances of a further drop.	
 The euro came under renewed selling pressure after its
fragility was highlighted late last week when ratings agency
Fitch downgraded Greece, and Norway said it was suspending a
grant payment to the country. [ID:nLDE74J1JM] [ID:nLDE74J1K7]	
 The euro's drop gained steam after triggering stop-loss
selling below 1.24 against the Swiss franc. The euro took out an
option barrier at 1.2350 francs and hit a record low of 1.2345
francs on trading platform EBS. It was last down 0.4 percent on
the day at 1.2378 francs .	
 Against the dollar, the euro slid 0.8 percent to $1.4044
, having touched a two-month low at one point.	
 ""The shape of euro/dollar's chart looks very bad. It's
likely that the euro could test below $1.39 in the near term,
which is a 50 percent retracement between January's low and a
high reached earlier this month,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior
manager for Okasan Securities' foreign securities department.	
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and senior ECB
officials said on Saturday that Greece must avoid debt
restructuring and push on with budget cuts and privatisations to
overcome its debt crisis. [ID:nLDE74K08V]	
 But worries about some form of debt restructuring by Greece
persist.	
 If Greece were to restructure its debt that could prompt
Ireland and Portugal to follow with debt restructuring of their
own, Adrian Foster, head of financial markets research for
Asia-Pacific for Rabobank International in Hong Kong, said in a
research note. 
 ""It is difficult to imagine them proceeding with
economically (and politically) painful fiscal austerity whilst
Greece gets debt forgiveness,"" Foster said.	
 
 
 SPECULATORS STILL LONG EURO	
 The euro now has a cluster of support starting around
$1.4000, which roughly coincides with its 200-week moving
average.	
 Other possible downside targets include $1.3975, the bottom
of the cloud on daily Ichimoku charts, a Japanese technical
analysis tool used by market players. Another is the 100-day
moving average near $1.3969.	
 The potential for further long liquidation suggested the
euro could dip towards such levels in the near-term, said a
customer dealer for a major Japanese bank. 
 ""The euro seems likely to stay heavy and could make a try
for levels near its 100-day moving average (at $1.3969),"" the
customer dealer said.	
 The latest positioning data from the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission shows that currency speculators reduced their
net long positions in the euro to 41,645 contracts in the week
to May 17. 
 While that is well below the peak above 99,500 lots hit a
few weeks earlier, it is still at the higher end of net long
positions in the euro seen since late 2007.	
 Adding to the negative sentiment against the euro, Spain's
ruling Socialists suffered a crushing defeat in local elections
on Sunday, a result that could make it hard for Socialist Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to impose further
austerity measures if needed to cut the budget deficit
[ID:nLDE74L02S]	
 The euro's drop helped give a lift to the dollar, which hit
a seven-week high against a basket of major currencies and rose
above chart resistance, setting itself up for further gains.	
 The dollar index rose as high as 76.133 ,
having clawed above resistance near 76.00, roughly the 38.2
percent retracement of the dollar's January to May slide and
where the dollar index peaked last week before turning lower.	
 The next retracement level lies near 77.00, the 50 percent
retracement of the same dollar drop.	
 The dollar rose broadly, with a drop in Asian equities and
commodity prices suggesting that investors were cutting back
positions in risky assets. In another sign of such risk
reduction, the Australian dollar slid 1.1 percent to $1.0544
.	
 ""Commodities and equities remain a focal point. I get the
sense that they remain unstable,"" said a trader for a major
Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 A slide in commodities such as silver and oil 
earlier in May had spooked investors, prompting them to trim
dollar-funded positions in risky assets and triggering a
short-covering rally in the dollar.	
 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to around 81.88 yen .
Traders said the dollar could extend its gains against the yen
if stop-loss buying at levels near 82.10 yen is triggered.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Monday as worries about euro-zone
debt sapped demand for riskier assets such as Asian stocks and
prompted investors to shift funds into U.S. government debt,
gold and the dollar.	
 European shares are set to take their cue from Asia, with
financial spread betters calling major indexes to open
between 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent lower. [ID:nLDE74M02N]	
 The euro came under fresh selling pressure after Fitch
Ratings cut Greece's debt ratings by three notches on Friday,
pushing the country's debt deeper into junk status, while rival
Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to ""negative"" from
""stable"" on Saturday. [ID:nLDE74J1K7]	
 The news undermined already weak sentiment in stock markets,
which have seen a stream of headlines about the euro area's debt
problems.	
 Japan's Nikkei average and Australia's benchmark
index each fell more than 1.5 percent as investors shed
riskier assets.	
 Seoul shares shed 2.6 percent, led by declines in
shares of Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors ,
whose production is being disrupted by a strike at one of their
suppliers.	
 Outside Japan, MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares
dropped 2 percent, adding to four consecutive
weeks of declines.	
 The rush towards safe-haven assets helped U.S. Treasury
bonds <0#USBMK=> build on Friday's gains.	
 While the five-year yield is on the verge of falling below
the 200-day moving average, 10-year yields were down 3 basis
points at 3.12 percent. 
 
 
 EURO'S WOES WORSEN	
 The Swiss franc gained from the euro's woes as investors
shifted to traditional safe havens.	
The euro breached support near 1.24 against the
Swiss unit, and hit a record low of 1.2345 francs on trading
platform EBS before trimming its losses to stand
above 1.2360.	
 Against the dollar, the euro slipped further below $1.41,
having triggered some stop-loss selling near that level.	
 The euro's fortunes have turned around dramatically after
hitting a peak of near $1.4940 in early May. Having cheered the
ECB's rate rise, investor sentiment has swung to worrying about
the impact of rising interest rates on the euro area's weaker
economies.	
 In addition, considerable net long positions in the single
currency and a deteriorating technical picture add to the
downside potential of the currency, with $1.35 eyed in the near
term. 
 ""The prospect of ECB rate hikes is no longer sufficient
reason to buy the single currency, and in fact it may become the
case that rate hikes will be seen as EUR-negative should
peripheral concerns intensify,"" Credit Agricole CIB strategists
said in a daily note.	
 The euro-related concerns sparked a safety bid towards the
U.S. currency, propelling the dollar index - which
measures its value against a basket of currencies - to a
seven-week high. [ID:nTKW007278]	
 Still, significant gains may be limited as the Fed nears the
end of its quantitative easing programme in June owing to
worries that the U.S. economy has yet to show a clear recovery
path. Stocks, bonds, gold and the euro are expected to fall in
the three months after the end of the $600 billion plan, a
Reuters poll shows. [ID:nSLAJGE7U1]	
 U.S. crude futures  retreated further below $100 per
barrel on expectations the threat to air travel from a volcanic
eruption in Iceland could reduce oil demand in Europe.
[ID:nLDE74L0JH]	
 Gold, which benefited from a safe haven bid, extended gains
to a two-week high.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Friday on fresh fears of a Greek debt default, which
sent global stocks lower.
 But even as the dollar strengthened against the euro,
copper prices jumped on a decline in Chinese inventories, while
oil prices rose sharply from early losses in choppy trading.
Gold advanced on safe-haven buying.
 A report that Norway suspended the payment of a $42 million
grant to Greece for failure to comply with its EU-IMF bailout
commitments started a sell-off in the euro. Speculation mounted
that Finland, a European Union member, would also suspend
payments. For details see [ID:nOSL016301].
 A Greek daily reported the International Monetary Fund
suspended its review of Greece until the government draws up
further austerity measures. A suspension could mean a delay in
the disbursement of much-needed IMF funds for Athens.
 In addition, rating agency Fitch further downgraded
Greece's credit, fueling the euro's decline. [ID:nLDE74J1K7]
 The single currency was down 1.2 percent at $1.4144
 on trading platform EBS after four days of gains,
with investors focused on the $1.40 level as a short-term
target.
 The news about problems with the EU-IMF Greek bailout plan
almost overshadowed anxiety over Spain's upcoming regional
election this weekend. Spanish bond yields rose on concern the
vote results may undermine Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero's
ability to curb Spain's own fiscal deficit.
 ""The news has been tough all day for the euro. People were
starting to buy the euro the last few days and then we got all
this news, and then the euro just gave way,"" said Richard
Franulovich, senior currency strategist, at Westpac in New
York.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of the greenback
against a basket of currencies, rose 0.75 percent, while
benchmark U.S. Treasuries prices were up 7/32 to yield 3.14
percent.
 On Wall Street bank shares were the hardest hit, though
some retailers also weakened.
 ""It's all about the euro,"" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief
investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte, Vermont.
 ""It's not just the commodity stocks,"" he said. ""As the
dollar strengthens, multinational, dollar-sensitive large
cyclical companies go down also.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> lost 93.28 points,
or 0.74 percent, to 12,512.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>
fell 10.33 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,333.27. The Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> dropped 19.99 points, or 0.71 percent, to
2,803.32.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.57 percent and the Thomson Reuters global stocks index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.67 percent.
 Copper prices jumped, with three-month copper  up
1.5 percent as investors focused on data showing stockpiles in
warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 14.6
percent from last Friday. [ID:nEMS011047] China is the world's
largest consumer of industrial metals.
 Oil prices bounced back from a more than 2 percent decline
on end-of-week short-covering after crude's intraday plunge ran
into support.
 U.S. light crude futures <2CLc1> gained 1.1 percent to
settle at $99.491 as the contract expired on Friday. Brent
crude  was up 0.7 percent, above $112 a barrel.
 Gold rose 1.5 percent, its biggest daily gain in two weeks,
on safe-haven buying as investors fretted about euro zone
debt.
 Spot gold  rose 1.5 percent to $1,513.20 by 4:17 p.m.
EDT (2017 GMT). U.S. June gold futures  settled up $16.50
at $1,508.90 an ounce, after trading between $1,486.40 and
$1,515.80, which marked a one-week high.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro should remain
vulnerable to negative headlines about Greece's debt next week,
but will likely trade within a range as investors hesitate to
sell the euro zone single currency with a key European Central
Bank meeting around the corner.
 While the euro dropped about 4 percent against the dollar
in May, interest rate differentials have largely worked in
favor of the currency and it is up 6 percent year-to-date.
 While the euro's fragility was made evident on Friday when
ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greece and Norway suspended a
grant payment to the country, it will likely remain range bound
over the near term with the ECB widely expected to communicate
plans for another rate hike at its meeting on June 2. For
details see [ID:nATH006085] and [ID:nOSL016301].
 Friday's negative Greece news caused the euro to sink to a
session low of $1.4139  on trading platform EBS before
paring losses on a commodities rebound.
 Investors are focused on the key $1.40 level for the euro.
 ""The market lacks conviction, so any dollar gains we may
see next week will not so much be about the dollar strength but
about euro weakness,"" Marc Chandler, global head of currency
strategy Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Chandler said the euro will likely trade between $1.4050
and $1.4350 next week.
 ""The euro should remain in this range because few will want
to sell aggressively ahead of the upcoming ECB meeting.""
 Spain's regional election this weekend could affect the
euro.
 ""European officials have been successful in establishing a
firewall around Spain and insulating it from the crisis in the
peripheral. That firewall may be tested shortly,"" Chandler
said.
 Spain's Socialist government faces major losses to the
center-right opposition Popular Party, and analysts are wary
that there could be the potential for unearthing of unknown
financial problems. [ID:nLDE74F1GL]
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was at $1.4171
, down 1 percent on trading platform EBS, although on
the week it was still up 0.7 percent.
 The dollar has enjoyed a broad-based rebound recently
fueled by a massive unwinding of short U.S. dollar positions
and a pullback in riskier assets.
 The value of the dollar's net short position fell to $20.01
billion in the week ended May 17 from $27.68 billion the week
before, according to CFTC and Reuters calculations.
[ID:N25267965]
 For the dollar to make a more sustainable push higher,
investors will want to see the Federal Reserve moving closer to
more normal monetary policy, according to Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""While additional near-term strength in the dollar is
likely, especially if Europe's debt problems take a turn for
the worse, its upside will continue to be limited as long as
the Fed remains content to leave lending rates at rock-bottom
levels.""
 Traders also said news Hungary has agreed with banks to fix
a below-market rate on Swiss franc-denominated mortgages has
pressured the euro/Swiss franc pair. Hungary will use an
exchange rate of 180 forints per franc, far below the current
market rate of 215.84 . [ID:nLDE74J14T]
 So far the 1.24 level has held in the euro/Swiss franc
pair, currently down 1.3 percent at 1.2442 .
 The euro also traded 0.9 percent lower against the yen
 at 115.74 yen although it stayed well above a recent
two-month low near 113.40.
 The dollar was up against a basket of currencies <.DXY>,
gaining 0.8 percent to trade at 75.700, though it stayed below
a recent peak of 76.00 struck earlier this week. The dollar was
flat against the yen at 81.58 yen .
 Next week ushers in a slew of global economic data.
 In the U.S., data on durable goods and a second look at
first-quarter gross domestic product will be the main focus.
 In Europe, the ECB will be watching developments with
German HICP inflation and euro area M3 money supply next week.

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Friday on fresh fears of a Greek debt default, which
sent global stocks lower.
 Despite the euro's slide and the U.S. dollar's strength,
copper prices jumped on a decline in Chinese inventories, while
oil prices rose sharply from early losses in choppy trading.
 A report that Norway suspended the payment of a $42 million
grant to Greece for failure to comply with its EU-IMF bailout

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled against the
dollar on Friday on caution before Spanish elections this
weekend and an uncertain Greek debt situation, driving oil and
stock prices lower.
 On Wall Street, stocks were dragged down by declines in
energy and commodity-related shares as well as by the impact of
the euro zone's debt problems.
 The euro was down 1.1 percent at $1.4156  on
persistent concern about a possible restructuring of Greek
debt, which would likely lead to losses for holders of the
bonds, including major European banks.
 Investors also sold the euro on worries the outcome of
Spain's regional elections this weekend could result in the
unearthing of hitherto unknown Spanish financial problems.
 ""We're having a little Spanish angst ahead of the local
election,"" said Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist, at
CitiFX in New York. ""People are a little bit concerned that the
new government that will come in will expose the skeletons of
the supposedly outgoing administration.""
The European Central Bank is firm in its opposition to a
Greek debt restructuring and saying it would refuse to accept
Greek bonds as collateral in the event of such a move.
 Fitch rating agency further downgraded Greece's credit,
increasing the euro's decline. [ID:nLDE74J1K7]
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of the greenback
against a basket of currencies, rose 0.75 percent.
 The stronger dollar sent crude oil prices lower, while
energy investors continued to worry about the global economic
outlook.
 U.S. light crude futures  were down 1.7 percent at
$96.78 a barrel before their contract expiry later on Friday
while Brent crude  was down 1.6 percent at $109.72.
 ""Overall, the downtrend remains very much intact in oil,""
said Edward Meir, senior commodities analyst at MF Global in
Connecticut.
 U.S. stocks fell, dragged lower by commodity-related shares
and as the broad S&P 500 index faced strong technical

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Friday on European policy-makers' disagreement over
how to tackle Greece's debt and ahead of a Spanish regional
election, driving oil prices down more than 2 percent.
 On Wall Street, stocks were dragged down by declines in
energy and commodity-related shares, and also by worries about
the broader impact of the euro zone's debt problems.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 100.92
points, or 0.80 percent, to 12,504.40. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 10.69 points, or 0.80 percent, to
1,332.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 19.31 points,
or 0.68 percent, to 2,804.00.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.7 percent.
 The euro was down more than 1 percent at $1.4162 
on persisting concerns about the possibility of debt
restructuring in Greece, with risk also coming from Spanish
local elections over the weekend.
 ""There are a number of headwinds ahead that favor playing
the euro from the short side,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency
strategist at CIBC.
 The euro was pressured by worries that the outcome of
Spain's regional elections this weekend could help unearth
unknown financial problems, and by an uncertain situation over
Greek debt.
The European Central Bank is firm in its opposition to a
Greek debt restructuring and saying it would refuse to accept
Greek bonds as collateral in the event of such a move.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of the greenback
against a basket of currencies, rose 0.75 percent.
 The stronger dollar sent crude oil prices lower.
 U.S. light crude futures  were down 2 percent at

while Brent crude  was down 1.9 percent at $109.36.

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Friday after four straight days of gains, on worries
about the outcome of Spain's regional elections this weekend
and an uncertain Greek debt situation.
 Traders said the market will be focused on Friday's close
for the euro, which has ended each day higher this week. A
close below Thursday's would stall the euro's retracement rally
from the seven-week low hit last Monday, suggesting the market
may have seen the top in the single currency for now.
 ""We're having a little Spanish angst ahead of the local
election. People are a little bit concerned that the new
government that will come in will expose the skeletons of the
supposedly outgoing administration,"" said Greg Anderson, senior
currency strategist, at CitiFX in New York.
 Spain's Socialist government, faces major losses to the
center-right opposition Popular Party and analysts are wary
that there could be the potential for unearthing of unknown
financial problems. [ID:nLDE74F1GL]
 In early New York trading, the euro was last at $1.4169
, down 1 percent on trading platform EBS, although on
the week it was still up 0.6 percent. It hit a session low of
$1.4161 after earlier hitting a session high at $1.4345.
 A weekly close below the euro's 55-day average around
$1.4301 could push it toward that seven-week trough at
$1.4048.
 Trading may also be influenced by a large $1.4360 digital
option for expiry on Monday, with euro/dollar needing to hold
below that level for a payout.
 In line with euro weakness, the spread between peripheral
bonds and German Bunds widened on Friday. The Spain/Bund
10-year yield spread   traded at its
widest since mid-January at around 239 basis points, up 11
basis points a day after a lackluster Spanish bond auction.
 The Greece debt crisis remains a prominent background
factor in the market, with the European Central Bank firm in
its opposition to a debt restructuring. The ECB notes that the
country can pay back its debt by sticking to the EU/IMF plan
without resorting to a restructuring.
 ECB Governing Council member Marko Kranjec said as much on
Friday, adding that he knew of no discussion from any country
ever having wanted to exit the euro. See [ID:nF9E7GJ000].
 The 10-year Greek/German yield spread expanded nevertheless
by about 58 basis points.
 The euro also gave ground gains against the yen, to trade
0.3 percent down on the day at 116.41 yen , although
it stayed well above a recent two-month low near 113.40 yen.
 The dollar <.DXY> recovered earlier falls to trade up 0.3
percent at 75.345 against a basket of currencies, though it
stayed below its recent peak of 76.00 struck earlier this
week.
 ""Our preference is that the dollar index slowly sinks to
74.40, or a 1 percent drop From current levels, but technical
buying will no doubt emerge there,"" said Chris Turner, head of
FX strategy at ING.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 81.70 yen . Traders
cited talk of dollar bids from Japanese retail traders near
81.30 yen, while some offers from such household investors were
said to be lurking at 81.80 yen and above.
 The Bank of Japan kept policy unchanged, holding interest
rates steady in a zero to 0.1 percent range on Friday. But in
surprise move, Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura dropped a
proposal to loosen policy further. [ID:nL4E7GK04E]

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - World stocks and oil prices rose
on Friday as the dollar lost ground broadly, after weak U.S.
economic data reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve will
be slow to raise interest rates.
 Equities have gained this week as risk aversion eased while
commodities regained some stability after a sharp sell-off
earlier in May, but mixed economic data has capped advances.
 Oil rose with U.S. light crude heading towards $100 per
barrel as the weaker dollar and advances in stock markets lured
investors into the market.
 The dollar struggled to make headway against a basket of
currencies after data on Thursday showed a slowdown in
manufacturing growth in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region and an
unexpected fall in existing home sales in April.
 That cemented the view that if economic data continues to
disappoint, it could delay Fed action on rates until well into
2012 or later, encouraging investor appetite for riskier assets
such as equities.
 European shares rose for a third straight day, tracking
gains in the United States that were helped by social network
company LinkedIn's  solid market debut.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.6 percent, after a 0.7 percent rise in the previous
session.
 ""Most people don't see this market as being particularly
stretched. But there's a concern about where the growth comes
from,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven
Investment Management.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.3
percent while Asian stocks excluding Japan also inched up.
 Japanese stocks ended down 0.1 percent after the Bank of
Japan kept interest rates on hold and warned that the economy
will remain under strong downward pressure for the time being.

 GREEK DEBT RESTRUCTURING TALK
 In currency markets, the soft U.S. data gave the euro a
respite from recent heavy selling, with the single currency
holding much of its overnight gains as investor attention slowly
shifted to interest rate differentials and away from the euro
zone debt crisis.
 The euro remains around 4 percent below an early May peak of
$1.4940 after a rout in commodities spooked investors, prompting
the unwinding of dollar-funded bets in risky assets.
 The euro was last at $1.4310  on Friday, well above a
seven-week low of $1.4048 struck on trading platform EBS earlier
this week.
 The dollar index was down 0.1 percent <.DXY> after
Thursday's data underscored the view the Fed was likely to keep
monetary policy easy in the coming months in contrast to the
tightening cycle that the European Central Bank has embarked on.
 ""Growth prospects still fail to convince the market and the
risk surrounding prices is far more moderate,"" says BBVA chief
strategist Pablo Zaragoza. 
 ""Disappointing activity-related data and mixed signals from
employment numbers continue to cast doubt over the U.S.
economy's ability to continue growing at above 3 percent,
particularly with the oil price still above $100/barrel.""
 Financial markets remained on edge over persisting concerns
about the possibility of debt restructuring in Greece and before
the U.S. Federal Reserve's bond-buying programme winds down next
month. [ID:nL4E7GJ3XF]
 The yield premium of lower-rated euro zone government bonds
over German benchmarks rose as disagreement over a possible
Greek debt restructuring and upcoming elections in Spain soured
investor appetite for riskier debt.
 ""In our view the Greek situation is being overplayed by the
market and we think that the politicians, the European Central
Bank and the International Monetary Fund will get around to
finding a solution,"" said Gavin Friend, currency analyst at
nabCapital.
 U.S. light crude futures  were up 0.9 percent at
$99.28 a barrel before their contract expiry later on Friday
while Brent crude  was up 0.4 percent at $111.87, and
spot gold  rose on bargain hunting. [GOL/]

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro was steady against the
dollar on Friday, holding on to modest gains made in the
previous session, with investors' focus slowly shifting to
interest rate differentials from the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Trading in the euro was likely to be influenced by a large
$1.4360 digital option for expiry on Monday, with the spot
euro/dollar  pair needing to hold below that level for a
payout.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4330, , well above a
seven-week low of $1.4048 struck on trading platform EBS earlier
this week.
 It was helped by the dollar's own struggles, with the
greenback taking a hit on Thursday from data showing a slowdown
in manufacturing growth in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region and an
unexpected fall in existing home sales in April. [ID:nN19134058]
 The data backed views that the Federal Reserve will likely
keep monetary policy easy in the coming months, in sharp
contrast to the tightening cycle the European Central Bank has
already embarked on.
 Despite favourable rate differentials, the euro has shed
around 4 percent since hitting a peak near $1.4940 in early May,
hurt by concerns about a possible debt restructuring in Greece
and as a selloff in commodities such as silver  and oil
 led investors to unwind dollar-funded bets.
 ""In our view the Greek situation is being overplayed by the
market and we think that the politicians, the European Central
Bank and the International Monetary Fund will get around to
finding a solution,"" said Gavin Friend, currency analyst at

 ""The euro has good support and although there is talk of
options at $1.4360, I think it can test resistance at $1.4425 in
the near term."" The euro last traded near that level on May 11.
 With data showing German producer prices rising strongly in
April, expectations of further tightening measures by the ECB
seem to have overshadowed the split emerging between the ECB and
euro zone politicians about how to tackle Greece's debt crisis.

 BOJ HOLDS FIRE 
 Signs of an easing in risk reduction among investors, with
commodities having regained some stability this week after their
sharp falls earlier in May, have also supported the euro and
commodities-related currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at 116.87 yen , having
rebounded from a two-month low near 113.40 yen on Monday.
 The dollar inched higher against the yen, rising 0.1 percent
to 81.71 yen , and edging towards a three-week high around
82.23 hit the previous day.
 Despite its gains against the yen, the dollar was on the
back foot overall, with the dollar index <.DXY> flat at 75.12,
well below its recent peak of 76.00 struck earlier this week.
 ""Our preference is that the dollar index slowly sinks to
74.40, or a 1 percent drop from current levels, but technical
buying will no doubt emerge there,"" said Chris Turner, head of
FX strategy at ING.
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged, holding
interest rates steady in a range of zero to 0.1 percent on
Friday, as widely expected.
 But in surprise move, Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura
dropped a proposal to loosen policy further with an expansion of
the central bank's asset-buying scheme. He made such a proposal
last month but was voted down by an 8-to-1 margin.
 The yen showed little reaction to the BOJ decision, with
some analysts saying that the possibility of the bank expanding
asset buying in coming months could not be ruled out.
[ID:nL4E7GK04E]
 The yen has been pressured this week by speculation about
the potential for yen-selling flows related to Japanese
corporate acquisitions of overseas firms, including drug maker
Takeda Pharmaceutical's <4502.T> deal to buy Swiss-based Nycomed
for 9.6 billion euros ($13.7 billion). [ID:nL4E7GJ0XB]
 There was talk of dollar bids from Japanese retail traders
near 81.30 yen, while some offers from such household investors
were said to be lurking at 81.80 yen and above.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 20 (Reuters) - The dollar looked set to post
its first weekly loss in three weeks as investors increased bets
on risky assets like equities on expectations the United States
would take a long time to raise interest rates after weak
economic data this week.	
 Despite the meagre gains posted by stocks on Friday, markets
have drifted aimlessly this week, lacking any fundamental
drivers after the end of the earnings season and a brutal
commodity markets rout earlier this month.	
 Japanese shares ended the day down 0.1 percent at
9607.08 after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold at
the end of a two-day policy meeting at which it warned that the
economy will remain under strong downward pressure for the time
being. [ID:nT9E7FR009]	
 Outside Japan, the broader Asian market represented by the
MSCI index ex-Japan edged up 0.1 percent.	
 Korean shares rose 0.8 percent despite foreign
selling, while Australian shares fell 0.5 percent, led
by miners.	
 ""Smart, short-term money which flowed in March and April is
withdrawing. I am getting a sense that a lot of it is European,""
said Chung Yun-sik, chief investment officer at ING Investment
Management. Chung said the pull-back could be linked to ongoing
debt issues and the fragility of Europe's banking sector.	
 Technology companies, in particular the Chinese internet
sector, might get a look in after LinkedIn's stellar
debut saw its market value more than double in a single day.	
 Tencent , China's dominant internet firm, looks
poised to benefit from lofty valuations that social media firms
are fetching despite its 31 percent gains so far this year, as
the stock approaches a record high hit last month.	
 
 YIELD HUNTERS	
 Overnight, data showed a slowdown in manufacturing growth in
the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region and an unexpected dip in existing
home sales in April. [ID:nN19134058]	
 That cemented views that if economic data continues to
disappoint, it could delay Fed action until well into 2012 or
later, encouraging investors to hunt for yields, especially in
Asian fixed income markets.	
 Solid responses to recent credit issues have already taken
the year-to-date volume in the Asian primary market to $44.7
billion, more than half of last year's record $83.4 billion.
Morgan Stanley has projected the annual tally could end up in
excess of $100 billion at the current pace.	
 ICICI Bank , India's second-biggest lender, sold $1
billion in bonds at 295 basis points over US Treasuries, tighter
than an initial guidance of above 300 basis points above.	
 Emerging market debt funds more than doubled inflows to $223
million in the week of May 18 from the prior period, according
to Thomson Reuters Lipper data. [ID:nN19158983]	
 In currency markets, the soft patch of U.S. data gave the
euro a brief respite after recent heavy selling, with the euro
holding much of its overnight gains versus the dollar.	
 Notwithstanding Friday's small gains, the euro remains
around 4 percent below an early May peak of $1.4940 after a rout
in commodities spooked investors, prompting the unwinding of
dollar-funded bets in risky assets.	
 Financial markets remained on edge amid lingering concerns
about the possibility of debt restructuring in Greece and before
the U.S. Federal Reserve's bond-buying programme winds down next
month.[ID:nL4E7GJ3XF]	
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a
popular gauge for market performance, has steadied after
tumbling 9 percent from an April 29 high, while oil
climbed before a contract expiry and spot gold rose on
bargain hunting. 
 U.S. Treasury yields softened on weak data with the 10-year
U.S. Treasury yield hovering around 3.17 percent, though some
analysts warned the market's six-week rally was near an end.
Yields have fallen from as high as 3.62 percent on April 8.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Discouraging U.S. housing and
factory data weighed on oil prices and the U.S. dollar on
Thursday, while a lackluster day on Wall Street was
overshadowed by the doubling of professional networking company
LinkedIn's share price in its market debut.
 A drop in weekly claims for unemployment aid suggested the
U.S. labor market was on track for recovery. But regional
factory activity grew much more slowly than expected in May and
home resales fell in April. For details see [ID:nN19134058].
 The bleak data made investors question the strength of the
U.S. economic recovery and suggested the Federal Reserve will
likely keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a while longer,
keeping interest rate differentials unfavorable for the U.S.
currency.
 ""The markets right now are very concerned, they are pricing
in risk that somehow the second-half rebound is under threat,""
said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J.P. Morgan Private
Wealth Management in New York.
 The euro  rose 0.4 percent to $1.4306 while the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, a gauge of the greenback against a
basket of currencies, fell 0.5 percent.
 ""The Fed cannot raise rates in a slowing economic
environment,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at
Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""Given the U.S. Treasury states currencies should reflect
economic fundamentals, we see a weaker (dollar) going
forward.""
 Oil prices fell as the U.S. data stoked fresh worries about
the health of the world's largest economy and after the
International Energy Agency urged oil producers to increase
supply to cut fuel costs and protect the fragile global
economic recovery.
 The IEA raised the possibility of releasing emergency
stockpiles to cool prices if producers did not increase
supply.
 U.S. crude oil  dropped 1.7 percent to $98.44 a
barrel, unable to extend Wednesday's 3.3 percent advance, while
Brent  edged 0.8 percent lower to $111.38.
 Copper  fell 1.4 percent following Wednesday's gain
of more than 3 percent, the largest in two months.
 Commodity prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks after
months of steep gains. U.S. crude is down more than 13 percent
for the month.
 Investors in higher-risk assets such as commodities and
equities face next month's end of a Federal Reserve program to
buy U.S. Treasury debt, known as QE2, which has generated a
flow of cash that has contributed to rising prices.
 Stocks, bonds, gold and the euro are expected to fall in
the three months after the end of QE2, a Reuters poll of 64
analysts and fund managers found.

 On Wall Street, shares of LinkedIn Corp , whose
site is popular with professionals and job hunters, surged as
much as 171 percent in their first day of trading, reminiscent
of investors' love affair with Internet stocks in the late
1990s.
 ""It seems to bring back memories of the tech bubble,"" said
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in
Chicago. ""Based on what I know it seems like investors are a

 LinkedIn shares closed up 109.4 percent at $94.25 after
hitting a session high of $121.97.
 U.S. stocks closed higher but ran into a technical
resistance level that is likely to limit a further rise in the
near-term. The mixed economic data kept confidence in the
economic recovery on shaky ground.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The dollar slid on Thursday as
weak U.S. economic data affirmed expectations the Federal
Reserve will keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a while,
keeping interest rates for the greenback very low compared with
higher yielding currencies.
 The Fed is widely expected to refrain from raising rates
this year, and if economic data continues to disappoint it
could push out Fed action until well into 2012 or perhaps even
later.
 ""The Fed cannot raise rates in a slowing economic
environment,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at
Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""Given the U.S. Treasury states currencies should reflect
economic fundamentals, we see a weaker (dollar) going
forward.""
 Data showing a slowdown in manufacturing growth in the U.S.
Mid-Atlantic region and an unexpected dip in existing home
sales in April triggered dollar selling and added to growing
signs that U.S. economic prospects were far from upbeat. See
[ID:nN19134058]
 Some global central banks have already embarked on a path
of monetary tightening, making their assets more appealing and
lifting their currencies. The European Central Bank last month
raised rates for the first time since July 2008.
 Interest rate differentials have firmly favored the euro,
with the single-currency up 7 percent year-to-date against the
dollar.
 The euro climbed to a session high of $1.4326 on trading
platform EBS . In late afternoon New York trading, the
euro pared some of its gains but was still up 0.4 percent at
$1.4304.
 A still unresolved debt restructuring issue in Greece,
however, should minimize the greenback's losses against the
euro, though the single-currency still managed to hold above
its 55-day moving average, currently around $1.4295.
 Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset
Management Company in Burlington, Vermont, said despite weak
economic data, the June conclusion of the Fed's second round of
quantitative easing, called QE2, should work in favor of the
dollar.
 The Fed's bond-buying program launched in November entailed
buying $600 billion in Treasury securities.
 ""The weakness we have been seeing in the economy is due to
shocks caused earlier in the year from Japan's earthquake and
higher energy prices,"" she said. ""We expect economic growth to
reaccelerate in the second half of the year, but the Fed will
likely be inclined to wait until 2012 to raise rates.""
 ""An improving economy and the end of QE2 should ultimately
push Treasury yields higher, and that will fare well for the
dollar,"" she said.
 Dwight Asset Management Company has $55 billion in assets
under management.
 Only 10 percent of economists and fund managers surveyed in
a Reuters poll expected the Federal Reserve to launch another
round of quantitative easing when the current one ends in June.
[ID:nSLAJGE7U1]
 The euro has fallen in recent weeks after hitting a
17-month peak near $1.4940 in early May on expectations of a
less aggressive ECB and concerns about debt in euro zone
peripheral nations.
 Traders said major central banks have been alternately
buying the euro on dips and selling it on any modest rally,
suggesting the single euro zone currency will trade within a
tight range until the European Union and International Monetary
Fund complete a full analysis of Greece's debt.
 That analysis is due sometime in late May or early June and
should shed light on whether Greece will restructure its
massive liabilities.
 Debt restructuring is viewed as negative for the euro as it
could prompt a flight away from euro zone bonds and damage the
European Union's credibility after it went all-out to bail out
Greece.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index was down 0.5 percent at
75.124 <.DXY>. The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen
at 81.58  after hitting a three-week high at 82.179.
Thursday's weak U.S. data had an impact on this currency pair.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - World stocks pared gains on
Thursday as discouraging U.S. housing and factory data weighed
on Wall Street and prompted investors to sell oil and other
commodities.
 An exception to stocks' listless trend came from the debut
of LinkedIn . Shares of the U.S. social networking
company, whose site is popular with professionals and job
hunters, surged as much as 167 percent in their first day of
trading in a scenario that was reminiscent of investors' love
affair with Internet stocks in the late 1990s,
 European equities closed higher, offsetting slight losses
in New York, while the euro, still hampered by Greece's
uncertain debt situation, was unable to hold gains on the
dollar despite the weak U.S. data.
 On Wall Street, stocks edged lower after separate reports
showed an unexpected drop in existing home sales in April and
regional factory activity grew much more slowly than expected
in May. Earlier, data showed weekly applications for
unemployment insurance fell more than expected.
 ""The trend has been picking up as far as data being a bit
weaker than expected,"" said Steve Goldman, market strategist
at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 ""For the markets, there's been a theme change in the past
two months. When looking at the data, the expectation was
things may be starting to slow down, maybe a move toward
defensive names. Global growth seems to be ebbing somewhat.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 2.73
points, or 0.02 percent, to 12,557.45. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 2.17 points, or 0.16 percent, to
1,338.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 5.52
points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,809.48.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.64 percent.
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> and the Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> were up around 0.1
percent for the day.
 U.S. crude oil  dropped 0.9 percent to $99.20 a
barrel, weighed by the U.S. data. Copper  fell 1
percent following Wednesday's gain of more than 3 percent.
 Commodity prices have fallen sharply in May as the
dollar's weakness reversed. U.S. crude is down more than 13
percent for the month. The feeling that the commodities' rout
was overdone contributed to Wednesday's gains.
 Investors in higher risk assets like commodities and
equities face the end next month of a Federal Reserve program
known as QE2, which has generated a flow of cash that has
contributed to rising prices.

 EURO STILL UNDER GREEK PRESSURE
 Analysts said investors were looking for opportunities to
start buying the euro and riskier currencies after recent
falls, but sovereign debt concerns kept the single currency
pinned below a key 55-day moving average around $1.4295 on
trading platform EBS .
 The euro edged up less than 0.1 percent to $1.4259 while
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, a gauge of the greenback against

 A restructuring of Greece's debt seemed to be off the

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for a second
day on Thursday, boosted by European equities which rose to
their highest in almost a week, while commodities mostly held
to the previous session's steep gains.
 The euro wobbled against the U.S. dollar, pressured by some
reported central bank selling, with the single currency still
hampered by Greece's uncertain debt situation.
 On Wall Street, stocks were little changed after data
showed weekly applications for unemployment insurance fell more
than expected, but separate data showed an unexpected drop in
home resales in April and regional factory activity grew much
more slowly than expected in May.
 In Europe, energy shares advanced on firmer crude prices
and auto shares rose on improving prospects for vehicle
markets. Miners were also in demand after Glencore ,
the world's top diversified commodities trader, made a bumper
$11 billion market debut in London.
 ""Markets had a bounce yesterday and momentum will continue
... with bargain hunting coming in,"" said Matt Brown, trader at
Catalyst Markets.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.8 percent.
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> and the Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> were up around 0.2
percent on the day.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 28.00 points,
or 0.22 percent, to 12,588.18. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> edged up 1.16 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,341.84. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 4.15 points, or 0.15
percent, to 2,819.15.
 ""Long-term demand from China is really driving up commodity
stocks and ultimately that is the reason why investors put
money into the Glencore IPO,"" said Yusuf Heusen, senior sales
trader at IG Index.
 U.S. crude oil  edged up 0.1 percent to $100.25 a
barrel after the previous day's 3.3 percent jump. Copper
 dipped 0.2 percent after a more than 3 percent gain on
Wednesday.
 Commodity prices have fallen sharply in May as the dollar's
weakness reversed. U.S. crude is down more than 12 percent for
the month.
 Higher-risk assets also have been helped in recent months
by the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying program,
known as QE2, which has generated a flow of cash. Investors
face the end of the QE2 program next month.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday, pressured by some reported central
bank selling, with the single currency still hampered by
Greece's uncertain debt situation.
 Analysts said investors were looking for opportunities to
start buying the euro and riskier currencies after recent
falls, but sovereign concerns kept the euro pinned below a key
55-day moving average around $1.4295 on trading platform
EBS.
 A restructuring of Greece's huge debt seemed to be off the
table for now, according to euro zone sources, lending the
whole issue a positive spin, but still investors were not
willing to commit buying the euro's upside. For the story,
click on [ID:nLDE74I0QP].
 Debt restructuring is viewed as negative for the euro as it
could prompt a flight away from euro zone bonds and damage the
European Union's credibility after going all out to bail out
Greece.
 Traders pointed to a report that quoted European Central
Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet as saying the bank would not
accept Greek bonds as collateral in the event of a
restructuring. The same view was attributed to policymaker
Juergen Stark by a bank spokesman. [ID:nFLAJGE7NK]
 ""The uncertainty about Greece has kept the euro under
pressure,"" said Mary Nicola, currency strategist, at BNP
Paribas in New York.
 ""But you get the sense that despite all the uncertainty,
the expectation is that something positive will come out of
this. That's probably why we're seeing the euro not as weak as
one might expect,"" she added.
 Economists expressed doubts about whether the ECB would
follow through on the threat over Greek collateral, describing
it as a negotiating ploy designed to halt the momentum towards
some form of restructuring. [ID:nLDE74I13Q]
 In early New York trading, the euro was down 0.2 percent at
$1.4234 , still comfortably above a seven-week low of
$1.4048 hit on Monday, and traders cited sovereign bids around
$1.4200.
 Support was also seen around $1.4246, the 200-hour moving
average, and the 55-day moving average at $1.4295.
 With Greece's debt problems seen coming to a head, the euro
has taken a knock as investors cut back long positions in past
weeks. This has pulled the single currency down from a 17-month
high around $1.4950 hit earlier this month.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 82.11
 after earlier hitting a three-week high at 82.179.
 Better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims helped to boost
the greenback versus the yen. For the data, click on
[ID:nOAT004812].
 Some analysts said though the jobless claims level was
still not sufficient to bring unemployment significantly
lower.
 ""At 409,000 claims in the latest week, we are still at
levels consistent with moderate job growth and little progress
in bringing unemployment down,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief
economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the
dollar on Thursday on uncertainty about the implications of a
possible Greek debt restructuring, with traders saying
policymaker opposition might lead to further declines.
 Traders pointed to a report that quoted European Central
Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet as saying the bank would not
accept Greek bonds as collateral should there be a decision to
lengthen the term of Greece's debt repayments. The same view was
attributed to policymaker Juergen Stark by a bank spokesman.
[ID:nFLAJGE7NK]
 In response, the euro held below its 55-day moving average
at $1.4296, though sovereign bids at $1.4220-30 were expected to
keep it comfortably above a seven-week low of $1.4048 hit on
Monday. Further uncertainty over euro zone debt could pull it
back down towards this level again, traders said.
 The dollar was also soft after Federal Reserve minutes were
interpreted as suggesting U.S. monetary policy tightening was
still some way off, even as some officials saw a rise in
inflation risks. [ID:nN18279205]
 ""We are seeing a consolidation phase after the heavy
liquidation of short dollar positions,"" said Niels Christensen,
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 But he added that for the euro to make gains the market
would need to see euro zone data or comments from European
Central Bank officials that would point to further rises in euro
zone interest rates, he said.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4224 , off the
day's high of $1.4308 as it struggled to make a sustained break
above resistance at its 55-day moving average.
 ""There's a sense that when it comes to Greece's debt crisis
there's still some time left to deal with it,"" said Minori
Uchida, a senior analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in
Tokyo.
 ""It's difficult to sell the euro beyond $1.40 now, when
there's talk that the European Central Bank could raise rates in
July,"" he said.
 The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies <.DXY>
at 75.503, below a high hit on Monday of 76.001.
 Perceived higher-risk commodity-linked currencies gained
slightly against the greenback, with the Australian dollar
 up 0.15 percent at $1.0640 and the New Zealand dollar
 up 0.3 percent at $0.7909.
 The dollar hit a three-week high against the yen  at
81.85 yen as data showed the Japanese economy shrank much more
than expected in the first quarter. [ID:nL4E7GJ01B]
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at 116.24 yen , with
the concerns about euro zone debt pulling it off an earlier high
of 116.70 yen. Its immediate target was seen at 116.91, a 38.2
percent retracement of its one-month decline until last week.
 ""Japanese data overnight have been weak and the sovereign
debt crisis in the euro zone continues to cloud the outlook for
risk,"" Rabobank analysts said in a note.
 ""Although position adjustment over the past couple of week
has no doubt curbed exuberance, the market is likely to remain
reluctant to load up heavily on risk just yet.""

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - World stocks rose from this
week's four-week low on Thursday and the euro erased earlier

buy back risky assets.
 Wall Street was set for a firmer open later, a day after

 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.4 percent to $100.47 a barrel
after the previous day's data showed a surprise drop in crude
stockpiles in the United States, the world's biggest consumer.
 
 COLLATERAL UNCERTAINTY
 A brighter risk climate helped the euro rebound to $1.4277
 after an earlier decline following warnings that the
European central bank would be unable to accept Greece's
government bonds as collateral in the event of a restructuring
of its debt.
 Bund futures  fell 30 ticks.
 German daily Financial Times Deutschland reported European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet had warned the bank
would stop accepting Greek bonds as collateral if Greece asked
investors for a voluntary extension of bond maturities.
 Another ECB official Juergen Stark said a restructuring of
Greek debt would make it impossible for the ECB to continue to
accept its bonds as collateral in liquidity operations.
[ID:nFLAJGE7NK]
 European finance ministers broke a taboo this week by
acknowledging for the first time that some form of restructuring
might be required to ease Greece's debt burden, which at 150
percent of annual output is among the highest in the world.
 The dollar <.DXY> fell a quarter percent against a basket of
major currencies. It briefly hit a three-week high around 81.96
yen  thanks to a rebound in U.S. bond yields 
from 2011 lows around 3.1 percent.
 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's April policy meeting,
released on Wednesday, showed a few central bank officials saw a

 * Uniform rise in commodities helps Asia materials sector
 * Financial markets still struggle for common theme

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, May 19 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Thursday
with funds sensing a rally this month is ending and expectations
increasing that commodity prices have resumed an uptrend,
pushing up equities in Asia's energy and materials sectors.	
 Investors have been struggling to find a common theme in
financial markets after two routs in commodities over the past
two weeks led to a reduction of risky assets in portfolios.
Economic data out of the United States and China also sent mixed
signals.	
 Some investors latched on to a rise in U.S. 10-year yields
from a low for the year hit overnight because Federal Reserve
officials expressed worries about inflation ahead of the
expiration of a $600 billion bond purchase programme next month.
A rebound in the S&P 500 index from a one-month low also played
a role.	
 A slide in Treasury futures suggested more weakness was in
store for U.S. bonds.	
 Higher U.S. yields supported the dollar briefly against the
low-yielding yen, but not against other major currencies. Price
action suggests investors are sensitive to relative interest
rate advantages, but also see the U.S. currency bogged down with
economic and fiscal imbalances.	
 The dollar index, a measure of its value versus six other
major currencies, was down 0.2 percent after hitting a
one-month high on Monday.	
 The euro was up 0.1 percent to $1.4268 in choppy
trade, trying to chalk up a fourth consecutive day of gains
after the market was unable to push the common currency below
its 200-week moving average at $1.4000.	
 ""If you look at the next few months, the euro could fall to
around $1.35. But I guess it's difficult to sell the euro beyond
$1.40 now, when there's talk that the European Central Bank
could raise rates in July,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.	
 The dollar was at 81.64 yen, steady on the day after earlier
hitting a three-week high of 81.82 yen .	
 
 SHRINKING JAPAN	
 Japan's Nikkei share average slipped 0.5 percent ,
with tech shares reversing earlier gains and weighing on the
broader market.	
 Japan's economy shrank more than expected in the first
quarter and slipped into recession after the triple blow of the
March earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis hit business and
consumer spending and disrupted supply chains. [ID:nL4E7GJ01B]	
 The difficult business environment has not hit stocks as
hard and many economists expect growth to resume in the second
half of the year, but power shortages are a real threat to the
world's third-largest economy.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2
percent after earlier gaining as much as 1
percent, rallying from a six-week low hit on Tuesday.	
 The energy and materials sectors were outperforming after
commodities prices posted their biggest gain in two months
overnight. The MSCI's Asia Pacific ex-Japan materials sector
index reflected the second-highest returns for
the year to date among all sectors, but lagged far behind the
top consumer discretionary sector.	
 Australia, one of the most sensitive economies in the region
to commodity prices, saw its benchmark index rise 1.2 percent
, leading other Asian stock markets.	
 Miners listed in Australia were sold down too much when
commodities prices plunged two weeks ago and large-cap
miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto in particular
are cheap, dealers and analysts said.	
 BHP and Rio Tinto shares were up 1.2 percent and 1.3 percent
respectively in modest trading volume.	
 ""In the longer term, with our commodity price forecasts,
they remain attractive,"" said Mark Taylor, senior resources
analyst at Morningstar.	
 U.S. crude's front month future edged down 0.3 percent to
$98.80 a barrel , but was well above the low for the month
hit two weeks ago at $94.63 a barrel.	
 The June 10-year Treasury future slipped 3/32 to 122-14/32
 after the cash yield bounced 7 basis points to 3.18
percent on Wednesday.	
 Central banks and domestic U.S. mutual funds were buyers of
Treasuries overnight, though other longer-term investors were
sellers of mid-maturity paper, Royal Bank of Scotland said in a
note.	
 Futures have broken an upward trend in place since early
April and have also dropped back below the 200-day moving
average, bearish technical signals that even without Washington
hitting its debt ceiling should give caution to bond bulls.	
 Republican Congressional officials meanwhile have been
floating the idea that investors would be forgiving if the
government missed a few coupon payments. [ID:nN18289725]

uptrend, pushing up equities in Asia's materials sector.	
 Investors have been struggling to find a common theme in
financial markets after two routs in commodities over the past
two weeks led to a reduction of risky assets in portfolios.
Economic data out of the United States and China also sent mixed
signals.	
 Some investors latched on to a rise in U.S. 10-year yields
from a low for the year hit overnight because the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion bond purchase programme starts winding
down next month and Fed officials expressed worries about
inflation. A rebound in the S&P 500 index from a one-month low
also played a role.	
 A slide in Treasury futures suggested more weakness was in
store for U.S. bonds.	
 Higher U.S. yields supported the dollar briefly against the
low-yielding yen, but not against other major currencies. Price
action suggests investors are sensitive to relative interest
rate advantages, but also see the U.S. currency bogged down with
economic and fiscal imbalances.	
 The euro was up 0.3 percent to $1.4294 , trying to
chalk up a fourth consecutive day of gains after the market was
unable to push the common currency below its 200-week moving
average at $1.4000.	
 ""If you look at the next few months, the euro could fall to
around $1.35. But I guess it's difficult to sell the euro beyond
$1.40 now, when there's talk that the European Central Bank
could raise rates in July,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.	
 The dollar was at 81.56 yen, down 0.1 percent after earlier
hitting a three-week high of 81.82 yen .	
 Japan's Nikkei share average slipped 0.1 percent ,
with tech shares reversing earlier gains and weighing on the
broader market.	
 Japan's economy shrank much more than expected in the first
quarter and slipped into recession after the triple blow of the
March earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis hit business and
consumer spending and disrupted supply chains. [ID:nL4E7GJ01B]	
 The difficult business environment has not hit stocks as
hard and many economists expect growth to resume in the second
half of the year, but power shortages are a real threat to the
world's third-largest economy.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1
percent, rallying from a six-week low hit on Tuesday.	
 The materials sector was outperforming after commodities
prices posted their biggest gain in two months overnight. The
MSCI's Asia Pacific ex-Japan materials sector index
reflected the second-highest returns for the
year to date among all sectors, but lagged far behind the top
consumer discretionary sector.	
 Australia, one of the most sensitive economies in the region
to commodity prices, saw its benchmark index rise 1.4 percent
, leading other Asian stock markets.	
 Miners listed in Australia were sold down too much when
commodities prices plunged two weeks ago and large-cap
miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto in particular
are cheap, dealers and analysts said.	
 ""In the longer term, with our commodity price forecasts,
they remain attractive,"" said Mark Taylor, senior resources
analyst at Morningstar.	
 U.S. crude's front month future edged up 0.3 percent to
$100.39 a barrel  and Brent was up 0.33 percent to $112.67
.	
 The June 10-year Treasury future slipped 1/32 to 122-14/32
 after the cash yield bounced 7 basis points to 3.18
percent on Wednesday.	
 Futures have broken an upward trend in place since early
April and have also dropped back below the 200-day moving
average, bearish technical signals that even without Washington
hitting its debt ceiling should give caution to bond bulls.	
 Central banks and domestic U.S. mutual funds were buyers of
Treasuries overnight, though other longer-term investors were
sellers of mid-maturity paper, Royal Bank of Scotland said in a
note.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - An unexpected drop in U.S. oil
supplies boosted crude prices on Wednesday as commodities
rallied from steep losses, helping lift global stocks after
five days of declines.
 Wall Street stocks posted their best day in three weeks,
led by gains in energy and basic materials shares, while a more
than 5 percent jump in the stock of computer maker Dell boosted
the technology sector.
 Commodities rallied as a recent sharp selling binge, which
pushed the price of oil sold in the United States down more
than 15 percent this month, was believed to have gone too far.
Oil prices rose further after a weekly government report showed
a surprising decline, albeit modest, in U.S. crude stockpiles.
 U.S. crude  rose 4 percent before paring gains, up
more than 2.5 percent and just shy of $100 a barrel. Brent
crude  gained 1.9 percent to at $112.05 a barrel.
 U.S. crude is still down 12.5 percent this month.
 ""There is a sense that perhaps the selling in the energy
markets was overdone,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at PFGBest
Research in Chicago.
 Copper jumped 3.4 percent to a two-week high, but doubts
about short-term fundamentals were expected to cap prices. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodities index <.CRB> rose 2.3
percent, its largest daily gain in two months.
 A stronger dollar and renewed concerns about global
economic growth have been cited for plummeting commodity
prices in the first two weeks of May.
 STOCKS RISE, EURO WOBBLES
 U.S. stocks were led by energy shares and an encouraging
outlook from the world's No. 2 PC maker, Dell Inc .
 ""The rally has been led by the raw materials, which is
linked to a rebound in some of the commodity prices,"" said Nick
Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global in Chicago. Dell's earnings
""were strong and breathed some life back into technology.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 80.60 points,
or 0.65 percent, to 12,560.18. The Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>
gained 11.70 points, or 0.88 percent, to 1,340.68. The Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> added 31.79 points, or 1.14 percent, to
2,815.00.
 The broad S&P 500 <.SPX> posted its largest daily
percentage gain since April 26.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> jumped 0.9
percent, bouncing off five days of losses that took the index
down on Tuesday to its lowest close since April 18.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.4 percent to
close at 1,130.89 and U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures
 gained 1 percent.
 The euro hovered near break-even against the dollar in
volatile trade. Firmer stocks and commodities gave a floor to
the single currency, but the near-term outlook remained
overcast as Greece's debt situation was still largely
unresolved.
 Most Federal Reserve officials prefer to raise benchmark
interest rates before selling assets when the time comes to
tighten policy, minutes of their April meeting showed.
 U.S. policymakers said discussion of the removal of
monetary stimulus should not be seen as an indication it will
happen soon.
 The euro was mostly unchanged at $1.4239 . On
Monday, it slumped to a seven-week low of $1.4048.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Wednesday as minutes from last month's U.S. central
bank meeting raised expectations that inflation could spur an
interest rate hike sooner than expected.
 U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers discussed how to
eventually normalize monetary policy at their April meeting.
While policymakers did not make any decisions on their upcoming
strategy, they did agree on principles to guide it.
[ID:nN18276699]
 Some Fed policymakers said they saw a rise in inflation
risks, suggesting the Fed might need to tighten monetary policy
sooner than currently anticipated.
 ""While we're not expecting any change in the immediate
future, it's clear that the Fed is definitely eyeing an exit
strategy from its extremely accommodative policy stance,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange Inc in Washington.
 ""Ultimately, that suggests the dollar will eventually find
some support as a result of rising interest rates later this
year.""

 In afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.1
percent at $1.4226 . It faces a near-term upside
hurdle at its 55-day moving average around $1.4290.
 The European Central Bank has already embarked on a path of
monetary tightening, raising rates last month for the first
time since July 2008.
 The Fed's meeting, and a lack of new negative developments
in Greece, prompted investors to turn their attention back to
interest rate differentials, which have firmly favored the euro
against the dollar this year. The single currency has gained
about 6.4 percent year-to-date on the dollar.
 GREECE REMAINS A WILD CARD
 There were opposing views on whether Greece should overhaul
its massive debt. Euro zone finance ministers on Tuesday
floated the idea of a ""soft"" restructuring, but the Greek
government did not appear keen to adopt their suggestion.
 Greece's Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on
Wednesday that no magic scenarios can take Greece out of its
crisis. See [ID:nATH006083]
 His comments pushed the euro lower earlier in the session,
but the impact dissipated.
 Some analysts argued that a restructuring in Greece would
be unlikely at least until European officials are confident the
contagion risks to other weak euro zone countries would be
low.
 Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities,
said the high $1.42 level is perhaps as good as it will get
for the euro on Wednesday.
 ""We retain a broadly bearish bias and continue to think the
main near- to medium-term risk is for a drop to the $1.36/$1.39
range,"" he said.
 In line with euro weakness, the premium investors demand to
hold Greek government bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds
rose to one-week peaks on Wednesday.
 The Greek/German 10-year government bond yield spread
 expanded 29 basis points on the day
to 1,305 bps. The bid/ask spread for the 10-year paper was
last 336 bps, its highest since June 2010. See
[ID:nLDE74H1A0].
 Ongoing U.S. fiscal issues may limit demand for the U.S.
dollar, which has bounced following a heavy selling trend this
month, as investors trimmed overstretched bets to sell the
greenback.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.1 percent to 75.452, below a
six-week high around 76.0 hit earlier in the week.
 The dollar traded 0.2 percent lower against the yen at
81.56 .

 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - An unexpected drop in U.S.

 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Inventory data boosted oil
prices as other commodities prices rallied on Wednesday on a
rebound from steep declines, helping lift global stocks after
five straight days of losses.
 On Wall Street, stocks were led by gains in energy and
basic materials shares, but traders remained cautious ahead of
minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting expected later in the

 NYMEX and Brent crude prices rose after an overnight report
of a surprise drop in U.S. gasoline inventories, followed
Wednesday by an unexpected draw in crude supplies.
 U.S. crude , up almost 4 percent, traded above $100 a

more than 2.5 percent to as high as $113 a barrel.
 U.S. crude is still down more than 11 percent this month.

 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Oil and other commodity prices
rose on Wednesday, rebounding from recent losses, and global
stocks gained after five straight days of declines as investors
sought bargains in hard-hit markets.
 On Wall Street, stocks were led by gains in
commodity-related shares, but caution remained ahead of minutes
from a Federal Reserve meeting expected later in the day.
 NYMEX and Brent crude prices extended gains after data from
the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude
inventories fell slightly last week as refinery utilization

 Brent crude  moved above $111 a barrel, adding 1.8
percent. U.S. crude  approached $100, up more than 2
percent and cutting the month's losses to just below 13
percent.
 Copper jumped 2.7 percent to a two-week high but doubts
about short-term fundamentals were expected to cap prices.

 The euro was volatile as it struggled to hold gains against
the dollar after early demand ran into technical resistance. If

 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Oil and other commodity prices
rose on Wednesday, rebounding from heavy losses earlier in the
week, and global stocks gained after five straight days of
declines as investors sought bargains in hard-hit markets.
 On Wall Street, stocks opened flat as gains by computer
maker Dell and the rebound in commodity prices were balanced
against minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting, expected later
in the day.
 Brent crude  moved above $111 a barrel, adding 1.2
percent, supported by a surprise drop in U.S. gasoline
inventories. Supply data was seen giving crude oil prices a
further lift. U.S. crude  gained 2 percent, cutting the
month's losses to just above 13 percent.
 Copper jumped 2.7 percent to a two-week high but doubts
about short-term fundamentals are expected to cap prices.
 ""Investors are feeling their way back slowly, there's a
general feeling the sell-off was overdone,"" a metal trader
said.
 ""But I don't think we've seen an end to losses. Dollar
strength and some bad economic news from China or the United
States is all it will take.""
 The hunt for cheaper assets, was tempered by continuing
concerns about the euro zone's struggle to control debt in some
of its economies.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
half a percent, bouncing off Tuesday's losses, which took the
index to its lowest since April 18.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> gained around a third of
a percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 6.21 points,
or 0.05 percent, to 12,473.37. The Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>
edged up 1.52 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,330.50. The Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> gained 7.32 points, or 0.26 percent, to
2,790.53.
EURO SLIPS
 The euro struggled to hold gains against the dollar after
early demand ran into technical resistance, but the single
currency may catch fresh bids if Federal Reserve meeting
minutes, to be released later on Wednesday, suggest U.S.
interest rates will remain low.
 The shared currency dipped 0.1 percent to $1.4218
. It slumped to a seven-week low of $1.4048 on
Monday.
 ""The possibility of a more dovish tone in the (Fed) minutes
as well as European inflation figures over the coming days
could well see confidence in pursuing euro strength above
$1.43,"" said Lena Komileva, global head of G10 currency
strategy at BBH.
 Yields on a German bond auction were lower and those at a
Portuguese sale higher than in previous bidding, reflecting the
perceived safety of bonds from the euro zone's strongest
economy while countries on the bloc's periphery struggle.
 Portugal sold 1.0 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in two-month
T-bills, at the top of the indicative offer range. The average
yield rose to 4.657 percent from 4.652 percent in an auction of
three-month paper, the closest comparable maturity, on May 4.
 Germany sold 4.9 billion euros in five-year bonds with the
average yield falling to 2.45 percent compared with 2.68
percent in April.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar
on Wednesday after early demand ran into technical resistance
but the shared currency may catch fresh bids if Federal Reserve
meeting minutes suggest U.S. interest rates will stay low.
 The euro  traded at $1.4220, down 0.1 percent on the
day, with intra-day stops below $1.4210. Traders said early
sovereign demand took it to a session high of $1.4287, but gains
were blocked by its 55-day moving average around $1.4290.
 Higher shares and commodity prices offered some support to
riskier currencies including the euro, while the dollar was on
the back foot as lower U.S. Treasury yields tarnished the appeal
of U.S. assets ahead of FOMC minutes due later in the day.
 The market took in its stride the risk of a Greek debt
restructuring after European finance officials on Tuesday
acknowledged such a possibility. [ID:nLDE74G0PD]
 Some analysts argued that while investors remain deeply
concerned about Athens' creditworthiness, overall speculation
about an end-game to Greece's debt situation was limited for the
moment.
 Range trading in the euro suggested the market was wary of
taking a strong direction on the latest development in the euro
zone debt crisis at present, while analysts saw the risk of more
dollar downside.
 ""The possibility of a more dovish tone in the FOMC minutes
as well as European inflation figures over the coming days could
well see confidence in pursuing euro strength above $1.43,"" said
Lena Komileva, global head of G10 currency strategy at BBH.
 Eurogroup leader Jean-Claude Juncker on Tuesday said there
was a need to move towards a ""soft restructuring"" of Greek debt,
but other officials are fighting any such move, while Greece's
prime minister has said restructuring would do more harm than
good.
 Some analysts argued that a restructuring would be unlikely
at least until European officials were confident the contagion
risks to other weak euro zone countries would be low, adding
that this outlook may prop up the euro.
 Still, many concede the euro will be unable to gain
significantly until investors have more clarity on how
successful Greece, along with Portugal and Ireland, will be in
sorting out its debt problems.
 ""If Greece is allowed to restructure in one way or another,
it could be taken as a negative for the euro as it could
undermine confidence in the euro zone,"" said Dag Muller,
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Market participants said the euro's immediate downside was
protected by the 21-hour moving average around $1.4244.
 The dollar  slipped 0.4 percent to 81.12 yen, as the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hovered around its lowest
in five months. Narrowing U.S./Japanese government bond yield
spreads often put selling pressure on the dollar versus the yen.
 
 DOLLAR SLIPS
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.04 percent at 75.428, but
well below a six-week high around 76.0 hit earlier in the week.
 The U.S. central bank releases minutes from its May policy
meeting at 1800 GMT.
 Investors expect the Fed to underline its determination to
keep rates near zero even after it ends its cheap-money policy
of quantitative easing in June, and an even more dovish stance
could prompt selling in the dollar.
 U.S. fiscal wrangling is also expected to limit demand for
the dollar, which has bounced following a heavy selling trend
this month, as investors trimmed overstretched bets to sell the
greenback.
 ""Doubts over the extent to which the recent USD rally washed
out extreme short positioning warns against expectations for USD
to return sharply lower, but we suspect that the USD Index will
head below 75.0 before long,"" ING analysts said in a note.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.4 percent to $1.0581
, struggling in the aftermath of weak wage data which
further reduced the case for a rate rise next month.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed off
four-week lows on Wednesday and the euro recovered some ground
against the dollar as investors sought bargains in recently
hard-hit markets.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher.
 The hunt for cheaper assets, however, was tempered by
disappointing U.S. economic data on Tuesday and continuing
concerns about the euro zone's struggle to control debt in its
peripheral economies, particularly Greece.
 Europe's top financial officials broke a taboo on Tuesday
and acknowledged for the first time that Greece may have to
restructure its debts, a move which could stoke Europe's
sovereign debt crisis. [ID:nLDE74G0PD].
 Yields on a German bond auction were lower and those at a
Portuguese sale higher than in previous bidding, reflecting the
perceived safety of bonds from the euro zone's strongest economy
while countries on the bloc's periphery struggle.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
half a percent, bouncing off Tuesday's losses, which took the
index to its lowest since April 18.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> gained around a third of
a percent.
 Investors have become more cautious in the past month faced
with unanswered questions about slow U.S. growth, Chinese
overheating and Europe's debt woes.
 U.S factory output slipped for the first time in 10 months
in April as a shortage of parts from disaster-hit Japan crimped
activity.
 While many investors consider the overall outlook to be
positive, those sort of signs have led to a pull back from risk.
 ""It seems to me that we are going to be stuck in a
trading range for a little while,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief
strategist at Brewin Dolphin.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> climbed 1 percent, helped by
a weaker yen and hence better exporting prospects.
 
 EURO CLIMBS
 The euro rose against the dollar, recovering from a
seven-week low earlier in the week, but wariness over Europe's
sovereign debt problems kept investors nervous about piling up
euro positions.
 ""The euro is still in a correction phase after recent
declines,"" said Hideki Amikura, a forex manager at Nomura Trust
and Banking. ""It has the potential to advance towards
$1.43-$1.44 on hopes for more buybacks by foreign investors."" 
 The shared currency gained 0.1 percent to $1.4253 . It
slumped to a seven-week low of $1.4048 on Monday.
 In the euro zone government debt auctions, Portugal sold 1.0
billion euros ($1.4 billion) in two-month T-bills, at the top of
the indicative offer range. The average yield rose to 4.657
percent from 4.652 percent in an auction of three-month paper --
the closest comparable maturity -- on May 4.
 Germany sold 4.9 billion euros in five-year bonds with the
average yield falling to 2.45 percent compared with 2.68
percent in April.
 ""There is still robust demand, and obviously we don't need
to look far for the reasons,"" said WestLB rate strategist
Michael Leister.

 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro was buoyant against the
dollar on Wednesday after recovering from a seven-week low
earlier in the week, but wariness over Europe's sovereign debt
problems kept investors nervous about piling up euro positions.
 The euro drew support from a recovery in oil prices and
precious metals, while a downward trend in U.S. Treasury yields
weighed on the dollar.
 ""The euro is still in a correction phase after recent
declines. It has the potential to advance towards $1.43-$1.44
on hopes for more buybacks by foreign investors,"" said Hideki
Amikura, a forex manager at Nomura Trust and Banking.
 ""But the euro could lose ground again once rounds of
corrective buying are over,"" Amikura said.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.4275 , breaking
through the previous day's high after slumping to a seven-week
low of $1.4048 on Monday.
 The European currency could test its 50-day moving average,
currently at $1.4325, in the near term, said Teppei Ino, a
currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""Although the euro is still vulnerable to downward pressure
due to lingering debt problems in the euro zone, we are
watching whether it could break through its 50-day moving
average above $1.43 in the near term,"" Ino said.
 ""I feel that the euro-zone debt issue has stabilised
slightly for the near term after European finance ministers
approved a loan scheme for Portugal, prompting buying back of
the euro,"" he said.
 Still, investors avoided becoming overly optimistic and
building up euro positions as the region's debt crisis is far
from over, analysts said.
 Europe's top financial officials broke a taboo on Tuesday
and acknowledged for the first time that Greece may have to
restructure its debt, which could stoke the region's sovereign
debt crisis. [ID:nLDE74G0PD]
 YEN FIRMS
 The euro drifted lower against the yen after gaining
support in early trade on expectations of yen-selling flows
linked to M&A deals by Japanese corporations, traders said.
 Japan's Toshiba Corp <6502.T> is close to closing a deal to
buy Swiss-based meter maker Landis+Gyr for about $2.5 billion,
an industry source said on Tuesday. [ID:nL4E7GH09K]
 Separately, Takeda Pharmaceutical <4202.T> will reach an
agreement on Wednesday with Swiss-based Nycomed to acquire the
company for about 1 trillion yen ($12 billion), the Nikkei
financial daily reported. [ID:nWNAB9664]
 The euro fell 0.1 percent to 115.83  after
climbing to a high around 116.40 yen in early Asian trade.
 ""The near-term technical trend for the euro improved,
especially after breaking beyond 115.60 yen yesterday, but its
topside was capped somewhat as the dollar is weighed down above
81 yen,"" a forex dealer at a Japanese securities house said.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 81.20 yen , with
stop-loss sell orders triggered after it drifted down from
Tuesday's high of 81.77 yen.
 The dollar was weighed down as the market detected a series
of sell orders by Japanese retail investors lined up between
81.50 and 81.70 yen, traders said.
 Further stop-loss dollar sell orders are rumoured to be
placed at 81.00 yen and 80.80 yen, they said.
 ""The dollar may face some hurdles near 82 yen, with U.S.
Treasury yields drifting down recently,"" Ino said.
 U.S. housing starts and building permits fell in April,
while factory output slumped, suggesting the economy got off to
a weak start in the second quarter, U.S. data showed on
Tuesday.
 The New Zealand dollar advanced to $0.7890  after
news that producer input prices rose 2.2 percent in the three
months to March 31 from the previous quarter, the sixth
straight increase and the largest quarterly movement since
September 2008. [ID:nW9E7EU02E]
 The Australian dollar advanced to $1.0655  after
slipping to the day's low of $1.0615  on data showing
that the Australian wage price index rose 0.8 percent in the
first quarter versus the previous quarter, below economists'
forecast of 1.1 percent.
 The Aussie was also undermined after Moody's Investors
Service downgraded credit ratings of the country's four major
banks to Aa2.

 By Nick Macfie	
 SINGAPORE, May 18 (Reuters) - Asia shares rose from a
six-week low on Wednesday, led by consumer stocks, but
disappointing U.S. data have made some investors reluctant to
follow commodity prices higher, containing a bounce in risky
assets from currencies to oil.	
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average was up 1.1 percent
and MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.8 percent. Korea stocks rose 1.59
percent, lifted by automakers and shipbuilders.	
 European shares were expected to rise on Wednesday,
taking Asia's lead and bouncing from four-week lows. Britain's
FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40
were seen putting on between 0.7 and 0.9 percent,
according to financial spreadbetters.	
 The main Wall Street indices ended flat to 0.6 percent
lower on Tuesday after falling as much as 1 percent, weighed by
soft economic data, including a slump in home building, and a
lower outlook from tech heavyweight Hewlett-Packard Co. .	
 U.S. factory output slipped for the first time in 10 months
in April as a shortage of parts from Japan crimped activity and
home building slumped, showing the economy got off to a weak
start in the second quarter.	
 
 Signs of lacklustre economic activity were also evident in
declining sales at Wal-Mart Stores , and the cut in 2011
profit forecast by Hewlett-Packard. [ID:nN17138040].	
 ""As long as investors remain jittery about U.S. economic
growth, investment in Japanese manufacturers may be subdued,""
said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho
Securities.	
 London copper firmed on Wednesday, but analysts said gains
may be capped as disappointing U.S. data raised more doubts
about the global economic recovery.	
 But amid the U.S. slowdown, the state of the housing market,
a big copper user, comes as no surprise, especially after
tornadoes lashed parts of the country last month. Home
construction only accounts for about 2.2 percent of U.S. GDP.	
""On a day-to-day basis, it is almost impossible to predict
market movements,"" said Khiem Do, chairman of the Asia
multi-asset team at Barings Asset Management in Hong Kong.	
 ""The U.S. is going through a period of consolidation, but
it's still growing. It's not going back to recession, it's just
a deceleration. There's nothing too big to worry about.""	
 The euro was steady against the dollar at $1.4274
after recovering from recent lows, but wariness over sovereign
debt problems in Europe made investors nervous about piling up
euro positions, although traders said signs of clarity in the
issue may prompt some buying back of the single currency.

 ""I feel that the euro-zone debt issue has stabilised
slightly for the near term after European finance ministers
approved a loan scheme for Portugal, prompting buying back of
the euro,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

and acknowledged for the first time that Greece may have to

sovereign debt crisis. [ID:nLDE74G0PD].	
 The U.S. dollar index , a measure of the U.S. dollar
against a basket of currencies, was off 0.31 percent.	
 
 GOLD, CRUDE EDGE UP 
 Gold rose to $1,492.26, after falling for three
consecutive sessions. Again, worries about the
euro-zone's debt crisis lent support, despite news this week
that billionaire financier George Soros dumped almost his entire
$800 million stake in bullion investment in the first quarter.	
 U.S. crude futures bounced back after ending at a 12-week
low following industry data that showed a surprise drop in U.S.
product inventories. 
London Brent crude for July delivery  was up 54 cents
at $110.53 a barrel, after settling down 85 cents.	
 NYMEX crude for June delivery  was up 79 cents at
$97.70 a barrel, after rising to as high as $98.00 earlier.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to a
one-month low on Tuesday on Europe's debt crisis and data that
spurred new doubts about the global economic recovery, while a
late pick-up in the euro brought commodities off early lows.
 The single currency rose against the U.S. dollar in choppy
trade, but was seen still vulnerable to global risk aversion
and the possibility that Greece might restructure its debt.
 The euro gained 0.55 percent to $1.4233, helping lift oil,
copper and gold prices off their lows.
 U.S. housing starts and building permits plunged in April
and factory output declined for the first time in 10 months as
Japan's earthquake interrupted the supply of parts to auto
makers.
 The weak data weighed on U.S. stocks on concerns the
recovery is taking longer than expected. Shares of industrial
powerhouse Caterpillar Inc  dropped 3.8 percent, while a
disappointing outlook from Hewlett-Packard Co  also took
a toll on Wall Street.
 ""Today's market largely reflects the intensifying concerns
that the global economy is slowing or worse,"" said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC
in Albany, New York.
 ""Leading indicators for the economy are starting to give
ground and all of that is bothering investors.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 68.79
points, or 0.55 percent, to 12,479.58. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> dipped 0.49 point, or 0.04 percent, to
1,328.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> edged up 0.9
point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,783.21.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
closed down 1 percent at 1,126.94, the lowest close since April
19, as disappointing economic numbers hurt sentiment.
 German investor sentiment fell more than expected in May,
indicating surging growth in Europe's largest economy could
ease over the course of the year. In the UK, annual inflation
hit a 2-1/2-year high in April.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> dropped
0.5 percent, off for a fifth day for a near 3 percent slide.
 However, U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures  rose
0.2 percent as the dollar rose 0.6 percent against the yen
.
 Investors face the end of the U.S. Federal Reserve's $600
billion asset-purchase program next month. The flow of cash
generated by the program, coupled with ultra-low interest
rates, has fueled investments in higher-yielding assets in
recent months.

 GREEK DEBT DRAGS ON EURO
 Europe's top financial officials broke a taboo on Tuesday
and acknowledged for the first time that Greece may have to
restructure its debts, a move that could stoke Europe's
sovereign debt crisis. For more, see: [ID:nLDE74G0PD]
 Speaking on the sidelines of an EU finance ministers'
meeting, Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the 17-country
Eurogroup, said there was a need to move toward what he called
a ""soft restructuring"" of Greek debt.
 ""We're going to hear a lot of back and forth as to what
politicians and other European officials think, and it would be
hard for the euro to find a clear direction,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 The euro was last up 0.6 percent at $1.4235 , a
day after hitting a seven-week low of around $1.4048 on trading
platform EBS. Some traders said as long as the euro stayed
below its 55-day average of $1.4280, it was vulnerable to a
test of recent lows.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a measure of the greenback
against a basket of currencies, edged 0.15 percent lower.
 July Brent crude  was down 0.6 percent at $110.18 a
barrel, while U.S. crude for June delivery  was down 0.2
percent at $97.15 after being down as much as 2 percent
earlier.
 Gold fell but was off its lows as the dollar reversed
course. Commodities have recently been fragile after steep

 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to a
one-month low on Tuesday as data spurred a new wave of doubts
over the global economic recovery and on worries about
debt-laden euro-zone nations, while a late pick-up in the euro
brought commodities off earlier lows.
 The euro rose against the dollar in choppy trade, but was
seen still vulnerable to global risk aversion and the
possibility that Greece might restructure its massive debt.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.4221, and oil copper and
gold prices came off their lows.
 U.S. housing starts and building permits plunged in April
and factory output declined for the first time in 10 months as
Japan's earthquake interrupted the supply of parts to auto
makers.
 The weak data drove down U.S. stocks on concerns the
recovery is taking longer than expected.
 A disappointing outlook from Hewlett-Packard Co ,
the world's top technology company by revenue, also took a toll
on Wall Street.
 ""Earnings from blue-chips as well as data (are) showing
evidence of an economic slowdown,"" said Chad Morganlander,
portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New
Jersey.
 Hewlett-Packard shares tumbled 8.5 after the company cut
its forecast due to supply problems stemming from Japan's
earthquake and soft PC sales. For details see [ID:nN17131511].
 The broad S&P 500 index fell below its 50-day average, a
key technical measure, indicating further weakness could be in
the charts.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 114.47
points, or 0.91 percent, to 12,433.90. The Standard & Poor's
500 <.SPX> fell 5.41 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,324.06. The
Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> lost 11.84 points, or 0.43 percent, to
2,770.47.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
closed down 1 percent at 1,126.94, the lowest close since April
19, as disappointing economic numbers hurt sentiment.
 German investor sentiment fell more than expected in May,
indicating surging growth in Europe's largest economy could
ease over the course of the year. In the UK, annual inflation
hit a 2-1/2-year high in April.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> dropped
0.6 percent, off for a fifth day for a near 3 percent slide.
 July Brent crude  was down 0.7 percent at $110 a
barrel, while U.S. crude for June delivery  was down 0.5
percent at $96.91, after being down as much as 2 percent
earlier.
 ""The economic growth and demand thesis is ebbing before the
eyes of the market,"" said John Kilduff, partner at the hedge
fund Again Capital LLC in New York.
 Investors also face the end of the U.S. Federal Reserve's
$600 billion asset-purchase program next month. The flow of
cash generated by the program, coupled with ultra-low interest
rates, has fueled investments in higher-yielding assets for the
past months.

 GREECE DEBT DRAGS ON EURO
 The euro ticked up against the dollar in afternoon trading
in New York.
 Greece's foreign minister, Spyros Kouvelis, said Athens was
open to a ""soft"" debt restructuring if needed. His comments
came after euro-zone officials, including Jean-Claude Juncker,
chairman of the euro-zone finance ministers, said for the first
time on Tuesday that Greece may have to ask investors to extend
the maturities of the Greek debt or agree to a soft
restructuring.
 ""We're going to hear a lot of back and forth as to what
politicians and other European officials think, and it would be
hard for the euro to find a clear direction,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.4212 , a
day after hitting a seven-week low of around $1.4048 on trading
platform EBS. Some traders said as long as the euro stayed
below its 55-day moving average of $1.4280, it was vulnerable
to a test of recent lows.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a measure of the U.S. dollar
against a basket of currencies, was unchanged.
 Gold fell but was off its lows as the dollar's strength
reversed. Commodities have recently been fragile after steep
run-ups.
 Spot gold  was down 0.7 percent at $1,479.20 an ounce
at 1835 GMT, up from a session low of $1,471.50.
 Copper was also lower by worries over the economic
recovery. Benchmark copper <.CMCU3> was at $8,830 a ton versus
$8,839 at Monday's close.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodities <.CRB> was
on track to close at its lowest level since February.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar in choppy trading on Tuesday but remains vulnerable to
global risk-aversion and the possibility that Greece might
restructure its massive debt.
 European finance ministers approved a financial aid package
for Portugal on Monday, but Greece's debt situation is a
significant wild card. A restructuring of Greece's debt could
erode the euro zone's credibility with investors.
 The U.S. dollar had received a boost against most major
currencies as investors unwound bets in commodities, stocks,
and high-yielding units such as the Australian dollar on
concerns global growth has stalled.
 The dollar's recent outperformance against other
'safe-haven' currencies is probably a reflection of short
speculative positioning on the greenback being scaled back as
global market jitters persist, said to Vassili Serebriakov,
currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Commodities and stocks were weaker as a result, with U.S.
oil futures  and the S&P 500 <.SPX> 0.3 percent weaker on
the day. Nervousness related to Greece's debt situation also
supported safe-haven U.S. Treasury debt. [ID:nN17160326]
Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister Spyros Kouvelis said it was
open to a ""soft"" debt restructuring if needed. Kouvelis'
comments came after euro zone officials, including Jean-Claude
Juncker, chairman of the euro zone finance ministers, said for
the first time on Tuesday Greece may have to ask investors to
extend the maturities of its debt or agree to a soft
restructuring. Click on [ID:nLDE74G1IK]. For Juncker's
comments, see [ID:nWEA1772].
 But key European Union officials including German
Chancellor Angela Merkel vehemently opposed restructuring any
euro zone country's debt. Merkel on Monday said such a scenario
could lead to massive investor flight from euro zone bonds.
 ""A voluntary Greek restructuring would still be a euro
negative event in the short-term by setting a dangerous
precedent,"" Serebriakov said.
 The euro was last at $1.4194 , up 0.3 percent,
recovering from a seven-week low of around $1.4048 hit on
Monday on trading platform EBS. Some traders said as long as it
stayed below its 55-day moving average of $1.4280, it was
vulnerable to a test of its recent lows.
 The $1.40 trading level has kept the euro supported with
buying from central banks and hedge funds.
 DiDi Weinblatt, vice president of mutual fund portfolios at
USAA Investment Management Company in San Antonio, Texas, said
the June conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's second round
of quantitative easing, called QE2, should cause Treasury
yields to rise.
 The Fed's bond buying program launched in November and
entailed buying $600 billion in Treasury securities.
 ""With the end of QE2 nearing I am nervous about buying
Treasuries right now,"" she said. ""The whole world is based on
supply and demand dynamics, and so the Fed is going to leave a
large void, which should push Treasury yields higher.""
 Weinblatt, who oversees just under $4 billion in assets,
said higher yields should make dollar-denominated assets more
appealing and that should buoy the dollar.
 ""The euro still faces peripheral debt issues and that
should weigh on the currency,"" she said.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the performance
of the greenback against a basket of currencies, is down 0.4
percent since Nov. 3 and down 9 percent since late August, when
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled QE2 was on the horizon.
 <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The euro hit a 17-month peak near $1.4940 in early May,
buoyed by market expectations that the ECB would raise interest
rates further in the coming months, while the Federal Reserve
is expected to keep interest rates near zero this year.
 The yen, meanwhile, fell broadly as Toshiba Corp <6502.T>
was said to be close to buying Swiss-based Landis+Gyr and media
reports said Takeda was in advanced talks to purchase
Swiss-based rival Nycomed, developments that were the catalyst
for yen selling. [ID:nL4E7GH09K]
 The euro rose 1.3 percent to 115.82 yen , while
the Swiss franc was up 0.5 percent at 91.86 yen . The
dollar was up 0.9 percent against the yen  at 81.52 yen,
with traders citing demand from funds and stops above 82 yen.

 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to a
one-month low on Tuesday as data spurred a new wave of doubts
over the global economic recovery and on worries about
debt-laden euro zone nations, while oil tumbled on the economic
outlook and a firmer dollar.
 U.S. housing starts and building permits fell in April and
factory output fell for the first time in 10 months as Japan's
earthquake interrupted the supply of parts to auto makers.
 In Europe, German investor sentiment fell more than
expected in May, a sign that surging growth in Europe's largest
economy is set to ease over the course of the year. In the UK,
annual inflation hit a 2-1/2-year high in April.
 Wall Street stocks fell as the weak data added to concerns
the recovery is taking longer than expected. Oil prices slid
more than 2 percent as the weak U.S. data spurred demand
worries and as the dollar strengthened.
 ""The economic data has not been particularly good,"" said
Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San
Francisco. ""This whole Europe thing is wobbly again and it
doesn't seem like anyone has got a reasonable solution.""
 ""Oil is down again today so commodity related stocks are
down and that drags on everything as well. So when you add it
all up together, it ain't a good day for the market.""
 The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> index
fell 0.8 percent, down for the fourth consecutive session,
after the chairman of the euro zone finance ministers suggested
Greece's debt could undergo a ""soft"" restructuring.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.8 percent, after earlier hitting the lowest level since
mid-April.

or 0.76 percent, to 2,761.28.
 Hewlett-Packard Co , the world's largest technology
company, tumbled 9.1 percent to $36.18 after cutting its
forecast due to problems stemming from Japan's earthquake and
soft PC sales.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodities <.CRB> was
on track to close at its lowest level since late January.
 In London, July Brent crude  was down 2 percent at
$108.61 a barrel, while in New York U.S. crude for June

 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to a
one-month low on Tuesday on lingering doubts over the global
economic recovery and worries about the debt of peripheral euro
zone nations, while oil was pushed down by demand concerns and
a firm dollar.
 Wall Street stocks opened lower after weak data on housing
and industrial production added to concerns the recovery is
taking longer than expected. The euro zone's blue chip Euro
STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> index fell 0.6 percent, down for the
fourth consecutive session, after the chairman of euro zone
finance ministers suggested Greece's debt could undergo a
""soft"" restructuring.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.6 percent, with the index earlier hitting its lowest level
since mid-April.
 ""The expected growth that was supposed to take place in
housing this spring hasn't yet,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior
currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. ""If anything
(the U.S. data) should be negative for growth, negative for
stocks, and positive for the dollar.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> lost 64.06 points,
or 0.51 percent, to 12,484.31. The Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>
dropped 3.61 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,325.86. The Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> fell 11.62 points, or 0.42 percent, to
2,770.69.
 Brent oil  dipped below $110 a barrel while U.S.
crude  brushed $96 a barrel ahead of weekly U.S. data
expected to show builds in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks and
as the dollar gained ground.
 ""There's a reassessment of the fundamentals, and there's a
perception that the current price is too high,"" said Christophe
Barret, oil analyst at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment
Bank. ""With demand being affected by the high oil prices ...
they have to correct.""
 The euro seesawed against the dollar as Eurogroup chairman
Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be a soft restructuring of
Greek debt, with support for the single currency coming from a
solid response to a Spanish bond auction and a mixed German
economic sentiment survey.
 Lingering worries over Greece were keeping the euro on
edge, with some traders expecting it to trade in a $1.40-1.4250
range in the next few days.
 Copper was also dragged lower by the firmer dollar and
worries over the economic recovery. Benchmark copper <.CMCU3>
was at $8,808 a ton versus $8,839 at Monday's close.
 Earlier, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average <.N225> inched
higher, helped by a weaker yen, but the gains were limited by a
slide in the utility sector, dragged down by Tokyo Electric
Power Co <9501.T>.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - The euro jumped from
seven-week lows against the dollar on Monday as a European
Union meeting showed support for debt-burdened countries,
lifting demand for the single-currency after last week's sharp
sell-off.
 While the euro remains vulnerable to renewed selling
pressure on peripheral debt concerns, indications of support
for Greece and that it may avert a debt restructuring was
embraced after days of speculation.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as much on Monday,
noting that she was against debt restructuring by any euro zone
country before 2013. She added that doing so would be
""incredibly damaging"" to the euro zone's credibility. For
details, see [ID:nBAT006249]
 Euro zone finance ministers, meanwhile, approved a
three-year, 78-billion euro emergency loan program for Portugal
on Monday and said Lisbon would ask private bondholders to
maintain their exposure to its debt. [ID:nLDE74F28K]
 The euro has fallen roughly 6 percent from a 17-month peak
of $1.4940 hit less than two weeks ago as peripheral debt
concerns resurfaced, with $1.40 seen as a key support level.
 ""That is a huge drop within a short space of time, so while
there is no technical reason for today's bounce, I am also not
surprised by it,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head of fx strategy
at Nomura Securities in New York.
 Nordvig said they had some short EURUSD exposure in option
form since the currency pair first traded to $1.45 in
mid-April.
 ""While risk reduction could see a further unwinding of USD
shorts on global basis, including EURUSD longs, we think the
risk reward in EURUSD shorts is less compelling here, and we
are squaring up for now, with a smallish gain,"" he said.
 Nordvig said this stance reflects the fact that while there
is a lot of focus on Greece and the rest of the periphery once
again, this is not translating into systemic tension in the
euro zone banking system in the same way it did during 2010 and
in January 2011, he said.
 The euro rose as high as $1.42450  on trading
platform EBS and was last at $1.4222, up 0.7 percent. Earlier,
it fell to $1.40481, the lowest since late March.
 Traders said the euro's earlier fall was met with strong
demand from Asian sovereign accounts that were still keen to
buy on dips, while strong bids were seen toward $1.40.
 That level represents the euro's 200-week moving average,
while the 100-day moving average lies at $1.3922. Below that is
the 50 percent retracement of the euro's January to May rally,
near $1.3900.
 On the upside, key resistance resided at $1.42539, the 23.6
percent retracement of the decline from the 17-month high at
$1.4940 in early May to Monday's low.
 ""I expect the European finance ministers to show solidarity
and support for Greece,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior
currency strategist at Westpac in New York, which, he said,
should put a floor on the euro for now.
 The impact of the arrest of International Monetary Fund
chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on sexual assault charges, which
earlier dampened sentiment on the euro, faded as central banks
started snapping up the euro after it declined to the $1.4050
level.
 Overall, the market mood remained cautious.
 Market players said the euro's outlook remained uncertain
as meaningful progress on resolving the Greek crisis was
unlikely at Monday's meeting. Athens is struggling to put its
public finances in order under the EU/IMF bailout.
 ""There is clear support in the euro versus the dollar at
$1.41 after having been sold off so much over the last week and
a half, so there's a lot of bargain-hunting here,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 ""But I don't know how firm the support is.""
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 80.76 .
 The greenback fell 0.5 percent against a basket of six
major currencies to 75.348 after climbing to a six-week high of
76.001 <.DXY>. reached earlier in the day.

 NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - Signs of a slowdown in the
economic recovery weighed on stocks and oil prices on Monday,
while optimism that euro zone officials will provide more
clarity about debt aid lifted the euro.
 U.S. crude fell by almost $2 a barrel and U.S. gasoline
futures hit a seven-week low on concerns about the economic
impact of high oil prices and softening economic data.
 A sense of ""declining economic activity and a negative
impact on demand outlook"" were dragging energy prices lower

 ""I expect the European finance ministers to show solidarity
and support for Greece, especially after Merkel ..."" said
Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in
New York. He noted that kind of support should put a floor
under the euro for now.
 Euro zone finance ministers approved a three-year, 78
billion euro emergency loan program for Portugal. For details,

 The weekend arrest in New York of IMF Managing Director
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, coming just ahead of the finance
ministers' meeting about Portugal and Greece initially made
investors nervous about the approval and implementation of
rescue packages.
 The single currency rose 0.7 percent above $1.422 after
earlier falling as far as $1.4048 on trading platform EBS
, its lowest since March 30. It hit a 17-month peak of
$1.4940 less than two weeks ago.
 U.S. crude oil futures were dragged down by gasoline, which
slumped to an eight-week low. Crude futures  fell to a
low of $97.29 before bouncing back to trade around $97.95 by
1815 GMT. June Brent  fell to an intraday low of

 NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday on
optimism that a meeting of European finance ministers will
offer more clarity on euro zone debt aid after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel ruled out debt restructuring for
Greece in the short term.
 But continued concern about the strength of the global
economic recovery kept U.S. equities lower.
 The euro rose against the dollar, boosted by sovereign
demand, as Merkel said the restructuring of the debt of any
euro zone country before 2013 would be ""incredibly"" damaging to

Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in

 The weekend arrest in New York of IMF Managing Director
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, coming just ahead of a euro zone
finance ministers' meeting about an EU/IMF bailout of Portugal
and Greece's deficit reduction, initially made investors
nervous about the approval and implementation of rescue
packages.
 The single currency rose 0.6 percent near $1.422 after
earlier falling as far as $1.4048 on trading platform EBS
, its lowest since March 30. It hit a 17-month peak of
$1.4940 less than two weeks ago.
 The weaker dollar helped commodity-related stocks snap back
from a sell-off in the last session, but the S&P 500 was pulled
lower by declines in technology and consumer discretionary
shares.
 Big retail names such as Amazon.com  and Ebay
 weighed on the Nasdaq, falling over 2 percent each.
The S&P retail index <.RLX> fell 1.2 percent.

around $97.82 by 1706 GMT. June Brent  fell to an
intraday low of $112.00, down $1.83, before bouncing to $113.

strengthened, but lingering worries over slowing global
economic growth capped gains. Benchmark copper traded at $8,802

some safe-haven buying of the precious metal.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The euro traded near a seven-week
low against the dollar on Monday on doubts that a European
finance ministers' meeting would offer more clarity on euro zone
debt aid, but losses were limited with demand for the single
currency seen around the psychologically key $1.40 level.
 The euro  initially fell to $1.4048 on electronic
trading platform EBS after the arrest on sexual assault charges
of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn prompted speculation that
changes at the top of the multilateral lender may affect
discussions on aid for indebted euro zone states.
 That view added to broad risk aversion, prompting
short-covering demand for the dollar at the expense of
higher-yielding currencies including the Australian, Canadian
and New Zealand dollars.
 Equity and commodity markets also took a hit, which analysts
said was helping to support the dollar.
 The IMF moved to fill a leadership vacuum by naming No 2
official John Lipsky as acting managing director.
 Strauss-Kahn had been due to join euro zone finance
ministers on Monday to discuss the bloc's debt crisis and how to
handle Greece, which is struggling to meet the terms of a 110
billion euro European Union/IMF bailout granted last year.
 ""The peripheral euro zone problems continue to be somewhat
of an albatross for the euro and they will keep the euro bulls
at bay,"" said Paul Mackel, director of FX strategy at HSBC.
 ""These problems have been there all along but recently
they've put more of a risk premium into the euro than was the
case a few months ago.""
 Market players said the euro could stay under pressure as
meaningful progress on resolving the Greek crisis was unlikely
at Monday's meeting. Athens is struggling to put its public
finances in order under an EU/IMF bailout programme.
 Still, traders said the euro's fall met with strong demand
from Asian sovereign accounts who were still keen to buy it on
dips, while strong bids were seen towards $1.40. This helped it
to bounce back to $1.4110, close to unchanged for the day.
 The euro has fallen around 6 percent from a 17-month peak of
$1.4940 hit less than two weeks ago as peripheral debt concerns
resurfaced, but $1.40 appears to be an important support level.
 It represents its 200-week moving average, while the 100-day
moving average lies at $1.3922. Below that is the 50 percent
retracement of the euro's January to May rally, near $1.3900.
 
 EURO LONGS
 U.S. data showed speculators still had hefty long euro
positions even after trimming them and other higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian dollar last week, which
suggests chances of more liquidation of euro long positions.
[nN13251796]
 Kiran Kowshik, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas, said
the euro was vulnerable to more losses as investors continue to
shake out hefty bets for a stronger euro.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised to see a break of $1.4050 or $1.40
if general risk reduction prompts more position adjustments in
favour of the dollar,"" he said.
 Kowshik added that an ongoing, downward correction in
equities and commodities through June would also prompt more
short covering in the dollar, which could knock euro ""three or
four big figures lower than that"".
 As the euro wobbled, the greenback's index against a basket
of six major currencies hit a six-week high of 76.001 <.DXY>. It
was last close to flat for the day at 75.809.
 The euro was flat at 114.02 yen , near a two-month
low of 113.40 according to EBS, while the dollar was flat at
80.75 yen .
 A 0.7 percent fall in world stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> dented
risk appetite, knocking the Australian dollar down 0.4 percent
to $1.0532, while the U.S. dollar rose 0.9 percent against the
Canadian dollar to C$0.9770.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The arrest of IMF chief Dominique
Strauss-Kahn on charges of attempted rape added to existing
uncertainty about the euro zone debt crisis on Monday, helping
keep the euro near seven-week lows and knocking European stocks.
 Wall Street also looked set to open lower, following two
consecutive weeks of losses.
 While there was little sign that the International Monetary
Fund's overall activities would be curtailed by its managing
director's arrest, it comes almost on the eve of a series of new
talks on how to handle the euro zone crisis.
 Strauss-Kahn -- also a potential French presidential
candidate -- had been due to meet German Chancellor Angela
Merkel on Sunday and join euro zone finance ministers on Monday
to discuss the bloc's debt crisis.
 Greece, for one, is struggling to meet the terms of a 110
billion euro European Union/IMF bailout last year.
 ""This came at a really bad time for the euro as it could
delay efforts to put together a rescue package for Greece. It's
adding salt to their wounds,"" said Tsutomu Soma, manager of
foreign bonds at Okasan Securities.
 Financial markets have been jittery for months over the debt
crisis, which comes down to fears that indebted peripheral
economies will be unable to meet their obligations.
 ""The peripheral euro zone problems continue to be somewhat
of an albatross for the euro and they will keep the euro bulls
at bay,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at
HSBC.
 ""These problems have been there all along but recently
they've put more of a risk premium into the euro than was the
case a few months ago.""
 The euro fell as far as $1.4048 , its lowest since
March 30, having dropped 6 percent from a 17-month peak of
$1.4940 hit less than two weeks ago.
 It later recovered to stand flat at $1.4110.
 
 EURO SHARES SLIP
 The Strauss-Kahn affair also fed into a general mood of risk
aversion, weighing on stocks.
 European shares hit their lowest in more than a week with an
eye on the euro zone finance ministers meeting.
 As well as discussing Greece, the ministers were likely to
back a bailout package for Portugal, with new conditions set by
Finland.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.9 percent, dragged down by shares in banks, which
could suffer if any peripheral country defaults or restructures
debt.
 ""We are seeing the signs of nervousness perhaps in trying to
establish a very decisive policy framework to get the euro zone
settled,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were three
quarters of a percent lower.
 Earlier, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average <.N225> ended down
for a third straight day, losing 0.9 percent to 9,558.30, while
the broader Topix <.TOPX> shed 1.2 percent to 829.55.
 Euro zone bonds were generally steady as traders focused on
the euro zone ministers' meeting.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - Asian equities slipped and the
dollar strengthened on Monday with further gains seen as renewed
concerns of a possible euro zone debt restructuring prompted
market players to reduce risk.	
 European shares are also expected to open lower, weighed
down by the euro's weakness, according to financial spread
bettors. [ID:nLDE74F03F]	
 Having gained by more than 4 percent in less than two weeks,
the dollar extended its biggest winning streak against a
basket of currencies this year, helped by violent swings in
commodities and troubles in the euro zone.	
 The euro fell as low as $1.4063 , its lowest in six
weeks, having dropped 5.9 percent from a 17-month peak of
$1.4940 hit less than two weeks ago.	
 Cooling demand for risky trades was also evident in
commodity markets and Asian currencies, which weakened while
safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries and Japanese bonds
advanced.	
 ""Investors are risk-averse right now,"" said Jackson Wong,
vice president of Tanrich Securities in Hong Kong. ""Investors
are unwinding their dollar carry trades, and it wouldn't be
until probably next month that we see the dollar relenting.""	
 Most stock markets in the region were in the red on Monday
with Hong Kong and Jakarta leading losses as funds unwound their
positions in resource-related stocks.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was down 1.3 percent, extending a two-week
decline.	
 Japan's Nikkei was down nearly a percent with banks
among the main losers and Australia's benchmark index
fell 1.2 percent.	
 Shares in Whitehaven Coal plunged as much as 14.5
percent and were trading down 13 percent after the firm called
off a sale after a five-month auction failed to find a buyer at
the right price.[ID:nL4E7GF0BK]	
 
 COMMODITIES, ASIAN FX WEAKENS 
 While some large bids in the euro are strewn around the
$1.4050 to $1.4000 region, just below that, from $1.3900 to
$1.4000, is also an area where stop-loss orders are said to be
lurking, according to traders. [ID:nL4E7GF0CQ]	
 Even as euro zone officials scrambled to avert a fresh
precipitation of the debt crisis, an unexpected complication for
financial markets this week is the arrest on sexual assault
charges of International Monetary Fund chief Dominique
Strauss-Kahn. [ID:nN15215355]	
 A Greek official told Reuters that Strauss-Kahn's arrest
""might definitely cause some delays in the short term,"" but
would not change the IMF's policy on Greece. [ID:nN15241568]	
 A meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers, followed by an
Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers on Monday, could provide
further direction for the euro.[ID:nLDE66D1JB].	
 Weighing on the euro has also been weakness in commodities
with oil and gold softening after recent sharp volatility.	
 ""The euro had been bought only because rising commodity
prices were fueling expectations of more rate hikes in the euro
zone. With commodity prices clearly running out of steam,
there's no reason to buy the euro,"" said Daisuke Karakama,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank and a long-time euro
bear.	
 Most Asian currencies also weakened with the Malaysian
ringgit among the worst performers after central bank
chief Zeti Akhtar Aziz said the country faced rising inflation
risks.	
 China last week raised reserve requirements for banks while
Indian state-run oil firms raised domestic petrol prices,
indicating rising price pressures in the region. [ID:nL3E7GC2W4]	
 In bond markets, U.S. government bonds extended Friday's
gains as investors' preference for safety pushed 10-year yields
down to 3.16 percent from 3.23 percent on Thursday.	
 Ten-year Japanese bond yields dropped below
1.110 percent to the lowest since late November.[ID:nL4E7GG02N]	
 The dollar's strength chewed into oil's gains last week with

 LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The arrest of IMF chief Dominique
Strauss-Kahn on sexual assault charges added to existing
uncertainty about the euro zone debt crisis on Monday, initially
knocking the euro to seven-week lows and pressuring stocks.

 Financial markets have been jittery for months over the debt
crisis, which comes down to fears that indebted peripheral
economies will be unable to meet their obligations.
 ""The key is whether Greece approves its medium-term fiscal
strategy. Should that happen, Germany and the IMF will likely
come to an agreement to fill Greece's funding gap,"" said Raghav
Subbarao, currency strategist at Barclays Capital.
 The euro fell as far as $1.4048 , its lowest since

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - Asian equities are on course
for their biggest daily drop in two months and the dollar
strengthened on Monday with further gains seen as renewed
concerns of a possible euro zone debt restructuring prompted
market players to reduce risk.	
 European shares are also expected to open lower, weighed
down by the euro's weakness, according to financial spread
bettors. [ID:nLDE74F03F]	
 Having gained by more than 4 percent in less than two weeks,
the dollar extended its biggest winning streak against a
basket of currencies this year, helped by violent swings in
commodities and troubles in the euro zone.	
 The euro fell as low as $1.4063 , its lowest in six
weeks, having dropped 5.9 percent from a 17-month peak of
$1.4940 hit less than two weeks ago.	
 Cooling demand for risky trades was also evident in
commodity markets and Asian currencies, which weakened while
safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries and Japanese bonds
advanced.	
 ""Investors are risk-averse right now,"" said Jackson Wong,
vice president of Tanrich Securities in Hong Kong. ""Investors
are unwinding their dollar carry trades, and it wouldn't be
until probably next month that we see the dollar relenting.""	
 Most stock markets in the region were in the red on Monday
with Hong Kong and Jakarta leading losses as funds unwound their
positions in resource-related stocks.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was down 1.3 percent, extending a two-week
decline and set for its biggest daily drop since mid-March.	
 Japan's Nikkei was down nearly a percent with banks
among the main losers and Australia's benchmark index
fell 1.2 percent.	
 Shares in Whitehaven Coal plunged as much as 14.5
percent and were trading down 13 percent after the firm called
off a sale after a five-month auction failed to find a buyer at
the right price.[ID:nL4E7GF0BK]

 While some large bids in the euro are strewn around the
$1.4050 to $1.4000 region, just below that, from $1.3900 to
$1.4000, is also an area where stop-loss orders are said to be
lurking, according to traders. [ID:nL4E7GF0CQ]	
 Even as euro zone officials scrambled to avert a fresh
precipitation of the debt crisis, an unexpected complication for
financial markets this week is the arrest on sexual assault
charges of International Monetary Fund chief Dominique
Strauss-Kahn. [ID:nN15215355]	
 A Greek official told Reuters that Strauss-Kahn's arrest
""might definitely cause some delays in the short term,"" but
would not change the IMF's policy on Greece. [ID:nN15241568]	
 A meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers, followed by an
Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers on Monday, could provide
further direction for the euro.[ID:nLDE66D1JB].	
 Weighing on the euro has also been weakness in commodities
with oil and gold softening after recent sharp volatility.	
 ""The euro had been bought only because rising commodity
prices were fueling expectations of more rate hikes in the euro
zone. With commodity prices clearly running out of steam,
there's no reason to buy the euro,"" said Daisuke Karakama,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank and a long-time euro
bear.	
 Most Asian currencies also weakened with the Malaysian
ringgit among the worst performers after central bank
chief Zeti Akhtar Aziz said the country faced rising inflation
risks.	
 China last week raised reserve requirements for banks while
Indian state-run oil firms raised domestic petrol prices,
indicating rising price pressures in the region. [ID:nL3E7GC2W4]	
 In bond markets, U.S. government bonds extended Friday's
gains as investors' preference for safety pushed 10-year yields
down to 3.16 percent from 3.23 percent on Thursday.	
 Ten-year Japanese bond yields dropped below
1.110 percent to the lowest since late November.[ID:nL4E7GG02N]	
 The dollar's strength chewed into oil's gains last week with
U.S. crude futures  down nearly 1 percent on Monday below
$99 a barrel. [ID:nL4E7GF0B4]	
 Gold and silver also edged lower.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hovered near a
six-week high against the euro and stocks dipped on Monday as
renewed concerns of a possible euro zone debt restructuring
prompted market players to reduce risk.	
 Having gained by more than four percent in less than two
weeks, the dollar extended its biggest winning streak
against a basket of other currencies this year helped by violent
swings in commodities and troubles in the euro zone.	
 The single currency was down a fifth of a percent
from late New York trade on Friday at $1.4083, near a six-week
low of $1.4065 hit late last week on EBS.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Investors this week woke up to
the fact the Federal Reserve's easy money campaign will soon
end, yanking investments out of big-growth bets in emerging
markets, commodities and shares of small U.S. companies.
 The sell-off started last week on signs the commodities
rally was overstretched. That raised questions about the true
value of assets inflated by the Fed's bond buying program,
which concludes at the end of June.
 U.S. stocks fell on Friday and the euro slid to a six-week
low against the dollar as euro zone debt fears came back to the
fore, accelerating a flight from markets associated with
optimism about economic growth.
 After a good run, investors took what profits they could
and stowed them in safe-haven assets such as the dollar and
U.S. government bonds. The dollar <.DXY>, which has been
debased by the Fed's money printing, extended its recovery into
a second week.
 ""What's happened is people are saying, 'Let me start taking
some profits on these positions, and getting out of them,'""
said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president for capital markets
at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 The fall in U.S. stocks capped a second week of losses,
reflecting growing worries that stocks are on the precipice of
a pullback.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 100.17
points, or 0.79 percent, at 12,595.75. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 10.88 points, or 0.81 percent, at
1,337.77. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 34.57 points,
or 1.21 percent, to end at 2,828.47.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.6 percent to 344.42, having earlier hit
a more than three-week low. Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.8 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index ended down
0.4 percent. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> lost 0.3 percent.
 ""I think this is the first thrust in what's likely to be a
correction in the stock market,"" said James Dailey, a portfolio
manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. ""The epicenter of that correction is likely to be
in what's already been correcting most severely, which is the
commodity-related area.""

 GREECE RESTRUCTURING FEARS
 The euro traded down against the dollar as investors'
anxiety increased ahead of meetings of European policymakers
next week. The euro is likely to remain pressured at least
until after investors digest any outcome.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4065 on trading platform EBS,
the weakest since April 1. It was last down 0.9 percent at
$1.4111 .
 A meeting of euro zone finance ministers is to be held on
Monday, followed on Tuesday by a meeting of European Union
finance ministers. [ID:nLDE66D1JB]
 There are doubts as to whether a substantial agreement to
help Greece manage its debts will emerge from the meetings,
keeping uncertainty high over how long the country can avoid a
restructuring. Concerns about Greece have pushed the euro down
more than 5 percent from a peak near $1.4940 hit in early May.
 ""There is growing speculation that Greece will need to
restructure its debt arrangements and that will cause
significant turmoil and hardship for the euro,"" Tempus
Consulting's Salvaggio said. ""If Greece restructures, Portugal
will likely be next, Ireland shortly behind them, and then the
worst-case scenario is Spain.""
 Oil fell early as the dollar strengthened, but crude
managed to stage a rebound before the U.S. market close, helped
by short-covering ahead of the weekend.
 Brent crude  rose 85 cents to settle at $113.83 a
barrel after hitting as high as $114.92 earlier. U.S. crude
 traded up 68 cents at $99.65 a barrel.
 The strength in the dollar also hit gold. Spot gold 
fell 0.7 percent to $1,492.50 an ounce, having earlier risen as
high as $1,516.40. U.S. gold futures for June delivery 
settled down $13.20 at $1,493.60.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rose, helped by stock losses, Fed
purchases of Treasuries and relief that U.S. inflation data did
not come in above forecast.
 Investors' preference for safety helped push benchmark U.S.
10-year Treasury notes  up 12/32 in price, with
yields easing to 3.18 percent from 3.23 percent on Thursday.
 Benchmark yields remain not far above the five-month low of
3.13 percent reached last week.

 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday and
the euro slid to a six-week low against the dollar as euro zone
debt fears came back to the fore, accelerating a flight from
markets pumped up by the Federal Reserve's easy money policy.
 Investors flocked to safe-haven assets such as the dollar
and U.S. government bonds.
 The Fed's second round of bond purchases program, which is
pumping $600 billion into the economy, is due to end in June.
The cheap liquidity provided by the U.S. central bank has
stoked sharp gains in commodity, stock and emerging market
asset prices as investors seek higher yields.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the global
economy and anxiety over Europe's debt crisis pushed major
stock markets sharply lower on Friday and sent the euro to a
six-week low against the U.S. dollar.
 Investors shunned riskier assets, moving away from
commodities and higher-yielding currencies and flocking to
safe-haven assets such as the dollar and U.S. government bonds.
 Oil fell as the dollar strengthened, but crude managed to
stage a rebound before the U.S. market close, helped by
stronger-than-expected economic growth data from Germany and
France and by short-covering.
 U.S. inflation raced to a 2-1/2-year high in April as food
and gasoline prices rose, even though there was little sign of
a broader pick-up in prices. The recent volatility in commodity
prices and the looming end of the Federal Reserve's easy-money
policy further weighed on sentiment.
 ""Right now we are in risk-off mode. There is nervousness
about the global economy,"" said David Watt, senior currency
strategist at RBC capital Markets in Toronto. ""This is not just
the dollar coming back but everybody is getting a haircut.""
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.6 percent to 344.15, having hit a more
than three-week low earlier. Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.7 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 90.18 points,
or 0.71 percent, to 12,605.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> edged down 9.08 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,339.58.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 27.05 points, or 0.94
percent, to 2,836.03.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index ended down
0.4 percent. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> lost 0.2 percent.
 The euro traded down against the dollar, as investors'
anxiety increased ahead of meetings of European policy makers
next week. The euro is likely to remain pressured until at
least after investors digest any outcome.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4065 on trading platform EBS,

""Oil prices are down, equities off, and risk off,"" he said.
""With the dollar being beaten so badly, a bounce makes sense.""
 OIL VOLATILE
 Oil traded lower most of the session after Italian Foreign
Minister Franco Frattini said Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has
very likely left the capital Tripoli and has most likely been
wounded. A Libyan government spokesman denied the claim.
[ID:nLDE74C1Y5]
 Conflict in Libya, an OPEC nation, has slashed exports,
helping to send prices earlier this year to peaks that had not
been seen since 2008.
 Gains in the dollar also weighed on prices. The U.S. dollar
index, which measures the greenback against a basket of
currencies, rose 0.7 percent to 75.754 <.DXY>.
 Crude prices rebounded near the close on short-covering
ahead of the weekend. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude for June delivery  settled at $99.65 a barrel, up
68 cents, or 0.69 percent.
 Strong growth data from the euro zone helped underpin
prices, which have tumbled more than $20 over the last week.
 Germany's economy beat the most bullish forecast in a
Reuters poll to grow by 1.5 percent in the first quarter while
the French economy also grew faster than expected thanks to a
strong pick-up in business investment, expanding 1.0 percent
from the final quarter of 2010.[ID:nBZNCGE7A9][ID:nLDE74C06J]
 The rebound in the dollar also hit gold. Spot gold 
fell to $1,493.10 an ounce, having earlier risen as high as
$1,516.40. U.S. gold futures for June delivery  were down
$14 at $1,492.80.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading
9/32 higher in price to yield 3.19 percent, down from 3.23
percent late on Thursday, while 30-year bond yields 
eased to 4.33 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the global
economy and anxiety over Europe's debt crisis pushed major
stock markets sharply lower on Friday and sent the euro to a
six-week low against the U.S. dollar.
 Investors shunned riskier assets by moving away from
commodities and higher-yielding currencies and flocking to
safe-haven assets such as the dollar and U.S. government
bonds.
 The strength in the U.S. currency dragged down oil prices,
reversing earlier gains that had been fueled by
stronger-than-expected economic growth data from Germany and
France.
 U.S. inflation raced to a 2-1/2 year high in April as food
and gasoline prices rose, even though there was little sign of
a broader pick-up in prices. The recent volatility in commodity
prices and the looming end of the Federal Reserve's easy-money
policy further weighed on sentiment.
 ""Right now we are in risk off mode. There is nervousness
about the global economy,"" said David Watt, senior currency
strategist at RBC capital Markets in Toronto. ""This is not just
the dollar coming back but everybody is getting a haircut.""
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.8 percent at 343.74, having hit a more
than three-week low earlier. Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.8 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 113.57 points,
or 0.89 percent, to 12,582.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> edged down 12.04 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,336.61.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 32.55 points, or 1.13
percent, to 2,830.62.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,140 points. Emerging stocks
<.MSCIEF> lost 0.3 percent.
 The euro traded down against the dollar, as investors'
anxiety increased ahead of meetings of European policy makers
next week [ID:nLDE66D1JB]. The euro is likely to remain
pressured until at least after investors digest any outcome.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4065 on trading platform EBS,
the weakest since April 1. It last traded down 0.9 percent at
$1.4112 .
 A Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance ministers is due
to be held on Monday, followed on Tuesday by a meeting of
European Union finance ministers. [ID:nLDE66D1JB]
 There are doubts whether a substantial agreement to help
Greece manage its debts will emerge from the meetings, keeping
uncertainty high over how long the country can avoid a
restructuring. Concerns about Greece has pushed the euro down
more than 5 percent from a peak near $1.4940 hit in early May.
 ""We're getting some anxiety ahead of the weekend,"" said
Jessica Hoversen, foreign exchange and fixed income analyst at
MF Global in New York. ""It's risk off, which is unfortunately
simplistic but seems to explain the movements of all the
markets lately.""
 OIL REVERSES COURSE
 Oil erased early gains after Italian Foreign Minister
Franco Frattini said Gaddafi has very likely left the capital
Tripoli and has most likely been wounded, though a Libyan
government spokesman denied the claim. [ID:nLDE74C1Y5]
Conflict in the OPEC nation has slashed exports, helping to
send prices to peaks not seen since 2008 earlier this year.
 Gains in the dollar also weighed on prices. The U.S. dollar
index, which measures the greenback against a basket of
currencies, rose 0.4 percent to 75.535 <.DXY>.
 June Brent  last traded down 0.1 percent at $112.85
a barrel. U.S. light crude oil futures for June  lost 0.6
percent to 98.36.
 Earlier, strong growth data from the euro zone encouraged
investors to move back into oil, which has tumbled more than
$20 over the last week.
 Germany's economy beat the most bullish forecast in a
Reuters poll to grow by 1.5 percent in the first quarter while
the French economy also grew faster than expected thanks to a

fell to $1,491.40 an ounce, having earlier risen as high as
$1,516.40. U.S. gold futures for June delivery  were down
$15 to $1,491.60.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading
18/32 higher in price to yield 3.16 percent, down from 3.23

 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Major stock markets fell on
Friday after data showed U.S. inflation hit the highest level
in 2-1/2 years, while the euro slipped against the dollar as
investors refocused on Europe's debt problems ahead of meetings
by finance officials next week.
 The rise in the dollar dragged down crude oil prices,
reversing earlier gains that had been fueled by
stronger-than-expected economic growth data from Germany and
France.
 U.S. consumer prices increased 0.4 percent in April from
March after rising 0.5 percent in March. The rise, which was in
line with economists' expectations, took the year-on-year
inflation reading to 3.2 percent, the highest since October
2008. For details, see [ID:nN13186747]
 ""CPI was right in line, net benign, but people are
concerned we're still going to have to deal with inflation,""
said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New
York. ""People are going to take advantage and reallocate some
assets, build a more defensive type portfolio.""
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.6 percent to 344.39 on the day, not far
from a three-week low set on Thursday. Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.6 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 74.97
points, or 0.59 percent, to 12,619.14. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> edged down 7.88 points, or 0.60 percent, to
1,340.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 22.02 points,
or 0.76 percent, to 2,841.16.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,140.07 points. Emerging stocks
<.MSCIEF> lost 0.3 percent.
 The euro traded down against the dollar, as investors'
anxiety increased ahead of meetings that could provide further
direction to the single currency [ID:nLDE66D1JB]. The euro is
likely to remain pressured until at least after investors
digest any outcome.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.4169 , after hitting
a session low of $1.4155 on trading platform EBS, not far from
a six-week low of $1.4123 set on Thursday.
 Concerns that Greece won't repay private bondholders in
full have contributed to the currency shedding roughly 5
percent from a peak near $1.4940 hit in early May.
 A Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance ministers is due
to be held on Monday, followed on Tuesday by a meeting of

 There are doubts whether a substantial agreement to help

keeping uncertainty high over how long the country can avoid a
restructuring and making some investors reluctant to load up
too much on risky assets, analysts said.
 ""Ahead of event risk, we're getting some anxiety ahead of

 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Upbeat German and French
economic growth data and favorable European corporate earnings
on Friday drove up oil prices and pulled the euro off a
six-week low against the dollar.
 World stocks, measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> traded flat on the day, coming off a three-week
low set on Thursday.
 Germany's economy beat the most bullish forecast in a
Reuters poll to grow by 1.5 percent in the first quarter while
the French economy also grew faster than expected thanks to a
strong pick-up in business investment, expanding 1.0 percent
from the final quarter of 2010.[ID:nBZNCGE7A9][ID:nLDE74C06J]
 Strong growth data from the euro zone on Friday encouraged
investors to move back into oil, which has tumbled more than
$20 over the last week but recouped some of those losses.
 ""Very healthy numbers out of the euro zone this morning are
supporting oil and have pushed the euro (up) against the
dollar,"" said Robert Montefusco, broker at Sucden Financial.
 June Brent  last traded up 0.3 percent at $113.32 a
barrel. U.S. light crude oil futures for June  earlier
rose to a high of $100.70, before easing back to trade around
$99.13.
 The euro last traded at $1.4221 , moving away from a
six-week low set on Thursday.
 Concerns that Greece won't repay private bondholders in
full have contributed to the currency shedding roughly 5

 Wall Street edged down at the open after April U.S.
inflation rose in line with expectations, helping investors
reassess the recent volatility in the commodities market.
 U.S. consumer prices gained in April on higher food and
energy prices but continued to exhibit little sign of a broader
pick-up in inflation that would trouble the Federal Reserve.
 The Nasdaq was dragged lower by Nvidia's  financial
results and a Yahoo announcement of restructuring in a

points, or 0.33 percent, to 12,653.79. The Standard & Poor's

 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro climbed against the
dollar on Friday after strong growth data in Germany and France
bolstered expectations a healthy euro zone economy will keep
interest rates in the region higher than their U.S.
equivalents.
 A report showing U.S. consumer prices rose as expected in
April on higher food and energy prices added to the dollar's
weakness, as there was little sign of a broader pick-up in
inflation that would trouble the Federal Reserve.
[ID:nOAT004810].
 But some analysts said the euro's rebound from recent
losses could prove short-lived as concerns about debt problems
in peripheral euro zone states may outweigh rate
differentials.
 ""If the U.S. inflation number had come in worse than
expected it would have pressured the Fed but that didn't happen
and the market is a little bit short euro after the sell off in
recent days,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX
Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey.
 The euro's  session peak came after strong
first-quarter GDP data from the euro zone's biggest economies
prompted demand from Asian sovereign names, European real money
accounts and leveraged funds. [ID:nLDE74C0FI]
 The euro  was 0.2 percent higher on the day at
$1.4265 but well off the day's high at $1.4339, according to
Reuters data.
 The session peak came after the German economy grew 1.5
percent in January-March from the previous quarter, while
French GDP rose 1.0 percent. Both readings exceeded forecasts,
as did an 0.8 percent rise in the overall euro zone economy.
 ""Today's move is really a relief rally on the back of the
stronger GDP figures,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at
BTM-UFJ in London. ""But there is still divergence in the growth
performance in the (euro zone) member states.
 ""We still believe a weak euro will be required for a
solution to the euro zone's problems, and we don't think this
near-term bounce will be sustained,"" he said.
 Figures also showed Portugal entered a technical recession,
highlighting the growth gulf between countries in the region.
 EURO ZONE CONCERNS
 The German and French data helped the euro recover from
recent sharp falls triggered by talk Greece may need to
restructure its debts.
 The dollar also gave back some of the gains made in the
past week as a rout in commodity prices hurt risk appetite,
prompting unwinding of dollar-funded bets on risky assets.
 ""We've had the stronger European GDP numbers ... and it's
starting to feel like we're getting to the end of the risk
aversion trade,"" said Geoff Kendrick, currency strategist at
Nomura in London.
 Friday's euro zone GDP data added weight to the view that a
buoyant economy will add to inflation risks, making the
European Central Bank more likely to raise rates in the coming
months, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep
policy loose.
 A meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers on Monday,
followed by an Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers, could
provide further direction to the single currency.
[ID:nLDE66D1JB]
 There are doubts whether a substantial agreement to help
Greece manage its debts is likely to emerge from the meetings,
keeping uncertainty high over how long the country can avoid a
restructuring and making some investors reluctant to load up
too much on risky assets, analysts said.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent against the yen  to
115.11 yen.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent against the yen at 80.66
yen  with declines increasing after the U.S. CPI data.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen on the week
but the euro fell 0.8 percent against the dollar at current
prices.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday and
the euro firmed from a six-week low against the dollar as upbeat
German and French growth data and favourable European corporate
earnings prompted investors to buy back risky assets.
 Germany's economy beat the most bullish forecast in a
Reuters poll to grow by 1.5 percent [ID:nBZNCGE7A9] in the first
quarter while the French economy also grew faster than expected
thanks to a strong pick-up in business investment, expanding 1.0
percent from the final quarter of 2010. [ID:nLDE74C06J]
 Strong growth in the two major euro zone economies --
together they make up almost half of the region's output -- and
strong results from EADS  and Credit Agricole 
helped lift world stocks from Thursday's three-week low.
 ""It's another data point that is adding to positive
sentiment,"" said Ben Hauzenberger, fund manager at Zurich-based
Swisscanto Asset Management, which manages about 60 billion
Swiss francs ($68 billion). 
 ""I am rather optimistic for the stock market as a lot of

billion) and posted higher-than-expected first quarter earnings.
 U.S. stock futures rose 0.15 percent , pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street later.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 0.4 percent.
 Euro zone data also helped U.S. crude oil , which rose
0.9 percent to $99.91 after a volatile week when prices have

 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.4285 , moving away

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Friday after strong growth data in France and Germany
bolstered speculation that a healthy euro zone economy would
keep interest rates in the region higher than U.S. ones.
 The single currency jumped to a session high of $1.4299
after data showed German GDP surged 1.5 percent in the first
quarter from the previous three months, much more than
expectations for a 0.9 percent rise. [ID:nLDE74C0FI]
 Also providing a boost was a 1.0 percent rise in French GDP
during the same period, which also exceeded forecasts and
suggested the economic engines of the euro zone were chugging
ahead while weaker member nations struggle to grow.
 Investors took the strong figures as a cue to pick up the
euro, which has fallen sharply in the past week or so as
commodity markets have sold off and speculation simmers that
Greece may need to restructure its massive debts.
 Analysts said the GDP data would offer some support to the
single currency, but added that technical levels and sluggish
growth readings from the region's weaker members due later in
the day could cap gains.
 ""The data shows the core euro zone is still growing, so the
euro will get further support,"" said Marcus Hettinger, global FX
strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 ""But we need to wait for figures from Greece, which could
pose some downside risk for the euro.""
 At 0745 GMT, the euro  traded 0.4 percent higher on
the day at $1.4287, boosted by demand from Asian sovereign names
and leveraged funds.
 It broke above resistance at $1.4270, its 55-day moving
average, but technical analysts said a decisive break above that
level would be needed for the euro to secure more near-term
gains.
 Gains for the euro helped put the dollar under broad selling
pressure, with the U.S. currency falling 0.4 percent against a
currency basket to 74.982.
 The dollar  slipped half a percent on the day to 80.50
yen, while the Australian dollar  edged up 0.2 percent
to $1.0690.
 
 EURO RISKS
 The U.S. currency relinquished some gains made in the past
week or so as a recent rout in commodities such as silver 
and oil  has hurt risk appetite and prompted traders to
brace for the possibility of further unwinding of dollar-funded
bets on risky assets.
 Friday's GDP data supported the euro as it fuelled market
expectations that the European Central Bank may raise interest
rates in coming months, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve seems
committed to keep borrowing costs near zero.
 But analysts pointed out the euro faced downside risks next
week, as Eurogroup finance ministers are due to meet on Monday,
followed on Tuesday by an Ecofin meeting of European Union
finance ministers. [ID:nLDE66D1JB]
 There are doubts whether a substantial agreement to help
Greece manage its debts is likely to emerge from such meetings
of euro zone finance ministers, keeping uncertainty high over
how long Greece can avoid a restructuring.

 HONG KONG, May 13 (Reuters) - Most Asian equity markets edged higher, but are headed for
their second week of losses as volatile commodities kept bargain-hungry investors on the
backfoot while the euro may head lower ahead of a key meeting on Greece next week.	
 Japan's Nikkei led declines, falling 0.7 percent, weighed down by losses in banks,
after a top government spokesman said they may be asked to ease the financial burden faced by
Tokyo Electric Power Co in the aftermath of Japan's triple natural
disaster.[ID:nL3E7GD0EO]	
 Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) , Mizuho and MUFG
were down between 2.5-3 percent after Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano's comments.	
 While commodities like copper, silver and corn stabilised after choppy trading overnight,
traders were hesitant to take big bets before the weekend after two precipitous routs in the
commodity markets in the past week and China's latest round of policy tightening.
[ID:nL3E7GC0BB]	
 ""The market has become increasingly more cautious and investors are increasingly more
uncertain about growth ex (excluding) the resources sector,"" said Shaw Stockbroking senior
dealer Jamie Spiteri.	
 
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3 percent. For
the week it is set to fall nearly 0.5 percent. 
 Notwithstanding the high volatility in commodities and the troubles in the euro zone,
emerging market assets have performed solidly of late, though further gains may be hard fought
from these levels, Barclays Capital strategists said in a note. 
 Overnight, China Resources priced a $750 million bond, bringing the year to date, hard

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 13 (Reuters) - Asian equities are poised for
their second consecutive week of losses as volatile commodities
kept bargain-hungry investors on the backfoot while the euro's
weakness may snowball before a meeting next week.	
 Copper, corn and the broader Reuters/Jefferies CRB index
-- a broad measure of commodity performance -- posted
small gains while U.S. crude prices fell more than a dollar,
sliding further below $100 a barrel on concerns over global oil
demand as U.S. drivers face rising pump prices.	
 ""The market has become increasingly more cautious
and investors are increasingly more uncertain about growth ex
(excluding) the resources sector,"" said Shaw Stockbroking senior
dealer Jamie Spiteri.	
 Japan's Nikkei was down 0.2 percent after opening
slightly higher with the yen's strength holding back equity
gains while Australia's index also turned lower after
beginning higher.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was down 0.1 percent. For the week it is set to
fall nearly a percent. 
 Notwithstanding the high volatility in commodities and the
troubles in the euro zone, emerging market assets have performed
solidly of late, though further gains may be hard fought from
these levels, Barclays Capital strategists said in a note. 
 Overnight, China Resources priced a $750 million bond,
bringing the year to date, hard currency, primary market
offerings from Asia ex-Japan to $42.3 billion. 
 The weekly average so far this year is $2.2 billion,
compared with 2010's $1.6 billion.	
 Inflows into emerging markets bond funds remain strong, with
a rise of 40 percent in the week to May 11, a report from ING
said. Hard currency bonds received $161 million of new
investment while high yield bond funds received $491 million.

 DOLLAR UP	
 On a weekly basis, the dollar index , which measures
the dollar's value against a basket of currencies, is set to
rise for the second consecutive week, the first time this year.	
 The euro dipped 0.4 percent on hedge fund selling
before recovering slightly to 1.4205, within sight of a six-week
low hit overnight, with lingering fears about Greece's debt
problems acting like a weight around the euro's neck.	
 Nevertheless, the European Central Bank's April interest
rate rise was ""certainly not"" a one-off move as inflation risks
in the euro zone have increased and price pressures are
building, ECB policymaker Luc Coene said. [ID:nLDE74B0PZ]	
 Doubts over whether a substantial agreement on Greece would
emerge from meetings of euro zone finance ministers next week
have pushed the euro down by nearly five percent from an early
May high. [ID:nLDE66D1JB]	
 The Korean won led losses in Asia after Seoul's
surprising decision to hold interest rates triggered a fresh
round of dollar buying. Traders were hesitant to take big bets
before the weekend after two precipitous routs in the commodity
markets in the past week and China's latest round of policy
tightening. [ID:nL3E7GC0BB]	
 After market hours on Thursday, China lifted bank reserve
requirement ratios by 50 basis points, its eighth increase since
last October, forcing main Chinese banks to withhold more money
from the economy in a bid to cool inflation
pressures.[ID:nL3E7GC2W4]	
 A late rally in equities dealt another blow to safe-haven
assets such as U.S. government bonds, which were already hurt by
a lackluster 30-year Treasury bond auction. 
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes eased slightly,
though yields held near 3.22 percent compared to 3.16 percent on
Wednesday and 3.13 percent last week.	
 U.S. crude for June delivery was down more than a dollar to
$97.92 a barrel  before pulling back slightly while gold
prices crept higher, building on overnight gains.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on
Thursday after a broad sell-off in commodities dissipated while
oil prices snapped back from earlier losses as the U.S. dollar
weakened.
 Defensive shares led a rebound on Wall Street as investors
weighed mixed economic signals and rising volatility in
commodities markets for further direction. For details see:
[ID:nN12288714]
 The Dow fell nearly 100 points early in the session but
late rose as a lackluster auction of 30-year U.S. government
bonds and headlines suggesting an improving outlook for talks
over boosting the U.S. debt ceiling brought buyers back.
 The White House and Congress intensified negotiations for a
deficit-reduction deal. [ID:nN12252437]
 ""The volatility has scared a lot of people away, so I think
a lot of investors are sitting back and saying, 'Where can I
put my money?' and the stock market is that,"" said Channing
Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 65.89
points, or 0.52 percent, at 12,695.92. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 6.57 points, or 0.49 percent, at
1,348.65. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 17.98
points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,863.04.
 Oil prices also seesawed through much of the session as
traders tested whether a deep sell-off in commodities beginning
last week might be nearing an end.
 In London, Brent crude for June delivery  settled up
41 cents to $112.98 a barrel, while U.S. June crude 
settled up 76 cents to $98.97.
 Earlier losses were triggered after the International
Energy Agency cut its global demand forecast and China
tightened another notch its bank reserve requirements.

 The euro, which edged off a six-week low against the
dollar, rose as investors shrugged off worries about Greece and
focused on higher interest rates in the euro zone.
[ID:nN12125567]
 Expectations of rising rates in the euro zone as the
Federal Reserve remains committed to keeping borrowing costs
near zero have pushed the euro up to almost $1.50. But the
currency pulled back lately after the European Central Bank
dented hopes of a rate hike next month.
 ECB policy maker Luc Coene told Reuters on Thursday that
inflation risks in the euro zone have increased and price
pressures are building. [ID:nLDE74B0PZ]
 ""Certainly the market is fixated on interest rate

give the euro a boost,"" said Gareth Sylvester, senior currency

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher from a
six-week low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as investors
shrugged off worries about Greece and refocused attention on
higher interest rates in the euro zone.
 The European Central Bank's April interest rate rise was
""certainly not"" a one-off as inflation risks in the euro zone
have increased and price pressures are building, ECB
policymaker Luc Coene said on Thursday. [ID:nLDE74B0PZ]
 Expectations of rising rates in the euro zone even as the
Federal Reserve remains committed to keeping borrowing costs
near zero have pushed the euro up near $1.50. But the currency
has pulled back lately after the European Central Bank dented
hopes of a rate hike next month.
 ""Certainly the market is fixated on interest rate
expectations and talk of a potential interest rate hike could
give the euro a boost,"" said Gareth Sylvester, senior currency
strategist at San Francisco-based Klarity FX.
 The ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25
percent in April to address firming price pressures, ending two
years of crisis-induced loose policy. Financial markets expect
two more such rises this year.
 The euro was last up 0.3 percent at $1.4239 , after
rising to a session peak of $1.4277 on trading platform EBS. It
earlier hit a session low of $1.4123, the weakest level since
April 1.
 Traders noted euro buying from sovereign accounts in the
$1.41 area. Offers are now seen around $1.4280.
 Analysts said the single currency was likely to remain
under pressure from euro zone periphery woes. Speculation over
whether Greece will receive more bailout funding kept risk
appetite volatile as investors continued to price in a high
probability that the country will eventually need to
restructure its debt.
 ""If uncertainty is lifted behind what's going on with
Greece, people will likely refocus attention on inflation, the
ECB's potential for rate normalization and the Fed's likely
status quo of remaining on the sidelines for at least the next
six months to a year,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist
at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 The euro earlier fell to 114.16 yen, its lowest since March
24 , before rebounding to 115.23 yen, up 0.1 percent.
 Part of the euro's turnaround came after U.S. economic
reports sent mixed signals.
 The U.S. economy struggled to gain momentum early in the
second quarter, with retail sales posting their smallest rise
in nine months in April and wholesale prices increasing more
than expected. [ID:nN12296928]
 Other data on Thursday showed new claims for unemployment
benefits fell 44,000 last week to 434,000, but they remained
too high to signal a strong labor market recovery.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of currencies, <.DXY> rose as high as 75.645, its
strongest in more than three weeks, taking it well above a
three-year low touched only last week, before surrendering
gains to trade at 75.174, down 0.2 percent.
 Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 80.89
.
 Among commodity-linked currencies, the Australian dollar
 fell to a one-week low after surprisingly weak
Australian jobs data reduced market expectations of a rate
hike. [ID:nL3E7GC01L]
 The Australian dollar and other commodity currencies did
not react to China's move to increase reserve requirement
ratios, although analysts warned this could add to the risk-off
attitude in markets. [ID:nL3E7GC287]

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Oil and stocks rebounded on
Thursday after President Barack Obama and Senate Republicans
agreed on the need to raise the level of the U.S. debt
ceiling.
 The White House and Congress intensified negotiations for a
deficit-reduction deal as major U.S. corporations clamored for
lower tax rates they said would increase their global
competitiveness. For details see: [ID:nN12252437]
 Oil prices had seesawed earlier in the session as traders
tested whether a deep sell-off in commodities beginning last
week could be nearing an end.
 A weaker U.S. dollar helped crude oil snap back from
earlier losses that were triggered after the International
Energy Agency cut its global demand forecast and China
tightened another notch its bank reserve requirements.
[ID:nL3E7GC0JC].
 In London, Brent crude for June delivery  was up
$1.04 at $113.62 a barrel, while U.S. June crude  rose
$1.67 cents at $99.88.
 Concern about slower economic growth in China and Europe
had pressured commodity prices earlier in the session,
prompting investors to sell stocks and other risky assets.
 ""The dollar came under pressure and the stock market looked
like it started to pare losses and we seem to have digested the
China reserve requirement hike,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst,
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The euro bounced off a six-week low against the dollar
after a policy maker at the European Central Bank said April's
interest rate rise was ""certainly not"" a one-off.
 ECB policy-maker Luc Coene told Reuters that inflation
risks in the euro zone have increased and price pressures are
building. For details, see [ID:nLDE74B0PZ]
 The ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25
percent in April to address the firming price pressures, ending
two years of crisis-induced loose policy. Financial markets
expect two more such rises this year.
 U.S. stocks erased early losses in a volatile session as
fluctuating commodity prices kept the market churning while the
agreement by lawmakers on the need to raise the debt ceiling
showed progress on an important issue for markets.
 Commodities rebounded after U.S. data showed a decline in
jobless benefit claims last week and a revision to retail sales
data suggested consumer spending in the first quarter might
have been stronger than initially thought. [ID:nN12292551].
 ""What longer term investors have to be wary of here is that
is very hot money. If it does come back in it is not likely to
stay for long and the fundamentals of supply and demand do
matter,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris
Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 58.58
points, or 0.46 percent, at 12,688.61. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 5.95 points, or 0.44 percent, at
1,348.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 14.95

 Since the results, Treasuries have traded lower. In cash
trade, 30-year Treasury bonds  were down 1 point
with yields rising to 4.36 percent.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices rebounded on
Thursday, spurring relief across markets that a deep sell-off
in commodities could be nearing an end and pulling riskier
investments such as stocks off earlier lows.
 The euro bounced off a six-week low against the dollar on
as an ECB policy maker said April's interest rate rise was
""certainly not"" a one-off.
 After suffering a steep fall, commodity prices later pared
losses as oil briefly turned positive, and stocks on Wall
Street also turned, hovering near break-even, and the Nasdaq
tipped into positive territory.
 ""Commodities have had a great run in here -- we are just
going to get some volatility going forward both in the up
direction and down direction,"" said Wayne Schmidt, chief
investment officer at Gradient Investments In St. Paul,
Minnesota.
 ""This is kind of the way going forward where we have some
price declines in commodities that take the market down with
it,"" Schmidt said.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities, had hit 3-1/2-month lows earlier as prices of
raw materials fell sharply for a second straight session.
 China raised bank reserve requirements once again to keep
inflation in check amid signs of a slowing economy, while data
showed euro zone industrial production fell unexpectedly in
March, suggesting regional growth in the first quarter was less
than expected. For details see:[ID:nL3E7GC2W4][ID:nLDE74B11S].
 The U.S. economy also struggled to gain momentum early in
the second quarter, with retail sales posting their smallest
rise in nine months in April and wholesale prices increasing
more than expected. [ID:nN12296928]
 EURO GAINS AGAIN ON RATE OUTLOOK
 The euro reversed earlier losses against the dollar after
European Central Bank policymaker Luc Coene told Reuters that
inflation risks in the euro zone have increased and price
pressures are building [ID:nLDE74B0PZ].
 The dollar index earlier had scaled a three-week high as a
sell-off in commodities prompted an unwinding of dollar-funded
bets on risky assets, the same reversal that pushed the euro to
its multi week low against the greenback.
""Certainly the market is fixated on interest rate
expectations and talk of a potential interest rate hike could
give the euro a boost,"" said Gareth Sylvester, senior currency
strategist at San Francisco-based Klarity FX.
 The euro was last up 0.3 percent against the dollar at
$1.4240 , near the session peak of $1.4259, and well off
the session low of $1.4121.
 But analysts emphasized the single currency remained under
pressure from euro zone periphery woes, as concerns increased
that Greece's debt burden may be unsustainable. The euro fell
to its lowest since March 24 against the yen in earlier trade
.
 Crude oil, priced in dollars, fell almost 1.0 percent at
one point, while gold and silver fell sharply for a second day
and copper prices sagged to a five-month low as last week's
slump in commodity prices resumed.
 Investors sold stocks worldwide. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> declined 0.8 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 18.46
points, or 0.15 percent, at 12,611.57. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 0.58 points, or 0.04 percent, at
1,341.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.94
points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,849.00.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
regional shares was down 1.1 percent.
 The commodities slump is ""front and center"" among drivers
of the equities market, said Rick Meckler, president of
LibertyView Capital Management in New York.
 ""Watching commodities' volatility increase is just making
people aware the potential exists for equity volatility to pick
up in a similar fashion,"" Meckler said.
 Silver  fell 7.6 percent to $32.80 an ounce, hitting
its weakest since late February. Gold  slipped 0.3
percent to $1,495.30 per ounce.
 Oil prices reversed course.
 Brent crude  rose 0.85 percent to $113.53 per
barrel, according to Reuters data. U.S. crude  rose 0.66
percent to $98.86.

 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Concern about slower economic
growth in China and Europe pressured commodity prices again on
Thursday, prompting investors to dump stocks and risky assets
in favor of U.S. Treasury bonds and the U.S. dollar.
 China raised bank reserve requirements another time to keep
inflation in check amid signs of a slowing economy, while data
showed euro zone industrial production fell unexpectedly in
March, suggesting regional growth in the first quarter was less
than expected. For details see:[ID:nL3E7GC2W4][ID:nLDE74B11S].
 The U.S. economy also struggled to gain momentum early in
the second quarter, with retail sales posting their smallest
rise in nine months in April and wholesale prices increasing
more than expected. [ID:nN12296928]
 Persistent speculation about a possible Greek debt
restructuring also caused investors to pare their holdings of
higher-risk assets and pressured the euro for a second day,
providing a boost for the U.S. dollar.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> was up 0.04 percent at 75.356,
while the euro  was up 0.03 percent at $1.4199.
 Crude oil, priced in dollars, fell almost 1.0 percent at
one point, while gold and silver fell sharply for a second day
and copper prices sagged to a five-month low as last week's
slump in commodity prices resumed.
 Investors sold stocks worldwide. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> declined 0.8 percent.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 49.23 points, or 0.39 percent, at 12,580.80. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 5.19 points, or 0.39
percent, at 1,336.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 6.71 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,838.35.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
regional shares was down 1.1 percent.
 The commodities slump is ""front and center"" among drivers
of the equities market, said Rick Meckler, president of
LibertyView Capital Management in New York.
 ""Watching commodities' volatility increase is just making
people aware the potential exists for equity volatility to pick
up in a similar fashion,"" Meckler said.
 Nervous investors piled into low-risk government debt and
the dollar <.DXY>, which at one point in the session rose to a
three-week high versus a currency basket and six-week high
versus to euro .
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 6/32 in
price to yield 4.31 percent.
 U.S. DOLLAR RISES
 Some analysts expect the latest bout of risk aversion will
prompt investors to continue unwinding carry trades in which
they borrowed dollars to buy higher-yielding assets. This could
offer more support to the dollar in the near term, they added.
 ""We're seeing an unwinding of dollar carry trades and we
could be set for a round of dollar strength,"" said Michael
Hewson, currency strategist at CMC Markets in London.
 The retrenchment in carry trades has been most damaging to
the commodity complex.
 Silver  fell 7.6 percent to $32.80 an ounce, hitting
its weakest since late February. Gold  slipped 1 percent
to $1,483.50 per ounce.
 Copper  was last down 0.9 percent at $8,626.50 after
falling to $8,504.50, its weakest since early December.
 Oil prices stayed under pressure in the wake of a surprise
rise in U.S. gasoline inventories.
 Brent crude  fell 1.3 percent to $111.70 per barrel,
extending the previous day's fall of more than 4 percent,
according to Reuters data. U.S. crude  fell 1.8 percent
to $96.40, adding to its 5 percent tumble on Wednesday.

 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Concern about slower economic
growth in China and Europe pressured commodity prices again on
Thursday, prompting investors to dump stocks and risky assets
in favor of bonds and the U.S. dollar.
 China lifted bank reserve requirements again on Thursday to
try to rein in inflation even after signs its economy was

 By Jessica Mortimer and Anna Yukhananov
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - The dollar index scaled a
three-week high on Thursday as a rout in commodities prompted an
unwinding of dollar-funded bets on risky assets, a sell-off that
dragged the euro to a six-week low versus the greenback.
 The euro  fell as low as $1.41230, breaking below a
key level at $1.4150, which technical analysts said leaves open
the prospect of further falls towards $1.40. However, traders
said bids above $1.4100 could limit falls for now. Near term
support is seen near its April 1 low of around $1.4060.
 The single currency was also weighed by euro zone periphery
woes, as concerns increased that Greece's debt burden may be
unsustainable. The euro also hit a six-week low against the yen.
 The Australian dollar and other commodity currencies did not
react to China's move to increase reserve ratios, although
analysts warned this could add to the risk-off attitude in
markets. [ID:nL3E7GC287]
 Steep losses in commodity prices -- with silver 
tumbling more than 7 percent and oil down around 2.3 percent
after falling overnight -- as well as weak equities encouraged
traders to cut exposure to riskier currencies.
""The underlying reason for the dollar rally is a shift in
market sentiment, which started with the headlines on Greece
last week,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.
""This has led to an unwinding of previously held positions in
commodities and longs in the euro.""
 ""And more uncertainty about the euro zone periphery, the
looming prospect of less central bank accommodation as well as
worries about inflation all paint a less benign picture for
risky assets going forward,"" he added.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose as high as 75.645, its
strongest in more than three weeks, taking it well above a
three-year low of 72.696 hit only last week.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX ON THE RISE
 Chartists said the dollar index could target 77, a 50
percent retracement of its decline from Jan. 12 to May 2. Before
that, a 38.2 percent retracement sits just under 76.
 A broad recovery in the dollar also pushed it to a one-week
high against the yen of 81.35 yen  before it slipped back
to trade at 80.90 yen. The dollar was also near a three-week
high against the Swiss franc at 0.8882 francs .
 The euro was last down 0.3 percent against the dollar at
$1.4162, while against the yen, the common currency 
fell as low as 114.178 yen, its weakest since March 24.
 ""Loss of risk appetite is also hitting the euro. A lot of
people had got very long of euros on the back of expectations
for higher euro zone rates,"" said Michael Hewson, currency
strategist at CMC Markets.
 Some analysts pointed to a strengthening correlation between
silver prices and the euro which could mean further falls in
silver would be a warning sign for a further downward correction
in the shared currency.
 Speculation over whether Greece will receive more bailout
funding kept risk appetite volatile as investors continued to
price in a high probability that the country will eventually
need to restructure its debt.
 Among commodity-linked currencies, the Australian dollar
 was particularly weak, tumbling more than 1 percent to
a one-week low of $1.0568 after surprisingly weak Australian
jobs data reduced market expectations of a rate hike.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Silver prices tumbled 7 percent
on Thursday as concerns that a weaker global outlook may quell
demand for natural resources deepened a commodities sell off and
prompted investors to purge risky assets in favour of the
dollar.
 London Brent crude extended the previous day's big losses
while copper plumbed a five-month low, and the ongoing sell-off
in commodities stung European mining and energy shares, pushing
the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> down 1.3 percent.
 Silver and European shares both fell below their 100-day
moving averages, which had been seen as key technical support
levels, opening the door to further selling.
 U.S. stock futures  slipped 0.6 percent, suggesting
U.S. bourses may fall later in the day.
 Gold and oil prices relinquished early gains made in Asia,
as investors remain worried about the extent to which the
Chinese economy may cool even as inflation remains high.
 China increased its reserve requirement ratio for commercial
banks for the eighth time since October on Thursday, extending
its campaign to calm prices, though the market largely ignored
the move. [ID:nL3E7GC287]
 Concern over a slowdown in Chinese may affect demand for
natural resources in the world's No. 2 economy, weighing on
commodity markets, which looked set to extend a second big rout
in less than a week.
 ""The slowdown we have seen in a wide range of economic
indicators suggests there is concern among investors about the
continued strength of the commodity complex,"" said Jeremy
Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley.
 Persistent speculation about a possible Greek debt
restructuring also cut demand for higher-risk assets and pushed
the dollar -- whose vast liquidity makes it a popular choice
with investors during periods of uncertainty -- to a three-week
high versus a currency basket.
 A sharp reversal in commodities in Europe served as a
reminder of markets' vulnerability to hefty losses -- oil fell
more than 5 percent on Wednesday -- which will likely steer
investors further away from higher-risk assets.
 German government bonds benefited from this view, as Bund
futures  rose 49 ticks, but gains were limited after
Irish and Portuguese debt rallied after Finland backed a bailout
package for Lisbon.
 
 DOLLAR RISES
 Silver  fell 7 percent to $32.60 per ounce, adding to
its 9 percent tumble the previous day and hitting its weakest
since late February. Gold  slipped 1 percent to $1,483.50
per ounce.
 Roughly 3 percent losses in the shares of mining
heavyweights including Anglo American , BHP Billiton
 and Rio Tinto and  led European shares lower,
while the MSCI's world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1
percent.
 It extended the previous day's losses and pulled further
away from a three-year high hit last week, approaching key
support at its 55-day moving average.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> fell
0.8 percent.
 Oil prices stayed under pressure in the wake of a surprise
rise in U.S. gasoline inventories.
 Brent crude  fell 1.6 percent to $110.70 per barrel,
extending the previous day's fall of more than 4 percent,
according to Reuters data. U.S. crude  fell 2.2 percent,
adding to its 5 percent tumble on Wednesday.
 Copper  fell 2 percent to $8,504.50, its weakest
since early December.
 Investors dumped commodities and other higher-yielding
assets for dollars, pushing the dollar index <.DXY> up roughly
half a percent to 75.645, its highest since mid-April.
 Risk aversion stung the euro , which hit its weakest
against the dollar in nearly six weeks.
 Some analysts expect the latest bout of risk aversion will
prompt investors to continue unwinding carry trades in which
they borrowed dollars to buy higher-yielding assets. This could
offer more support to the dollar in the near term, they added.
 ""We're seeing an unwinding of dollar carry trades and we
could be set for a round of dollar strength,"" said Michael
Hewson, currency strategist at CMC Markets.
 ""Risk appetite is also hitting the euro. A lot of people had
got very long on euros on the back of expectations for higher
euro zone rates.""
 Analysts added that increasing speculation that Greece's
debt problems could spin out of control highlighted ongoing
fiscal issues in the euro zone, which could bruise the euro.

 MELBOURNE, May 12 (Reuters) - Asian share markets tumbled on
Thursday after a second big sell-off in commodities in less than
a week curbed investor appetite for riskier investments and
boosted the U.S. dollar, while a short-lived recovery in oil
prices was wiped out in late trade.	
 Global markets have been regaining ground since a
near-record fall in commodities last week, but remain skittish
as investors mull issues ranging from a possible Greek debt
restructure to the extent of a cooling economy in China as it
tackles inflation.	
 ""It is my judgment that the Chinese economy is slowing down
more than people realise,"" Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said at a news briefing in Hong Kong.
O'Neill, known for coining the term BRIC economies, added that
by contrast there were no real signals of a U.S. slowdown.	
 Weaker-than-expected growth data from China and an
unexpected rise in gasoline stocks saw oil prices tumble more
than 4 percent on Wednesday, triggering a rout across the
commodities complex that pushed the Reuters/Jeffries CRB index
, a broad measure of commodities performance, down 3
percent.	
 Oil prices initially recovered ground on Thursday as
investors in Asia focused on strong demand growth. U.S. crude
futures  rose more than $1 but eased back in late trade to
be flat around $98.18. Brent crude turned slightly negative at
$112.42. U.S. oil prices are down more than 13 percent on last
Monday's close.	
 China's weaker-than-expected industrial output data led some
investors to worry about a sharp slowdown and reduced demand for
commodities, while others felt it would ease the need for
further aggressive tightening.	
 European stocks were set to fall on Thursday, trimming gains
made in the past two sessions as a renewed retreat in
commodities was seen hurting shares of heavyweight mining firms.	
 Investor sentiment was also hurt by Cisco's warning
that it will fare worse this quarter than analysts had feared,
and unveiled plans for global job cuts as the group struggles to
revive growth. [ID:nN11260314] 
 ""Markets are worried about high commodity prices, higher
inflation, lower consumer spending power, rising interest rates
and potential downward GDP growth forecasts especially for
Japan, the euro zone and the UK in the near future, while QE2 is
coming to an end,"" said Derek Lawless, head of WorldSpread
France.	
 
 SHARES FALL	
 Energy and resource stocks led Asian share markets lower
with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 down 1.5 percent by
0600 GMT. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 1.6 percent to
a six-week low, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.1
percent, while MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 1.8 percent.	
 Miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto fell
more than 2 percent in Australia, while Japan's biggest oil and
gas developer Inpex Corp fell 3.6 percent. 
 Shanghai copper fell as much as 2 percent on Thursday after
London copper hit its lowest level since December.	
 Bucking the trend, Toyota Motor Corp jumped 3.0
percent after saying that output would begin recovering as much
as two months earlier than it had expected as parts makers come
back on line, offsetting poor quarterly earnings.	
 
 DOLLAR GAINS	
 The euro was steady in Asia after falling to a
six-week low against the yen and a three-week low versus the
U.S. dollar on further speculation that Greece will eventually
need to restruture its debt.	
 The broader safe-haven recovery in the dollar was reflected
in its rise against a basket of currencies from a
three-year low hit last week. The dollar held steady in Asia
around 75.3.	
 ""People have been doing dollar-carry trades and yen-carry
trades based on a moderate recovery in the global economy. That
money is now flowing back,"" said Makoto Noji, a senior
strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. 
 Already hurt by a sell-off in commodity linked currencies,
the Australian dollar tumbled more than 1 percent to a one-week
low after surprisingly weak Australian jobs data reduced market
expectations of a rate hike. 
 Gold pared early gains to be flat in late Asian trade
around $1,499.65, while volatile spot silver eased
slightly to add to a loss of nearly 9 percent in the previous
session, despite earlier gaining more than 2 percent.	
 Analysts said signs of a slowdown in China were bearish for
precious metals, while other factors supporting the market were
also receding, including unrest in the Middle East, high oil
prices and dollar weakness.	
 U.S. corn futures were flat after a 4 percent plunge
on the expectation of higher near-term stocks due to reduced
export demand, while wheat was also steady.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped but held near a
three-week high against a basket of currencies on Thursday as a
rout in commodities and an uncertain outcome on Greece's debt
problems lowered risk appetite and prompted traders to expect
more unwinding of dollar-funded bets on risk assets, with its
break above a trendline pointing to the chance of more gains.
 The euro, bruised by concern that the problems in Greece
could spin out of control despite policymakers' efforts to
support it, hovered just above a three-week low against the
dollar after having broken below its 55-day moving average, and
touched a 1-½ month low against the pound.
 Adding momentum to a sell-off in commodity-linked
currencies, the Australian dollar tumbled more than 1 percent to
a one-week low after surprisingly weak Australian jobs data
reduced market expectations of a rate hike.
 The decline in the euro and the Aussie dollar also reflected
a broader recovery in the U.S. dollar, with its index against a
basket of currencies having shot up to a three-week high on
Wednesday, and more importantly breaking above a trendline that
has capped it during its relentless fall since the beginning of
this year.
 ""It has broken above a trendline that has lasted for four
months. So you'd think the adjustment will be quite big,"" said
Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse.
 The index <.DXY>, which has risen about 3.5 percent from a
three-year low of 72.696 hit last week, last stood at 75.26,
down 0.1 percent on the day but still holding near a three-week
high of 75.419 struck on Wednesday.
 Fukaya said it could target 77, a 50 percent retracement of
its decline since January. Before that, a 38.2 percent
retracement sits just under 76.
 ""People have been doing dollar-carry trades and yen-carry
trades based on a moderate recovery in the global economy. That
money is now flowing back,"" said Makoto Noji, a senior
strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
 Such trade had been popular because many market players bet
that a moderate recovery in the global economy, led by red-hot
growth in emerging economies, would boost demand for oil and
other commodities while the Federal Reserve, concerned by still
high unemployment, is likely to keep U.S. interest rates near
zero for the near term, allowing speculators to borrow at little
cost to fund their positions.
 OIL'S SLIDE
 But oil prices tumbled over 4 percent on Wednesday after an
unexpected rise in gasoline stocks amid slowing demand sent
prices into a tailspin, fuelling the second big commodities
sell-off in a week.
 ""Oil prices had risen from around $80-90 after revolutions
in the Middle East raised worries about oil supply. If you think
the situation there is stabilising, you could argue that oil
could fall back to levels from before that. That would mean more
upside for the dollar,"" said Credit Suisse's Fukaya.
 The euro traded at $1.4218 , up 0.2 percent on the day
after having fallen to $1.4172 on Wednesday, its lowest in three
weeks.
 Sporadic buying set in after the euro had bounced off major
support levels around $1.4150 -- near the mid-April low and a
38.2 percent retracement of the January-May rise to around
$1.4145. There could be more bargain-hunting bids just above the
top of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart, at $1.4118.
 The euro also rebounded from a six-week low of 114.56 yen on
Wednesday to fetch 115.45 yen , rising 0.4 percent on
the day.
 The euro rose 0.1 percent against sterling to 0.8689 pound
, having dipped to 0.86735 pound earlier on Thursday,
the euro's lowest since late March. Sterling was supported after
the Bank of England raised its inflation forecasts, leading
markets to bring forward the possible timing of an interest rate
hike.
 The euro's outlook remained murky as speculation over
whether Greece will receive more bailout funding kept risk
appetite volatile as investors continued to price in a high
probability that the country will eventually need to restructure
its debt.
 While many in financial markets tend to view the debt mess
in Greece and other peripheral euro zone countries as being
contained and unlikely to hurt the euro zone's bigger economies,
some analysts say investors should not underestimate the impact
because falls in Greek, Irish and Portuguese bond prices are
causing sharp losses to European banks and could hit the
financial system.
 ""Remember that 80 years ago, Austria's Creditanstalt went
down. Although people thought the impact of a bank failure in a
small European country would not be big, it affected other
countries and snowballed into a financial crisis on a global
scale. You shouldn't think that the current debt problems are
peripheral,"" said Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo
Securities.
 A broad recovery in the dollar also pushed the U.S. currency
to a one-week high against the yen. The dollar rose as high as
81.35 yen .
 The Australian dollar fell as low as $1.0585 , down
nearly 4 percent from a 29-year peak hit last week. After paring
some of its losses, the Australian dollar last stood at $1.0638,
down 0.6 percent on the day.

Thursday after a second big sell-off in commodities in less than
a week sparked a retreat from riskier investments, including
stocks, although oil and silver managed to claw back some of
their losses.	
 Oil prices tumbled over 4 percent on Wednesday after an
unexpected rise in gasoline stocks and concerns about slowing
demand triggered a rout across the commodities complex that
pushed the Reuters/Jeffries CRB index , a broad measure of
commodities performance, down 3 percent. 
 Silver fell 8 percent, dragging down gold. Copper crumbled

a three-week low versus the dollar, hurt also by bubbling

 Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was trading down 0.8

 Miners such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto
led the decline in Australia, while Japan's biggest oil and gas
developer Inpex Corp fell 3.0 percent.	
 The abrupt fall in commodity prices after last week's
near-record slump knocked about 1 percent off U.S. stock
indices, and boosted the U.S. dollar on safe-haven buying.	
 The euro fell back to a six-week low against the yen and was
little changed in early Asian trade, holding around $1.4218, and
at 115.11 against the yen.

 Gold partly retraced its losses in Asia, adding 0.3
percent to $1,504.65 an ounce, while volatile spot silver
jumped 2.3 percent after sinking nearly 9 percent in the

 U.S. corn futures extended Wednesday's 4 percent plunge on
the expectation of higher near-term stocks.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - A slide in oil prices on
Wednesday sparked the second rout in commodities in less than a
week, driving investors away from riskier investments,
including stocks, and sending the euro to a three-week low.
 U.S. crude oil prices tumbled by more than 5 percent,
falling below $100 a barrel, after data showed increases in
crude and gasoline inventories and signs that China's economy
is cooling.
 Other commodities slumped, with spot silver  down 8
percent. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global
benchmark for commodities prices, dropped 3 percent.
 On Wall Street, all three major indexes fell about 1
percent, led by losses in energy shares, while the dollar and
U.S. Treasuries gained on a safe-haven bid.
 Heightened worries about debt-stricken European countries
also hit the euro, just a week after the currency rose to a
17-month high against the dollar.
 ""With the dollar continuing to strengthen, commodities like
oil should continue to trade off, given the inverse
relationship between the dollar and some of these commodities,""
said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors in New York.
 ""All these different issues -- currencies, the commodities,
equity prices, the risk trade -- all seems to be somewhat
interrelated.""
 Brent crude settled down $5.06 at $112.57 a barrel, while
U.S. crude futures dropped $5.67 to settle at $98.21.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 130.33
points, or 1.02 percent, to 12,630.03, according to the latest
available figures. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell
15.08 points, or 1.11 percent, to 1,342.08. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 26.83 points, or 0.93 percent,
to 2,845.06.
 The drop ended a three-day rally on Wall Street, and
oil-related exchange traded funds fell sharply.
 About 5 stocks fell for every 1 that rose on the New York
Stock Exchange, a broad exodus signaling that investors saw
little value in most industries.
 The U.S. oil fund LP  fell 4.2 percent to $39.35,
the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  was down 2.9 percent
at $74.28 and the U.S. gasoline fund LP  dropped 6.4
percent to $51.44.
 The U.S. inventory report showing ""a build in gasoline
stocks last week was a surprise, and that shook the market,
adding to earlier worries about signs of cooling in China's
economy,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in
Chicago.
 The price of gasoline also slumped, triggering a brief
trading pause on the New York Mercantile Exchange. U.S.
gasoline for June delivery  fell 25.69 cents to $3.1228 a
gallon. It was the biggest one-day drop since late September
2008.
 DEBT WORRIES DOG EURO
 New outbreaks of unrest in Europe highlighted the worries
over debt-laden nations.
 The euro firmly broke below its 50-day moving average
around $1.43, which traders are likely to take as a sign of
more losses to come. The euro last traded down 1.5 percent on
the day at $1.4193 , after hitting a session low of
$1.4172 on trading platform EBS, the lowest since April 18.
 ""It's a combination of renewed concern about peripheral
Europe and positioning that's leading to this bout of risk
aversion,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX
Strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research in New York.
 In Greece, police fired tear gas at dozens of youths
hurling stones in central Athens and a strike against budget
tightening brought much of the nation to a halt during talks on
the next slice of a bailout package. For details, see

 EU finance ministers will discuss Greece's debt crisis next

while the heads of Germany's coalition parties will voice their
support for the bailout, according to a draft paper seen by
Reuters. [ID:nLDE74A2A4]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Renewed worries about Greek
debt and another sell-off in the commodities market drove the
euro sharply lower on Wednesday, with more losses likely as
investors grow skittish over the currency's sudden retreat.
 The euro zone common currency dropped to a three-week low
against the U.S. dollar, firmly breaking below its 50-day
moving average around $1.43, which traders are likely to take
as a sign of more losses to come.
 The euro's drop, just a week after it hit a 17-month high
versus the dollar above $1.49, accelerated after steep losses
in stocks and commodities led to a stampede for the safe-haven
dollar.
 Speculation over whether Greece will receive more bailout
funding kept risk appetite volatile as investors continued to
price in a high probability that the country will eventually

 The euro last traded down 1.4 percent on the day at $1.4201
 after hitting a session low of $1.4172 on trading
platform EBS, the lowest since April 18.
 Analysts said long euro positioning has reached stretched
levels in recent weeks, making the currency vulnerable to a
pullback. Speculators increased bets in favor of the euro to
the highest since July 2007 in the week ended May 3.
 A move lower could test support around $1.4150 -- near the
mid-April low and a 38.2 percent retracement of the January-May
rise at around $1.4145.
 Euro crosses were dumped after a deep fall in U.S. gasoline
futures fueled the second major sell-off in the oil market in a
week, hitting riskier assets across the board.
 Weakness in the euro helped push the dollar index, which
measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, to
75.308 <.DXY>, up 0.9 percent on the day. Against the yen, the
dollar rose 0.2 percent to 81.01 yen .
 Commodity-linked currencies dropped, with the Australian
dollar down 1.3 percent  and the New Zealand dollar
down 0.9 percent .

 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - A slide in oil prices on
Wednesday sparked a second big rout across commodities in less
than a week, driving investors away from riskier investments
like stocks.
 Crude oil prices tumbled by more than 3 percent, driving
New York crude below $100 a barrel, stung by a rise in crude
oil inventories and signs that China's economy is cooling.
 Other commodities also slumped, with spot silver 
down more than 7 percent. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index

 Brent crude was down $3.96 at $113.67 a barrel, while U.S.

 The U.S. oil fund LP  fell 4 percent to $39.46, the

 The euro hit a session low of $1.4275  on the EBS

lower on the day, but within its range of the past few days.
 The European peripheral nations ""have never had their

Consulting in Washington. Investors ""may have lost focus on
that but it is now back in focus.""

 (Adds details, updates prices)
 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Ongoing uncertainty about
sovereign debt woes in the euro zone pushed the euro lower on
Wednesday, while crude oil prices tumbled after data suggested
China's economy is cooling.
 Oil extended declines midmorning in New York after a weekly
U.S. government report on oil inventories showed crude stocks
rose more than expected last week. On Wall Street, the drop in
oil prices hit energy shares fell, while disappointing
corporate results also pulled the Dow down.
 Investors fretted over whether euro zone officials will
give timely aid to debt-burdened Greece and Portugal, though
financial markets are braced for some form of debt
restructuring in the long run.
 EU finance ministers will discuss Greece's debt crisis next
week but will not decide on new emergency aid until a mission
to Athens that began on Wednesday gives its verdict on progress
on reforms. [nLDE74A0SY]
 Ministers are likely to tell Greece it must deliver on
savings and privatization targets already agreed if it wants
new emergency financing next year, a euro zone source said.
 But Greece is already chaffing under sharp spending cuts
and tax rises. Police fired teargas at dozens of youths hurling
stones in central Athens and a strike against austerity brought
much of the country to a halt. [ID:nLDE74A0SY]
 Some poorer European nations ""have never had their fiscal
house in order,"" said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington. Investors ""may have lost focus on
that but it is now back in focus.""
 Meanwhile, Portugal hopes its bailout plan will be approved
on Monday and looked set for a green light from a key German
parliamentary panel. [ID:nLDE74A16A]
 The euro hit a session low of $1.4275  on the EBS
trading platform. It was last at $1.4288, about 0.8 percent
lower on the day, but within its range of the past few days.
 CHINA ECONOMY SLOWING?
 Data out of China showed the country's industrial input
growth eased much more than expected in April, reducing the
need for further aggressive monetary policy tightening even as
inflation remains stubbornly high. [ID:nL3E7GB0H2]
 Despite robust demand for oil in China, investors turned
their focus to signs the economy is cooling and benchmark Brent
crude oil  dropped $2.42 to $114.78 a barrel, after
rebounding for two days from last week's tumble. U.S. crude
 lost $2.98 to $109.90 a barrel.
 U.S. stocks fell with oil prices and earnings from Dow
Jones industrial average component Walt Disney Co  also
disappointed.
 ""Disney earnings last night were below expectations,"" said
Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments in Lisle,
Illinois.
 ""Oil prices are down and that is affecting energy stocks
today,"" he said. ""We're getting a pullback after three days of
gains in the market.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 74.09
points, or 0.58 percent, at 12,686.27. The Standard & Poor's

1,349.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was off 7.45
points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,864.44.
 U.S. stocks have partially recovered in the past two days
from four days of falls last week and remain near the three

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Wednesday,
with risks to the downside on mounting uncertainty over whether
euro zone officials would provide timely financial aid to
debt-laden Greece and Portugal.
 Sterling  hit a 6-week high against the euro
 after the Bank of England raised its medium-term
inflation forecasts in its Quarterly Inflation Report, with
markets now expecting a UK rate hike by year-end. 
[ID:nLDE74A10B].
 The euro traded down 0.3 percent on the day against the
dollar at $1.4358, in sight of a three-week low of $1.4254 hit
on Monday. Asian sovereigns were keen to buy the euro on dips.
 ""Euro/dollar is being dominated by concerns about Greece and
Portugal and the contagion concerns that triggered a sell-off
last week could see the common currency fall further,"" said Adam
Myers, senior forex strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""If this trend continues, it can test lows of $1.4250 and
then $1.4160."" The euro had hit a low of $1.4156 on April 18.
 Comments from a German deputy finance minister that euro
zone officials will debate Greece's debt crisis next week but
that no decision will be taken, added to uncertainty as markets
fret over potential for a Greek debt restructure. [ID:WEA0239]
 The euro had got a brief boost on Tuesday after a Dow Jones
news agency report, citing a senior Greek government official as
saying Athens expects to receive a new aid package totalling
nearly 60 billion euros ($87 billion) in June. [ID:nLDE7490UN]
 Although Greece denied the report, some market players
expect additional funding sooner or later given fears that other
options -- such as debt restructuring or even an exit from the
euro zone by Greece -- would be more painful and cause more
losses among European banks.
 
 MORE WORRY
 Greece is not the only source of worry for investors, with
Finland delaying a parliamentary vote on the EU's Portugal
bailout plan to Friday from Wednesday because the country's
second-largest party remained undecided.
 The Finnish parliament's approval is important because it,
unlike others in the euro zone, has the right to vote on EU
requests for bailout funds. The leader of Finland's
third-biggest party reiterated his opposition to Portugal aid.
[ID:nLDE74910V] [ID:nLDE74A0TX]
 But traders are also weighing the euro zone's troubles with
another big theme that has driven the market this year -- dollar
weakness stemming from the Federal Reserve's reluctance to raise
interest rates from near zero.
 In contrast, the European Central Bank has raised rates in
April and is expected to raise them further.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 74.614, above a
three-year low hit earlier this month of 72.696.
 ""It looks too early to call this a major reversal in the
dollar,"" said Chris Turner head of fx strategy at ING. ""Our view
has been that with little to emerge in fresh policy from the Fed
ahead of its June 22 meeting, the dollar-funded carry trade
would be a dominant theme for the second quarter.""
 Stabilising commodity prices provided support to
growth-linked currencies like the Australian dollar ,
which rose 0.1 percent against the greenback to $1.0835.
 Traders said some investors were increasingly expressing a
bearish view on the euro by adding to bullish bets on the
Australian dollar against the common currency .

 LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for a second
straight day on Wednesday thanks to favourable U.S. and European
corporate earnings, while the euro slipped on uncertainty over
whether debt-laden Greece would need additional financial aid.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro clung to its gains of the
past few days on Wednesday, helped by stabilising commodity
prices and speculation about another Greek aid package, but a
further foray to the upside is seen filled with obstacles such
as the chance of negative news on the prospects of the euro
zone's efforts to help Greece and other financially strained
countries.
 The risk-sensitive euro and the Australian dollar dropped
briefly after data showing Chinese industrial production and
retail sales fell short of market expectations, but they quickly
pared losses as China shares recovered.
 ""I thought the data was quite weak and there could have been
more selling. But the market positioning (in euro longs) is much
lighter than before, so the euro's reaction to any negative news
is smaller,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 The euro traded at $1.4390 , down 0.1 percent on the
day but still keeping most of its gains from a three-week low of
$1.4254 hit on Monday.
 Some traders suspected much of the bloated long positions in
the single currency were likely to have been unwound during a
torrent of selling since last Thursday that pushed the currency
down by 4.6 percent from a 17-month peak of $1.4940.
Speculators' net long positions hit the highest since July 2007
in the week to May 3, based on data from a U.S. regulator.
 As the unwinding of euro long positions had been in part
triggered by massive falls in oil and commodity prices last
week, some signs of stabilisation in commodity prices are
helping the euro.
 The euro got a boost on Tuesday after a Dow Jones news
agency report, citing a senior Greek government official, said
Athens expects to receive a new aid package totalling nearly 60
billion euros ($87 billion) as soon as next month.
[ID:nLDE7490UN]
 Although Greece denied the report, some market players
expect additional funding sooner or later given fears that other
options -- such as debt restructuring or even an exit from the
euro zone by Greece -- would be more painful and cause more
losses among European banks.
""I think giving Greece more financing is the only option they
can take. But the euro will be driven by news headlines for now.
It can easily move 100 pips in either direction,"" a trader at a
Japanese brokerage said.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde told Le Figaro
newspaper in an interview for publication on Wednesday that it
is hard to see Greece returning to debt markets in 2012, as
envisaged under an EU bailout package, and Europe would have to
keep financing countries in difficulty to avoid a costly
restructuring. [ID:nLDE7492K4]
 But many market players also expect more twists and turns
before any deal is reached on Greece, likely causing ups and
downs in the euro.
 Adding to uncertainty, a German member of parliament
questioned whether Greece had met terms for its next aid
tranche. A source close to European Union and International
Monetary Fund inspectors in Athens said it was too early to say.
[ID:nLDE7491FC]
 MORE WORRY
 Greece is not the only source of worry for investors, with
Finland delaying a parliamentary vote on the EU's Portugal
bailout plan to Friday from Wednesday because the country's

 But traders are also weighing the euro zone's troubles with
another big theme that has driven the market this year -- dollar
weakness stemming from the Federal Reserve's reluctance to raise
interest rates from near zero.
 Just last week the dollar hit a three-year low against a
basket of currencies <.DXY> as a run of softer-than-expected
U.S. data in recent weeks reinforced expectations that any Fed
rate hike will be many months away, in contrast with the ECB,
which raised rates in April and is expected to boost them
further in the coming months.
 The dollar index <.DXY> stood at 74.627, flat on the day and
2.6 percent above the low of 72.696.
 ""There are so many uncertainties at this point. But when
people really don't know what to expect, a currency with higher
interest rates tends to be bought,"" said Takako Masai, manager
of forex at Shinsei Bank.
 The greenback stood little changed at 80.88 yen ,
maintaining its gains since it marked a seven-week low of 79.57
yen last Thursday. It rose as high as 81.10 yen, its highest
level in a week, helped by buying from Japanese investors. But
offers lined up at 81.20 yen were keeping the dollar's gains in
check.
 Options traders are said to be saddled with gamma long
positions at around 81 yen after dollar calls expiring on Monday
with a strike price of 81 yen were traded on Tuesday, which
means the dollar may stick around that level because option
traders have to sell dollars above 81 yen and buy below that
level for delta hedging.
 Technically, the yen is trying to stay above the bottom of a
cloud on the daily Ichimoku chart at 80.89 yen.
 The Australian dollar stood at $1.0860 , up 0.2
percent on the day, weathering disappointment from the Chinese
data.

 * Oil, euro dip but quickly recover

 By Richard Pullin	
 MELBOURNE, May 11 (Reuters) - Asian shares firmed on
Wednesday as rising global commodity prices boosted energy and
resource stocks, while investors largely shrugged off data from
China suggesting growth there is starting to slow.	
 Oil prices and the euro dipped briefly after China's April
inflation came in slightly above expectations, but other data,
including industrial output, suggested slower activity and less
room for aggressive tightening to curb growth.	
""Price pressures are still uncomfortably strong, but there
are some signs in today's data that policy measures put in place
over the last six months or so are having an impact,"" said Brian
Jackson, an economist with Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.	
 Stocks remained supported by a recovery in commodities after
last week's near-record sell-off and an easing of concerns about
any Greek debt restructure following a debt downgrade.	
 ""The dominant theme this week is whether last week's fall in
commodities was just a speculative reversal rather than a brutal
reassessment and it appears that, yes, it was. The market was
running ahead of itself,"" said Adrian Foster, head of financial
markets research, Asia-Pacific at Rabobank International in Hong
Kong.	
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5
percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was flat and South
Korea's Kospi was up 1.3 percent after a holiday on
Tuesday.	
 Asian shares outside Japan rose 1.1 percent
on Wednesday, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 up 1.2
percent, with global miner Rio Tinto moving up 1.8
percent.	
 The euro held on to gains in Asia, trading at
$1.4392. The currency has been moving away from a three-week
low, helped by stabilising commodity prices and chances of
another aid package for Greece.	
 However, a further move to the upside could be constrained
by the chance of more negative news about the prospects of the
euro zone's efforts to help Greece and other financially
strained countries.

 CHINA DATA	
 China's headline consumer price inflation slowed to 5.3
percent in April from a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March,
but missed market forecasts for a decline to 5.2 percent.
[ID:nL3E7GB06W]	
 The overall data was mixed with industrial output
considerably weaker than expected, climbing 13.4 percent in
April and retail sales also coming in below forecasts.	
 ""The economy is slowing, but not very seriously,"" said Chen
Gang, an economist with CEBM in Shanghai. ""It is still far from
the warning line for the Chinese leadership. There is no room
for the central bank to relax its monetary tightening.""	


 The inflation data followed Chinese trade figures on Tuesday
that suggested still-strong global demand, although a slowdown
in imports raised concerns for some analysts about slower
growth.	
 Analysts said it was clear the economy was slowing but were
divided on the likely policy response to curb inflation. 
 China's central bank has raised interest rates four times
since October and Premier Wen Jiabao has signaled a hawkish
stance for the coming months to bring inflation under control.
The government has a 4 percent ceiling on annual inflation.	
 Spot gold edged up 0.4 percent to 1522.74, heading
for a fourth day in a row of gains, while silver rose 1 percent.	
 ""Gold is generally benefiting from the return of confidence
from investors,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Ivestec Australia. ""They are very happy buying on the dip, as we
see the same old problems hanging around."" 
 Oil prices recovered from an initial dip on the China data
to be slightly higher. Brent cruded was trading at $117.86,
continuing the march back from last week's steep fall as rising
waters along the Mississippi River threatened to disrupt
petroleum plants in Louisiana in the next two weeks.	
 The Australian dollar , which is sensitive to
Chinese demand for the country's coal and iron ore, was little
changed at $1.0857.

 MELBOURNE, May 11 (Reuters) - Asian shares pushed higher in
line with gains in world markets as Chinese trade data buoyed
optimism about the global recovery, but investors will be
watching China's inflation data due later on Wednesday for any
hints on further tightening.	
 U.S. stocks rose for a third day in a row, led by utilities
and other defensive sectors, while European shares climbed to a
one-week closing high as investor concerns over a possible Greek
debt restructuring receded.	
 The euro maintained overnight gains on Wednesday, helped by
stabilising commodity prices and chances of another aid package
for Greece, but some traders said selling based on Greece
worries could subside though the currency may remain vulnerable.

 Markets will be on the look-out for any surprises from
China's inflation data, due out at 0200 GMT, which could prompt
a further round of tightening. A downside surprise will ease
those concerns. April consumer price data is expected to come in
around 5.2 percent. 
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.9
percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.0
percent and South Korea's Kospi rose 1.0 percent after a
holiday on Tuesday.	
 Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent
in early trade on Wednesday.	
 Australia's top home lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
posted a 13 percent rise in Q3 profits, as expected,
and said it saw a gradual improvement in operating conditions.

week's near-record sell-off, as China's stronger-than-expected
trade data illustrated the strength of global demand.	
 Gold and silver rose, while copper held firm. Spot gold
edged up 0.2 percent in early Asia trade at 1517.95,
heading for a fourth day in a row of gains.	
 Crude oil prices also edged up in Asia after resuming their
march back from last week's steep fall as rising waters along

Louisiana in the next two weeks. U.S. crude  was trading
up 0.25 percent at $104.14 a barrel.	
 Stronger commodity prices boosted the Australian dollar
, which rose back above $1.08 to $1.0859. The euro

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher against
the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen on Tuesday, though it
struggled to gain momentum on persistent fears that Greece may
have to restructure its debt.
 Renewed worries about debt troubles in the euro zone's
peripheral economies have pushed the euro more than 5 cents
below its recent peak near $1.50, reached last week. Traders
expect the euro to slide further, approaching support around
$1.4150 in the coming days.
 The euro earlier gained after Dow Jones News reported
Greece could receive new aid totaling 60 billion euros as soon
as June to help it meet funding requirements. The currency
pulled back after Greece denied the report. See
[ID:nLDE7490LK]
 ""The only thing that seems 100 percent certain is that
Greece remains mired in debt and that at least a good portion
of that debt is at risk of not being repaid should the
situation not change considerably, both in terms of the
financial metrics and spending levels within the country
itself,"" said Mark Frey, regional director at Wester Union
Business Solutions in Victoria, British Columbia.
 The euro  was up 0.3 percent at $1.4403, well above a
session low of $1.4270 on trading platform EBS. It hit a
session peak of $1.4412 in late afternoon trading as gains in
U.S. stocks boosted risk appetite.
 Analysts said the euro is vulnerable to escalating debt
worries even as investors remain focused on the outlook for
higher rates in the euro zone compared with the United States.
 A move lower could test support around $1.4150 -- near the
mid-April low and a 38.2 percent retracement of the January-May
rise at around $1.4145.
 Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ, said it was
""quite likely"" the euro had formed a medium-term top and that
any move back into the high $1.40s could result in heavy
selling by longer-term investors.
 EURO SHORTS
 Adding to uncertainty over the situation in Greece, a
German member of parliament questioned whether Greece had met
terms for its next aid tranche. A source said European Union
and International Monetary Fund inspectors have not yet
concluded whether Greece is meeting its targets.
[ID:nATH006067] [ID:nBAT006220]
 On Monday, Standard and Poor's cut Greece's rating, saying
its projections suggest reductions of between 50 percent and 70
percent of the bonds' original value could be needed to make
Greece's debt burden sustainable.
 Coupled with a media report last week -- later emphatically
denied by European policymakers -- that Greece may be
considering exiting the euro, it highlighted the dilemma of how
best to extricate the country from its debt quagmire.
 ""The combination of deep recession, strict austerity
measures and sky-high borrowing costs has sent Athens into a
vicious debt cycle,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in Washington.
 Some traders said some macro accounts had started to reduce
their euro short positions. Other market players also suggested
selling was overdone in the near term after the euro tumbled
from a 17-month high last week.
 ""We need a fresh trigger to go lower in the euro from here.
I think we're in a $1.43/1.46 range for now,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS in London.
 The euro was up 1 percent against the yen at 116.39 yen
 after earlier sliding to a 6-week low. The dollar was
up 0.7 percent at 80.80 yen .
 The Swiss franc fell to session lows against the dollar
 and the euro  after Swiss inflation rose 0.1
percent month-on-month in April, well below forecasts and
denting the chance of a rate increase in June. [ID:nZCH9GE78M]

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Tuesday as
unexpectedly strong Chinese trade data reinforced optimism
about the global economy, while oil rose on concerns U.S.
flooding could hit Gulf Coast refinery operations.
 The euro was little changed as conflicting reports emerged
of a potential new aid deal for debt-laden Greece.
 China posted a trade surplus in April that was nearly four
times greater than expected, as exports hit a record and
imports eased more than anticipated. The data illustrated the
strength of China's economy even after its efforts to rein in
inflation. For details, see [ID:nL3E7GA09F]
 Optimism about the pace of economic recovery lifted
European and U.S. equities. World stocks as measured by the
MSCI stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.7 percent.
 ""China's export numbers were very good,"" said Burt White,
chief investment officer at LPL Financial in Boston. ""That gave
a shot in the arm to this market.""
 European shares climbed to a one-week closing high as
mining stocks rose on the data and investors scooped up banks
on hopes they will not suffer an imminent write-down on their
Greek debt holdings.
 ""There is a view that if there is going to be a debt
restructuring, it is going to be orderly,"" said Bob Parker,
senior adviser at Credit Suisse.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
ended up 0.8 percent.
 U.S. stocks rose for the third day in a row. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> added 55.89 points, or 0.44 percent,
to 12,740.57. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 8.27
points, or 0.61 percent, to 1,354.56. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> gained 19.93 points, or 0.7 percent, to
2,863.18.
 But even as the Chinese data helped ease fears about a
global slowdown, the utilities sector led gainers on the S&P
500 as investors took more defensive positions on the view that
although the recovery was still in place, it is not
accelerating as quickly as anticipated.
 U.S. data showed import prices rose at a slower pace in
April as petroleum and food cost increases moderated, while a
jump in wholesale inventories during March suggested a weak
first quarter ended on a firmer note. [ID:nN1044569]
 The ease in prices underscored the Federal Reserve's
general view that the impact of higher food and commodity
prices will prove to be temporary.
 OIL CHOPPY
 Crude oil prices traded higher as investors resumed a
reversal from last week's abrupt slide. While no refineries had
been forced to cut operations yet, rising waters along the
Mississippi threatened to disrupt plants in Louisiana in the
next two weeks.
 Prices also got support from the China data that showed
strong oil imports for April.
 Brent crude  jumped $1.73 to $117.63, recovering
from a low of $113.58 earlier in the session. U.S. crude 
settled up $1.33 at $103.88 a barrel in volatile action.
 Oil fell earlier in the day after CME Group Inc, the
world's largest commodities exchange, raised the margin call on
crude futures for a fourth time since February in an effort to
curb volatility.
 Oil prices have had a volatile week of trading, falling
from over $114 a barrel -- the highest level since 2008 -- to
$94 a barrel.

costs rose amid fears it may have to restructure its debt
without further EU help. [ID:nLDE7491FC]
 Doubts were raised by a German lawmaker whether Greece had
met the conditions for getting the next tranche of aid under
its existing deal but a source close to EU and IMF inspectors
in Athens said it was too early for a decision.
 Comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- Europe's
reluctant paymaster -- on new aid for Greece were guarded.
Merkel said she could only discuss further aid for Greece after
EU and IMF officials report on implementation of its existing
rescue plan. But she did not rule out additional funding for
Athens or a possible fresh easing of terms on its bailout.

 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Strong Chinese trade data
lifted stocks on Tuesday, reinforcing optimism about the global
economy, while the euro steadied on reports of a potential new

 China posted a hefty trade surplus in April, nearly four

 The euro  steadied on the news of a new Greek
bailout after falling sharply in recent days. The euro was last
down 0.1 percent at $1.4346, with the session peak at $1.4395
and the low at $1.4267. Since last Wednesday the euro fell from
a 15 month of high of $1.4939 to a seven week low around
$1.4254 on renewed fears of a Greek debt default.
 The euro's recent fall was accelerated by Monday's move by
ratings agency Standard & Poor's to cut Greece's rating to B
from BB-, dragging it further into ""junk"" territory.
 ""The euro continues to struggle amid a backdrop of renewed
debt problems in the bloc's periphery,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in
Washington.
 But some analysts said it was unlikely to fall as sharply
as it did a year ago when the Greek debt crisis hit financial
markets, because there was now a safety net for indebted
countries.
 OIL CHOPPY
 Crude oil prices reversed earlier losses to trade higher.
Oil had been driven down earlier in the day after CME Group
Inc, the world's largest commodities exchange, raised the
margin call on crude futures for a fourth time since February
in an effort to curb volatility.
 ""Having high margin requirements makes it more difficult
for speculative traders to enter the market, so naturally that
will cause less speculative activity in oil markets,"" said Ben
Westmore, commodity economist at National Australia Bank.
 Brent crude  was up 61 cents at $116.51, recovering
from a low of $113.58 earlier in the session. U.S. crude 
was off 17 cents at $102.38 a barrel after briefly turning
positive in choppy trading.
 Oil prices have had a volatile week of trading, falling
from over $114 a barrel -- the highest level since 2008 -- to
$94 a barrel.

 The euro  was last down 0.1 percent at $1.4346, with
the session peak at $1.4395 and the low at $1.4267. Since last
Wednesday the euro fell from a 15 month of high of $1.4939 to a
seven week low around $1.4254 on renewed fears of a Greek debt
default.
 The euro's recent fall was accelerated by last week's
commodity sell-off and Monday's move by ratings agency Standard
& Poor's to cut Greece's rating to B from BB-, dragging it
further into junk territory.
 ""The euro continues to struggle amid a backdrop of renewed
debt problems in the bloc's periphery,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in
Washington.
 But some analysts said it was unlikely to fall as sharply
as it did a year ago when the Greek debt crisis hit financial
markets, because there was now a safety net for indebted
countries.
 OIL RETREATS
 Crude oil prices were also steadier after CME Group Inc,
the world's largest commodities exchange, raised the margin
call on crude futures for a fourth time since February in an
effort to curb volatility.
 ""Having high margin requirements makes it more difficult
for speculative traders to enter the market, so naturally that
will cause less speculative activity in oil markets,"" said Ben
Westmore, commodity economist at National Australia Bank.
 Brent crude  was 42 cents lower at $115.40,
recovering from a low of $113.58 earlier in the session. U.S.
crude  was down 98 cents at $101.59 a barrel.
 Oil prices have had a volatile week of trading, falling
from over $114 a barrel -- the highest level since 2008 -- to
$94 a barrel.

 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar in volatile trade on Tuesday as conflicting reports
emerged of a potential new aid deal for debt-laden Greece to
help it meet its funding requirements in the next two years. 
 The euro touched the day's high after Dow Jones News
reported that Greece could receive aid totaling 60 billion
euros as soon as June, but pulled back after Greece denied the
report.
 It traded well off Monday's low, the lowest since April 19,
but analysts said it was still vulnerable to escalating
concerns about euro zone debt even as investors remain focused
on the outlook for higher rates in the euro zone compared with
the U.S.
 ""The euro continues to struggle amid a backdrop of renewed
debt problems in the bloc's periphery,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in
Washington.
 The euro was last down 0.1 percent at $1.4346, with the
session peak at $1.4395 and the low at $1.4267.
 Adding to the uncertainty over the situation in Greece, a
German MP questioned whether Greece had met the terms for its
next aid tranche, while a source said EU and IMF inspectors
have not yet concluded whether Greece is meeting its targets.
 ""This seems a bit early to come up with something concrete.
I think we'll get more posturing before a deal can be agreed on
Greece,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital
in London.
 On Monday, Standard and Poor's cut Greece's rating to B
from BB-, saying its projections suggest that debt reductions,
or haircuts, of between 50 percent and 70 percent of the bonds'
original value could be needed to make Greece's debt burden
sustainable.
 Coupled with a media report last week -- later emphatically
denied by European policymakers -- that Greece may be
considering exiting the euro, it highlighted the dilemma of how
best to extricate the country from its debt quagmire.
 ""Despite receiving a massive bailout last year, the
combination of deep recession, strict austerity measures and
sky-high borrowing costs have sent Athens into a vicious debt
cycle that may only be broken by a restructuring of its
existing obligations or by devaluing its currency, an option
that is unavailable to it as long as it remains part of the
euro zone,"" said Commonwealth Foreign Exchange's Esiner.
 EURO SHORTS
 Traders said some macro accounts had started to reduce
their euro short positions. Other market players also suggested
selling was overdone in the near term after the euro tumbled
from a 17-month high last week.
 ""We need a fresh trigger to go lower in the euro from here.
I think we're in a $1.43/1.46 range for now,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS in London.
 But Hardman at BTM-UFJ said it was ""quite likely"" the euro
had formed a medium-term top and any move back into the high
$1.40s could result in heavy selling by longer-term investors.
 A move lower could test support around $1.4150 -- near its
mid April low and a 38.2 percent retracement of the January-May
rise at around $1.4145.
 Recent euro weakness was triggered by disappointment over a
lack of hints on a rate increase next month from the European
Central Bank last week. Because rising oil and commodities have
been at the root of inflation that has pushed the ECB to
tighten policy, declines in oil prices could make investors
scale back their expectations of rising rates.
 The euro was up around 0.3 percent against the yen at
115.61 yen after sliding to a 6-week low earlier in the global
session.
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 80.60 yen, well above a
seven-week trough touched last week.
 The Swiss franc fell to session lows against the dollar and
the euro after Swiss CPI inflation rose 0.1 percent
month-on-month in April, well below forecasts and denting the
chance of a Swiss rate increase in June.

 * Lack of water resources main challenge for gold extraction
 
 By Reem Shamseddine
 KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, May 10 (Reuters) - State-controlled
minerals firm Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Maaden) plans to more
than double its gold production to 400,000 ounces per year by
2015, an executive told Reuters on Tuesday.
 Maaden's current gold production is around 140,000-150,000
ounces per year, Hany al-Dabbagh, the company's vice president
of precious metals and exploration, told Reuters in an interview
on the sidelines of a MEED conference.
 Lack of water resources is one of the main challenges
crippling the exploration of gold projects.
 ""We have a number of new gold projects at an advanced stage
and will build a 450 km long water pipeline from Taif to the
mine site in the Central Arabian Gold Region,"" he said.
 ""Gold is there but we don't have water. Water is as precious
as gold,"" said al-Dabbagh.
 To get around the problem, the firm managed to secure 10,000
cubic meters per day of recycled waste water from the city of
Taif into central Saudi Arabia, where a number of gold mines
have been identified, he added.
 "" initially include Ad Douwaihi, Massara, Mansoura, Ar Rjum.
These four mines will be served by the water facility with the
potential for more,"" said al-Dabbagh.
 ""Other projects such as As Suq are also in development
although are not served by the water pipeline.""
 Gold had gained a lot of interest from investors seeking a
safe haven during times of the economic crisis.
 On Tuesday, spot gold recovered from a session low of
$1,505.69 an ounce and was quoted 0.1 percent higher at
$1,514.60, set for a 1.5 percent gain this week.
 ""As long as our buyers are buying gold, we are in good
business,"" said al-Dabbagh.

606,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2011 08:36AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-U.S. import price rise slows in April," (Adds details, adds background)
 WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. import prices rose at
a slower pace in April as petroleum and food cost increases
moderated, supporting views the recent jump in commodity prices
was likely to be transitory.
Overall import prices increased 2.2 percent for a seventh
straight month of gains, the Labor Department said on Tuesday,
slowing from a 2.6 percent increase in March.
The increase was, however, above economists' expectations
for a 1.8 percent rise.
 The report came on the heels of a collapse in commodity
prices last week, which pulled down crude oil prices from their
lofty levels. U.S. crude oil has fallen to about $102 a barrel
from more than $114 at the start of May.
 ""If these falls were to be maintained, the rates at which
import prices are increasing would slow and that would mean
less upward pressure on CPI,"" said Paul Dales, a senior U.S.
economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Excluding volatile petroleum, import prices were up 0.6
percent after rising 0.4 percent the prior month. In the 12
months to April, import prices rose 11.1 percent overall and
4.3 percent excluding petroleum.
Stripping out both petroleum and food, import prices rose
0.5 percent in April after a 0.3 percent rise in March.
Federal Reserve officials generally view the recent surge in
food and energy prices as unlikely to translate into broader
inflation. The monthly rise in import prices reflected a 7.2
percent increase in imported petroleum prices, which followed a
9.8 percent advance in March.
Imported food prices increased 1.8 percent, slowing sharply
from a 4.2 percent rise in March.
The Labor Department report showed export prices rose 1.1
percent after increasing 1.5 percent in March. Analysts had
expected export prices to gain 0.9 percent.
 In the 12 months to April, export prices rose 9.6 percent.
Export prices were lifted by gains in foods and industrial
supplies and materials.

 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro was steady versus the
dollar in volatile trade on Tuesday as conflicting reports
emerged of a potential new aid deal for debt-laden Greece to
help it meet its funding requirements in the next two years.
 The euro briefly gained, hitting the day's high at $1.4379
after Dow Jones News reported that Greece could receive aid
totalling 60 billion euros as soon as June, but pulled back
after Greece denied the report. [ID:nATH006063
 However, it stayed above Monday's three-week low of $1.4254
and short-term was well supported above its 55-day moving
average, now at $1.4245, but analysts said it was still
vulnerable to escalating concerns about euro zone debt.
 The euro was flat at $1.4361. Traders said a semi-official
name was seen selling around the day's highs.
 ""There is a lot of uncertainty over the longer-term outlook,
which is why we are seeing such volatile moves,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 ""There is not sufficient risk premium priced into the euro
at the moment. Continued peripheral troubles, plus moderating
euro zone growth could pull back European Central Bank rate hike
expectations, taking away the euro's main support.""
 Adding to the uncertainty over the situation in Greece, a
German MP questioned whether Greece had met the terms for its
next aid tranche, while a source said EU and IMF inspectors have
not yet concluded whether Greece is meeting its targets.

the euro tumbled from a 17-month high of $1.4939 hit last week.
 ""We need a fresh trigger to go lower in the euro from here.

currency strategist at UBS.
 But Hardman at BTM-UFJ said it was ""quite likely"" the euro
had formed a medium-term top and any move back into the high
$1.40s could result in heavy selling by longer-term investors.
 The euro's 55-day moving average is seen as major support as
it has not traded below that measure since mid-January. But a
break there could put it on course to test support around
$1.4150 -- near its April 18 low of $1.4156 and a 38.2 percent
retracement of the January-May rise at around $1.4145.
 Recent euro weakness, initially triggered by disappointment
over a lack of hints on a rate hike next month from the European

commodities market prompted investors to shun risk.
 Because rising oil and commodities have been at the root of
inflation that has pushed the ECB to tighten policy, declines in
oil prices could make investors scale back their expectations of
more rate hikes.

(Recasts with trade minister comment)	
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Taiga Uranaka	
 TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japan's government said on Tuesday
it would not set an initial limit on Tokyo Electric Power's
liability for damages caused by its leaking Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear plant and said the utility must tighten its belt
further.	
 The president of Tokyo Electric had asked the
government earlier on Tuesday to help shoulder a compensation
bill for the nuclear crisis that is expected to run into tens of
billions of dollars.	
 In a written response to the president's request, trade
minister Banri Kaieda said there would be no ceiling on what
the utility must pay and that it would be expected to compensate
the victims of the disaster in a timely manner.	
 Kaieda's statement echoes the stance taken by Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano earlier this month, adding to the
likelihood the government will take a hard line against the
utility in its rescue plan.	
 Kaieda did not go into details of a scheme that is still
being hammered out that could use public funds and premiums from
other utilities to help deal with the initial outlay of
compensation, thereby saving Asia's largest power company from
financial ruin.	
 JP Morgan has estimated Tepco could face 2 trillion yen
($24.9 billion) in compensation losses in the financial year
that started last month, while Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has
said the bill could reach $130 billion if the crisis drags on. 
 
 Government officials, bankers and Tokyo Electric executives
have been in discussions for weeks on the scheme, but have yet
to agree to a final plan, reflecting disagreement about who
should foot the bill.	
 Earlier on Tuesday Tokyo Electric President Masataka Shimizu
pledged to slash or forgo executive salaries after demands by
some cabinet ministers for it to take more drastic restructuring
steps before receiving public help and with a hike in
electricity prices now seen likely.	
 As well as more cost-cutting by the utility, some in the
government have called for creditor banks and holders of its
shares and bonds to shoulder some of the burden before unveiling
the scheme, seen as politically unpopular but necessary to
ensure compensation is paid in full.	
 National Strategy Minister Koichiro Gemba hinted that
holders of Tokyo Electric shares and bonds may have to bear some
of the burden when asked about issue.	
 ""In relation to any burden on taxpayers, it's important to
consider the issue of those who hold Tokyo Electric shares and
bonds,"" he told reporters.	
 Tepco shares closed higher on Tuesday, rising 3.2 percent to
469 yen per share, outperforming the broader market. 
 A draft plan already calls for a fund to be set up to help
people who had to leave their homes due to the nuclear crisis
that would include contributions from other utilities, which
Tokyo Electric would reimburse over several years using its
annual profits, sources familiar with the matter have said.	
 People living within a 20-km (12-mile) radius of the plant
have been evacuated, while those in five towns downwind from it
have also been told to prepare to leave their homes. 
 The draft is controversial since not only payments by Tokyo
Electric but contributions from other utilities would likely be
borne by electricity users.	
 Tokyo Electric and its creditor banks have been pushing for
a compensation plan that would include substantial government
help, capping the utility's liabilities and protecting its
shareholders and bond owners.	
 They argue that given the sheer volume of Tokyo Electric
bonds it is essential to prevent its credit rating being cut to
junk status, which they said could wreak havoc with not only
with other utilities' bond issues but the entire bond market.	
 Tokyo Electric is the biggest corporate bond issuer in
Japan, representing about 8 percent, or about 5 trillion yen,
of the entire 70 trillion yen Japanese corporate bond market. 
 In the immediate aftermath of the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami that wrecked cooling systems at the nuclear plant 240 km
(150 miles) north of Tokyo, the utility's main lender Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp and other major banks provided a
total of 1.9 trillion yen in emergency loans.	
 
 STEP UP RESTRUCTURING	
 Shimizu told reporters after meeting Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yukio Edano and Kaieda that the company would step up planned
restructuring steps including asset sales. 
 He said he and other representative directors of the company
would forgo salaries ""for the foreseeable future"" as part of the
additional measures.	
 Shimizu warned that the utility could face with extra costs
of 1 trillion yen for fuel after shutting down reactors in
Fukushima following the quake, and it was having difficulty
raising funds.	
 He also said it faced having to pay out 750 billion yen to
redeem bonds and loans in the current financial year to March
2012, potentially overwhelming its finances.	
 ""Our fundraising situation is extremely difficult,"" Shimizu
said in a letter to the trade minister seeking government
support.	
 ""If this situation continues ... sooner or later we will
not be able to secure enough funds, potentially affecting not
only fair and timely compensation payments for victims but also
the stable supply of electricity.""	
 After the meeting with Shimizu, Kaieda said the government
would ask Tokyo Electric to keep its requests for government
financial support to a minimum and not to raise electricity
prices immediately.	
 He also said the government was aiming to finalise the
scheme this week. It had been expected to say this week it would
give Tokyo Electric time to prepare for reporting its 2010/12
earnings, scheduled for later this month.

 * Greece denies report it expects 60 bln euro package soon
 * Euro zone source says no figure under discussion yet
 By Ingrid Melander and Stephen Brown
 ATHENS/BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, Europe's reluctant paymaster, said on Tuesday she could
only discuss further aid for Greece after EU and IMF officials
report on implementation of its existing rescue plan.
 Speaking to foreign correspondents in Berlin, Merkel did not
rule out additional funding for Athens, or a possible fresh
easing of the terms on its 110 billion euro ($157 billion)
bailout, and she voiced confidence that the German parliament
would back a permanent bailout mechanism for the euro zone.
 ""I need to analyse the findings of the European Central
Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund first
and I can't comment before that,"" she said. ""Anything else would
not help Greece or Europe.""
 A source with direct knowledge of the joint inspection
mission visiting Athens said EU and IMF officials had not yet
concluded whether Greece had met targets required to receive the
next tranche of aid under its existing aid deal.
 He stressed the inspectors were not discussing any new
bailout package with Greek authorities.
 A senior German lawmaker said earlier there were signs that
conditions for the next payment had not been met.
 Euro zone markets steadied amid growing expectations that
Greece may receive a new aid package to cope with its debt
crisis and avert an early restructuring that could force
investors to take crippling losses.
 But Greek and EU officials dismissed a Dow Jones report that
Athens was expecting a 60 billion euro ($86 billion) second
bailout next month as plain wrong, or at least highly premature,
insisting talks on further assistance were only at an
exploratory stage.
 Analysts said the projected figure of 60 billion euros was
merely a reflection of the amount Athens is due to raise on
markets in 2012 and 2013 under its current programme.
 
 EURO, SHARES STEADY
 The euro, which hit a three-week low against the dollar on
Monday after ratings agency S&P downgraded Greece deeper into
junk territory and said it might have to write off up to 70
percent of its debt, regained some ground on Tuesday.
 European shares crept up partly due to a growing belief that
the European Union would act to support Athens and prevent
forced write-downs on its 327 billion euro debt mountain. The
cost of insuring Greek and other peripheral euro zone debt
against default fell slightly.
 ""There is no formal negotiation between Greece and the
European authorities on any new package,"" a senior euro zone
source in Brussels told Reuters.
 Euro zone finance ministers would take a first look at the
situation next Monday when they receive the conclusions of the
EU/IMF/ECB mission, he said.
 Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter was quoted as saying
Greece might be given longer to repay 110 billion euros in
emergency loans under its existing EU/IMF rescue plan, and the
interest rate could be cut again.
 ""International aid is clearly tied to reform measures,"" the
Austrian Press Agency quoted her as saying.
 APA said Fekter expressed ""total rejection"" of any
rescheduling of Greek sovereign debt, saying: ""That brings
absolutely nothing. There would be no pressure for reforms.""
 Greece paid an increased yield of 4.88 percent to sell
six-month treasury bills on Tuesday to refinance maturing debt,
higher than last month and well above the 4.2 percent average
rate on its IMF and EU loans.
 
 ""POLITICAL SUICIDE""
 Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou has acknowledged
that investors do not believe Athens will be able to return to
capital markets next year to raise 27 billion euros as foreseen
under its bailout plan.
 The chairman of euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude
Juncker, said after senior euro zone policymakers met last
Friday there was a consensus that Greece would need a second
adjustment programme.
 Despite widespread market expectations that Greece will
eventually have to restructure its debt, ECB policymakers kept
up a barrage of dire warnings against such a move.
 ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny of Austria said
Greece should be given more time to repay financial aid rather
than issuing new loans.
 A restructuring ""would immediately have massive consequences
for the Greek Banking system and for the banking system
overall,"" he told Austrian radio. ""That would only heighten the
crisis.""
 ECB executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said a euro
zone debt default or restructuring would be ""political suicide"".
 Speaking in Florence, Bini Smaghi said Greece was a rich
country with assets it could sell to pay down its debt. Asked
about a possible new aid programme for Athens, he said it should
follow its reform programme for the coming months to try to
restore market confidence.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - World stocks advanced on Tuesday
as strong Chinese trade data reinforced optimism about the
global economy, while the euro was volatile on conflicting media
reports of a potential new aid deal for debt-laden Greece.
 The euro briefly gained against the dollar after Dow Jones
News Wires reported that Greece expected to receive fresh aid
totalling 60 billion euros ($85.71 billion) as soon as June, but
Greece denied it was discussing a new aid package.
 China posted its biggest trade surplus in four months in
April as exports hit a record on stronger global demand,
highlighting strength in the world's second largest economy
despite its efforts to rein in inflation.
 Oil prices fell on a firmer dollar and higher margins for
oil futures but surprisingly high Chinese crude imports showed
demand was resilient and limited further losses.
 Optimism about the pace of economic recovery after the
robust Chinese data lifted the the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares 0.9 percent. World stocks as measured by MSCI
were up 0.5 percent.
 ""Markets have been reluctant to give up a lot of ground
because there is confidence in a global recovery and confidence
that it is turning into a sustainable expansion even if there is
some loss of momentum,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin.
 
 GREEK WOES
 The euro see-sawed against the dollar after Greece denied
negotiating a new bailout and a German lawmaker said there were
signs conditons for payment of Greece's next aid tranche in late
May may not be met.
 The single currency fluctuated in a $1.4267-$1.1.4378 range
and was last flat on the day at $1.4348.
 ""This seems a bit early to come up with something concrete.
I think we'll get more posturing before a deal can be agreed on
Greece,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 Jitters over a possible second bail-out package for Greece
had pushed the single currency down 0.5 percent to $1.4284,
nearing a seven-week low of $1.4254 hit the previous day.
Against the yen, the euro was up 0.5 percent at 115.79, after
sliding to a 6-week low in Asian dealing around 114.76.
 The euro's recent fall was accelerated by last week's
commodity sell-off and Monday's move by ratings agency Standard
& Poor's to cut Greece's rating to B from BB-, dragging it
further into junk territory.
 But some analysts said it was unlikely to fall as sharply as
it did a year ago when the Greek debt crisis hit financial
markets, because there was now a safety net for indebted
countries.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default and its
yield premium over German benchmark Bunds fell after the Dow
report though bond yields remained at euro-era record highs.
""It's very difficult to trade as there are so many
conflicting headlines about a restructuring being the only way
forward or not. Something will have to give,"" a bond trader
said.
 
 OIL RETREATS
 Oil prices fell more than 1 percent as the dollar firmed and
after CME Group Inc, the world's largest commodities exchange,
raised the margin call on crude futures for a fourth time since
February in an effort to curb volatility.
 Brent was 94 cents lower at $114.96, recovering from a low
of $113.58 earlier in the session. U.S. crude was $1.32 lower at
$101.23 a barrel, paring losses of more than 2 percent on
Tuesday.
 The oil price fall followed a volatile week of trading that
saw U.S. crude prices fall from over $114 a barrel -- the
highest level since 2008 -- to $94 a barrel.
 The CME's move to make it more expensive for speculators to
trade oil futures on margin, while not completely unexpected,
added to a sense that a year-long steep climb in commodity
prices is on hold for now.
 The impact of the margin hike on oil prices may be less
severe than on silver, which fell more than 30 percent in late
April due to a succession of margin hikes, sparking a sell-off
in other commodities.
 Spot silver reversed earlier losses and was last bid at
$38.49.

613,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2011 07:16AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Too early to call a bear market for copper," * Copper may see $8,000/T before tackling record high 
 * Clues in LME, Shanghai stocks
 * All bets off if BoJ prints money for rebuilding
 
 By Pratima Desai and Polly Yam
 LONDON/HONG KONG, May 10 (Reuters) - An exodus of investors
from the copper market could see prices slip to the $8,000 a
tonne mark before heading back towards record highs later this
year as stronger demand from China and Japan becomes visible.
 Copper prices tumbled with other commodities last week as
the dollar strengthened and investors fretted about consumption
after disappointing surveys of manufacturing in top consumers
China and United States.
 LME copper fell to $8,657.50 a tonne last week, its lowest
in more than 5 months and a 15-percent drop since the all-time
high. It was trading around $8,950 a tonne on Tuesday.
 China's absence from the market for some months now has also
taken its toll on sentiment. It accounts for about 40 percent of
global demand for the metal used widely in power and
construction.
 But as Chinese consumers are expected to return later this
year, Japan rebuilds its infrastructure after the earthquake in
March and inventories fall, confidence in the metal's price
prospects will grow. 
 For now though a lacklustre performance is on the cards.
 ""It could go to $8,500 a tonne or perhaps even as low as
$8,000 as investors unwind positions,"" said Stefan Graber,
commodities analyst at Credit Suisse Private Banking.
 ""But copper price weakness will be used by physical
consumers who have been waiting to step up their purchases and
replenish their inventories ... We expect reconstruction efforts
in Japan to boost consumption in the second half of the year.""
 Analysts reckon Japan normally consumes about 5 percent of
global copper supply -- estimated at around 19 million tonnes
last year. It's consumption in 2011 could jump to 10 percent of
the total estimated at around 21 million tonnes this year.
 The second half of the year is when many fund managers and
analysts think copper on the London Metal Exchange will tackle
the record high of $10,190 a tonne hit on February 15.
 Jing Chuan, chief researcher at Hua Tai Great Wall in
Shanghai said demand could pick up quickly as credit became more
easily available. 
 ""It's too early to say the bear is coming,"" he said.
 Monetary tightening to restrain inflationary pressures in
China have curbed demand and the country's copper imports, which
in the first three months of this year fell 21 percent from a
year earlier to 595,963 tonnes.
 
 BEFORE TOO LONG
 The spotlight is also on bonded stocks in Shanghai, which
analysts and traders last month estimated at between 500,000 and
700,000 tonnes, about double the levels seen last December.
 These stocks are not monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange (SHFE) and so are only estimates, but they are used as
collateral for loans, for higher-yielding investments elsewhere.
 ""Any move back to the $10,000 mark in the next few months
would again shake loose stocks held by speculators in China,""
said David Thurtell, analyst at Citi. 
 ""We believe the tight market should sustain the copper price
in an $8,000-10,000 range over the next year or so.""
 A purchasing manager for a large Chinese copper tube
producer said it will not be easy for copper prices to fall
below $8,000 a tonne and that demand for the company's products
had been strong since April.
 Analysts say other consumers in China have reported better
demand for their products -- possibly a reason why stocks in
warehouses monitored by (SHFE) have since April 1 fallen nearly
a quarter to 123,043 tonnes.
 However, stocks of copper in LME warehouses have climbed
more than 30 percent to above 468,000 tonnes since December 9.
 ""We think LME warehouse stocks will follow (Shanghai stocks)
before too long,"" Graber said.
 
 DRIVERS
 ""To see copper back at its peak we would need to see China
finished with monetary tightening,"" said Sean Corrigan, chief
investment officer at Diapason Commodities, who thinks there is
potential for copper to see $8,000 a tonne.
 ""Conversely we need another set of drivers for speculative
activity to push prices higher ... One thing we need to think
about is how much more money could the Bank of Japan print for
the reconstruction process.""
 Investors have in recent months and years borrowed and sold
cheap dollars to finance potentially higher-earning assets such
as equities, corporate debt and commodities.
 Those trades have been reinforced by an abundance of
liquidity, or dollars pumped into the global financial system by
the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
 ""But people could start using the yen again if the Bank of
Japan is led into helping to provide extra credit and if that
happens all bets are off,"" Corrigan said.
 If people start using yen to finance trades then they will
not use dollars, which may mean a higher U.S. currency and more
expensive commodities for investors who use other currencies.
 A weaker dollar has been a key factor behind commodity price
strength since 2002/2003.

616,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2011 06:44AM ET</span>","UPDATE 4-China trade surplus surges, fuel for yuan critics in U.S. talks"," * China's trade swings back to surplus of $11.4 bln in April
 * Strong trade data comes amid high-level U.S.-China talks
 * Surplus could provide fuel for foreign criticism on yuan
 * Fears of China growth slowdown seen overblown
(Adds details, background)	
 By Kevin Yao and Aileen Wang	
 BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China stormed back to post a
hefty trade surplus in April as exports hit a record while
imports eased more than expected, weighed down by sustained
monetary tightening and high commodity prices.	
 The surplus of $11.4 billion, nearly four times greater than
expected, comes as China holds high-level economic and strategic
talks in Washington and could fuel U.S. criticism that Beijing
limits the yuan's appreciation to support its exports industry.	
 The trade account swung from a small, rare trade deficit in
the first quarter, pushed by a stronger-than-anticipated 29.9
percent rise in exports over a year earlier to a record $155.7
billion.	
 Imports climbed 21.8 percent, well short of estimates and
analysts were at loggerheads whether this should be read as a
sign of surprising weakness in the world's fastest-growing
economy or simply deferred purchases because of soaring
commodity bills.	
 ""Exports are much stronger, that's the basic thing. Global
demand is still pretty strong, a bit stronger than many people
feared,"" said Tao Wang, economist with UBS in Beijing.	
 ""On the import side, we think that commodity exports had
been very strongly up until February and there has been quite a
bit of inventory build-up. So right now we think it's going
through some adjustment.""	
 But Xu Biao, an economist with China Merchants Bank in
Shenzhen, said the lower-than-expected imports might contain a
much more serious warning.	
 ""Concerns about a slowdown have certainly intensified, and
the risks of a worst-case scenario for the Chinese economy,
namely a relatively low growth rate and a high inflation, are on
the rise,"" he said.	
 The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters last
week was for exports to rise 29.4 percent and imports to grow 28
percent, resulting in a trade surplus of $3 billion.
[ID:nL3E7G51F6] 
 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, exports rose 35.1 percent in
April from a year earlier and rose 12.3 percent from the
previous month. Imports gained 27.4 percent year-on-year and 7.4
percent month-on-month, the customs administration said.	
 China's trade numbers also registered an impact from Japan's
earthquake and subsequent nuclear crisis. Imports from Japan
were $16 billion in April, down 14.9 percent from March, as
production and shipments were interrupted.

 WEAK YUAN POLICY	
 The data showed China's trade surplus with the United States
swelled 16 percent to its widest since November. 
 The data provides fresh ammunition to those U.S. lawmakers
who have linked the trade imbalance to China's currency policy,
saying a weak yuan gives Chinese manufacturers an unfair
advantage in global markets and costs American jobs.	
 China's overall trade surplus narrowed last year, but that
provided little comfort for officials in Washington because the
surplus with the United States grew 26 percent to more than $180
billion. 
 On the first of two days of talks on Monday, the United
States pressed China on a range of familiar themes, including
that Beijing should push the closely managed yuan up at a faster
pace against the dollar.	
 ""This number will likely add to the pressure from Washington
for Beijing to allow faster currency appreciation, but more
importantly should persuade Chinese policymakers that a stronger
yuan can be tolerated by the economy,"" said Brian Jackson, an
economist with the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.	
 For its part, China turned aside a chance to openly
criticise the loose U.S. monetary and fiscal policies it has
argued in the past were weakening the dollar.	
 China holds about $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves,
of which some two-thirds are estimated to be held in
dollar-based assets, so Beijing has a significant stake in the
health of the currency.	
 Higher import costs, along with the government's efforts to
rebalance the economy in favour of domestic consumption to
reduce reliance on exports, could lead to a smaller trade
surplus for 2011 from last year's $183 billion.	
 Chinese officials hope a smaller trade surplus with the rest
of the world could ease criticism from key trade partners over
the yuan.	
 Still, there are plenty of signs that the government is
tolerating faster yuan appreciation this year as it seeks to
deal with the inflationary impact of rising commodity prices.	
 China loosened the yuan from a nearly two-year
peg to the dollar in June, and this year the People's Bank of
China has guided the yuan to record highs. It has now
appreciated about 5 percent since June and 1.5 percent since the
start of this year.	
 
 NO HARD-LANDING	
 China already is the world's biggest exporter and so has
little scope to increase its exports further, while its demand
for imports is increasing in leaps and bounds alongside its
turbo-charged growth, which last year topped 10 percent.	
 Investors have long feared an abrupt slowdown in the world's
second-largest economy, which could stifle a pivotal source of
demand as a global buyer of everything from raw materials to
consumer goods as many parts of the world still struggle to
emerge from the global financial crisis.	
 The latest data showed that China, the world's
second-largest oil buyer, imported 1.7 percent more oil than a
year earlier, bringing in 5.24 million barrels per day in April,
the third highest on record on a daily basis.	
 Imports of copper were much weaker, down nearly 14 percent
from March in volume terms. But rather than heralding a sudden
drop-off in Chinese economic activity, analysts said the
shortfall indicated that firms were shunning high-priced
overseas supplies in favour of local producers and stockpiles.
[ID:nL3E7GA0E4]	
 The government sees little sign of a hard-landing in the
economy. But it is likely to raise banks' required reserves and
interest rates while letting the yuan rise at a faster clip to
combat inflation, analysts say.	
 Inflation hit a 32-month high in March of 5.4 percent,
keeping investors expectant of more policy tightening. Figures
on Wednesday are expected to show that inflation eased in April
to 5.2 percent as food prices, the main pressure behind
inflation, are now falling. [ID:nL3E7G60AQ]	
 ""I think over-tightening is the key risk for China. However,
it may be too early to call for over-tightening based only on
April imports,"" said Dongming Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank
in Singapore. 
 ""Compared with interest rate policy, maybe China may rely
more on the currency policy to tackle inflationary pressure
now.""

 By Olga Orininskaya
 ALMATY, May 10 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan may convert some
foreign currency reserves into China's yuan should it be
globally recognised as a reserve currency, something which could
happen this year, its central bank governor said on Tuesday.
 Grigory Marchenko also forecast that the yuan would soon be
used more frequently in trade between Kazakhstan and China, its
biggest export market, where the dollar still accounts for ""99
percent"" of all payments between the neighbouring countries.
 ""For the yuan to become part of (Kazakhstan's) gold and
currency reserves, it must be recognised as a convertible and
reserve currency by the world community,"" Marchenko told a news
conference. ""We believe that this will happen this year.""
 ""If at a certain moment the International Monetary Fund
officially recognises the yuan as a reserve currency ... a
pretty large amount (of reserves) can be converted from the
dollar into the yuan,"" the central bank governor said.
 He declined to estimate the amount of reserves that could be
converted into yuan. Kazakhstan, Central Asia's largest economy
and oil producer, had net gold and foreign currency reserves of
$36.4 billion on April 30, up from $34.6 billion on March 31.
 China, which owns about a quarter of Kazakhstan's crude oil
output, became the most lucrative export market for Kazakh
commodities last year, accounting for 17 percent of Kazakhstan's
total exports in U.S. dollar terms.
 Marchenko said that, while the International Monetary Fund
had yet to decide on the status of the yuan, the central banks
of Kazakhstan and China had reached agreement on currency swap
deals.
 ""If we effectively transit to payments in national
currencies among the countries of the customs union with China,
then, respectively, demand for the dollar for mutual payments is
set to decrease,"" he said.
 He was referring to the creation of a customs union between
Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
 
 TENGE BOOST
 Less demand for the U.S. currency would signal further
appreciation of Kazakhstan's tenge currency, already buoyed this
year by high world prices for Kazakh oil and metals.
 Marchenko said the central bank was now buying fewer dollars
on the domestic market to curb tenge appreciation. Official data
show the central bank bought about $1 billion in April, compared
with around $6 billion between January and mid-March.
 ""Accordingly, this means one can hope that the rate will
steadily come to a comfortable and balanced level,"" he said.
 ""There are already some estimates that this level may be in
the neighbourhood of 144.6-144.7 tenge (per dollar),"" he said.
 The weighted average of the tenge on Tuesday was 145.90 per
dollar.
 Marchenko said the tenge rate could test other levels,
depending on prices for Kazakh commodity exports, on the share
of earnings which exporters sell on the domestic market and on
demand for the dollar.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro pared losses in volatile
trade on Tuesday on a media report, later denied, that heavily
indebted Greece could agree a new rescue deal next month to help
it meet its funding requirements in the next two years.
 The euro rose around half a cent to trade as high as $1.4376
after Dow Jones quoted a senior Greek official as saying that a
new deal could be struck as early as June. It later fell back
after Greece denied it was discussing a new package and a German
MP questioned whether Greece had met the terms for its next aid
tranche, and was last trading around $1.4330, a touch softer on
the day.. Traders said a semi-official name was seen selling
around the day's highs.
 ""This seems a bit early to come up with something concrete.
I think we'll get more posturing before a deal can be agreed on
Greece,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 Greece must follow the steps laid down in its budget
adjustment programme before any additional loans can be
considered, European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo
Bini Smaghi said on Tuesday.
 Asked about the possibility of a new loan being extended to
Greece, Bini Smaghi said the Athens government had to press on
with what had already been agreed.
 ""Our view is that policy makers will probably not want to
derail the European banking industry in the midst of stress
tests, and further Greek aid will probably be forthcoming,"" said
Chris Turner, head of fx strategy at ING in a note.
 ""However, the euro may stay on the soft side running into
next week's EcoFin meeting,"" he added.
 On Monday, Standard and Poor's cut Greece's rating to B from
BB-, dragging it further into junk territory, saying its
projections suggest that debt reductions, or haircuts, of
between 50 and 70 percent of the bonds' original value could be
needed to make Greece's debt burden sustainable.
 Coupled with a media report last week -- later emphatically
denied by European policymakers -- that Greece may be
considering exiting the euro, it highlighted the dilemma of how
best to extricate the country from its debt quagmire, pushing
the euro to a three-week low of $1.4254 on Monday.
 
PROFIT TAKING
Traders said macro accounts had started to take profit on
their euro short positions, with others market players also
thinking selling was becoming overdone in the near term after
the euro fell from a 17-month high of $1.4939 hit last week.
 ""We need a fresh trigger to go lower in the euro from here.
I think we're in a $1.43/1.46 range for now,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS.
 The euro's 55-day moving average, now at $1.4246, is seen as
major support. But a break there could put it on course to test
support around $1.4150 -- near its April 18 low of $1.4156 --
and a 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's rise, around
$1.4145.
 Recent weakness in the euro, initially triggered by
disappointment over a lack of hints on a rate hike next month
from the European Central bank last week, accelerated as panic
selling in the commodities market prompted investors to shun
risk.
 Because rising oil and commodities have been at the root of
inflation that has pushed the European Central Bank to tighten
policy, declines in oil prices could make investors scale back
their expectations of ECB rate hikes.
 The euro was up around 0.3 percent against the yen at 115.84
yen after sliding to a 6-week low in Asian dealing around
114.76.
The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 80.76 yen, well above a
seven-week trough of 79.57 yen hit last week.
The Swiss franc fell to session lows against the dollar and
the euro after data showed Swiss CPI inflation rose 0.1 percent
month-on-month in April, well below forecasts for a 0.6 percent
rise, denting the chances of a rate hike from the Swiss National
Bank in June.
 The dollar gained more than 50 pips to 0.8804 francs, its
strongest in nearly two weeks. The greenback was steady versus a
currency basket at 74.722.

 WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The head of China's central
bank on Monday fended off a question about the weakening U.S.

major currencies in recent years.
 ""From our perspective, we've already become accustomed to

efforts to rein in its budget deficit.
 Zhou, who is here for the annual U.S.-China Strategic and
Economic Dialogue, also treaded carefully around other
sensitive issues, including the Standard and Poor's credit
agency's recent warning on the U.S. debt outlook.
 ""Our view is very close to the whole world's -- that major

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
three-week low against the U.S. dollar on Monday, with renewed
worries about the euro zone's heavily indebted economies
suggesting more losses could be in store for the single
currency.
 Standard and Poor's cut Greece's rating to B from BB-,
dragging it further into junk territory on concerns a debt
restructuring is increasingly likely. Moody's threatened to cut
Athen's ratings by several notches. For details, see
[ID:nLDE7480MK]
 Any changes to Greece's debt structure are likely to prompt
a call for more favorable terms from other nations who are
struggling under heavy debt burdens and receiving financial
aid, adding to fears about the euro zone economy.
 The euro dropped to a low near $1.4250, about 7 cents below
its recent 17-month high around $1.4940 reached last Wednesday.
While it remains too early to tell if the euro is back on a
downward trend, the speed of the latest correction suggests the
currency could remain under pressure in the coming days.
 ""The euro is very much in a reversal at the moment,"" said
Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
""We should have seen some sort of bounce over the last 36
hours. We haven't seen that. All we are seeing is renewed
selling pressure on any euro rallies.""
 The euro fell as low as $1.4254 on trading platform EBS
, the lowest since April 19, breaking through
technical support at its 50-day moving average of $1.4279. It
later recovered slightly to trade at $1.4333, up 0.2 percent on
the day.
 Technical analysts said a sustained break of the 50-day
simple moving average could see broader correction lower
towards $1.4020/30, followed by $1.3950.
 The euro volatility ""confirms the whole market skittishness
about the viability of the peripheral economies,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, head of research at GFT Forex. ""More draconian
measures will be necessary to stabilize the situation with a
broader solution as Ireland and Portugal will want more
favorable terms if Greece gets them.""
 The euro started a sell-off last week after panic selling
in the commodities market prompted investors to shun risk. Its
losses accelerated on Friday after a German news report, which
was later denied, suggested Greece had raised the possibility
of leaving the euro zone.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group of euro zone finance
ministers, late on Friday dismissed a report in Germany's
Spiegel Online magazine that Greece could withdraw from the
17-member euro zone.
 While few market players think Greece is likely to drop out
of the euro, the European Union is under pressure to
renegotiate its financial bailouts of Ireland and Greece with
an Irish minister saying any concessions given to Athens should
mean better terms for Dublin as well. [ID:nLDE7470E8]
 ""The Greek situation is like a slow motion car crash. The
politicians know they have to dip into the pockets to find a
solution to the problems facing Greece,"" said Jeremy Stretch
head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets in London. 
 The euro was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 115.16
yen  after earlier falling to its lowest since late
March.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - New-found worries that Greece
may be forced to restructure its debt dragged the euro lower on
Monday and took a toll on European equities, while commodities
staged a recovery after last week's rout.
 After struggling to push higher throughout the morning,
U.S. stocks rose to session highs by midday as
resource-related shares mounted strong gains on the higher
commodities prices, overshadowing fears of the European debt
crisis.
 The European Union said it was talking about lowering
interest rates on the bailout loans extended to Greece and
Ireland in order to prevent a restructuring, but comments by
ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Monday that more radical
measures would be needed fueled investors' risk aversion. For

Monday, citing an increased risk of a debt restructuring and
saying that a principle reduction of 50 percent or more on
Greek debt may be needed. [ID:nLDE7481EG]
 Yields on Greek and Portuguese debt rose, with five-year
Greek paper  offering around 22 percent.
 Falls in European bank stocks led European equities lower
and the euro fell for the fourth day in a row. The currency
earlier had rebounded from last week's losses.
 The euro volatility ""confirms the whole market skittishness
about the viability of the peripheral economies,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, head of research at GFT Forex. ""More draconian
measures will be necessary to stabilize the situation with a
broader solution as Ireland and Portugal will want more
favorable terms if Greece gets them.""
 CLOUD ON THE MARKET
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.4267 , the lowest
since April 19, bringing its losses over the last four sessions
to 3.8 percent, according to Reuters data, the biggest four-day
drop since May 2010.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 stock index <.FTEU3> provisionally
ended down 0.4 percent. Shares of banks, which are seen as
exposed through Greek bond holdings, suffered.
 ""Generally the growth is insufficient to finance the cost
of the burden of the debt for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. If
Greece restructures its debt, people will start to ask where
next,"" said Andrea Williams, who manages 1.3 billion pounds in
assets for Royal London Asset Management.
 Banks were among the heaviest losers on the back of
concerns about potential losses for private bondholders in the
event of debt restructuring, with the STOXX Europe 600 banking
index .SX7P down 1.2 percent.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
down 0.4 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 58.58
points, or 0.46 percent, to 12,697.32. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> added 6.61 points, or 0.49 percent, to
1,346.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 17.77
points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,845.33.
 ""Europe continues to be a regular cloud on the market,""
inserting caution in the market's bullish mood, said Christian
Magoon, CEO of Magoon Capital in Lisle, Illinois.
 The energy and materials sectors were the best performers
on the S&P 500 as the Reuters/Jefferies commodities index
<.CRB> jumped 1.7 percent.
 While few market players think Greece is likely to drop out
of the euro, the European Union is under pressure to
renegotiate its financial bailouts of Ireland and Greece, with
an Irish minister saying any concessions given to Athens should
mean better terms for Dublin as well. [ID:nLDE7470E8]
 ""The Greek situation is like a slow motion car crash. The
politicians know they have to dip into the pockets to find a
solution to the problems facing Greece,"" said Jeremy Stretch
head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets in London. 
 The euro was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 115.15 yen
 after earlier falling to its lowest since late
March.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 80.73 yen
, off last week's seven-week low.

 Bargain hunting helped oil prices rebound with Brent crude
futures  up more than $3 at $112.67 a barrel, following
last week's 12.8 percent slump. Spot silver  rose to
$36.95 after bearing the brunt of last week's commodity
sell-off.
 ""We went through a pretty hefty sell-off for all markets,""
said Tony Machacek, an oil trader at Bache Commodities. ""It
smacked of funds getting sell-stops triggered. Now that long
liquidation has been done, everything seems to be stabilizing.""

623,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2011 05:45AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Russia could prolong full grain export ban," * May crop development and summer weather key for decision
 * Limited, policed, amount of wheat may be released in July
 * End of ban bearish but delay to Dec would make prices soar
 
 By Sybille de La Hamaide and Karl Plume
 PARIS/CHICAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - Russia's embargo on grain
exports is due to expire on July 1, but traders on international
markets think Moscow will likely play it safe and wait until
end-September for a full lifting of the ban.
 However, if crops develop well it may release some wheat in
July to relieve hefty stocks in its south.
 Any reopening of the gates would be bearish for grain prices
although the drop could be softened by rising concerns about
deteriorating harvests in other key producers including Europe
and the United States.
 Russia, the world's former third-largest wheat exporter,
halted grain exports from mid-August last year after the worst
drought in over a century which devastated crops.
 Speculation has mounted on whether Moscow will stick to its
July date after government members hinted they may extend the
ban.
 Most European and U.S. traders said they believed Moscow
would wait until end-September or October. Moscow will remember
that last year's crops were ravaged in July, after the ban's
expiry date.
 ""Keeping in mind the lessons of the previous season the
government will try to buy some time and wait until some
preliminary crop reports,"" an international trader specialised
in the Black Sea region said.
 A parliamentary election in December and a presidential one
in March 2012 would also play a role. The government may want to
avoid measures that would boost food prices but at the same time
gain the votes of farmers who saw their revenues plunge.
 Russian wheat prices are around a third below international
ones and should jump when the export gates open.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday said ""crop results
must convince us that we fully satisfy our internal necessities
and build up reserves necessary for the country"" before
restarting grain exports.
 Meetings scheduled at the end of May could give leads on
what may happen in the months to come.
 
 LIMITED JULY EXPORTS?
 Moscow could release some grain as early as July as it faces
high pressure to relieve oversupplied farmers in the southern
region, who cannot ship to deficit regions for lack of
infrastructure and fear they will not have enough space in silos
when the new crop comes in late July.
 That would pay lip service to the July 1 date, an attractive
option for Moscow as it wants to restore its credibility as a
grain supplier. The ban imposed without warning hit many major
grain exporters left without material.
 Operators willing to make a bet said they expected a wheat
export quota at around 2-3 million tonnes, potentially taxed.
 ""Whatever the crop, there is a very good chance they will
release at least two million tonnes in July,"" France's Agritel
Michel Portier said.
 Many operators said the probability of an early easing was
supported by talk that wheat in the southern part of Russia had
already been moved into position to be shipped for export.
 ""Most people believe they will lift it for a limited tonnage
(in July) but it will be policed,"" Geneva-based Agrinews analyst
James Dunsterville said.
 Some observers were more cautious.
 ""There's all sorts of talk that wheat is moving into
position to be shipped, but there is no way that the government
is going to open the door for exports until they know what their
crops are,"" Roy Huckabay, analyst with The U.S. Linn Group said.
 
 WEATHER CRUCIAL
 A full end of the export ban would depend on weather in the
next weeks, and over the summer.
 ""If all goes well it's July for a quota, if not it will
certainly not be before October,"" a French trader said.
 Russia forecast it will produce 85-90 million tonnes of
grain this year, up 50 percent on the drought-hit 2010 output
reduced to 61 million tonnes, but still down on the 97 million
tonnes of grain in 2009 and 108 million in 2008.
 Based on sowings and the weather so far, operators estimate
it will produce around 50-55 million tonnes of wheat this year.
Operators' export estimates for 2011/2012 range from 6 to 11
million tonnes, up from less than 4 million in 2010/2011 but
likely lower than the previous seasons.
 ""I don't expect them to come back and export the volumes we
say two or three or four years ago, maybe something of a more
modest program,"" said Shawn McCambridge, grains analyst with
Prudential Bache Commodities.
 Any softening in Russia's ban would be bearish for EU and
U.S. prices. The market has been boosted by unusually dry
weather in Western Europe and parts of the United States, and
rainfall slowing planting in the U.S. Corn Belt.
 Supply concerns was great enough to shield wheat prices frm
last week's commodities price drops. 
 But traders agreed that global grain prices would soar if
Moscow decided to postpone a decision until year-end, worried
that lifting the ban could boost internal prices.
 The ban in August last year pushed wheat futures prices up
10 percent in intraday trade in Europe and 16 percent the next
day on U.S. markets.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - European and Wall Street stocks
slipped and the euro fell on Monday on concern about revised
bailout plans for Greece and other euro zone countries, while
commodity markets recovered partially from last week's rout.
 Concern that Greece may be forced to restructure its debt
pushed euro zone officials into talking about lowering the
interest rates on the EU-IMF bailout plan for Greece and
possibly Ireland also over the weekend. For details, see
[ID:nLDE7480MK]
 Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's cut Greece's credit rating
to B from BB- on Monday, dragging it further into junk
territory over concerns that a debt restructuring is
increasingly likely. [ID:nLDE7481EG]
 ""In our view, there is increased risk that Greece will take
steps to restructure the terms of its commercial debt,
including its previously-issued government bonds,"" the agency
said in a statement, warning that more downgrades could come.
 S&P said Athens may have to reduce the principal by 50
percent or more.
 Yields on Greek and Portuguese debt rose, with five-year
Greek paper  offering around 22 percent.
 The S&P news pushed European stocks lower, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 stock index <.FTEU3> down 0.5 percent. Banks,
which are seen as exposed through Greek bond holdings, led the
way down.
 ""This has potential to disrupt the market in the near term
as it looks increasingly likely that we will see another
adjustment package for Greece,"" said Klaus Wiener, chief
economist at Generali Investments.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
down 0.7 percent.
 Wall Street stocks slipped early but were little changed
midmorning with the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> up
24.10 points, or 0.19 percent, to 12,662.84. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 2.63 points, or 0.20 percent, to
1,342.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 5.48 points,
or 0.19 percent, to 2,833.04.
 The euro recovered from last week's steep drop, but
nervousness around sovereign debt muted gains.
 The rebound in various commodity prices after their rout
last week also helped to pull up the euro from a three-week
low.
 The euro  was slightly weaker mid morning around
$1.4283, after falling 3.0 pct last week.
 Bargain hunting also helped oil prices rebound with Brent
crude futures  up $2.83 to $112.22 a barrel, following
last week's 12.8 percent slump. Spot silver  rose to
$36.91 after bearing the brunt of last week's commodity
sell-off.

 NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Monday
after a strong sell off last week, but euro zone debt worries
continued to mute gains, particularly after a ratings downgrade
of Greece.
 The euro pared gains after Standard and Poor's cut Greece's
rating to B from BB-, dragging it further into junk territory
over concerns that a debt restructuring is increasingly likely.

 Any changes to Greece's debt structure are also likely to

 By Anirban Nag and Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - The euro bounced on Monday as
Asian and Middle East sovereign investors scooped it up after
last week's selloff, although bloated long positions and euro
zone debt worries pointed to downside risks.
 Technical indicators also suggested the euro could ease,
although a rebound in some commodities after their rout last
week helped risk appetite and ensured the single currency stayed
well above a three-week low hit against the dollar last week.
 The euro continues to be supported by favourable rate
differentials with the European Central Bank expected to raise
interest rates further this year. A record surge in German
exports in March showed its recovery remained on track, helping
to support the single currency.
 However, with data showing bullish bets on the euro rose to
their highest since July 2007 and concerns over Greek debt
returning to the fore, the currency's outlook remained
uncertain.
 ""The latest euro rebound notwithstanding we suspect that it
would take a more lasting resolution of the problems of the euro
periphery to see it returning to its recent highs against other
G10 majors,"" said Valentin Marinov, fx strategist at Citi.
 The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.4385, after a 3.3 percent
fall in the past two sessions took it to a three-week low around
$1.4310. It fell late on Friday following a German news report,
which was later denied, that suggested Greece had raised the
possibility of leaving the euro zone.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group of euro zone finance
ministers, late on Friday dismissed a report in Germany's
Spiegel Online magazine that Greece could withdraw from the
17-member euro zone.
 While few market players think Greece is likely to drop out
of the euro, the European Union is under pressure to renegotiate
its financial bailouts of Ireland and Greece with an Irish

better terms for Dublin as well.

head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
 Chartists say a break below the euro's 50-day moving average
at $1.4279 could signal a broader correction lower towards
$1.4020/30, the lows struck on March 28.
 The euro gained 0.7 percent to 116.20 yen, rebounding from a
five-week low of 115.23 yen on Friday.
 Meanwhile, the dollar was up 0.1 percent at 80.74 yen, off
last week's seven-week low of 79.57 yen, and not far from
Friday's high of 80.95 yen hit after upbeat U.S. jobs data.
 Friday's data showed U.S. employers added 244,000 jobs last
month, well above expectations. The dollar index was down 0.3
percent at 74.591.
 The data also helped to underpin risk appetite, boosting
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Commodity currencies were supported on Monday by a rebound in
oil prices, after a plunge in oil, silver and other commodities
last week triggered profit taking.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0755, extending

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Concern about plans for a
fundamental review of the bailouts given to Europe's high
debtors hit European stocks on Monday and drove up the bond
yields of troubled euro zone economies.
 Wall Street, however, looked set to open with gains.
 The euro itself rebounded from recent sharp losses.
Commodity prices firmed, bouncing back from their biggest weekly
drop since 2008 as the dollar eased back.
 The focus in Europe was on the implications of Friday's
unusual and secretive meeting of selected financial officials
who discussed the need for new adjustments to Greece's aid
programme.
 It was not clear to what extent such a move would also
trigger adjustments to similar repayment plans for Ireland and
Portugal. An Irish minister said any concession to Athens should
mean better terms for Dublin as well.
 Rumours about a full-on restructuring of Greek debt have
roiled European markets for several weeks now.
 Yields on Greek and Portuguese debt rose, with five-year
Greek paper offering around 22 percent.
 The cost of insuring Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt
against default also rose, with investors increasingly concerned
that Greece may have to dilute its repayment terms for private
bondholders.
 By contrast, yields on core euro zone bonds fell as
investors bought into their relative safety.
 Traders said the market was reacting to ""a lot of noise"" --
suggesting that investors wanted clarity on what was happening
in the euro zone.
 Amid the uncertainty, the FTSEurofirst 300 stock index fell
half a percent, with banks, seen as exposed through Greek bond
holdings, taking a hit.
 ""Investors should remain cautious about assets in the euro
zone peripheries due to increased uncertainties and should
switch into the core,"" said Andy Lynch, who manages 2.5 billion
euros ($3.6 billion) for Schroders.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index was down about a
third of a percent, also hurt by a two-thirds of a percent loss
in Japan.
 
 EURO REBOUNDS
 The euro recovered a bit from last week's steep drop, which
was brought on both by an apparent delay in the European Central
Bank's next rate rise move and by dollar-boosting U.S. jobs
data, which came in stronger than expected on Friday.
 The rebound in various commodity prices after their rout
last week also helped to pull up the euro from a three-week low.
 ""The bounce has seen the euro rise past $1.44, but the
market is a bit cautious given the overextended position in
currencies,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at
HSBC.
 The euro was up 0.6 percent at around $1.44, after a 3.3
percent fall in the past two sessions took it to a three-week
low around $1.4310.
 The dollar was down a third of a percent against a basket of
major currencies.
 This, along with the better U.S. economic data, helped
demand for commodities, which are priced in dollars.
 Brent crude futures rose more than $3.50 to $112.82 a barrel
as the dollar weakened and some traders and investors went
bargain hunting after last week's sell-off.
 Spot gold rose 0.8 percent, following its biggest weekly
loss since the first quarter of 2009. Silver, copper and wheat
also rose.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 9 (Reuters) - The yuan closed little changed
on the dollar on Monday as a sharp rebound in the U.S. dollar
index raised investor concerns over how much the People's
Bank of China may allow the yuan to appreciate in the future.	
 Before trading began, the PBOC fixed the yuan's daily
mid-point versus the dollar at a record high but traders said
the fixing was not a show of determination to let the yuan rise
irregardless of global market conditions.	
 Traders said Monday's fixing appeared to be a goodwill
gesture to the United States ahead of the crucial U.S.-China
Strategic and Economic Dialogue later in the day in Washington.	
 China, wielding its huge dollar holdings, has pressed
Washington to tackle its huge fiscal deficit and said it would
raise the issue of discrimination against Chinese investors at
the high-level talks. 
 Chinese officials made clear that U.S. demands for Beijing
to raise sharply the value of the yuan and to end a crackdown on
dissent -- both irritants in ties between the world's two
biggest economies -- would gain little ground. [ID:nL3E7G60IW]	
 ""The market is jittery over the impact of the steep rebound
of the dollar on yuan appreciation,"" said a U.S. bank trader in
Shanghai. ""That concern offsets the PBOC's record high fixing.""	
 Spot yuan closed at 6.4939 versus the dollar,
compared with Friday's close of 6.4938. It has appreciated 5.11
percent since it was depegged from the dollar in June 2010, and
1.47 percent since the start of this year.	
 Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.4988 against the dollar, stronger than Friday's 6.5003. The
central bank uses the mid-point to express the governments'
intention for the yuan's movements.	
 
 
 ALL ABOUT PACE	
 The PBOC has guided the yuan to a slew of record highs this
year, with a rise of 0.9 percent in April, accelerating from 0.4
percent in March, due in part to a general surge in global
commodity prices.	
 But the benchmark Reuters Jefferies CRB index , which
covers 19 mostly U.S.-traded commodities, has slumped nearly 10
percent this month, along with a rally in the U.S. currency.	
 Traders said the latest global market developments may
affect the pace of yuan gains but will have little impact on the
overall direction of yuan appreciation in 2011.	
 ""Fighting inflation is only part of the reasons behind yuan
appreciation,"" said a Chinese bank trader in Shenzhen.	
 ""China has even a bigger domestic task for its currency's
rises -- to adjust its economic structure to ease the reliance
on exports for its economic development."" [ID:nTOE71H052]	
 Traders said they retained the forecast for the yuan to
appreciate 5 to 6 percent for all of 2011, compared with a 1.5
percent rise in the four months of this year, but they saw no
major government currency policy changes, such as a one-off yuan
revaluation, in the near future. [ID:nL3E7G303J]

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - The euro bounced back on Monday as
some sovereign investors viewed its selloff late last week on
concerns about Greek debt as overdone given still favourable
interest rate differentials.
 Technical indicators however suggest gains could be
temporary.
 A rebound in some commodity prices after their rout last
week also helped to pull the euro up from a three-week low hit
last week as it boosted risk appetite. It also lifted
growth-linked currencies like the Australian dollar.
 The euro continues to be supported by favourable rate
differentials with the European Central Bank expected to raise
interest rates further this year. However, with bullish bets on
the euro at their highest since July 2007, the single currency
could see a move lower, before heading back towards the $1.50
level. [ID:nN06253186].
 ""The bounce has seen the euro rise past $1.44, but the
market is a bit cautious given the overextended position in
currencies,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at
HSBC.
 The euro gained 0.8 percent to $1.4430 , after a 3.3
percent fall in the past two sessions took it to a three-week
low around $1.4310. It fell late on Friday following a German
news report, which was later denied, that suggested Greece had
raised the possibility of leaving the euro zone.
 Chartists say that with the euro having broken below
trendline support at $1.4380 from the Feb. 14 lows, the onus has
shifted towards the downside. A break below the $1.4280/90 area
-- the 50-day moving average -- would signal a broader
correction lower towards $1.4020/30, the lows struck on March
28, they say.
 Talk of an option expiry at $1.45 was also doing the rounds
in European trade.
 ""Given the fast pace of the euro's rise up until last week,
I wouldn't be surprised if the euro falls below $1.42,"" said a
Japanese bank trader in Tokyo.
 Against the yen, the euro gained 0.7 percent on Monday to
116.20 yen , rebounding from a five-week low of 115.23
yen on Friday.
 
 EZ PERIPHERY WEIGHS ON EURO
 Uncertainty over how the euro zone will tackle the prolonged
debt crisis in some peripheral member countries will continue to
weigh on the euro, according to some analysts. Others, however,
believe that after a shakeout of the extended bullish positions
in the currency, investors will shift focus to interest rate
expectations.
 ""The Greek situation is like a slow motion car crash. The
politicians know they have to dip into the pockets to find a
solution to the problems facing Greece,"" said Jeremy Stretch
head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
 ""But the fact that the euro has held above its 50-day moving
average at $1.4280 is a signal that the euro could bounce above
$1.45 by the middle of the week.""
 Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group of euro zone finance
ministers, late on Friday dismissed a report in Germany's
Spiegel Online magazine that Greece could withdraw from the
17-member euro zone.
 While few market players think Greece is likely to drop out
of the euro, the European Union is under pressure to renegotiate
its financial bailouts of Ireland and Greece with an Irish
minister saying any concessions given to Athens should mean
better terms for Dublin as well. [ID:nLDE7470E8]
 That would complicate the EU's efforts to rescue indebted
countries, as more concessions could mean more losses for many
European banks that hold Greek and Irish debt.
 Meanwhile, the dollar was flat at 80.65 yen , off last
week's seven-week low of 79.57 yen, though it is still below
Friday's high of 80.95 yen hit after upbeat U.S. jobs data.
 Friday's data showed U.S. employers added 244,000 jobs last
month, well above expectations. The dollar's gains were limited
though as U.S. bond yields barely rose on the data.
 The data also strengthened investor risk appetite, helping
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Commodity currencies were supported on Monday by a rebound in
oil prices, after a plunge in oil, silver and other commodities
last week triggered profit taking.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $1.0770 ,
extending gains on Friday after the Australian central bank said
rate hikes would be needed in future to contain inflation.

 * Export quantities unlikely to be huge
 * Policymakers struggle over food bill details
 * India currently needs about 4 mln T grains a month for
poor

 By Krittivas Mukherjee	
 NEW DELHI, May 9 (Reuters) - India's grain bins are
overflowing and the forecast for a normal monsoon promises
another bumper crop, but political disagreement over a bill to
secure food rights for the poor means the country is expected to
steer clear of large-scale exports.	
 Shipments from the world's second-biggest producer of wheat,
sugar and rice could come as a relief for governments across
Asia who are trying to combat food-led inflation, but India
needs to know how much to put aside for the food security bill
before taking any decision on overseas sales.	
 ""Ensuring supplies to the government's welfare schemes are
more important than allowing exports for private trade,"" a
senior food ministry official told Reuters on condition of
anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue.	
 ""Exports will be allowed after assessing local demand. The
food security bill will spell out the demand for food grains.""	
 But there is little clarity on when the food bill, an
election promise from the ruling Congress party, could be
ratified by parliament.	
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wants to introduce the bill in
parliament this year but members of the National Advisory
Council (NAC), which is helping the government draft the bill,
and finance ministry officials think the target is too
ambitious.	
 The NAC, headed by Sonia Gandhi, the powerful chief of the
Congress party, has suggested widening subsidies to 75 percent
of the billion-plus population. India currently provides
subsidised grains to about 30 percent of its people.	
 But the finance ministry and the planning commission, which
charts India's economic development, are seeking a lower number
of beneficiaries, mindful of its impact on the country's plans
to cut the fiscal deficit to a targeted 4.6 percent in 2011/12.	
 India will also need to weigh concerns about persistently
high food inflation, currently just under 9 percent, against
leaving stores to rot when global prices are near record highs.	
 And then there is the uncertainty of monsoon forecasts.	
 ""Betting on a favourable monsoon you may get it right, but
what if you get it wrong? Will the opposition spare you if you
have to go and buy at current global prices?"" a senior leader of
India's Congress party, which heads the country's coalition
government, told Reuters.	
 A failed monsoon could force India into the international
markets as a buyer, as happened in 2009, when India suffered its
worst drought since 1972 after initial forecasts had called for
normal rains. That year, India had to import sugar, driving up
global prices to their highest in three decades.

 LARGE EXPORTS UNLIKELY	
 Wheat reserves have swelled to more than double the
government's target of 8.2 million tonnes, and rice output is
expected to be well above demand, prompting industry and trade
to demand that export curbs are lifted. [ID:nN02253953]	
 Exports of all but small amounts of special quality rice
remain restricted, while on wheat a decision is still pending
after the farm minister called for lifting the ban. A panel of
ministers headed by India's finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee,
is yet to take a call on allowing wheat exports.	
 But huge domestic stocks are seen by an inflation-hit
government more as an insurance against high global prices than
an impetus to sell overseas, analysts said.	
 U.S. wheat futures  leapt about 47 percent last year as
inclement weather in various places, including the Black Sea
region, slashed global supplies. This year, prices are down
about 8 percent, but investors have been coming back to the
market on crop weather concerns in the U.S. and Europe. 
 Traders said Indian wheat prices were around $300 per tonne
free on board, while importers such as Japan and Iran are
currently importing U.S. wheat at around $360 a tonne,
indicating competitiveness of Indian wheat.	
 ""Even within the government there is disagreement - the farm
ministry wants exports, the food ministry doesn't because it is
worried about inflation,"" said political commentator Paranjoy
Guha Thakurta.	
 ""Until you have clarity over the food security bill you will
not have free flowing exports.""	
 The NAC wants the poorest of families to be given 35 kg (77
lbs) of rice at 6 US cents a kg a month, with those a bit better
off to be given 20 kg.	
 About 40 percent of India's 1.2 billion population lives
below the U.N. estimated poverty line. India currently needs
around 4 million tonnes of grain every month to sell to the poor
at cheaper rates.	
 The proposed food law could double the nearly $12 billion in
the year to end-March 2011 -- about 1 percent of gross domestic
product and 5 percent of total government spending -- that India
spent to provide cheap grains and pulses through a public
distribution system.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - The euro bounced back on Monday as
some funds scooped it up after a steep drop last week but
speculators' bloated long positions in the currency pointed to a
risk of further falls even after policymakers denied a report
that Greece may consider quitting the euro zone.
 A rebound in various commodity prices after their
rout last week also helped to pull up the euro from its
three-week low hit last week and lifted commodity currencies.
 But traders were not sure if the worst was yet
over for commodities, and said that the euro looks vulnerable
after the European Central Bank last week quelled expectations
of a rate hike next month.
 ""Given the fast pace of the euro's rise up until
last week, I wouldn't be surprised if the euro falls below
$1.42,"" said a Japanese bank trader in Tokyo.
 One possible target for the euro is a 38.2 pct
retracement of its rally this year at around $1.4150.
 The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.4389  after a 3.3
percent fall in the past two sessions that took it to a
three-week low around $1.4310.
 It extended losses late on Friday following a German news
report, which was later denied, that suggested Greece had raised
the possibility of leaving the euro zone.
 Against the yen, the euro gained nearly 0.7 percent on
Monday to 116.20 yen  after falling to a five-week low
of 115.23 yen on Friday.
 ""(The report on Greece) was just a trigger. In reality, the
market is being driven by flows and positioning. It just shows
how long the market had become in the euro,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank.
 Indeed, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission released on Friday showed speculators had extended
euro long positions to 99,516 contracts in the week to May 3,
the highest since July 2007, from 68,279 contracts the week
before. [ID:nN06253186]
 While some of the long positions are likely to have been
unwound already in the euro's tumble late last week, traders
said that a large number of euro long positions are left, making
it vulnerable.
 ""One of this week's focuses is Chinese data. I suspect a
weak reading is likely to cause a reaction in the euro,"" the
Japanese bank dealer said. Chinese inflation and industrial
production data is due on Wednesday.
 HAUNTING THE EURO
 Some market players think uncertainty over how the euro zone
will tackle debt crises in some of its member countries could
haunt the euro.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group of euro zone finance
ministers, has denied the report in Germany's Spiegel Online
magazine that the talks were held to discuss the possibility,
raised by Athens, of Greece withdrawing from the 17-member euro
zone, as well as the idea of restructuring Greece's 327 billion
euro ($470 billion) sovereign debt.
 While few market players think Greece is likely to drop out
of the euro in the near future, the European Union is under
pressure to renegotiate its financial bailouts of Ireland and
Greece with an Irish minister saying any concessions given to
Athens should mean better terms for Dublin as well.
 That would complicate the EU's efforts to rescue indebted
countries, as more concessions could mean more losses for many
European banks that hold Greek and Irish debt.
 Still, Some market players think that the euro could rebound
soon, with its yield advantage over the dollar remaining intact
as the euro zone's debt problems are hardly new to any
investors.
 ""Everyone knows there are debt problems but the
market has been buying the euro nonetheless this year. It has
decided they should ignore the debt problems and focus on yield
gaps instead,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of forex at State
Street in Tokyo.
 ""For the market to speak out and say the king is
not wearing clothes, it needs a bigger catalyst,"" Tomita said,
adding that a larger political backlash against bailout schemes
may be a possible trigger for that to happen.
 For now, the euro and commodity currencies are
being helped by a rebound in oil prices, after diving prices for
various commodities, ranging from silver to oil, last week
triggered profit-taking in the euro.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0750 ,
extending its gains following comments from the Australian
central bank that rate hikes will be needed in the future to
contain inflation.
 Friday's data showing U.S. employers added 244,000 jobs last
month, well above economist expectations, also strengthened
investor risk appetite, helping higher-yielding currencies such
as the euro and the Australian dollar.
 The data also helped to boost the U.S. dollar against the
Japanese yen, though gains were limited as U.S. bond yields have
hardly risen on the data.
 The dollar stood at 80.65 yen , off last week's
seven-week low of 79.57 yen, though it is still below Friday's
high of 80.95 yen hit after the U.S. payroll data.

 May 9 (Reuters) - By Joshua Schneyer	
 NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - When oil prices fell below $120
a barrel in early New York trade last Thursday, a few big
companies that are major oil consumers started buying around
$117.	
 It looked like a bargain. Brent crude had been trading above
$120 for a month. But the buying proved ill-timed. Crude kept on
falling.	
 ""They were down millions by the end of the day, trying to
catch a falling piano,"" an executive at a major New York
investment bank said.	
 Never before had crude oil plummeted so deeply during the
course of a day. At one point, prices were off by nearly $13 a
barrel, dipping below $110 a barrel for the first time since
March.	
 Oil's descent followed the biggest one-day price drop in
silver since 1980 on Wednesday, after hedge fund titan George
Soros was reported to be selling. Exchange operators raised
silver's margin requirements, making it more costly to trade the
metal and sending investors out of the market. Silver plunged by
20 percent, more by week's end. The rout unnerved some commodity
investors.	
 Oil just doesn't fall by 10 percent in the course of a
normal day, though. In commodities markets, oil is king, and its
daily contract turnover, typically around $200 billion, is
usually able to absorb even large inflows or outflows of
investment.	
 The rare moves of $10 a barrel usually are set off by
dramatic events -- the outbreak of the first Gulf War in 1991,
or the collapse in 2008 of Lehman Bros bank, which both led to
recessions.	
 Of course, there was major news last week. But the daring
Pakistan raid that killed Osama Bin Laden had done little to
shift the balance of oil markets on Monday.	
 In interviews with more than two dozen fund managers,
bankers and traders, no clear cause emerged for the plunge in
price. Market players were unable to identify any single bank or
fund orchestrating a massive sale to liquidate positions, not
even an errant trade that triggered panic selling, as seen in
the equities flash crash last May.	
 Rather, the picture pieced together from interviews on
Thursday and Friday is one of a richly priced commodities market
-- raw goods have been on a five-month winning tear over all
other major investment classes -- hit by a flurry of negative
factors that individually could be absorbed but cumulatively
triggered a maelstrom.	
 
 Computerized trading kicked in when key price levels were
reached, accelerating the fall.	
 ""It was a domino effect,"" said Dominic Cagliotti, a New
York-based oil options broker.	
 The negative factors -- prominent cheerleaders turning
bearish, some weak economic data, cheap money from the U.S.
Federal Reserve ending by July, a lessening of political risk --
merely provide a backdrop for the waves of selling. What stands
out is the way computers turned readjustment of positions in a
huge and deep market into a rout.	
 
 THE COMPUTERS	
 Stunningly large jolts from so-called stop-loss trading
amazed market traders. The automated sell orders were generated
as oil crashed through price points that traders had programmed
in advance into their supercomputers. In many cases, computer
algorithms sold for technical reasons, as oil dropped through
levels that, once breached, could trigger ever larger waves of
selling yet to come.	
 The machine trading, based on subtly different but
fundamentally similar, algorithmic models, eliminates the
white-knuckles and potential human error involved in actively
trading a volatile market, and increases anonymity. Instead of
breeding hesitation, abrupt price drops can quickly prompt these
machines to unload a bullish long position in oil, and build up
a bearish short one instead.	
 Machine-led trading is one plausible thesis for another
apparent market anomaly that occurred on Thursday. Exchange data
shows that the total number of open positions in the oil market
-- a number that would typically fall in a selloff -- instead
rose. Normally, panicky funds selling oil en masse would cause
total ""open interest"" numbers to shrink, as exiting investors
closed out contracts. But some machines, following the market
trend, may have gone further, by dumping long positions and
quickly amassing sizable short positions instead.	
 ""Computers don't care. Momentum just increases until nobody
wants to stand in front of it,"" said Peter Donovan, a floor
trader for Vantage on the New York Mercantile Exchange.	
 Some big Wall Street traders watched their own systems sell
into the down trend but couldn't know for sure who had initiated
the selling spree. They only knew that similar machines at other
firms, from New York, to London, Geneva and Sao Paulo, would be
automatically selling in much the same manner.	
 During Thursday's crash, such selling locked in profits that
high-flying commodities traders have been accumulating for
months. Some of Thursday's rout appears to have been more a
product of the wisdom of crowd computing than of widespread
human panic.	
 ""We believe the magnitude of the correction appears in large
part to have been exacerbated by algorithmic traders unwinding
positions,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a report.	
 High frequency trading and algorithmic trading accounts for
about half of all the volume in oil markets.	
 
 BIG NAMES TURNED BEARISH	
 Some of the seeds for the rout were sown earlier. In April.
Goldman Sachs' bullish team of commodities analysts, led by Jeff
Currie in London, issued two notes to clients in rapid
succession recommending they pare back positions. In one, the
bank called for a nearly $20 dollar near-term correction in
Brent oil, while maintaining a bullish longer-term outlook.	
 The closely watched money king, George Soros, who runs a
macroeconomic hedge fund, had said for months that gold was
pricey. Even online advisors to mom-and-pop investors such as
The ETF Strategist had warned of a bubble in precious metals
that could be ready to pop.	
 On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal had reported the Soros
Fund was selling commodities including silver, and four sources
from other hedge funds told Reuters they believed Soros was busy
selling commodities positions again on Thursday.	
 Silver markets already had suffered four days of carnage and
ended the week down nearly 30 percent. But silver is a tiny
market, much more susceptible to sharp price moves. Some traders
suspect that big holders were cashing out of the least liquid
commodity market first, before moving onto the big one - oil.	
 As crude crashed on Thursday, it dragged down every other
major commodity. The Reuters Jefferies CRB index, which follows
19 major commodities, was on its way to a 9 percent weekly drop,
the biggest since 2008.	
 Oil's selloff began in London, and accelerated as New York
traders piled in.	
 A routine report on U.S. weekly claims for unemployment
benefits spooked investors, showing the labor market in worse
shape than expected. That fed a growing pessimism about the
resilience of the global economy after industrial orders slumped
in Germany and the massive U.S. and European service sectors
slowed. Then the European Central Bank surprised with a more
dovish statement on interest rates than expected, signaling
its wariness about the euro zone outlook. The dollar rose
sharply.	
 Before noon New York time, Brent crude oil prices were
already trading down a jaw-dropping $8 a barrel. 
 Fourteen hundred miles southwest of New York's trading
floors, on Texas refinery row, oil men were stunned by the drop,
which played havoc with their pricing models.

spreadsheets,"" said a major U.S. "

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 9 (Reuters) - Stocks and commodities
stabilised on Monday after last week's solid U.S. payrolls data
showed the economic recovery in the world's biggest economy was
picking up momentum, though sharp gains may be limited, given
the severity of the decline.	
 Hiring by U.S. companies quickened to its fastest
pace in five years in April, a report showed on Friday. The
three-month average of private payrolls is now at a level seen
only twice since 2000, Thomson Reuters data
shows.[ID:nOAT004799] 
 While last week's violent moves were seen more driven by
unwinding of speculative positions rather than a sudden
weakening of the otherwise favourable global economic outlook,
traders said the sheer scale of the decline may introduce more
two way volatility into the market in the near term.	
 Last week, the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a global
benchmark for commodities prices staged its biggest weekly drop
since late 2008 while silver and crude oil  registered
record single-day falls on Thursday. [ID:nLDE7450VD] 
 Two days before the U.S. jobs data, redemptions spearheaded
by institutional investors in commodity funds hit their highest
weekly total on record with funds focusing on gold and precious
metals heavily hit by outflows, fund-tracker EPFR Global said.	
 
 On Monday, though, prices of copper, wheat and oil rose,
with the latter boosted by intensifying conflict in Libya.	
 ""When you see a 30 percent retracement in the likes of
silver, you will see some buying, but we are now entering a
period of more two-way action as opposed to earlier when you
bought commodities and watched it go higher,"" said Andrew
Robinson, a macro, commodities and FX analyst at Saxo Markets.	
 Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs said it did not rule
out a further decline in prices after last week's record drop,
while reaffirming its long-term bullish outlook and rival JP
Morgan upped its price forecast for oil by $10 per
barrel. [ID:nLDE74513V].

 BOON FOR GROWTH	
 Deutsche Bank's Alan Ruskin said the temporary benefit of a
12 percent drop in oil prices along with the jobs data should
prove to be a short-term boon for global growth as the growth
impact of lower energy prices for major energy consumers like
the U.S. and China overwhelms the negative growth implications
for energy producers.	
 Brent crude rose above $110 a barrel after losing $16 last
week in its biggest ever decline in dollar terms. ID:nL3E7G903X]	
 The bounce in commodities also boosted the region's stock
markets. 
 Australia's benchmark index was up by nearly 1
percent while Hong Kong's stocks rose by 0.8 percent, led
by petroleum and banking stocks.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was up nearly 1 percent after falling by nearly
3 percent last week.	
 ""Things have opened quite nicely but I wouldn't say this is
a totally enthusiastic market. Volumes are very light which
means that people are nibbling,"" said Lucinda Chan, division
director at Macquarie Equities.	
 ""Today were having a good run but (lately) it's been a slow
move up. It's been extremely patchy,"" she said. 
 In currency markets, the euro was under pressure
after posting its biggest weekly loss versus the dollar due to
the deepening euro zone debt problems.	
 While Greece has denied speculation it is quitting the euro
zone, the European Union is under pressure to renegotiate its
financial bailout, with an Irish minister saying any concessions
given to Athens should mean better terms for Dublin as well.
[ID:nLDE7470E8]	
 The single currency was last at $1.4396 on short-covering,
after having slumped to a three-week low around $1.4308, and is
now well below a 17-month peak above $1.4900 hit last week.	
 A revival in demand for risky assets saw demand for safe
haven instruments such as bonds cool with ten-year Japanese bond
yields edging a shade higher to 1.14 percent.	
 US Treasuries weakened slightly as traders took
profits after Friday's drop which was fuelled by speculation of
Greece's exit from the euro zone economy. [ID:nN06231622]	
 Ten-year yields were up by two basis points to 3.17 percent.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia's developed
stock markets inched higher on Monday as investors scooped up
bargains, helped by a strong U.S. jobs report, though sharp
gains may be limited before a deluge of Chinese economic data
this week.	
 A commodity market-driven selloff last week saw global
equities and high-yielding currencies weaken sharply as
investors unwound risky positions and fled to safe havens such
as U.S. Treasuries and the dollar.	
 But a report on Friday showed that hiring by U.S. companies
quickened to its fastest pace in five years in April, indicating
the economic recovery was gaining momentum, encouraging some
investors to buy back risk. [ID:nOAT004799]	
 Australia's benchmark index was up by more than half
a percent while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3 percent before
turning lower. MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was up slightly after falling by nearly 3
percent last week.	
 ""Volume will likely be thin ahead of a holiday tomorrow, but
the market will probably start off in positive territory, helped
by the U.S. job report,"" said Lee Jae-mahn, a market analyst at
Tong Yang Securities. 
 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced
0.43 percent, holding above important technical levels. 
 The customary monthly data-fest from Beijing is likely to
include the important CPI inflation data which may show that
inflation in April eased from a 32-month high due to a slight
decline in food prices. [ID:nL3E7G60AQ]	
 A higher than expected reading will revive expectations of
more policy tightening from Beijing, dealing a further blow to
beaten-down commodities and currencies such as the Aussie.

 Last week, the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a global
benchmark for commodities prices staged its biggest weekly drop
since late 2008. [ID:nLDE7450VD]	
 On Monday, though, prices of copper, wheat and oil
rebounded, with the latter boosted by intensifying conflict in
Libya.	
 Libyan rebels fought a fierce battle with forces loyal to
Muammar Gaddafi near the airport at the western city of Misrata
on Sunday as NATO planes targeted government ammunition stores
on another front in the war. [ID:nLDE7470DC]

 * Credibility of ASEAN at stake
 * Foreign ministers to extend stay in Jakarta to discuss
(Adds quotes from Indonesian president)	
 By Olivia Rondonuwu and Aditya Suharmoko	
 JAKARTA, May 8 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian leaders failed to
achieve any breakthrough on Sunday to end deadly border
skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia that overshadowed a
regional summit in Jakarta supposed to showcase progress towards
economic integration.	
 The clashes around crumbling Hindu temples in disputed areas
have starkly illustrated the tensions between countries in the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) that could
derail plans to create a single economic community by 2015, and
the apparent inability of the bloc to deal with disagreements.	
 Indonesia, host of the 18th ASEAN summit, has been pressing
for a deal that would prevent the meeting being marred by the
border dispute. But in the end all that was achieved was a
face-saving announcement that the Thai and Cambodian foreign
ministers would stay an extra day in Jakarta for more talks.	
 The two sides have spoken plenty of times in recent weeks,
but without finding a resolution to clashes that have killed 18
people since April.

 ASEAN, a collection of authoritarian states and nascent
democracies, has a policy of non-interference in each other's
domestic affairs, and so has struggled to resolve the border
dispute which -- although on the surface about ownership of some
ancient temples -- is being driven by domestic political
dynamics in both Thailand and Cambodia.	
 
 THAI ELECTIONS COMPLICATE DISPUTE	
 Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told Reuters on the
sidelines of the summit he will go to the polls on July 3. With
elections approaching, the border issue is one which he can try
to use to unite Thais behind him. He will certainly not be
looking to make any concessions that would lose him votes.	
 The party seen as the biggest rival of Abhisit's Democrats
is Peua Thai, a political vehicle for exiled former Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who has close ties with Hun Sen and
was briefly even an official adviser to him.	
 Abhisit insisted that Thailand wanted peace and was not
looking to score political points. 
 ""The ultimate objective must be to achieve lasting peace, so
that both our peoples can live peacefully side-by-side along the
Thai-Cambodian border,"" he said in a press briefing.	
 But he laid the blame for the border tensions squarely on
Cambodia, fuelling scepticism over whether the extra day of
talks on Monday will achieve anything.	
 Yudhoyono repeatedly called for ASEAN unity during the
summit, but intense efforts by Jakarta, including proposals to
send Indonesian military observers to disputed areas, did not
bridge the gap between Thailand and Cambodia.	
 ""ASEAN leaders wish both countries to choose a peaceful
solution, prevent the conflict escalating, and redouble efforts
to avoid fighting between the two armies,"" Yudhoyono said at the
summit's closing news conference. 
 ""Indonesia, as the ASEAN chair, has made many efforts to
resolve the situation by suggesting ways of achieving a peaceful
resolution.""	
 Other ASEAN nations were not happy with the tension.	
 ""They need to ponder how badly the ill will generated would
impede ASEAN collaboration on projects... An ASEAN disunited
will be taken less seriously by investors,"" said Singapore's
state-controlled Straits Times newspaper in an editorial.

 SECURITY CHALLENGES	
 Singapore leader Lee Hsien Loong did not attend the summit,
staying at home for general elections that saw the ruling
People's Action Party easily returned to power as expected. But
the foreign minister lost his seat in a landmark vote for an
opposition bolstered by a more sceptical younger generation.	
 The rest of the region's leaders, meeting in a cavernous
conference centre with an intricately carved wooden ceiling,
have also struggled to engage the region's 500 million people in
a project to build an economic community with free movement of
people and goods by 2015.	
 ""If the Cambodia and Thailand situation gets worse, then I'm
afraid they might have to postpone it to 2020 or even put it on
hold,"" said Enrico Tanuwidjaja, an analyst at OSK-DMG Group in
Singapore.	
 In a venue patrolled by hundreds of police and military
personnel after worries over reprisal attacks by Islamists in
Indonesia following the killing of Osama bin Laden, leaders were
discussing security challenges such as food and energy supply.	
 The group ranges from oil and gas-rich Indonesia, Malaysia,
Brunei, Vietnam and Malaysia, and the world's top rice exporter
Thailand, to port trading centre Singapore, resource-scarce
Cambodia and the Philippines, and impoverished Myanmar and Laos.	
 The fast-growing region has again become a magnet for
emerging market investors and is trying to develop its $1.8
trillion economy by negotiating bilateral trade deals with the
European Union and improving transport links with key trading
partner China. 
 Previous meetings have often been overshadowed by
controversy over member Myanmar. The country has asked to chair
ASEAN in 2014, a request which, if granted, would greatly
complicate ties between the bloc and the United States and
European Union. 
 A draft communique from the summit said the request had been
agreed, but leaders later backpedalled. The final statement
issued from the meeting said only that the request was being
considered, although Yudhoyono said there would be no objection
if Myanmar continued making progress towards democracy.

 (Adds fresh comment by Greek Finance Minister, source)
 By Dina Kyriakidou and Renee Maltezou
 ATHENS, May 7 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou on Saturday denied there was even unofficial
discussion over Greece quitting the euro zone and asked that his
troubled country be ""left alone to finish its task"".
 Ministers from the euro zone's biggest economies met in
Luxembourg to discuss Greece's debt crisis on Friday but Athens
and senior EU officials denied a report by Germany's Spiegel
Online that the Greek government had raised the prospect of
leaving the 17-member euro zone.
 ""These scenarios are borderline criminal,"" Papandreou told a
conference on the Ionian island of Meganisi. ""No such scenario
has been discussed even in our unofficial contacts...I call upon
everyone in Greece and abroad, and especially in the EU, to
leave Greece alone to do its job in peace.""
 European Central bank Governing Council member Erkki
Liikanen on Saturday shot down reports of Greece exiting the
euro and said restructuring its 327 billion euro ($470 billion)
debt would offer no permanent solution to its problems.
 ""No euro zone country wants to leave the euro,"" Liikanen,
who also heads the Bank of Finland, said in an interview at
Finnish national broadcaster Yle.
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou attended the
Luxembourg talks, his finance ministry said, adding Greece
remained committed to repairing its finances and returning to
economic growth.
 ""Markets continue to have doubts and we have scheduled our
next steps for 2012,"" Papaconstantinou told reporters on
Saturday when asked about what was discussed at the meeting.
 ""We (Greece) will either go out to markets or use the recent
decision by the EU Council that allows the European fund (EFSF)
to buy Greek bonds. That was what the discussion was about.""
 Sources close to the talks said on Saturday the meeting did
not look at extending the repayment of Greece's bailout loans,
or any new bailout deal terms for the country.
 ""There was an extensive debate on Greece's economic
adjustment programme. The progress made was recognised but it
was also recognised that the programme has not changed the
situation (markets' confidence in Greece) as fast as expected,""
one source said.

 EURO EXIT ""STUPID""
 Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group of euro zone finance
ministers who called the late Friday meeting, said there was a
broad discussion of Greece and other international economic
issues but said the idea of exiting the euro was stupid.
 ""We have not been discussing the exit of Greece from the
euro area. This is a stupid idea. It is in no way -- it is an
avenue we would never take,"" he told reporters after the meeting
attended by ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
 ""We don't want to have the euro area exploding without
reason. We were excluding the restructuring option, which is
discussed heavily in certain quarters of the financial markets,""
he added.
 But he said a meeting of all euro zone finance ministers on
May 16 would discuss whether Greece needed a further economic
plan. The EU is currently negotiating a bailout with Portugal,
the third state it is rescuing after Greece and Ireland.
 Despite a 110 billion euro international bailout, Greece, a
euro zone member since 2001, has not cut its budget deficit as
fast as it promised its lenders amid a deep recession. Gains
from spending cuts and tax hikes have been partly erased by low
revenues due to tax evasion and a deep recession.
 
 SCEPTICAL MARKETS
 Financial markets have been sceptical for months that Athens
could manage its huge debt without eventually restructuring. As
austerity bites, even some ruling socialist party politicians
have been suggesting a ""soft"" restructuring which might involve
lengthening maturities on the country's bonds.
 On Friday, the euro fell nearly 1 percent against the dollar
and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default was quoted
at a record high in response to the Spiegel report.
 The Luxembourg talks were also attended by European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and Olli Rehn, the European
commissioner for economic and monetary affairs.

715,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2011 04:56AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Thai-Cambodia dispute sparks doubts over regional bloc ASEAN," (Updates with quotes, details)	
 By Neil Chatterjee and Olivia Rondonuwu	
 JAKARTA, May 7 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian leaders sought on
Saturday to resolve a deadly border dispute between Thailand and
Cambodia that has cast fresh doubt over whether the region's
plans to become a free-trade economic community by 2015 are
realistic. 
 The skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia -- ostensibly
over ownership of some crumbling ancient temples on the border
but also driven by internal political dynamics in both countries
-- have killed 18 people in the last couple of weeks.	
 The confrontation -- and the apparent inability of the
Association of South East Asian Nations to broker a lasting
peace deal -- has fuelled scepticism over the bloc's lofty
ambitions and threatens to overshadow its annual two-day
meeting, just as controversy over Myanmar has in the past.	
 ""We need to resolve the problem because we don't want this
to be a problem that would affect ASEAN's agenda on community
building,"" Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told Reuters
after meeting the group's leaders in Jakarta. ""If the Cambodians
would just come to the table, there is no problem.""	
 Cambodia says it is the Thais who are blocking agreement, by
repeatedly coming up with new demands to scupper peace. 
 The 10-member ASEAN, with some of the world's fastest
growing economies and some 500 million people, represents a
region with increasing economic clout, but has a policy of
non-interference in other members' domestic affairs and is often
derided as a talk shop.	
 ""ASEAN must enhance its credibility by fully implementing
its own agreements,"" Abhisit told leaders in a speech, referring
to the group's charter. ""To be credible, we must also be able to
address and resolve challenges within our region.""

 Fighting over the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO
World Heritage site in dispute since the withdrawal of the
French from Cambodia in the 1950s, has turned into Southeast's
Asia's bloodiest conflict in a decade and dented ASEAN's image.	
 Thai and Cambodian foreign ministers meeting ahead of the
summit agreed on some of the ground rules for sending an
Indonesian military observer team to the border, but Cambodia
rejected Thailand's request to withdraw troops from the temple
as a precondition.	
 Cambodia's foreign minister Hor Namhong said the country
will never withdraw troops from its own territory.	
 
 MYRIAD SECURITY CHALLENGES	
 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono avoided
mentioning the dispute in a speech to open the meeting on
Saturday, focusing instead on the region's challenges of food
and energy security and speeding up moves towards an economic
community.	
 The group ranges from oil and gas-rich Indonesia, Malaysia,
Brunei, Vietnam and Malaysia, and the world's top rice exporter
Thailand, to trading centre Singapore and resource-scarce Laos,
Cambodia and the Philippines.	
 ASEAN, together with China, Japan and South Korea, has
agreed to have a rice reserve of over 700,0000 tonnes to protect
against volatile commodity prices, which had surged this year
before unexpectedly diving this week.	
 The details of how the emergency reserve will work, such as
whether countries will buy it or whether it could also be used
to stabilise volatile prices, have yet to be thrashed out,
Indonesia's Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said.	
 Indonesia surprised regional markets earlier this year by
buying five times as much rice as expected, and vowed to lift
its rice stockpiles by a third as it struggled to fight
inflation after global food prices hit a record high.	
 ""Food security will be a great challenge for ASEAN,""
Yudhoyono said in the speech. ""Nations on this earth will face a
competitive situation for the scarce resources of daily needs.""	
 ASEAN needs to develop internal trade and investment, said
Yudhoyono, a week after meeting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao who
offered $9 billion for infrastructure and to improve transport
links with China. Transport disasters are all too common in
Indonesia and at least 15 died in a plane crash on Saturday.	
 ""We still have to do a lot of things,"" Yudhoyono added.	
 He said the leaders, transported in a fleet of gleaming

716,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2011 02:20AM ET</span>",Thai-Cambodia dispute fuels scepticism over regional bloc ASEAN," By Neil Chatterjee	
 JAKARTA, May 7 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian leaders sought on
Saturday to resolve a deadly border dispute between Thailand and
Cambodia that has cast fresh doubt over whether the region's
plans to become a free-trade economic community by 2015 are
realistic. 
 The skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia -- ostensibly
over ownership of some crumbling ancient temples on the border
but also driven by internal political dynamics in both countries
-- have killed 18 people in the last couple of weeks,	
 The confrontation -- and the apparent inability of the
Association of South East Asian Nations to broker a peace deal
that holds -- has fuelled scepticism over the bloc's lofty
ambitions and threatens to overshadow its annual two-day
meeting, just as controversy over Myanmar has in the past.	
 ""The United States and United Nations hope Indonesia, as
Southeast Asia's biggest country, can help to resolve this
dispute,"" Indonesian Communications Minister Tifatul Sembiring
told Reuters at the start of the meeting in Jakarta.	
 The 10-member ASEAN, with some of the world's fastest
growing economies and some 500 million people, represents a
region with increasing economic clout but is often derided as a
talk shop and has a policy of non-interference in other members'
domestic affairs.	
 Fighting over the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO
World Heritage site in dispute since the withdrawal of the
French from Cambodia in the 1950s, has turned into Southeast's
Asia's bloodiest conflict in a decade and dented ASEAN's image.

 Thai and Cambodian foreign ministers meeting ahead of the
summit agreed on some of the ground rules for sending an
Indonesian military observer team to the border, but Cambodia
rejected Thailand's request to withdraw troops from the temple
as a precondition.	
 ""We never can withdraw our troops from our own territory. It
should be very clear,"" said Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Namhong.	
 
 MYRIAD SECURITY CHALLENGES	
 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono did not
mention the dispute in a speech to open the meeting on Saturday,
focusing instead on the region's challenges of food and energy
security and speeding up moves towards an economic community.	
 The group ranges from oil and gas-rich Indonesia, Malaysia,
Brunei, Vietnam and Malaysia, and the world's top rice exporter
Thailand, to trading centre Singapore and resource-scarce Laos,
Cambodia and the Philippines.	
 ASEAN, together with China, Japan and South Korea, has
agreed to have a rice reserve of over 700,0000 tonnes to protect
against volatile commodity prices, which had surged this year
before unexpectedly diving this week.	
 ""Food security will be a great challenge for ASEAN,""
Yudhoyono said in the speech. ""Nations on this earth will face a
competitive situation for the scarce resources of daily needs.""	
 The region needs to develop intra-ASEAN trade and
investment, said Yudhoyono, a week after meeting Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao who promised $9 billion in loans to overhaul
Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure and to speed up transport
links between the region and China.	
 ""We still have to do a lot of things,"" Yudhoyono added.	
 He said the leaders, transported in a fleet of gleaming
Toyota limos through Jakarta's traffic jams and tropical rains
that killed 17 people on Friday night in floods to the west of
the capital, will also discuss disaster management following the
devastating tsunami in key trading partner Japan.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - Oil sold off for a fifth day on
Friday, following a 10 percent crash in the previous session,
while the euro sank again after German magazine Der Spiegel
reported Greece has considered exiting the euro zone.
 U.S. stocks recovered from a four-day slide, however, after
data showed U.S. employers added more jobs than expected in
April, reducing concerns about the economic recovery.
 U.S. Treasury prices erased some sharp early losses and
turned positive as worries about the future of the euro zone
revived their safe-haven appeal.
 In an extremely volatile session, oil prices earlier rose
more than 2.0 percent on optimism about demand brought on by
the U.S. jobs data, but turned negative later as the euro fell
and the U.S. dollar rose, making the commodity more expensive
for non-U.S. investors.
 U.S. crude oil futures  closed 2.6 percent lower at
$97.18 a barrel. Prices fell $16.75 in the week, their biggest
weekly drop since the contract began trading in 1983.
 Brent crude futures  closed at $109.13 a barrel,
down 1.51 percent for the day and 13.3 percent for the week,
also the largest weekly loss for the contract.
 Selling pressure on oil and other commodities came on
several fronts this week, as investors weighed the implications
of the death of Osama bin Laden in the Middle East and concerns
about the economic slowdown of China, the world's largest
consumer of raw materials.
 MORE EURO ZONE JITTERS
 The euro  lost 1.2 percent to $1.435 after Der
Spiegel reported on its website that a crisis meeting of euro
zone finance ministers and the European Commision would be held
on Friday evening to discuss Greece's situation.
 Greece denied it was considering to leave the bloc, but
official sources told Reuters a small group of European finance
ministers was indeed meeting on Friday to discuss the euro zone
debt crisis. For details, see [ID:nLDE7451YY].
 ""Those Greece headlines definitely had an impact on the
euro,"" said Geoffrey Yu, senior currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""Greece leaving the euro zone could cause a cascade of
problems, especially for the banking sector and particularly if
the European Union allow Greece to unilaterally default on its
loans. That would need to happen if Greece wants to leave the
euro zone,"" he added.
 U.S. JOBS DATA RELIEF
 Key U.S. stock indexes initially jumped more than 1.0
percent after the U.S. Labor Department reported 244,000 jobs
were added in April, the most in 11 months and far more than
the 186,000 expected by economists. [ID:nOAT004799]
 Resurgent concerns about the euro zone crisis erased some
of those gains, but stocks still managed to close in the
black.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed higher 54.57
points, or 0.43 percent, at 12,638.74, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, to

 U.S. Treasury prices turned positive as the reports on
Greece prompted investors to cover bets that bonds would weaken
into next week.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
2/32 in price, with its yield at 3.1459 percent.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro on Friday headed for
its worst week against the dollar since January and further
losses were seen as likely, as sovereign debt concerns
reappeared after a German news report, later denied, suggested
Greece had raised the possibility of leaving the euro zone.
 Spiegel Online reported euro zone finance ministers were
meeting in Luxembourg on Friday to discuss Greece, including
the issue of its possible exit from the currency bloc. Greece,
through its Finance Ministry, later denied it was considering
leaving the euro zone.
 The Greece headlines, however, were enough to send
investors further unwinding long positions on the euro, which
hit a low of $1.43150 -- its weakest level since April 19 on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 Market participants said the pullback in the euro was a
natural correction in a currency that, at one point, had surged
more than 10 percent so far this year.
 ""What's happening today also reflects the fact that markets
are increasingly unwilling to hold long euro positions into the
weekend,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist,
at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""It really depends on how much substance there is behind
the press reports (on Greece), but from a technical
perspective, the drop below $1.45 is fairly significant. It's
probably too early to say that the euro is back on a declining
path, but a test of $1.50 is now off the table for the moment,""
he said.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro traded lower
at $1.43480, down 1.3 percent on the day, further retreating
from a 17-month peak fo $1.49404 scaled on Wednesday. With
losses for the week of 3.3 percent, the euro was on pace for
its worst week against the dollar since January.
 But some traders said the euro is still likely to gain
against the dollar in the medium term, as euro zone rates are
expected to rise more quickly than those in the United States.
 Speculators said as much as they boosted short dollar bets
to their highest in two months and increased long euro
positions to their highest since July 2007, according to data
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 The euro fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday after ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled a rate hike was unlikely
next month, but left the door open for a move in July.
 The dollar, meanwhile, also got a boost from data on Friday
showing U.S. employers added 244,000 jobs last month, well
above what economists had expected. That boosted U.S. bond
yields and increased the dollar's appeal against the yen. It
was last up 0.5 percent at 80.54 yen.
 It also offered respite for a market that was trying to
digest a recent run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data that some
feared pointed to a slowdown in the pace of U.S. growth.
 Concerns the world economy could also lose steam spurred a
massive run for the exit on Thursday, sending oil into freefall
and hurting high-yielding currencies such as the Australian
dollar that are sensitive to commodity prices and the global
growth outlook.
 Thursday's commodity rout spurred traders to unwind trades
financed with cheaply borrowed dollars and the greenback had
its best day against major rivals since October.
 Those moves were partly reversed on Friday, though oil
dipped back under $100 a barrel and was down 2 percent after
the Der Spiegel online report on Greece. It fell 10 percent on
Thursday.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar recouped losses to trade
more than 1.2 percent higher at US$1.0703, although it was
still some distance away from a near three-decade peak above
US$1.10 hit early this week.
 ""It's a natural clearing-out process after being
overbought,"" said Adrian Lee, president and chief investment
officer, at Lee Overlay Partners, referring to Thursday's
sell-off in commodities and high-yielding currencies.
 ""But commodities and high-yielders will be back. In fact,
those long positions could be put back on next week. There's
definitely pressure for these assets to appreciate because the
global economy is definitely improving,"" Lee said in New York.
 Lee Overlay has assets under management of $8.5 billion.

 By Noah Barkin and Paul Taylor
 BERLIN, May 6 (Reuters) - The costs to a country of leaving
the euro zone would be so high that many analysts think the bloc
will do everything in its power to prevent an exit, even if that
requires the richest members to keep bailing out weak states.
 German magazine Spiegel reported on Friday that the Greek
government had raised the possibility of breaking away from the
12-year-old euro area and reintroducing its own currency in
talks with the European Commission and other member states in
recent days.
 The report was vigorously denied by the Greek finance
ministry and officials from other member states. Sources did
confirm that a small group of euro zone finance ministers were
meeting in Luxembourg on Friday to discuss Greece and other
pressing matters.
 Leaving the currency union would carry huge economic,
social, reputational and strategic costs for Greece or any other
country. Greece would have to hive off its bank deposits from
the rest of the euro zone banking system as it introduced a new
currency, risking a run on its banks and huge disruption for its
companies.
 Banks across Europe would face losses on their Greek debt.
 For the bloc as a whole, it would represent a humiliating
setback because the common currency is broadly viewed as the
culmination of half a century of European integration.
 ""To me the euro zone is a one-way street,"" said Gilles Moec,
senior European economist at Deutsche Bank. ""A breakup would
have catastrophic consequences for the country that left. It
would precipitate a run on the banks. I can't see how you do it
in an orderly way.""
 Speculation about a possible euro zone breakup reached
fever pitch in November of last year, but predictions that the
bloc will fracture have come mainly from Anglo-Saxon sceptics.
 Last summer, British economist Christopher Smallwood of
consultants Capital Economics produced a 20-page paper entitled
""Why the euro zone needs to break up"" and U.S. economist Nouriel
Roubini, nicknamed Dr. Doom, has said euro members will be
forced to abandon the shared currency.
 
 DEBT RESTRUCTURING RISK
 Greece has struggled to meet the fiscal targets set out for
it as part of its 110 billion euro ($160 billion) bailout from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
 Over the past month, markets have priced in the sort of
default risk that was once unthinkable for a euro zone state and
expectations have risen that Greece will have to restructure its
327 billion euro debt load while other countries will have to
provide more aid.
 Political opposition in northern Europe to giving Greece
more money and rising anger within the country at the tough
austerity measures the government has put in place have created
a dangerous new dynamic that has convinced more experts an exit
may conceivably happen, although probably not for years.
 By reintroducing the drachma, the argument goes, Greece
could sharply devalue its currency against the euro and keep
official interest rates ultra-low, regain competitiveness, and
tackle its debt problem without the political and social
upheaval associated with years of austerity-fuelled recession.
 ""I'm not suggesting that these stories are right,"" said
Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics.
""But we have said that we think it's quite likely that there
will be some change to the membership of the euro area over the
next four to five years and that one possible form will be the
exit of a small economy like Greece.
 ""I don't think the idea is implausible at all.""
 But U.S. economist Barry Eichengreen, who authored a 2007
paper arguing that the single currency could not be undone,
reaffirmed that belief last year as the Greek crisis deepened.
 ""Adopting the euro is effectively irreversible,"" he wrote in
an article on the economics website Vox.
 ""Leaving would require lengthy preparations, which, given
the anticipated devaluation, would trigger the mother of all
financial crises,"" said Eichengreen, a professor at the
University of California, Berkeley.
 
 LEGAL NIGHTMARE
 There is no legal procedure for leaving the euro zone and
some economists argue that treaty changes would have to take
place before an exit could happen.
 ""You would have to make it legal in order to leave,"" said
Moec of Deutsche Bank. ""You would probably have years of
litigation on all the debt held outside the country.""
 Trade flows would probably be severely disrupted. Business
costs would become unpredictable, inhibiting investment. Labour
unrest and social strife would likely result as citizens faced
mass unemployment, inflation and brutal public spending cuts.
 That would far outweigh any potential boost to exports or
tourism revenues from a devaluation.
 ""But what if the bank runs and financial crisis happen
anyway?"" Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman asked on his
blog last November.
 An exit that is neither planned nor chosen but imposed by
irresistible market forces would dramatically reduce the
marginal cost of leaving the euro, Krugman contended.
 But that economic logic may underestimate the political will
that has driven European monetary union since its inception.

$1.49. The currency hit a session low of $1.4373 and is down
1.1 pct at $1.4380 , heading for its worst week against
the dollar since January.
 ""Greece leaving the euro zone could cause a cascade of
problems, especially for the banking sector and particularly if
the European Union allows Greece unilaterally to default on its
loans,"" said Geoffrey Yu, senior currency strategist at UBS.
 The dollar also got a boost from data showing U.S.
employers added 244,000 jobs last month, well above what
economists had expected. That boosted U.S. bond yields and
increased the dollar's appeal against the yen. It was last up
0.4 percent at 80.49 yen .
 It also offered respite for a market that was trying to
digest a recent run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data that some
feared pointed to a slowdown in the pace of U.S. growth.
 Concern that the world economy would also lose steam
spurred a massive run for the exit on Thursday, sending oil
into free-fall and hurting high-yielding currencies such as the
Australian dollar that are sensitive to commodity prices and
the global growth outlook.
 Thursday's commodity rout spurred traders to unwind trades
financed with cheaply borrowed dollars, and the greenback had
its best day against major rivals since October. <.DXY>
 Those moves were partly reversed on Friday, though oil
dipped back under $100 a barrel after the Der Spiegel online
report on Greece. It fell 10 percent on Thursday. 
 ""Yesterday was an overreaction, a sort of 'get-me-out' now
moment driven by margin traders who feared the global economy
was getting worse,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com. ""That just doesn't seem to be the case, and the jobs
number shows the U.S. economy is still recovering. There will
be setbacks, but we think it will continue to plod along.""
 The Australian dollar soared 1.5 percent to $1.0740
, helped after the central bank warned already high
4.75 percent interest rates may have to rise further, while
Canada's dollar  rose on the stronger U.S. jobs data.
 MEDIUM-TERM EURO OUTLOOK POSITIVE
 Analysts predicted the dollar would stay well supported in
the short-term against major currencies such as the yen and
euro but would struggle against commodity-linked currencies.
 ""Different currencies have different sensitivities to risk,
so the dollar won't gain as much against the Australian dollar,
for instance, as against the yen,"" said Steven Englander, head
of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup.
 Some traders, though, said the euro was still likely to
gain against the dollar in the medium term, as euro zone
interest rates are expected to rise much more quickly than
those in the United States.
 The euro fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday after the
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled a
rate hike was unlikely next month but left the door open to a
move in July.
 ""We've had a healthy correction in euro/dollar, but I don't
think this is a sea-change in sentiment and wouldn't expect it
to move much below $1.45,"" said RBS strategist Paul Robson.
 Dolan said expectations of a June ECB rate hike took the
euro from $1.46 to $1.49 earlier this week and had simply
priced that move out. He said the euro will likely settle into
a $1.4450-$1.48 range over the coming weeks.
 And even with the stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data,
few investors are pricing in U.S. interest rate hikes any time
soon, particularly with the jobless rate jumping from 8.8
percent to 9 percent in April. [ID:nOAT004799]
 ""All the major headwinds are still there -- 9 percent
unemployment, a housing market still in the tank, high food and
energy prices impeding consumer spending,"" Dolan said.
 Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros Trading,
said, ""The U.S. economy remains weak and so shall the dollar.""

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - Stocks and oil prices recovered
while Treasuries fell on Friday after a report showed U.S.
employers added more jobs than forecast in April, easing
concerns about the strength of the economic recovery.
 Oil prices fell further early, after plummeting nearly 10
percent on Thursday, but recovered to be up about 1.5 pct
midsession on Friday, as investors wondered whether the recent
commodities sell-off was overdone.
 The U.S. dollar was little changed against major currencies
after jumping on Thursday, as the euro slumped and commodity
prices plunged. Traders said the better U.S. employment data
reported early Friday was unlikely to change the outlook for
Federal Reserve monetary policy, suggesting this year's
downtrend in the dollar may not be over.
 U.S. employers added 244,000 jobs in April, the most in 11
months and far more than the 186,000 expected by economists.
For details, see [ID:nOAT004799].
 ""Surprisingly good, strong number -- this reminds everyone
that we are still on the path of recovery,"" said Jeff Kleintop,
chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 ""This might even put a bid back in commodities which have
suffered so tremendously this week on the fear that there is no
more need for an inflation hedge.""
 U.S. stock indexes rose about 1.0 percent after the jobs
data, recovering from a four day slide.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> jumped 151.29
points, or 1.20 percent, at 12,735.46, and The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 15.49 points, or 1.16 percent,
at 1,350.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 28.21
points, or 1.00 percent, at 2,842.93.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> climbed
0.6 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares rose 1.1 percent.
 The positive jobs data also encouraged investors to leave
safe-havens such as U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen.
 The price of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  fell
20/32, while their yield rose to 3.2248 percent.
 The dollar rose 0.54 percent against the Japanese currency
, to 80.56 yen.
 INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS STILL A DRIVER
 The greenback lost most of its initial gains against the
euro, however, as investors kept betting that euro zone rates
will go up faster than U.S. rates, even after the European
Central Bank signaled on Thursday that it will not tighten
monetary policy next month.
 The euro  last traded 0.16 percent lower at $1.4515,
after reaching a session low of 1.4455 right after the release
of the jobs data.
 ""We're still looking at the divergence in interest rate
outlooks between the Fed and ECB as the primary driver in
market activity over the medium term,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
""This morning's jobs data was certainly positive and
encouraging on many fronts, but it was not strong enough to
meaningfully to alter the outlook for Fed policy and so doesn't
necessarily provide any long-term support for the U.S. dollar,""
he said.
 U.S. crude oil prices  jumped 1.9 percent, to $101.70
per barrel, after zigzagging between positive and negative
following the release of the jobs data.
 Investors are still asking themselves whether the positive
payrolls surprise will be enough to quench this week's sell-off
in commodities, which triggered the second-largest one day
drop in U.S. crude prices on Thursday.
 ""There are huge winners and losers"" in the commodities
sell-off, said Michael Cheah, senior portfolio manager with
Sunamerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 ""The question will be will the losers be forced to sell
other things to make margin requirements? If anything, the
winners will sell to make more money.""

 * Fears rise of surging EU textile and bioethanol imports
 * Reform of EU trade preferences regime due in 2013
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck and Francesco Guarascio
 BRUSSELS, May 6 (Reuters) - The European Union's trade chief
has proposed opening the EU to more imports from developing
countries, fuelling a debate about protectionism and the bloc's
ties with trade partners such as Pakistan.
 Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht's office has proposed that
the threshold for imports under the EU's Generalised System of
Preferences (GSP) be increased, leading several EU commissioners
to raise strong objections, citing potential harm to Europe's
textile and biofuels industries, among other issues.
 De Gucht's proposals, which are due to be formally presented
on Tuesday, would grant preferential trade terms to poorer
countries whose exports to the EU make up 2 percent of total EU
imports, raising the limit from 1 percent currently.
 That would allow both Pakistan and Ukraine, whose exports
are more than 1 percent of total EU imports, to take advantage
of the EU's most preferential trade status. Pakistan is a major
producer of textiles and both are producers of ethanol.
 In a document seen by Reuters, senior representatives for 10
of the 27 members of the Commission opposed the plan, saying it
could unfairly benefit Pakistan and Ukraine, while harming
textile and other industries in Portugal and elsewhere.
 ""Three key points remain unresolved that have given rise to
objections"" on a reform to GSP, said the document, which was
prepared after a Commission meeting on Thursday.

 POLITICAL SIGNAL
 Senior officials responsible for agriculture, internal
market and industry policy warned that Pakistan and Ukraine's
booming exports would hurt EU producers, the document showed.
 They demanded a rewrite of the draft to allow Europe to shut
its markets in the event of specific import surges.
 One official questioned the political signal the EU would be
sending in granting Pakistan GSP Plus status, particularly in
light of ""current events"", a reference to allegations that
elements in Pakistan may have helped shelter Osama bin Laden.
 De Gucht's plan is the first step in an EU reform of trade
preferences that will address the soaring growth in exports from
countries whose economies are technically still ""developing"".
The reform needs approval from EU governments and the European
Parliament, a process expected to take until late 2013.
 The strong disagreement prompted by his plans suggests the
EU has a long way to go to resolve internal differences over
policy before it even tries to improve its external relations.
 An earlier attempt to lift the GSP threshold from 1 percent
to 1.5 percent already failed, and a separate effort by the EU
to improve trade terms for Pakistan following its flood disaster
last year is now bogged down in dispute at the WTO.
 De Gucht's latest plan would also extend Indian textile
exporters' access to a preferential tariff regime that they have
almost outgrown under current rules, according to trade sources.
 Brazil and Argentina would be among the losers as the draft
would strip them of preferential status, one source said.

 * Rate rise pressures to ease if inflation forecasts ebb
 * Factories cooling, but more sustainable pace may be benign
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - This week's commodity market
fright at the cresting of world economic growth looks oddly
panicky and easier oil and raw materials prices may themselves
reinforce a more benign outlook than the market scare suggests.
 For all that speculative ebb and flow is inherent in most
financial markets, the sudden plunge in energy and metals prices
was seeded by series of soft business surveys from the United
States, China and elsewhere showing sky-high crude prices were
starting to brake buoyant business confidence and activity.
 Add in some weak signals from the U.S. labour market in the
form of a sharp jump in weekly unemployment claims and jitters
about the release next week of the latest Chinese inflation and
production data and a brutal retreat in commodities ensued.
 At its low just above $105 per barrel on Friday, Brent crude
oil had lost more than 12 percent since Wednesday alone, the
biggest two-day fall since the financial crisis over two years
ago.
 But should the other financial markets, businesses and
households run scared too or should they breath a sigh of relief
that dangerous and inflationary commodity market excesses may
have been lanced for now at least?
 For many leading economists, the answer is the latter.
 Some slowdown in breakneck industrial production growth is
due and warranted, they argue, as the bigger risk to world
growth going forward is one of overheating commodity demand that
exaggerates headline inflation further and forces central banks
to react by tightening credit and slowing their economies.
 In that respect, the commodity retreat is welcomed with open
arms by policymakers such as European Central Bank chief
Jean-Claude Trichet who have been trying to stem inflation fears
by pushing up interest rates from supereasy, credit crisis lows.
 ""It (the commodities retreat) is good to take in terms of
consolidating the recovery because any increase in the price of
oil and commodities has an inflationary impact and a depressive
impact (on growth),"" Trichet said on Friday.
 Economists at U.S. bank JPMorgan echoed that view, telling
clients late on Thursday that if the drop in oil and food prices
are maintained, ""they will provide unexpected relief on
inflation and household purchasing power.""
 Looking outside the United States, UK bank Barclays reckons
that if a lower trending oil price of around $111 per barrel for
Brent oil were to replace its existing assumption of $120, then
its euro zone and UK inflation forecasts for this year would
both be cut by 0.2 percentage points.
 Significantly, that would then mean euro zone headline
inflation peaked at 2.8 percent last month as opposed to topping
out in the autumn at 3.0 percent.

 BIG PICTURE
 So, how does that fit into the big picture of world growth?
 In broad context, sudden fears of a slowdown seem strange as
a slight ebbing of a booming world economy this year has been
the running assumption for months.
 The International Monetary Fund, for example, already
expects global growth to slow from 2010's blistering 5.0 percent
to 4.4 percent this year -- even though that's still more than a
percentage point above the 20-year average and it sees that pace
at least sustained through 2012.
 Using monthly business surveys from around the world as a
weather vane for the twists and turns of activity shorter-term,
it's clear that world manufacturing output -- expanding at
annualised rates of a whopping 10 percent plus coming into this
year -- has been the big driver of the recent boom.
 But, as JPMorgan points out, this surge was not matched by
final expenditure on goods and so unsold inventory in auto
factories and the like started to stack up -- presaging a
cooling of assembly lines and a drop in global manufacturing
growth rates to an estimated 3.5 percent in April.
 And that's why the outlook now hinges on sustaining final
demand to start clearing that inventory, and hence the growing
importance of the inflation and interest rate scenario on
household behaviour and the overall growth picture ahead.
 The big problem then for most economists and markets in the
short term is twofold.
 First, they are trying navigate a significant amount of
erratic and likely short term economic data swings related to
Japan's earthquake disaster, extreme weather -- such as the
damaging U.S. tornados - and the fact that oil price swings
themselves were likely exaggerated by the unprecedented unrest
across the Middle East and North Africa.
 Big output shocks in Japan, the world's third biggest
economy, will likely distort aggregate global growth data for
months, but most experts expect much of that to be corrected in
the second half of the year as the country recovers rapidly.
 And in the meantime, some argue, Japan's export hiatus may
actually help drain inventory piles in competing manufacturers
elsewhere in the world -- ironically sustaining output growth
outside Japan for longer until its recovery kicks in.
 
 MONETARY GUESSWORK
 The second puzzle is the difficulty in parsing the inflation
outlook and how the world's major central banks respond. And
here's where commodity prices become as much of a driver than a
reflection of the outlook.
 Jim'O Neill, Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and
a long-standing optimist on world growth, told clients this week
the persistence of commodity-driven inflation in China and the
rest of the world was his one gnawing concern about the prospect
of what he terms a ""happy slowdown"".
 ""Some softening (of business activity) wouldn't be overly
troubling, as we have risen so much in recent months, and any
softening would simply add to the inclination of most Western
monetary policymakers to be extremely slow in tightening
monetary policy, if at all,"" he said.
 He added that in the light of China's strategic plan to slow
its economy slightly over the coming years and tilt more toward
local consumption away from exports, ""I can't see the case for
so much bullishness on commodity prices.""
 ""Moreover, if commodity prices were to ease, I can't really
see the case for fears about inflation around the world.""

 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - A commodities sell-off is bringing
a sudden chill to financial markets where investors were already
turning cautious about the prospect of a slowdown in China and
other emerging economies given steady monetary tightening.
 Silver and crude oil saw a dramatic plunge in the past week,
registering record single-day falls on Thursday. 
 Oil has lost as much as 17 percent in the past week alone,
while the broader Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a global
commodity benchmark, dropped more than 8 percent, on track for
its biggest weekly fall since July 2008.
 While moves are seen more driven by unwinding of speculative
positions rather than a sudden reappraisal of the otherwise
favourable global economic outlook, they are enough to prompt
investors to scale back their risky bets.
 The coming week brings key data and events for China, whose
series of policy actions to curb inflation raised jitters growth
momentum is slowing in the world's second largest economy.
The China-U.S. strategic and economic dialogue kicks off on
Monday, with data on trade balance, inflation, industrial
production and retail sales all due later in the week.
 Emerging stocks, measured by MSCI have erased almost all of
their gains since January, while their developed counterparts
have fallen more than 3 percent from their three-year peak set
in the past week.
 ""We see high correlations between equities and commodities,
due to a demand effect coming from emerging economies, and
that's contributing to a general move towards a defensive
stance,"" said Christoph Riniker, strategist at Julius Baer.
 ""It will be difficult for equities in the next few weeks and
we may have a prolonged period of sideways trading before the
market picks up again. But we don't expect a huge sell-off given
there's a lack of opportunities in other asset classes.
 China has raised interest rates four times and banks'
reserve requirements seven times since October, when it declared
that it would make fighting inflation a priority.
 Beijing has also allowed the yuan to rise against the dollar
by guiding it towards successive record peaks. Many expect the
yuan to post steady gains throughout this year.
 Central banks in Korea, Chile and Poland are expected to
raise interest rates in their policy meetings in the coming
week, joining Russia and India which have already raised the
cost of borrowing in the past week.
 
 TAKING A BREAK
 Equities are increasingly moving in tandem with commodities,
with the 60-day rolling correlation between the CRB index and
MSCI world equity index moving to 0.7, its highest since July
2010, from a recent low of 0.1 posted in March.
Thomson Reuters' Lipper data showed funds that focus on
metals, resources and energy took a hit in the week ended May 4.
 The gold and natural resource funds had net outflows of $729
million, the most in net redemptions since the week ended Sept.
2, 2009. Energy sector funds had outflows of $723 million, a
reversal from the $343 million inflows in the prior week.
 Over the past week the economic data flow has turned less
positive, with global surveys showing manufacturing growth in
the United States and China slowing in April.
 ""Commodity markets have a tendency to cascade because
speculators are positioned simultaneously, creating a rush for
the exit,"" said John Ventre, portfolio manager at Skandia
Investment Group.
 ""For real money investors a soft patch in data is not
significant enough to warrant significant asset allocation
changes. I would come back to neutral see if opportunities
appear over the summer.""
 Growth momentum in export-driven economies such as Germany
might also turn lower given the dollar's recent decline to a
three-year low, at a time when inflationary pressures in the
euro zone stand at a 30-month high.
 Goldman Sachs said the S&P 500 index has not fully reflected
the recent downshift in the macro picture, saying that a
short-term correction to the 1,275 area was possible.
 ""As the recent data suggest, if we are no longer in a period
of accelerating growth and if the data continue to point to a
slowing cycle, a short-term tactical index correction... would
not be hard to envisage,"" Goldman said in a note to clients.
 JP Morgan has taken profit on its aggressive longs in
equities within its model portfolio given the impact of growth
downgrades, while it stayed net long on stocks.
 ""The earnings surprise phase is now completed and attention
is likely to shift to the economic data flow... Any remaining
downside growth risks are not enough, though, for us to turn
flat on equities as we do believe that much of recent economic
weakening will turn out temporary.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro and yen on Friday after data showed U.S. employers added
more jobs than expected last month, suggesting the economy may
not be slowing as much as some had feared.
 The dollar rose most against the yen, trading up 0.7
percent at 80.73 yen  as the addition of an unexpectedly
large 244,000 new jobs in April lifted U.S. bond yields,
increasing the greenback's appeal over the Japanese currency.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4455 , retreating further
from a recent 17-month high above $1.49, but rebounded to trade
at $1.4518, down about 0.1 percent.
 ""We've had a string of very weak U.S. data, so we will have
to assess whether that is coming to an end or whether this
number is an aberration,"" said Steven Englander, head of G10 FX
strategist at Citigroup.
 The dollar did not do as well against higher-yielding
currencies that tend to be more sensitive to risk appetite.
 The Australian dollar rose 1.7 percent to $1.0757 ,
making up some losses seen after fears of weaker U.S. and world
growth on Thursday prompted investors to cut risky trades.
It also got a boost when the Reserve Bank of Australia warned a
further rate rise may be needed. [ID:nL3E7G607H]
 Oil pared losses to trade around $99 a barrel but remained
well off a 2011 high above $114 hit earlier this week.
 A large fall in commodity prices, including oil's roughly
10 percent decline, boosted the dollar on Thursday.
 ""Different currencies have different sensitivities to risk,
so the dollar won't gain as much against the Australian dollar,
for instance, as against the yen,"" Englander said.
 For now, the euro was facing resistance around its 21-day
moving average of $1.4576.
 Some traders, though, said the euro was still likely to
gain against the dollar in the medium term, as euro zone
interest rates are expected to rise much more quickly than
those in the United States.
 The euro fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday after the
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled a

strategist at RBS.
 The euro gained some support after ECB official Ewald
Nowotny said the bank's stance should not be interpreted as
dovish. [ID:nHEL010146]
 On the U.S. side, the payrolls data showed the jobless rate
rose from 8.8 percent to 9 percent in April.
 ""The U.S. administration likes to state that currencies
should reflect economic fundamentals,"" said Douglas Borthwick,
managing director of Faros Trading. ""The U.S. economy remains
weak, and so shall the dollar.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell further against the
dollar in thin trade on Friday after steep losses the previous
day, as markets positioned for a key U.S. jobs report.
 The euro  dipped below 1.4500 after falling nearly 2
percent on Thursday to $1.4510, with further falls in oil prices
leaving investors wary of buying back riskier assets. [O/R] 
 But the euro was expected to remain supported by
expectations euro zone rates would continue to rise faster than
U.S. ones, as the European Central Bank tries to tame high
inflation.
 ""We've had a healthy correction in euro/dollar, but I don't
think this is a sea change in sentiment and wouldn't expect it
to move much below $1.45,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist
at RBS.
 Market participants saw limited room for euro gains,
however, and sovereigns were said to be looking to take profits
after buying at lower levels, with offers seen at $1.4580-85.
 The euro also faced resistance at its 21-day moving average
around $1.4576.
 The dollar was supported after jumping on a massive fall in
commodities on Thursday. On Friday, Brent crude  extended
losses after diving 10 percent the previous day, while silver
 steadied from Thursday's 12 percent slump.

 U.S. April non-farm payrolls, due at 1230 GMT, were forecast
to rise 186,000, but some analysts said there was a risk of a
weaker number given recent worse-than-forecast weekly jobless
claims and private payrolls data.  [ID:nN05211728]
 Analysts said a weaker reading would confirm the view that
sluggish U.S. economic growth will hold the Federal Reserve back
from raising interest rates in 2011 or even beyond as other
central banks raise rates.
 This would widen the rate differential between the dollar
and other currencies, keeping the U.S. currency weak, they said.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was little changed at 74.158, still
well above a three-year trough of 72.696 hit this week.
 
 IMPLIED VOLATILITY UP
 The euro fell sharply on Thursday after ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet did not signal a June rate hike. Analysts
said this showed investors had become overly bullish about the
euro zone rates outlook and they were forced to pare back long

 By Thomas Grove
 MOSCOW, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao will
be the top guest at Russia's showcase investor forum next month
as the Kremlin seeks to cement an alliance between the world's
biggest energy producer and the fastest growing major economy.
 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that Hu will
meet Russian leaders and attend the St Petersburg International
Economic Forum, which the Kremlin presents as Russia's answer to
the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.
 ""We in the Russian Federation await the chairman of the
People's Republic of China Hu Jintao, who will hold bilateral
meetings and take part in the St Petersburg Economic Forum,""
Lavrov said at a briefing with Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi.
 Yang confirmed that Hu would travel to the St Petersburg
forum, which Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is expected to
open. It will run from June 16-18.
 Russia and China, which had a border conflict in 1969, say
their relations have never been better though some Russian
officials express anxiety in private about China's growing clout
and talks on energy sales have stalled in recent years.
 But Russia, which is trying to stem capital outflows which
totalled $38.3 billion last year, sees China as a potential
source of billions of dollars in investment which Moscow says it
needs to upgrade ageing Soviet infrastructure.

 PIPELINE
 China has sought to secure long-term oil and gas supplies
from Russia, though wrangling over gas prices has delayed the
construction of a key gas pipeline to China that would allow the
Kremlin to leverage its energy sales to European customers.
 Russia's state-controlled gas company Gazprom wants to pump
30 billion cubic metres of gas a year to China from end-2015 and
a Chinese source said last month that a deal to end years of
stalled talks could be reached by June.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called for boosting sales
of natural resources -- Russia's main exports -- to China, whose
gas consumption is forecast to soar over the next decade.
 But some senior Russian policy makers are concerned by the
influence China wields over the global energy and commodity
markets which drive the fortunes of Russia's $1.5 trillion
economy, which is dwarfed by China's $5.9 trillion GDP.
 China was Russia's single largest trading partner in 2010,
accounting for 9.5 percent of Russia's external trade, though as
a whole the European Union was vastly bigger, accounting for 49
percent of Russia's $625.4 billion external trade.

 (Adds Deutsche Bank, Lloyds)
 By Dmitry Zhdannikov
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, which in April
predicted this week's major correction in oil prices, said on
Friday that oil could surpass its recent highs by 2012 as global
oil supplies continue to tighten.
 The Wall Street bank, seen as one of the most influential in
commodities business, said it did not rule out a further limited
short-term fall in oil prices if macro-economic data, which it
said had sparked this week's crash, continued to disappoint.
 News of Goldman's mid-term outlook on Friday prompted a $1 a
barrel jump in oil prices, helping oil to pare some of its
earlier heavy losses. 
 Oil prices seesawed on Friday, turning positive on better
than expected U.S. jobs data, which eased fears about global
economic recovery that led to a 10-percent price crash on
Thursday.
 ""It is important to emphasize that even as oil prices are
pulling back from their recent highs, we expect them to
return to or surpass the recent highs by next year,"" Goldman
Sachs' analysts said in a research note.
 ""We continue to believe that the oil supply-demand
fundamentals will tighten further over the course of this year,
and likely reach critically tight levels by early next year
should Libyan oil supplies remain off the market,"" it said.
 It said it believed that this week's correction in oil
prices, which fell from above $125 per barrel of Brent crude to
below $106 on Friday, was sparked by disappointing economic data
releases and U.S. oil inventory data.
 ""The sell-off yesterday (May 5) has likely removed a large
portion of the risk premium that we believe has been embedded in
oil prices, which could suggest further downside may be limited
from here"".
 ""However, we remain wary of potential further downside
should economic data releases in coming days continue to
disappoint, with the focus now turning to today's
(May 6) non-farm payroll report in the United States"".
 
 GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY?
 Goldman rocked markets in April by calling a nearly $20 fall
in Brent, saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of
fundamentals.
 Goldman was one of the first banks to predict $100 oil last
decade, in 2005 when prices were closer to $50 a barrel, but it
stayed bullish for some time after oil peaked at $147 in 2008.
 ""In terms of timing, Goldman got it (the crash) right this
time. Well done,"" said an oil trader with a major rival bank.
 ""It (this week's fall) was a move driven by macro funds
after U.S. and German data disappointed and (European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet did not deliver on yet
another rate rise,"" he said.
 ""With Asian funds having liquidated some of their position
today I think we will now see prices stabilising and even if
U.S. jobs data is poor this afternoon, I don't think it will
turn as horrible as yesterday,"" he added.
 Other major commodity players among banks, Barclays Capital
and Deutsche Bank, said on Friday the current levels might be a
good buying opportunity.
 ""While further downside from potential weaker macro releases
cannot be ruled out, the general trend from here should be
higher, rather than lower, in our view,"" said Amrita Sen, an oil
analyst at Barclays.
 She added that worries about tight supplies and unrest in
the Middle East will outweigh concerns about U.S. gasoline
demand destruction or slower Asian demand due to inflation.
 Deutsche Bank commented: ""We believe composure will return
to commodity markets as underlying fundamentals remain bullish
in our view... We believe the collapse in oil prices this week
is more a positioning event than a change underlying
fundamentals.""
 Andrew Moorfield, the head of oil division at Lloyds, said
he saw oil at around $110 in 2011 and $100-$110 going forward.
 ""Despite this week, the demand curve for oil remains with an
upward trajectory... Globally, this general fall in commodities
prices will reduce the drag many were starting to think they
were having on economic growth"".
 Colin O'Shea, head of commodities at Hermes, who helps
manage over $2 billion, also said the correction was a good
opportunity for investors to get into the market if they missed
out on the previous rally.
 ""Fundamentally, in the energy space and in crude oil, not a
lot has actually changed. We have got diminishing spare
capacity, globally demand is picking up, we have got some
supply-side issues -- so the factors that caused the price rises
right throughout 2010 are still there,"" he said.

 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Brent oil prices and world stocks
rebounded on Friday after U.S. data showed jobs growth
accelerated in April, tempering concerns that the recovery in
the world's biggest economy was stalling.
 Spot gold  fell as the dollar added to gains against a
basket of major currencies <.DXY> after the surprisingly upbeat
data soothed the nerves of investors who had earlier dumped
riskier assets following patchy U.S. economic data.
 A total of 244,000 jobs were added, U.S. non-farm payrolls
data showed, above the 186,000 expected in a Reuters poll.
However, the unemployment rate rose to 9 percent from 8.8
percent where analysts had expected it to remain steady.
[ID:nOAT004799]
 ""The numbers were better than expected and the market reacted
positively to that,"" ETX Capital sales trader Anita Paluch said.
""It seemed as if the market was looking for support in terms of
good numbers after yesterday's disappointing jobless claims data
and have taken these numbers quite positively.""
 European shares <.FTEU3> extended gains and were last 0.9
percent higher while the MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
was up 0.1 percent.
 Before the data, the world stock index was on track for its
biggest weekly fall since mid-August as this week's rout in
commodity prices and patchy U.S. and European economic data had
made investors nervous about taking big bets before the U.S.
jobs report.
 
 TRADE CHOPPY
 Brent crude futures headed higher and U.S. prices zigzagged
in choppy trade as the report supported the dollar against the
euro and the yen, capping oil market gains. 
 ICE Brent June crude  rose 20 cents to $111 a barrel,
having traded from $105.15 to $112.65. June crude  fell 4
cents to $99.76 a barrel, trading from $94.63 to $100.95. 
 Gold lost some of its safe-haven allure, dipping below
$1,478 an ounce  as the dollar strengthened. 
 ""This is the first positive data point in several days. To
the extent it gives further lift to the dollar, commodities will
continue to come under pressure,"" said John Kilduff, partner at
Again Capital LLC in New York.
 Commodity markets were poised for a further near-term drop
as speculators and those who joined the rally in its late stages
unwind long positions, Tetsu Emori, a commodities fund manager
at Astmax Co in Tokyo, said earlier.
 Silver plummeted more than $12 to $109 at one point on
Thursday after another margin hike by the CME Group on its COMEX
silver futures increased the cost of the trading the metal,
dragging gold down 3 percent and triggering a brutal sell-off in
other commodities.
 It was the best performing asset class in 2011 until last
week, posting gains of more than 10 percent.

760,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2011 06:28AM ET</span>","EU expects to agree Singapore FTA this year, more in 2012"," By Andrew Marshall	
 JAKARTA, May 6 (Reuters) - The European Union expects to
finalise its first free trade agreement with a southeast Asian
country this year -- most probably a deal with Singapore -- with
more to follow in 2012, Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said
on Friday.	
 Talks on a bloc-to-bloc trade deal between the EU and the
10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) were
abandoned in 2009, and the EU instead began exploring pacts with
individual countries in the region. 
 Negotiations with both Singapore and Malaysia are under way,
and the EU hopes to start discussing free trade deals with
Indonesia and Vietnam, De Gucht told a briefing for reporters,
as well as Thailand after it holds an election this year.	
 Asked for a tentative timetable for deals to be agreed, De
Gucht said: ""We hope to finalise one this year, more next year
and the rest in 2013."" Asked which country would agree an FTA
this year, he said the ""highest possibility"" was Singapore,
which opened free trade talks with the Europeans in 2010.	
 That would mean an agreement with Malaysia was expected in
2012, with possible deals with Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and
the Philippines in 2012 or 2013.	
 The timetable was for deals to be agreed -- ratification
usually takes about another year.	
 On Wednesday, South Korea's parliament approved a free trade
agreement with the EU, clearing the last hurdle before it takes
effect in July. Talks on the deal had begun in 2007, with the EU
racing the United States to be the first to strike a deal with
Seoul. The U.S. FTA remains some way from completion, although
both sides say they hope to conclude it by end-year.	
 The deal was the most ambitious bilateral FTA ever
negotiated by the EU, according to De Gucht, and could provide
an impetus for other Asian countries to seek an agreement.	
 
 HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE COMPLICATE NEGOTIATIONS	
 De Gucht said there were two key reasons for the abandonment
of efforts to strike a bloc-to-bloc deal between the EU and
ASEAN -- wide differences in the level of development of
different ASEAN nations that made a single deal extremely
difficult; and the issue of Myanmar's membership.	
 The EU imposes economic sanctions on Myanmar because of the
country's failure to install a legitimate civilian government.
Most sanctions have remained in place despite elections in
Myanmar last year to select members of a parliament that has
ostensibly taken over from the military in running the country.	
 The EU and other Western nations have said this process was
a sham and the same people remain in charge, with real democracy
still distant. 
 Myanmar, however, is by no means the only country in the
region to have a deficit of democracy and an appalling human
rights record. Laos and Vietnam are often criticised for rights
violations, Thailand and Cambodia have been slipping towards
greater authoritarianism, and Singapore, which holds an election
on Saturday, is nevertheless effectively a one-party state.	
 De Gucht denied that the EU was singling out Myanmar in
making that country a pariah when many of its neighbours were
little better. He noted that before entering into FTA talks with
any country, the EU first insisted on a Partnership and
Cooperation Agreement (PCA) which sets out expected standards
for human rights, labour conditions and political progress.	
 The ASEAN bloc says it aims to become a fully integrated
economic region in 2015 -- although many analysts regard this
target as wildly optimistic given differing levels of
development and multiple ongoing bilateral feuds, most seriously
the border skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia.	
 De Gucht said the EU would continue negotiating trade deals
with the region on a bilateral basis, and if and when an
integrated ASEAN economy comes into effect, this would be the
time to resume bloc-to-bloc negotiations.

 * Yuan may hover at recent levels but more rises are
expected
 * Yuan at 6.4938, up 5.1 pct since depegging

 By Chen Yixin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - The yuan ended little changed
against the dollar on Friday, after the People's Bank of China
kept the currency relatively stable and the yuan is expected to
push higher after next week's U.S-China economic dialogue.	
 Spot yuan closed at 6.4938 versus the dollar at
midday, almost flat from Thursday's close of 6.4937. 
 Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.5003 against the dollar, slightly firmer than Thursday's
6.5025. The central bank uses the mid-point to express the
governments' intention for the yuan's movements.	
 Traders said the market widely expects the central bank to
set the mid-point even higher after the dollar index
jumped 1.6 percent on Thursday and held around those levels on
Friday.	
 The yuan may also push upwards after next week's U.S.-China
Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington, lest Beijing
appears to be bowing to political pressure. 
 ""The yuan has repeatedly hit record highs, it should take a
rest,"" said a dealer at a Chinese bank in Shanghai. ""But the
pause should be temporary. It will still hit a fresh high.""	
 Market players expect the yuan has potential to rise five to
six percent this year as policymakers in Beijing have made it
increasingly clear they are willing to use the currency to curb
inflation, especially to buffer imported inflation from high
commodity prices. Consumer prices in March hit a 32-month high
of 5.4 percent from a year earlier.	
 China also faces pressure from the United State, who
continues to urge Beijing to move faster on letting the yuan
appreciate. 
 Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said on Friday
that China agrees with the United States on the direction of
yuan reform, but the two countries differ on the pace of
appreciation. [ID:nL3E7G607C]	
 The yuan has now appreciated 5.1 percent since it was
depegged from the dollar in June 2010, and 1.5 percent since the
start of this year.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.3530 late on Friday, up slightly
from 6.3450 at the previous close. Their implied yuan
appreciation in a year's time fell to 2.3 percent from 2.4
percent.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against the
dollar on Friday after steep losses the previous day, helped by
sovereign demand and with investors concerned a weak U.S. jobs
report could weigh on the greenback.
 Traders said euro gains might be limited as sovereigns were
also looking to take profits after buying at lower levels, with
offers seen at $1.4580-85.
 The euro was steady at $1.4532 after falling nearly 2
percent on Thursday to $1.4510. However, further falls in oil
prices and on equity markets left investors wary of buying back
into riskier assets.
 U.S. April non-farm payrolls were forecast to rise 186,000,
but analysts said there was a risk of a weaker number given
worse-than-forecast weekly jobless claims and private payrolls
data.
 ""Any reading that is short of the consensus would confirm
the status quo, that the Federal Reserve does not have a clear
timeline for when it will start removing stimulus and for this
reason we expect dollar weakness to continue,"" said Stephan
Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Traders said a weak report would weigh on the dollar, after
it rose around 1.5 percent versus a basket of currencies on
Thursday, its biggest one-day gain since mid-October.
 The catalyst for the dollar's rebound was a massive fall in
commodities on Thursday. Brent crude dived a record $12 a barrel
and silver slumped by nearly $5, its biggest one-day decline
since 1980.
 The dollar index was steady at 74.200 after rising as high
as 74.225 on Thursday, well above a three-year trough of 72.696
hit earlier in the week.
 The euro fell sharply on Thursday after European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet did not signal a June rate
hike. Analysts said this showed investors had become overly
bullish about the rates outlook and were forced to pare back
long positions.
 However, they expected the euro to remain supported by
expectations euro zone rates would rise in the coming months.
 The euro jumped on Friday after ECB official Ewald Nowotny
said the bank's stance should not be interpreted as dovish,
though gains were capped around the 21-day moving average at
$1.4578.
 
 YEN LOWER, AUSSIE SHINES
 The yen fell after a big rise the previous day, easing
immediate concerns about possible further official intervention
to stem its gains. Traders reported demand to sell the currency
from Japanese retail and real money accounts as they returned
from the Golden Week holiday.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 80.30 yen, bouncing from a
seven-week low of 79.57 yen hit on Thursday and tackling
resistance from the bottom of the Ichimoku cloud at 80.493. A
weak U.S. jobs reading could push the yen back up, however.
 Market players saw limited chances of intervention from
Japanese authorities, let alone joint action by the Group of
Seven countries, after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda
said on Thursday that current forex moves appeared different
from those seen when the G7 intervened in March.
 Commodity currencies recovered, led by strong gains for the
Australian dollar, which was up 0.7 percent at $1.0653,
benefiting after the Reserve Bank of Australia warned a further
rate rise would be needed.
 ""As some players had built up long positions in the Aussie
and the euro, based on the rise in commodities, further falls in
commodities could mean more position unwinding in currency
markets,"" said Makoto Noji, currency analyst at SMBC Nikko
Securities in Tokyo.
 ""I do think that what we are seeing is position adjustment
rather than the reversal of a trend. But as speculator positions
in oil were very big, the impact of a sell-off could be quite
large,"" he added.

 * Special economic zone gives tax breaks to investors
 
 By Simon Akam
 NEWTON, Sierra Leone, May 6 (Reuters) - West Africa's first
tax-exempt economic zone has opened in Sierra Leone, aiming to
produce the impoverished country's first significant value-added
exports since the end of its civil war nine years ago.
 The First Step Economic Opportunity Zone provides its
tenants with duty- and tax-exempt status for any goods or
capital equipment they import, along with a three-year tax
holiday.
 Fruit juice concentrate producer Africa Felix, the first
tenant at the 54-acre site at Newton, an hour's drive from the
capital Freetown, will begin output next week.
 ""We as a government strongly believe that the private sector
is the engine of growth,"" Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai
Koroma told the opening ceremony on Thursday.
 ""Soon people all over Europe and the U.S. will be able to
taste Sierra Leone's superior fruit,"" he added, standing close
by a newly constructed hangar-size factory building in a large
expanse of newly cleared bush.
 After Koroma came to power in 2007 he promised to run his
country ""like a business"".
 Nine years after the end of hostilities in Sierra Leone, the
country is widely considered a successful example of
international intervention to secure peace. In February the last
U.N. peacekeepers finally left.
 However, Sierra Leone remains one of the world's poorest
nations, despite increasing interest from international
investors focusing on its lavish natural resources, which
include diamonds, iron ore, rutile and bauxite.
 Eight hundred thousand of Sierra Leone's 6.2 million people
are without proper employment. The gross national income per
capita stands at $340 a year -- less than a dollar a day -- and
the national budget is a mere $500 million.
 Special economic zones offering preferential terms in return
for investment are common in parts of Asia but rare in Africa.
 ""Africa's always seen as a place where you dig stuff up, cut
things down or take it out of the water and ship it somewhere
else,"" said Richard Schroeder, president and CEO of First Step.
 Michael Owen, the U.S. ambassador to Sierra Leone, added:
""This special economic zone is in fact an incubator, a breeding
ground for new ideas, a safe haven for foreign capital.""
 
 DISPENSING WITH AID
 Although a commercial enterprise, First Step is 75-percent
owned by the American Christian NGO World Hope.
 Africa Felix -- which will initially produce pineapple and
mango concentrate -- is run by Italian Claudio Scotto.
 With a background in the food industry and a Sierra Leonean
wife, he was looking for business opportunities in the country.
 ""Importing shoes in this country is an easy business. It's
finding things to export that is the challenge,"" he said.
 Mangoes are abundant in Sierra Leone, but until now there
has been little or no market infrastructure for farmers to sell
the fruit.
 Roads in rural areas are so poor that much of the crop ends
up rotting on the branch, while the mango juice on sale in
Freetown is imported from Lebanon.
 There are few large growers, and so Africa Felix established
ties with smallholders in the hinterland, who it hopes will be
able to provide it with the fruit it needs.
 ""This is the way we want things to go in the future,"" said
Minister of Trade and Industry Richard Konteh. ""We don't believe
that we should rely forever on aid.""

768,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2011 04:04AM ET</span>",SPECIAL REPORT-A big fat Greek real estate sale," In one of the most blatant recent cases, a former
conservative environment minister was caught building a summer
house near Athens with an expired permit. He was not sacked.
 But no scandal has shaken Greece in recent years more than a
monastery land swap that helped bring down the conservative
government in 2009 and illustrated the state's failure to take
advantage of its own assets. In 2008, monks at the wealthy Mount
Athos monastery of Vatopedi convinced government officials to
exchange cheap farmland for prime Athens real estate, in a deal
that cost taxpayers millions of euros in lost land value.
Despite parliamentary investigations, no senior politician has
so far been charged.
 Such scandals have created suspicion among voters who see
politicians and their business friends profiting from opaque
real estate trades with seeming impunity. For the privatisation
plans to work, local property experts say, they will have to be
squeaky clean.
 ""It must be so transparent that it convinces everyone
nothing dirty lurks behind, nothing suspicious that will make
some rich from stealing the people's property,"" said Aristotelis
Karytinos, head of group real estate at the National Bank of
Greece (NBG), the country's largest commercial bank.
 
 'WE MUST CHANGE'
 But there's a problem with that: corruption helps grease the
slow wheels of bureaucracy.
 Red tape can delay projects for years, said Yannis Perrotis,
managing director of CB Richard Ellis-Atria and part of a
committee set up in 2003 by the then-socialist government to
target one billion euros in state property development. That
plan was interrupted when the conservative New Democracy party
came to power in 2004, and then again when the Vatopedi
monastery scandal broke.
 While small local developers can virtually raise buildings
anywhere, for a major foreign investor red tape is a
disincentive. ""Many foreigners have had very bad experiences
going through unimaginable troubles from Greek bureaucracy,""
said Karytinos.
 Even if the problems of corruption and bureaucracy are dealt
with, things can get tangled quickly for other reasons.
 The airport at Hellenikon is exhibit A. The government hopes
bulldozers will start work there for the project with Qatar --
which it says was attracted by the unique location of the site
-- as early as the first quarter of 2012. That would give Greece
a much-needed psychological boost and give a signal to investors
that Greece can work.
 ""Hellenikon will add value, create jobs and motivate the
international business community. It is a womb that will bear
many children,"" said Harris Pamboukis, State Minister in charge
of major projects, in March.
 But the project's opponents, led by mayor Kortzidis, are
determined to stop it. The soft-spoken leftist admits that
financially strapped local municipalities cannot afford to
maintain the huge public park he is fighting for, but insists
they will fight all the same. His town hall in the southwestern
Athens suburb of Argyroupoli is a picture of neglect, with
peeling paint and littered steps.
 ""Just because we can't take care of a square doesn't mean we
have to hand it over to private interests. We must change, we
must do things better ourselves,"" said Kortzidis.
 Greece has a long history of protesters blocking projects.
Neighbours held up the construction of the new Acropolis Museum
for more than a decade. This time, the government says it is
determined to avoid delays.
 ""We will clash with anyone who has an agenda of doing
nothing,"" said Pamboukis, the minister. ""The only way to stop a
project is through the law. The government will be very tough on
illegal actions which are often politically motivated.""
 Qatar's interest in Hellenikon shows the demand is there, he
said. ""Foreign investors are interested in Hellenikon because it
is rare, and rare is desirable. It will unblock things and
inspire others and that is why the prime minister is urging us
to go faster.""
 Well, sort of. Prime Minister George Papandreou tried to
calm public disquiet by telling parliament in February that ""not
an inch of Greek land will be sold"". That added to the confusion
-- it seems to mean that only buildings would be sold, but land
would be leased or parcelled out using a more complex
instrument, such as a holding company selling shares to
investors. In the current depressed international economy, such
deals might be hard to sell.
 Apart from Qatar, demand for projects may come from China --
its Cosco Pacific signed a 3.4 billion euro concession to run
the port of Piraeus in 2008 -- Russia or Japan. ""No one else has
the money,"" said one euro zone finance official, who discounted
the prospect of a European buyer.
 But potential buyers are wary. A Qatari consortium walked
away from a 3.5 billion euro energy project in western Greece in
October, a setback for Greek hopes to lure up to $5 billion in
investment from the cash-rich Arab emirate. Government officials
said at the time the two Qatari companies involved, Qatar
Petroleum and the Qatar Investment Authority, could not agree
with their Greek partners on the viability of the plan.
 
 EXPENSIVE ODYSSEY
 Advisers to the government have so far issued a list of 20
initial potential assets to sell, including land on the island
of Rhodes which might be turned into a golf course, and an area
next to the spectacular Rio-Antirio bridge near the western port
city of Patras that could be used for tourism or business
development.
 How much might Greece really own? A first glimpse came in a
report last November by the ISTAME think tank, which put the
value of property owned directly by the state at 272 billion
euros. This did not include tourist assets such as marinas,
camping sites and spas, or Olympic Games venues that belong to
two different state organisations, and ISTAME admitted its
figure may be way off.
 ""Commercial value can certainly be more but it will hinge on
how one exploits it,"" said ISTAME President, Elias Mosialos, a
socialist MP. ""It depends on how it can be used, if it has legal
or infringement issues, and if it can be developed.""
 Greek officials and bankers started to bounce the 300
billion euro figure off investors in London and New York during
trips in late 2010. With the figures in the open, Europe and the
IMF pushed harder and after an inspection visit in February an
initial government target of 1 billion euros in privatisation
revenues in 2011 was revised dramatically upwards, to the 2-3
billion this year and 15 billion by 2013.
 Much rides on Hellenikon. Clinching a deal with Qatar and
smoothly launching the project will offer foreign investors
concrete proof that things in Greece can change. But that will
have to be followed by an overhaul of the property and
development laws. ""We must offer projects that are ready to go,
if possible with permits obtained to avoid such problems in the
future,"" NBG's Karytinos said.
 This makes a no-go of sites redolent with historic appeal
that draw millions of tourists every year. They are often so
entangled in archaeological, environmental and legal
restrictions that from a property developer's point of view
there's nothing to be done with them. That rules out landmarks
like the Acropolis, even though Germany's media have suggested
that Greece sell it off to pay down its debts.
 ""A monument may be priceless but it has no real estate value
because we are looking for development,"" Karytinos said. ""We
must look at what we have and how best to take advantage of it
without getting stuck in Greece's legal jumble.""
 Can Greece do it? Pamboukis said the effort will combine the
experience of the public sector with the international view and
dynamism of the private sector.
 ""Imagine it as a Greek Odyssey,"" he said. ""Odysseus reached
Ithaca following an idea. He didn't have a map but he made it
home.""
 It took Odysseus a decade.

769,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2011 02:48AM ET</span>","FOREX-Dollar could test resistance, commodities spook bears"," * Rough swings in commodities dictate currency trades
 * Lack of hints on rate hike from ECB hurt euro
 * Dollar/yen up on Japanese buying after holidays
 * Yen intervention seen unlikely after Finmin comments
 * Aussie jumps 1 pct after RBA warns of more rate hikes
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 6 (Reuters) - The dollar on Friday held on to
most of the chunky gains it made the previous day, with key
resistance levels in its grasp as tumbling commodity prices and
a series of soft U.S. data prompted profit-taking in
higher-yielding currencies.
 While commodity prices stabilised somewhat on Friday, they
could fall further after upcoming U.S. jobs data, driving more
gains in the dollar as the euro and commodity currencies are
likely to fall in sympathy with other risk assets.
 A weak U.S. jobs reading is likely push the Japanese yen
near a seven-week high against the greenback hit on Thursday as
it would likely trigger short-covering in the currency, which is
often used to fund investments in risk assets due to low
interest rates.
 Market players also see limited chances of
intervention from Japanese authorities, let alone joint action
by the Group of Seven (G7) countries, after Japanese Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Thursday that current forex
moves appear to be different from those seen around the time the
G7 intervened in March. [ID:nL3E7G525S]
 The dollar index against a basket of currencies stood at
74.03 <.DXY> <=USD>, down slightly on the day after having risen
1.5 percent on Thursday, its biggest gain in over six months. It
was well off a three-year trough of 72.696, with an immediate
target seen at 74.653, the kijun line on the daily Ichimoku
chart.
 The catalyst for the dollar's rebound was a massive fall in
commodities on Thursday. Brent crude oil  dived a record
$12 a barrel and silver  slumped by nearly $5, its biggest
one-day decline since 1980, though they stabilised on Friday.
 Many market players had been buying commodities on the view
that money-printing by the U.S. Federal Reserve should boost
their value, which in turn was fueling inflation worldwide,
prompting some central banks to raise rates.
 ""As some players had built up long positions in the Aussie
and the euro, based on the rise in commodities, further falls in
commodities could mean more position unwinding in currency
markets,"" said Makoto Noji, currency analyst at SMBC Nikko
Securities.
 ""I do think that what we are seeing is position adjustment
rather than the reversal of a trend. But as speculator positions
in oil were very big, the impact of a sell-off could be quite
large,"" he added.
 The euro was also pressured after ECB chief Jean-Claude
Trichet did not give any signals on Thursday that there would be
a rate rise in June, by steering clear of using the key words
""strong vigilance"" in his comments on inflation.
 The currency stabilised around $1.4545  after shedding
more than 2 percent to as low as $1.4510 on Thursday, its lowest
in over a week.
 For now the euro was supported above the kijun line on its
daily Ichimoku chart at $1.4501. More support is seen at
$1.4490, its low on 26 April and $1.4455, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its rally since mid-April.
 Some traders think the euro's adjustment may have run its
course, after having fallen about 1.7 percent so far this week,
which would be its largest weekly loss in four months if the
euro remains at the current level by the end of Friday.
 Still, a failure to recover above its 20-day moving average
at around $1.4580 could make its near-term outlook bearish -- a
likely scenario if the U.S. jobs data due later in the day saps
investor risk appetite.
 Data showed on Thursday the number of Americans filing for
jobless aid rose to an eight-month high last week, which came
after weaker employment growth in manufacturing and service
sectors in April.
 TACKLING RESISTANCE
 Investor risk aversion is also helping the Japanese yen,
although selling from Japanese importers after Japan's Golden
Week holidays pushed it back from the seven-week high hit on
Thursday.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 80.55 yen  in early
Friday trade, bouncing from its seven-week low of 79.57 yen and
tackling resistance from the bottom of the Ichimoku cloud at
80.493.
 ""I expect some buying from Japanese at the current dollar
level, though I don't see big moves in Asian trade today either
ahead of the U.S. Job data,"" said Teppei Ino, currency analyst
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 While the yen has risen to levels the Group of Seven (G7)
countries jointly intervened to stem the yen's strength in
March, many analysts suspect that intervention is less likely
this time.
 ""When they intervened after the earthquake, market
volatility was shooting up and there were clearly speculative
moves to boost the yen. This time the yen's moves have been
moderate, so I don't think they will intervene just because the
dollar fell below 80 yen,"" said Nikko's Noji.
 Some traders also noted that there is less incentive for
Japan to intervene as exporters do not have that many dollars to
sell as exports have fallen due to supply chain problems after
the devastating earthquake in March.
 Some stop-loss orders are seen at around 79.50 yen and
below, which suggests some chance of the dollar's fall
accelerating if that level is broken.
 The Aussie dollar pared most of its sharp losses made on
Thursday with a 1 percent jump after the Reserve Bank of
Australia warned on Friday a further rise in interest rates will
be needed at some point in order to keep inflation contained.
[ID:nL3E7G607H]
 The Aussie fetched $1.0725 , off a two-week low of
$1.0537 hit on Thursday. Against the yen, it gained about 1.6
percent to 86.30 yen , bouncing back from Thursday's
five-week low of 84.39 yen.
 A Reuters poll showed on Friday that analysts expect the
Australian dollar  to hang on above parity against the
U.S. dollar over the next year helped by speculation that
domestic rates, already among the highest in the developed
world, may head even higher. [ID:nL3E7F60BV]

 * Yuan at 6.4958, up 5.09 pct since depegging

 By Chen Yixin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - The yuan inched slightly lower
against the dollar on Friday, after the People's Bank of China
kept the currency relatively stable and the yuan is expected to
push higher after next week's U.S-China economic dialogue.	
 Spot yuan was trading at 6.4958 versus the dollar
at midday, down from Thursday's close of 6.4937. 
 Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.5003 against the dollar, slightly firmer than Thursday's
6.5025. The central bank uses the mid-point to express the
governments' intention for the yuan's movements.	
 Traders said the market widely expects the central bank to
set the mid-point even higher after the dollar index hit
1.6 percent on Thursday.	
 The yuan may also push upwards after next week's U.S.-China
Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington, lest Beijing
appears to be bowing to political pressure. 
 ""The yuan has repeatedly hit record highs, it should take a
rest,"" said a dealer at a Chinese bank in Shanghai. ""But the
pause should be temporary. It will still hit a fresh high.""	
 Market players expect the yuan has potential to rise five to
six percent this year as policymakers in Beijing have made it
increasingly clear they are willing to use the currency to curb
inflation, especially to buffer imported inflation from high
commodity prices. Consumer prices in March hit a 32-month high
of 5.4 percent from a year earlier.	
 China also faces pressure from the United State, who
continues to urge Beijing to move faster on letting the yuan
appreciate. 
 Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said on Friday
that China agrees with the United States on the direction of
yuan reform, but the two countries differ on the pace of
appreciation. [ID:nL3E7G607C]	
 The yuan has now appreciated 5.1 percent since it was
depegged from the dollar in June 2010, and 1.43 percent since
the start of this year.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.3490 at midday, little changed from
6.3450 at the previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in
a year's time is 2.4 percent.	"

(Adds possible BOJ response)	
 By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto	
 TOKYO, May 6 (Reuters) - Japan warned on Friday it was
closely watching currency markets but stopped short of using
stronger language threatening action, a sign the yen's rise to a
seven-week high has not alarmed policymakers enough to consider
intervening in the market.	
 Despite the yen's brief rise near levels hit just before the
G7 currency intervention on March 18, many analysts suspect
intervention by Japanese authorities, let alone joint G7 action,
is less likely now with the yen's ascent more moderate than back
then, when the dollar tumbled 3 yen in a single day.	
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Friday he will
closely watch movements in foreign exchange and financial
commodity markets.	
 When asked whether Tokyo will discuss the yen's sharp rise
with G7 counterparts, he would not comment directly and said:
""At this point we will carefully watch (market moves).""	
 Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said that while excessive
volatility was undesirable, markets should set currency levels.	
 ""Levels are decided by markets,"" Yosano told reporters. ""If
you focus specifically on the yen, you could say this move seems
more like dollar weakness than a yen rally.""	
 The dollar bounced back to around 80.50 yen on Friday after
falling as far as 79.57 yen on Thursday, close to a record low
of 76.25 yen hit shortly before G7 economies jointly
intervened to stem yen gains on March 18.	
 
 BOJ RESPONSE	
 A sharp rise in the yen could deal a further blow to Japan's
export-led economy, which is reeling from the impact of the
March 11 earthquake.	
 But Tokyo may have difficulty garnering G7 support for
further intervention unless the yen rises much faster, as was
the case shortly after the earthquake, analysts say.	
 Noda said on Thursday that current foreign exchange moves
appear to be different from those seen around the time the G7
intervened in March. [ID:nL3E7G525S]	
 That means that if yen rises persist, the Bank of Japan may
come under pressure to loosen monetary policy further to support
the economy, some analysts say.	
 BOJ officials do not rule out easing again if a sharply
higher yen, coupled with falls in stock prices, hurts business
sentiment and threatens Japan's return to a moderate economic
recovery. The central bank's policy review meeting will be held
on May 19-20.	
 The BOJ is also expected to keep flooding markets with cash
through its market operations, although it does not see this as
an effective way to directly weaken the yen.	
 Japan's monetary base jumped to a record level in April as
the current account balance commercial banks park with the BOJ
soared due to the central bank's huge fund injections.	
 But BOJ officials say the current account balance is
expected to fall as the appetite for immediate quake-relief
funds wanes. [ID:nL3E7G601U]	
 The BOJ nudged interest rates effectively to zero last year
as part of its efforts to pull Japan out of deflation. It also
eased monetary policy days after the March 11 quake, by
expanding asset purchases, to soothe market jitters.

 By Chris Buckley	
 BEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - China staked out areas of
contention with the United States on Friday ahead of strategic
talks in Washington next week, including the pace of yuan reform
and concerns about U.S. debt levels, but Beijing also stressed
the two sides' co-dependency. 
 China agrees with the United States on the direction of yuan
reform, but the two countries differ on the pace of
appreciation, Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said at
a briefing, setting the stage for a clash at next week's annual
Strategic and Economic Dialogue with the United States.	
 China's currency policies have been a major irritant in ties
for several years and a focus of U.S. congressional anger at
China since at least 2005. Contention over the yuan exchange
rate has cooled a bit this year, but this remains a major
irritant in relations.	
 Zhu said China and the United States have different views on
yuan exchange rate reform, with the United States stressing
appreciation of the currency.	
 ""On these specific issues, I frankly acknowledge that China
and the United States have different views. Therefore, we need
to have discussion,"" he said.	
 In comments that broke little new ground and signaled that
Beijing would not be goaded into swift action, Zhu reiterated
Beijing's position that China's exchange rate policy is a matter
of sovereignty.	
 Zhu said that Vice-Premier Wang Qishan told U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner that the yuan exchange rate reform
was in China's interest and that China wants deeper discussion
on fiscal policies.	
 Zhu made clear China had concerns of its own that would
likely be aired in the discussions.	
 ""We hope that the United States will provide a healthy legal
and institutional setting for investment. In particular, we hope
that the United States will not discriminate against Chinese
state-owned companies."" Zhu said, while providing assurances
Beijing would give foreign companies access to China's markets.	
 Turning the focus toward challenges faced by the United
States, Zhu said China is paying high attention to the U.S. debt
and fiscal deficit.	
 ""We are paying a lot of attention to this, and Treasury
Secretary Geithner has swiftly informed Vice Premier Wang Qishan
about the situation,"" he said. ""We hope that the United States
in its fiscal clean-up will be able to adopt effective measures
based on President Obama's proposal.""	
 He reiterated that Beijing is not deliberately seeking a
trade surplus with the United States.	
 ""China's position is clear -- that we are not deliberately
pursuing a large trade surplus,"" Zhu said. ""This is a mutually
beneficial, win-win economic relationship.""	
 A key cause of friction between Beijing and Washington is
the U.S. trade deficit with China. Despite a pledge by both
countries to work together on overcoming global imbalances, the
U.S. trade deficit with China in 2010 rose to $273.1 billion, a
20.4 percent increase in the shortfall in 2009. 
 But many U.S. lawmakers believe that an undervalued yuan is
a root cause of the trade imbalance, with some saying the
currency is undervalued by 15 percent to 40 percent, giving
Chinese companies an unfair price advantage in international
trade. 
 The Obama administration continues to say that Beijing must
move faster to let the yuan rise.	
 China loosened its currency from a nearly two-year peg to
the dollar in June, and this year the People's Bank of China has
guided the yuan to record highs. It has now appreciated about 5
percent since June, and 1.5 percent since the start of this
year.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have also made it clear they will
deploy the currency as a weapon to fight inflation, which hit a
32-month high of 5.4 percent in March. That inflation means
China's real exchange rate has increased more than the nominal
rate.	
 Zhu added that managing China's growing foreign exchange
holdings was ""challenging"".

 By Eric Onstad and Manolo Serapio Jr
 LONDON/SINGAPORE, May 6 (Reuters) - Commodities spiralled
lower again on Friday with crude oil sliding a further $5 as
concerns over a slowdown in global growth sent traders rushing
for the exit for the fourth successive session. 
 Crude oil again suffered the deepest losses amid widespread
selling of silver, industrial metals and grains as worries over
global growth in a market ripe for profit taking combined to
cause a widespread rout.
 Brent crude tumbled as much as 5.1 percent to a low of
$105.15 per barrel. Unrest across Arab nations had helped spur
investors to pile into oil since the start of the year, driving
Brent to a 2-1/2 year high of $127 last month.
 Brent has lost more 12 percent alone since Wednesday's
close, the biggest two-day fall since the global financial
crisis over two years ago
 ""People are waking up to a whole new world. This is part of
the adjustment process,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing
director of Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.
 ""The volatility will stay with us for some time.""
 Brent fell by a record $12 at one point during Thursday's
bloodbath, the second biggest drop on record.
 U.S. crude also lost over $5 to a low of $94.63.
 ""From here I would expect some form of stability, trading
sideways maybe, but if we break throught the lows of last night
I think we're definitely looking at $90 and possibly worse,""
Sean Corrigan, chief investment strategist at Diapason
Commodities Management in Switzerland, said.
 Silver was down as much as 2 percent to $34.23 an ounce
while gold retained its safe-haven status, rising nearly one
percent.
 Some pointed to silver, which dropped almost $5 an ounce on
Thursday for its biggest one-day drop since 1980, as showing the
risks of holding frothy commodities, especially after margins on
trading COMEX silver futures have risen so sharply.
 Silver hit a record high just last Thursday close to $50 but
has since slumped almost 30 percent, an uncomfortable reminder
of the panic selling in 1980 when an attempt to corner the
market by two Texas oil tycoons fell apart.
 Jitters over global economic growth was the spark for the
commodities selloff that pushed the 19-commodity
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index down 5 percent on Thursday for its
fifth biggest one-day fall on record.
 Investors shifted their focus to U.S. jobs data due later on
Friday to gauge if concerns over the health of the world's
biggest economy are misplaced or not.
 Global manufacturing growth eased in April, JP Morgan said,
and the services sectors in both the United States and Europe
cooled, adding to data that suggests some faltering in the
world's recovery from the global financial crisis.
 Fears about a slowdown in economic growth and tightening
in the biggest metals consumer China hit coppper and other
industrial metals again.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange gave up
nearly 1 percent to $8,730 a tonne, zinc shed 1.6 percent and
tin fell 2.1 percent.
 Copper's weak fundamentals also weighed on its performance
as investors worried about high inventories in Chinese bonded
warehouses.
 Grains again joined the weakness. U.S. corn futures fell
more than 2 percent in late Asian trade and wheat shed 1.8
percent.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 6 (Reuters) - A record-setting rout in
commodity prices overnight showed signs of fizzling out on
Friday, led by a small pullback in silver, while Asian equities
consolidated near the day's lows as market players squared
positions before U.S. payrolls data.	
 Both spot silver and gold rose in Asia. Crude futures also
gained, but then swung lower as European markets opened up.	
 This week's steady drip of selling turned into a deluge on
Thursday. Spot silver and Brent crude  were battered by
record single-day falls, with the latter plummeting more than
$12 to $109 at one point. The broader Reuters-Jefferies CRB
index , a global commodity benchmark, dropped nearly 5
percent.	
 In Asia on Friday, the dramatic plunges caused a brief wave
of stop-loss selling in stocks and commodity currencies such as
the Australian dollar , which pushed higher some funding
currency favorites like the yen and the dollar.	
 While some scattered buying pushed prices mildly higher in
Asian time, trading remained volatile and sentiment cautious as
this week's sharp drops in metals weighed on the broader market.	
 Even as the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index looked set to
lose at least 8 percent on the week, for its biggest weekly fall
since July 2008, Tetsu Emori, a commodities fund manager at
Astmax Co in Tokyo, said prices may fall some more.	
 Commodity markets are poised for a further near-term drop as
speculators and those who joined the rally in its late stages
unwind long positions, Emori said. It was the best performing
asset class in 2011 until last week, posting gains of more than
10 percent.	
 Energy and resource counters, which had been the
outperformers in Asian equities before the selling spree in
commodities erupted, led declines in regional stock markets.	
 Australia's shares , which fell nearly half a
percent, climbed back to be 0.2 percent off, thanks to a strong
banking sector while shares outside Japan held
early losses and were down 0.4 percent. 
 For the week, that index was is set to drop more than 3
percent. The Hang Seng index was off 0.4 percent.	
 Japanese shares , opening after a three-day break,
fell 1.5 percent on concerns that the yen's sudden surge due to
unwinding of carry trades and a patch of U.S. soft data this
week would slow the pace of the broader economic recovery.	
 
 
 SILVER	
 COMEX silver  slumped 5 percent in early trades
before pulling back somewhat, but was heading for a weekly loss
of nearly 30 percent as investors such as billionaire Carlos
Slim increased bearish bets against the metal's dizzying rise
this year. [ID:nN04107769]	
 Spot silver prices rose around 1 percent and gold was up
just under 1 percent, to pare back some of the heavy losses from
Thursday.	
 U.S. crude oil  steadied after seeing its
second-largest single-day loss on Thursday due to a washout of
overstretched long positions arising from unrest in North Africa
and the Middle East, traders said.	
 However, crude futures gave up their gains as European
markets kicked into action to slip lower.	
 Brent crude rose as much as 1.7 percent before swinging 0.3
percent lower to $110.42. U.S. crude, which rose more than 1
percent earlier, was off 0.4 percent at $99.39.	
 ""When commodities reverse, it rarely goes down in a straight
line,"" said Gordon Kwan, head of energy research at Mirae Asset
Securities in Hong Kong. ""Brent has fallen below the 50-day
moving average and I expect it to be testing $105 a barrel,""
Kwan said.	
 
 DOLLAR BOUNCE	
 The greenback, a funding-currency favourite thanks to the
Fed's ultra easy monetary policy, scored its biggest one-day
rise in nearly nine months versus the euro on Thursday after the
European Central Bank signalled it won't raise interest rates in
June. [ID:nLDE7440GG]	
 It is expected to hold on to its early gains before U.S. job
data later in the day.	
 ""As some players had built up long positions in the Aussie
and the euro, based on the rise in commodities, further falls in
commodities could mean more position unwinding in currency
markets,"" said Makoto Noji, currency analyst at SMBC Nikko
Securities.	
 The sharp wave of risk reduction across markets
also boosted bond prices with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields
dipping to 3.16 percent before rising by two basis points. It
has fallen more than 40 basis points in less than a month.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - After the rest of the world
appeared to turn its back on the dollar, the U.S. currency
found one unexpected friend: the commodities market.
 Panic selling in oil, copper and silver led to the dollar's
best day since October against major currencies <.DXY> on
Thursday as investors fled to familiar safe havens.
 The biggest commodities correction in more than two years
is the best, perhaps only, thing going for the dollar, which
has been on a five-month slide as investors shunned it for
higher returns in commodities and other currencies.
 There are, of course, plenty of reasons to doubt the
commodities rout will continue. The dollar's own weak
fundamentals of rock-bottom interest rates and a burgeoning
national debt are two of the most obvious.
 Still, the longer investors are willing to contemplate the
notion that the dramatic run-up in commodities was yet another
financial market bubble, the better the dollar will do.
 ""I think this has a ways to go. I do not think investors
will decide tomorrow that this is all just a scare,"" said
Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup in New
York.
 ""The strong belief priced into markets that growth and
asset markets would be resilient to higher energy prices is
being shaken.""
 VIRTUOUS CYCLE
 A longer commodities retreat could also create a virtuous
cycle for the dollar by undermining the case for further
interest rate rises in the euro zone, expectations of which
have been a huge positive for the euro currency.
 The dollar's rebound initially got under way after after
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled
that euro zone interest rates are unlikely to rise next month,
wrong-footing investors who had bet on a more hawkish tone.
 Growing worries about a temporary growth pullback, if
translated into lower commodity prices, could benefit the
dollar as it will ""take some of the pressure off those central
banks who have already begun the rate tightening phase,"" said
Anthony King, managing director of investment grade fixed
income at PineBridge Investments in London.
 PineBridge manages about $81 billion in assets.
 High energy prices have stoked inflation in Europe and
other economies and prompted the ECB to hike rates in April for
the first time since 2008. That helped boost the euro, which is
up 9 percent against the dollar this year.
 ""Some of the foreign central banks, led by the ECB, have
been more hawkish than they needed to be,"" King said.
 GOOD-TIME CURRENCY
 The wide gap in interest rates has helped yield-chasing
investors drive the dollar down nearly 8 percent this year
before today's recovery, by borrowing cheaply in the U.S.
currency to fund risk taking elsewhere.
 This came apart with a vengeance as oil collapsed into
free-fall on Thursday, diving 10 percent and sending U.S. crude
back under $100 a barrel as investors stampeded for the exits.
 Concerns that the economic environment for dollar-funded
risk taking was deteriorating were exacerbated by U.S. data
showing a jump in the number of Americans filing for jobless
aid to an eight-month high.
 Ugo Lancioni, currency strategist and portfolio manager at
Neuberger Berman in London, said the latest string of soft data
was released at a time where ""the market is very much
positioned in favor of long risk."" That makes the market
vunerable to a reversal, which would benefit the dollar.
 Lancioni helps oversee about $80 billion in
investment-grade fixed-income assets. His firm manages about
$200 billion in assets.
 WHAT IF?
 While a moderate pullback in the somewhat bubbly commodity
market is likely in the coming months, many analysts say the
long-term bull cycle on strong demand remains in place and that
a burst of the bubble similar to what happened in the housing
market seems unlikely.
 ""We would give that event a very low probability. We would
be using a retreat in commodities and commodity-based
currencies to buy at lower levels, ""PineBridge's King said.
 Vasileios Gkionakis, director of macro strategy at Fulcrum
Asset Management LLP in London, which oversees $1.4 billion in
assets, said it is quite possible to see commodity prices
falling as a result of a stronger dollar, but it is difficult
to see why the U.S. dollar would go up as a result of collapses
in commodity prices.
 ""The fundamentals remain largely in place for U.S. dollar
weakness. The Fed does not seem particularly worried by a weak
currency, emerging market central banks, alongside the ECB, are
raising rates and the trade data in the U.S. do not argue for a
stronger currency,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices plummeted more than
10 percent on Thursday, dragging down stocks and fueling demand
for safe-haven assets, after new data cast fresh doubts on the
strength of the global economic recovery.
 U.S. crude oil ended below $100 a barrel and extended
losses after settlement, as reports showed new weekly U.S.
jobless claims jumped to an eight-month high and the country's
productivity growth slowed in the first quarter. For details,
see [ID:nN05259672]
 It was the second-largest single day loss on record for
U.S. crude oil, considering the post-settlement trade. For
Brent crude, it was the largest one day fall on record.
 The euro tumbled 2 percent against the dollar, its worst
day against the greenback since August, after the European
Central Bank signaled it will refrain from raising interest
rates next month. [ID:nLDE7440GG]
 On Wall Street, the Dow and the S&P 500 fell about 1
percent as energy shares slumped with the price of oil.
 ""The longer-term bull cycle (for oil) is still in place,
but this correction may have a life span of several months, as
weaker economic data is fueling this correction to a large
part,"" said Sterling Smith, senior analyst for Country Hedging
Inc in Minnesota.
 Some investors also saw the recent disappointing economic
data as a bad omen for Friday's key U.S. jobs report.

 COMMODITIES SUFFER
 Commodities extended their sell-off into a fourth
consecutive day as investors worried about faltering economic
growth in major economies and excessive monetary tightening in
China, the world's top consumer of raw materials.
 U.S. crude oil prices  settled down 8.64 percent at
$99.80 a barrel, before hitting $98.25 a barrel in
post-settlement trade. Brent crude  ended 8.57 percent
lower at $110.80 a barrel.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities prices, dropped 4.9 percent on Thursday. It has
lost about 8 percent so far this week.
 Silver  was set for its deepest weekly decline since
the late 1980s after the CME Group, in a move to curb
speculation, raised margin requirements for the 5,000-ounce
COMEX silver futures contract <0#SI:>.
 Silver has fallen more than 20 percent this week, with
investors taking profits from a recent rally that took it to a
31-year high just shy of $50 an ounce. It closed down 10
percent on Thursday, at $35.34 an ounce, its biggest one-day
loss since October 2008.
 Copper, seen as a proxy for global economic growth, dived
more than 3 percent to its lowest level since December.

trajectory, but now some talk out of the U.S. is showing pretty

depreciation in future will provide a positive tail wind,"" he
added.

 TORONTO, May 5 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell to its
lowest level against the U.S. dollar in more than two weeks on
Thursday as the wave of selling across commodity markets
accelerated on weak economic data and a discouraging outlook.
 Dragging on Canada's resource-linked currency, U.S. crude
oil futures lost more than $9, settling below $100 a barrel for
their lowest close since mid-March, as signs of slowing global
growth and more policy tightening in China spooked investors.
 Bullion prices also fell, with silver plunging 10 percent,
marking its biggest one-day loss since 1980, while gold skidded
more than 3 percent lower. [ID:nLDE7440RL]
 The Canadian dollar  ended the North American
session at C$0.9682 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0328, down from
Wednesday's North American finish of C$0.9585 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0433. Earlier it fell as low as C$0.9713 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0295, its softest point since April 18.
 ""The Canadian dollar is holding up better than you'd expect
given the what's happening in the commodity world. It's amazing
just to see the absolute collapse today,"" said Jacqui Douglas,
senior currency strategist at TD securities.
 ""CAD's not doing great but I guess there are bigger fish to
fry right now for currency markets. The focus seems to be
what's happening with the euro.""
 The euro plunged across the board after comments from the
head of the European Central Bank suggested interest rates were
unlikely to rise next month. [ID:nN05513328]
 The uncertainty over interest rates also weighed on the
Canadian dollar and other risk-related currencies compared with
the safe-haven greenback.
 Weak economic data from Europe and the United States fed
concerns that have battered commodities all week. German
industrial orders fell unexpectedly in March while U.S. weekly
jobless claims hit eight-month highs. [ID:nLDE74414K]
[ID:nN05290682]
 ""I think that this Canadian dollar bull trend had continued
on for so much time that I'm not surprised to see a little bit
of a pullback here,"" said C.J. Gavsie, managing director of
foreign exchange sales at BMO Capital Markets.
 According to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists
released on Thursday the Canadian dollar  is set for a
gradual and modest descent over the next 12 months. But the
median forecast is for the currency to stay well above parity
with the greenback. [CAD/POLL]
 Gavsie said that after the currency broke through its
50-day moving average, the next support level is the April 18
low of C$0.9722.
 Mixed Canadian economic indicators on Thursday that showed
an unexpected spike in March building permits and a drop in
April purchasing activity were overshadowed by the global
worries and commodity retreat. [ID:nN05280781]
 Next in focus are April employment reports from the United
States and Canada.
 ""Dollar/Canada just seems to be stuck here, it doesn't seem
to want to go too much higher, which is a good thing,"" added
TD's Douglas.
 ""I think markets are probably just waiting for the
employment numbers tomorrow before making any big moves.
There's always that risk that we come out with one of those
crazy blockbuster employment numbers.""
 Analysts predict a gain of 22,500 jobs in Canada last
month. The report will show whether the economy rebounded from
March's lackluster job growth -- the weakest in six months --
and whether the dramatic rise in full-time positions was
sustained. [ID:nN29144982]
 Canadian government bond prices were firmer across the
curve on Thursday, tracking U.S. Treasuries. [US/]
 The two-year bond  was up 6 Canadian cents to
yield 1.652 percent, while the 10-year bond  rallied
29 Canadian cents to yield 3.181 percent.

 * Euro falls nearly 2.0 percent vs US dollar
 * Slide in commodities' prices helps boost dollar
 (Recasts, updates prices, adds comment)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar soared nearly
2.0 percent against the euro on Thursday as concerns about a
global economic slowdown, reflected in a slump in commodity
markets, prompted investors to flee risky assets and
high-yielding currencies and seek refuge in the greenback.
 The slide in commodities also hurt currencies from
commodity exporting countries such as Australia and Canada. The
Australian dollar fell 1.4 percent to US$1.0568  after
rising above $1.10 earlier this week, its highest level in
nearly 30 years.
 The plunge in the euro, which had its worst day against the
U.S. dollar since August last year, was triggered by comments
from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
suggesting that euro zone interest rates were unlikely to rise
next month.
 But the impact of Trichet's comments were overshadowed by
the drop in the prices of energy and metals prices after more
weak U.S. economic data.
 ""It is clear to us that the market is caught with offside
positioning and facing a barrage of growth and risk negative
data,"" said Steven Englander, head of G10 foreign exchange
strategy, at CitiFX in New York.
 ""The major question for next week is whether this is just a
position squeeze, in which case a round or two of reserve
manager buying will put risk back on, or whether investors
significantly underestimated the fragility of the G10 and
possibly emerging market countries to tightening and commodity
price increases.""
 In late New York trading, the euro fell 2.0 percent to
$1.4526 , well off Wednesday's 17-month high of
$1.49404.
 ECB RATE RISE POSTPONED
 The euro's fall came after the ECB left its benchmark
interest rate unchanged as expected at 1.25 percent, but was
triggered by Trichet's comments in which he failed to use the
key words ""strong vigilance"" in his comments on inflation,
suggesting a further ECB rate rise would not happen in June.
 In the past, the ECB regularly used the phrase to signal a
rate hike was only a month away.
 ""Going into the meeting, the market was split on the issue
of whether the next hike would be in June or July, but Trichet
quickly made it clear that the ECB will not hike at the June
meeting,"" said Frank Hansen, senior economist at Danske Bank in
Copenhagen.
 Before the ECB meeting, the markets had priced a 40 percent
probability of a June hike. The probability has now declined to
almost zero, while the implied probability of a July rate
increase was now at 75 percent, analysts said.
 Further out on the yield curve, interest rate rise
expectations were reduced more aggressively. The euro zone's
refinancing rate is now expected to hit 2.0 percent next March
-- a rate that before the meeting was expected to be reached
late this year.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 2.5 percent to 116.49 yen
, its poorest showing since June.
 Other euro-linked assets also fell. The CurrencyShares Euro
Trust  was down more than 2.0 percent at $144.69.
 Overall option volume on this fund was 2.7 times the
average daily levels with about 40,000 puts and 3,096 calls
traded near the close on Thursday, according to options
analytics firm Trade Alert.
 Still, analysts believed the euro's decline was just a
respite and the currency should make its way to $1.50 in fairly
short order as part of an unwinding of safe-haven flows into
the U.S. dollar during the financial crisis of 2008.
 Market participants still expect the ECB to raise rates
more rapidly than the Federal Reserve, which is seen holding
U.S. borrowing costs at record lows until at least mid-2012.
 Against the yen, the U.S. dollar fell below 80 yen for the
first time since March 18, the day central banks intervened to
weaken the Japanese currency after it hit a record high.

 The strengthening of the yen prompted some traders to warn
a second round of intervention could be on the cards.

factors related to the Easter holiday may have distorted the

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro plunged across the
board on Thursday, on track for its worst day against the
dollar since November, after comments from the head of the
European Central Bank suggested interest rates were unlikely to
rise next month.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, in remarks after a
policy meeting where the central bank left interest rates
unchanged at 1.25 percent, failed to use the key words ""strong
vigilance"" in his comments on inflation. In the past, the ECB
regularly used the phrase to signal a rate hike was only a
month away.
 ""Going into the meeting, the market was split on the issue
of whether the next hike would be in June or July, but Trichet
quickly made it clear that the ECB will not hike at the June
meeting,"" said Frank Hansen, senior economist at Danske Bank in
Copenhagen.
 After falling as low as $1.45408 on trading platform EBS, a
more than one-week low, the next key level for the euro would
be $1.44559. That corresponds to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the euro's recent rally from a $1.41560 low on
April 18 to the 17-month peak of $1.49404 scaled on Wednesday.
 Before the ECB meeting, the markets had priced a 40 percent
probability of a June hike. The probability has now declined to
almost zero, while the implied probability of a July rate
increase was now at 75 percent, analysts said.
 Further out on the curve, hike expectations were reduced
more aggressively. The euro zone's refi rate is now expected to
hit 2 percent next March -- a rate that before the meeting was
expected to be reached late this year.
 In early afternoon trading, the euro fell 1.9 percent to
$1.4548 , well off Wednesday's 17-month high of
$1.49404, and was headed for its worst day since November.
 Reflecting sharp moves in the spot market, the implied
volatility on one-month euro/dollar options hit a roughly
six-week high at 11.60 percent on Thursday, according to
Reuters data, from 10.90 percent  on Wednesday.
 Risk reversals on one-month euro/dollar options, a broad
measure of currency sentiment, showed a deeper ""put"" bias, or
bets the euro will decline. On Thursday, this gauge was at
-1.73 vols from -1.30 the previous session.
 Against the yen, the euro fell more than 2 percent to
116.76 yen , its poorest showing since August.
 Still, some analysts believed the euro's decline was just a
respite and the currency should make its way to $1.50 in fairly
short order as part of an unwinding of safe-haven flows into
the dollar during the financial crisis.
 ""Back in mid-2010, we had concluded this 'flight to
quality' would be unwound over the next 12 months and believe
we are now within 2 percent of that being taken out of the
dollar's value,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at
Faros Trading, LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. ""This translates
into euro/dollar trading around $1.5000,""
 Analysts still expect the ECB to raise rates more rapidly
than the Federal Reserve, which is seen holding U.S. borrowing
costs at record lows until at least mid-2012.
 Meanwhile, risk aversion, sparked by slower growth in the
United States and some developed economies, also contributed to
gains in the dollar and yen, two low-yielding currencies used
to fund the purchase of riskier assets.
 As risk sentiment worsened, investors reduced positions in
dollar-denominated commodities such as gold, silver, and oil,
which further stoked the greenback's gains.
 The slide in commodities hurt currencies from commodity
exporters such as the Canadian and Australian dollars. The
latter fell to US$1.0610  after rising above $1.10
earlier this week, its highest level in nearly 30 years.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell below 80 yen for the first
time since March 18, the day central banks intervened to weaken
the Japanese currency after it hit a record high. 
 The strengthening of the yen prompted some traders to warn
a second round of intervention could be on the cards. Japan's
finance minister said authorities were monitoring the market
but added the yen move appears different from the one following
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Commodities plunged for a

for safe-haven assets, after new data cast more doubts on the
strength of the global economic recovery.
 U.S. crude oil prices plunged nearly 6 percent and a

eight-month high after the country's productivity growth slowed

fall was cushioned, however, by bets the European Central Bank

 COMMODITIES SUFFER
 Commodities extended their sell-off into a fourth
consecutive day as investors worried about faltering economic
growth in major economies and excessive monetary tightening in
China, the world's top consumer of raw materials.
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell 5.7 percent to $102.99 a
barrel, while Brent crude  lost 5.7 percent to $114.24 a
barrel. The decline is the biggest weekly fall for Brent and
U.S. crude since the week ended July 4, 2010.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities prices, dropped 3.6 percent on Thursday. It has
lost about 6 percent so far this week.
 Silver  was set for its deepest weekly decline since
the late 1980s after the CME Group, in a move to curb
speculation, raised margin requirements for the 5,000-ounce
COMEX silver futures contract <0#SI:>.
 At just below $38 an ounce, silver has fallen around 20
percent so far this week, with investors taking profits from a
recent rally that took it to a 31-year high just shy of $50 an
ounce.

(Updates prices, adds comment, detail)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro headed for its biggest
slide against the dollar since November on Thursday after the
European Central Bank hinted interest rates were unlikely to
rise next month, short-circuiting a rally that had driven the
currency to a 17-month high.
 The signal by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on rates
added to a growing sense of risk aversion in markets, sparked
by signs of slower growth in the United States and some other
developed economies, and spurred traders to bail out of
high-yielding currencies and commodities.
 The dollar and yen were the main beneficiaries, as record
low interest rates made it profitable to borrow in those two
currencies at no cost to finance more lucrative investments.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4581 before easing to $1.4604.
It was still well off Wednesday's 17-month high of $1.4939 and
was headed for its worst day since last November.
 A sharp fall in the price of oil this week has taken the
edge off inflation concerns, muting expectations for higher
interest rates as the high energy cost weighs on consumers.
 The price of U.S. crude oil has lost some 9 percent since
hitting $114 on Monday, its highest level since 2008.
 ""The story across the board is the Western consumer is
being hit by high energy costs, irrespective of whether his
currency is weak or strong,"" said Boris Schlossberg, head of
research at GFT Forex.
 An eight-month high in initial U.S. jobless claims reported
on Thursday and weak U.S. service data suggest as much, as do
weaker retail and industrial reports in Australia and Germany,
he said.
 The euro also fell against the yen, down 2 percent to
117.05 yen, while the dollar fell below 80 yen for the first
time since March 18, the day major central banks intervened to
weaken the Japanese currency after it hit a record high.
 The strengthening of the yen prompted some traders to warn
that a second round of intervention could be on the cards.
Japan's finance minister said authorities were monitoring the
market but added the yen move appears different from the one
that triggered the March intervention.
 U.S. government bonds rose and the dollar gained 1.2
percent against six major currencies after plumbing a
three-year low on Wednesday.
 TRICHET TREADS LIGHTLY
 High energy prices have stoked inflation in Europe and
other economies and prompted the ECB to hike rates in April for
the first time since 2008. That helped boost the euro, up 9
percent against the dollar this year.
 But Trichet on Thursday suggested rates were unlikely to
rise next month as some investors had expected, though he left
the door open to a hike in July.
 Some said the moves on Thursday were overdone. Recent weak
U.S. economic data ""merely validates our structural view on
U.S. growth: supertanker-slow but persistent progress,"" said
Dan Dorrow, head of research at Faros Trading. ""Markets expect
more acceleration, but the U.S. will lag others for a long
time,"" which should dampen demand for dollars.
 Indeed, analysts still expect the ECB to raise rates more
rapidly than the Federal Reserve, which is seen holding U.S.
borrowing costs at record lows until at least mid-2012.
Persistent worries about a yawning U.S. budget deficit should
also make it hard for the dollar to stage an extended rally.
 ""The euro is in an uptrend and I see no particular reason
to be turning negative here,"" said Adrian Schmidt, currency
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 But Schlossberg said a continued slide in oil prices could
alter the outlook.
 ""Trichet's overall tone is still pretty hawkish and there's
little doubt they've abandoned their tightening policy, and
that favors the euro in the medium term,"" he said. ""But they
have paused, and if oil falls and stays below $100 a barrel,
that might relieve some of the price pressures they face.""
 The slide in commodities hurt currencies from commodity
exporters such as the Canadian and Australian dollars. The
latter fell to $1.0650 after rising above $1.10 earlier this
week, its highest level in nearly 30 years.

 * Crown little moved after decision
 * Sees slightly weaker growth, rates up from Q4

(Adds forecasts, governor comment, mkt reaction)
 By Jana Mlcochova and Robert Mueller
 PRAGUE, May 5 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank left
interest rates on hold on Thursday as expected but signalled it
would start raising rates earlier in the fourth quarter than
previously suggested, citing rising price pressure from abroad.
 The pace of further rate rises, however, would be more
gradual than previously expected, it said.
 The bank maintained its key two-week repo rate 
, used to drain excess liquidity, at 0.75 percent.
 That extended the period of record low rates to a full year
despite the European Central Bank's move last month to raise its
benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent.
 Governor Miroslav Singer said the bank's new staff forecast
saw market rates, a proxy for official rates, rising sooner in
the fourth quarter, but the action would be moderate and not
followed by any further sharp increases.
 The bank had previously said it would not raise rates until
the end of this year.
 ""The way (the forecast) reacts to changes in the development
abroad, and the expected changes of the development abroad, have
shifted the expectations somewhat forward,"" Singer said.
 ""At the same time, expectations of the development abroad
next year have been reassessed downwards, which means that it
(the increases) are not that marked."" 
 Markets are pricing in a full quarter-point Czech rate rise
in August. 
 The crown  mostly shrugged off Thursday's decision
and was trading a tad firmer at 24.169 to the euro by late
afternoon. But interest rate swaps slipped after the central
bank's comments and after the European Central Bank (ECB) did
not signal an imminent rate hike following its rate meeting on
Thursday.
 The ECB left its key rate unchanged on Thursday, as
expected, at 1.25 percent. [ID:nLDE7440GG]
 The Czech central bank has been saying that it does not
follow the ECB but historically there has been a correlation in
interest rates, although often with time differentials.
 The Czech vote on Thursday was 5-2, with the two dissenters
voting for a 25 basis point hike. The full voting record will be
released next Friday.
 In a Reuters poll, 19 out of 22 analysts had expected no
rate change in May and three saw a quarter-point hike.
 
 MIXED SIGNALS
 The central bank is having to balance mixed signals on
inflation, with downside risk to domestic inflation but external
inflation pressure from rising commodity prices.
 Czech industrial output has been robust, driven by foreign
demand, which has led to a rise in wages and employment in the
sector, but fiscal restraint at home has kept demand low.
 The bank's staff forecast slightly raised the inflation
outlook for the second quarter of 2012 to 2.2 percent, from 2.1
percent in a previous forecast, but sees it dipping to 2.1
percent in the third quarter of 2012.
 It also cut its 2011 growth forecast to 1.5 percent, from
1.6 percent, and cut the 2012 growth estimate to 2.8 percent
from 3.0, citing low investment and fiscal restraint. 
 Appreciation of the Czech crown, which has gained 1.3
percent since the last rate-setting meeting in March, is helping
curb imported inflation pressure.
 A government plan to raise value-added tax as of January is
raising inflation expectations next year, although the bank
disregards primary effects of indirect tax changes on prices.

 * A return to high $40's likely
 
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Platinum is drawing investment as
a financial asset and palladium boasts an enviable market
balance but silver could top the precious pack this year as its
latest fall offers a chance to buy, GFMS's Philip Klapwijk said.
 The managing director of the metals consultancy, which on
Thursday released its 2010 Platinum and Palladium market survey,
said that once the current price decline from last week's record
above $49 an ounce has petered out, silver has enough favour
among investors to return to these levels.
 ""If we see silver drop, perhaps down close to $30-mark then,
(it) would look a pretty decent buy, because through to the end
of the year, you've got the possibility of 40 to 50-percent
price gains,"" Klapwijk said in an interview with Reuters.
 ""I'm not sure that silver would get above $50 but would we
see it in the upper $40's again? Quite possibly. I don't see
that scale of increase probably out there for gold and for
platinum and probably not for palladium either,"" he said.
 The silver price, which is still up about 22 percent so far
this year at $38 an ounce, is set for its largest weekly decline
in nearly 30 years, led by selling after a series of sharp rises
in margin requirements to hold U.S. silver futures, as well as
hefty outflows of metal from the world's largest exchange-traded
funds.
 
 COMPLEX TRAILS
 Gold, which hit a record $1,575.79 an ounce on Monday, is up
only 6.5 percent this year, while platinum has risen by 1.7
percent to around $1,885 an ounce.
 Palladium, which virtually doubled in price last year, has
lost nearly 8 percent to trade around $728.25, its lowest in
nearly two months.
 GFMS expects platinum to show a seventh consecutive annual
surplus in 2011 as jewellery demand softens and consumption from
the auto sector continues to depend on the struggling European
market, which is predominantly diesel-powered.
 Palladium on the other hand is forecast to show a deficit,
possibly of over half a million ounces in 2011, for a fifth year
in a row, while demand is expected to show modest improvement,
largely thanks to robust use of the metal in catalytic
converters for the gasoline-intensive Chinese and U.S. markets.
 ""The motivation for investment in platinum ... has shifted
from an assessment of the commodity fundamentals and a decision
whether these support higher prices or not, to broader
considerations that take into account financial and economic
factors and which are encouraging investment demand for the
purposes of portfolio diversification as a hedge against the
dollar and financial risk,"" Klapwijk said.

 * PMI data points to slowing pace of GDP growth
 * Attention turns to BoE inflation report next Wednesday
 
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Prospects of a UK rate rise
receded on Thursday after evidence of an economic slowdown grew,
and inflation hawk Andrew Sentance failed to find enough support
for higher borrowing costs at his final Bank of England policy
meeting.
 Sentance steps down from the Monetary Policy Committee at
the end of this month, to be replaced by ex-Goldman Sachs
economist Ben Broadbent, and pressure for an imminent rate rise
is likely to dissipate further after his departure.
 Governor Mervyn King's presentation of the BoE's new set of
quarterly economic forecasts next Wednesday will set the tone
for the policy debate over coming months -- as will minutes to
this week's MPC meeting, where the forecasts were discussed.
 A few weeks ago, markets saw a better-than-evens chance the
MPC would raise rates on Thursday for the first time since 2007,
and Sentance had been joined by BoE chief economist Spencer Dale
and external MPC member Martin Weale in calling for a hike.
 But since then a slew of downbeat data has seen economists
push back their expectations of a first increase to November,
and financial markets are betting it could be delayed to
December or next January .
 ""The dynamics with the MPC could now change significantly,
as the arch hawk Andrew Sentance is now leaving,"" said IHS
Global Insight economist Howard Archer. ""We expect the BoE to
delay raising interest rates ... until November, and it is far
from inconceivable that it could hold fire until 2012.""
 Weale told Reuters two weeks ago that he had been
disappointed by the first quarter performance, and Dale -- who
said his rate rise call was based on growth getting back to
normal this year -- may find it hard to sustain a lone call for
higher rates for months at a time.

 STRUGGLING TO REBOUND
 First-quarter UK GDP growth came in at just 0.5 percent --
suggesting the economy is struggling to rebound from a shock
contraction late last year -- and inflation unexpectedly fell to
4 percent from 4.4 percent.
 On Thursday, April's survey of service-sector activity fell
more than expected, echoing manufacturing and construction
surveys earlier this week and prompting compilers Markit to say
that quarterly growth had slowed to 0.4 percent.
 This is before consumers and businesses face the full force
of government spending cuts, which are now starting in earnest
and aim to largely eliminate a 10 percent budget deficit over
the next four years.
 A top British academic think tank, the National Institute
for Economic and Social Research, warned of the risk of a
vicious spiral of weak growth inducing the government to take
ever harsher measures to rein in the deficit. 
 That said, not all economists are as certain as Archer that
a rate rise is now a relatively distant prospect. After months
of gloom, British retailers have generally reported a buoyant
April, with spending driven by unseasonably warm weather and
celebration of the royal wedding.
 Supermarket Wm Morrison  and clothing chain Next
 both reported strong first-quarter sales.
And if Next is typical of retailers, the BoE's inflation
troubles are unlikely to be over soon, as it said it expected to
raise prices by 8 percent in the second half of the year.
 Governor King has defended keeping rates on hold during
months of above-target inflation, on the basis that it has been
caused by one-off shocks from sterling weakness, global
commodity prices and higher sales tax -- rather than domestic
prices pressures.
 The BoE's quarterly inflation reports have regularly
predicted that inflation will be back at its 2 percent target
within a couple of years.

likely meet new higher capital ratio requirements by
deleveraging, selling assets and increasing capital, without
needing to access loans from the bailout.
 Under the terms of the bailout deal, the country's banking
sector can get up to 12 billion euros to help it recapitalise.
Banks are required to raise their Core Tier 1 capital ratios to
at least 9 percent at the end of this year and to 10 percent in
2012.
 ""The nine percent goal seems to be fairly easy to achieve as
various banks have ratios between 8 and 9 percent,"" de Sousa
said. 
 ""The 10 percent is a bit more difficult, but it's in a year
and a half. It is very likely that this will be achieved by
deleveraging, asset sales and some capital increases, probably
without the need to use the recapitalisation line,"" he said.
 Unlike their Irish counterparts, Portugal's banks are not at
the heart of the country's sovereign debt woes, though they have
been squeezed out of the wholesale interbank credit market and
have had to rely heavily on ECB emergency funding.
 De Souza said the financing lines for the banking sector in
the bailout package were envisaged ""to give confidence and
liquidity to the system on expectations that the wholesale
markets will not reopen next year, or in the next two or three
years.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply on
Thursday as the European Central Bank left investors without a
sure sense of the timing of future interest rate increases.
 That added to a growing sense of risk aversion in markets,
sparked by signs of slower growth in the United States and some
other developed economies, and encouraged traders to bail out
of positions in high-yielding currencies and commodities.
 The dollar and yen were the main beneficiaries, as record
low interest rates made it profitable to borrow in those two
currencies at no cost to finance more lucrative investments.
 Commodities have tumbled in recent days, with the price of
oil losing more than 6 percent since hitting a 2011 high above
$114 a barrel on Monday.
 ""The story across the board is the Western consumer is
being hit by high energy costs, irrespective of whether his
currency is weak or strong,"" said Boris Schlossberg, head of
research at GFT Forex.
 Weak U.S. service and jobs data, including an eight-month
high in initial jobless claims, suggest as much, as do signs of
weaker consumer demand in Australia and Germany, he said.
 For more, see [ID:nN05259672] and [ID:nL3E7G400W]
 The euro was last down one percent at $1.4666 , well
off Wednesday's 17-month peak above $1.49, while the dollar
fell 1 percent to 79.80 yen . That was its lowest level
since March 18, the day major central banks intervened to
weaken the Japanese currency after it hit a record high.
 The dollar had held above 80 yen over the last six weeks
and its slide prompted some traders to warn that a second round
of intervention could be on the cards.
 Japan's finance minister said authorities were monitoring
the market but added the yen move appears different from the
one that triggered the March intervention. [ID:nP9E7ET00K]
 TRICHET TREADS LIGHTLY
 High energy prices have stoked inflation in Europe and
other economies and even prompted the ECB to hike rates in
April for the first time since 2008. That helped boost the
euro, up nearly 10 percent against the dollar this year.
 But ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet suggested rates were
unlikely to rise next month as some investors had expected,
though he did say stress that inflation remained a risk.
 See [ID:nLDE7440GG]
 Analysts still expect the ECB to raise rates more rapidly
than the Federal Reserve, which is seen holding U.S. borrowing
costs at record lows until at least mid-2012.
 Against six major currencies, the dollar was at 73.520, not
far from Wednesday's 72.696 <.DXY>, its lowest since 2008.
 ""The euro is in an uptrend and I see no particular reason
to be turning negative here,"" said Adrian Schmidt, currency
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 But Schlossberg said a continued slide in oil prices could
alter the outlook.
 ""Trichet's overall tone is still pretty hawkish and there's
little doubt they've abandoned their tightening policy, and
that favors the euro in the medium term,"" he said. ""But they
have paused, and if oil falls and stays below $100 a barrel,
that might relieve some of the price pressures they face.""
 The slide in commodities hurt currencies from commodity
exporters such as the Canadian and Australian dollars, with the
latter falling to $1.0663  after rising above $1.10
earlier this week, its highest level in nearly 30 years.
 Some said the pullback in risk and the dollar rally is a
bit overdone. Recent weak U.S. economic data ""merely validates
our structural view on U.S. growth: supertanker-slow but
persistent progress,"" said Dan Dorrow, head of research at
Faros Trading. ""Markets expect more acceleration, but the U.S.
will lag others for a long time,"" a reason to be wary of the
dollar.

 By Gabriela Baczynska
 WARSAW, May 5 (Reuters) - Poland's finance minister
reaffirmed on Thursday the government's resolve to cut its
budget deficit to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
next year, in line with pledges made to the European Commission.
 Despite accelerating economic growth, seen reaching 4
percent this year, some economists remain sceptical about the
budget reduction plan, especially with a parliamentary election
due in the autumn that makes spending cuts politically tough.
 ""I am convinced we will bring the general government
deficit to 2.9 percent (of GDP) in 2012,"" Finance Minister Jacek
Rostowski told a news conference after the cabinet approved the
2012 draft budget.
 ""This (2012) will be a tough year requiring extra
discipline,"" he said.
 Rostowski also confirmed that the finance ministry was
exchanging euro-denominated European Union funds for zlotys in
the foreign exchange market, but gave no more details.
 Dealers have previously reported that the state-owned bank
BGK was selling euros on the government's behalf under a plan to
support the zloty.
 The draft budget approved on Thursday envisages a central
government deficit next year of no more than 35 billion zlotys
($13.15 billion) in 2012, down from a previous estimate of 37
billion.
 The central budget shortfall is a narrower measure than the
ESA-95 or general government deficit monitored by the EU and
does not include spending by local government or state agencies.
 
 SCIENCE AND TEACHERS
 Despite the clampdown on spending, Prime Minister Donald
Tusk added Warsaw would boost the science budget in 2012 by nine
percent and confirmed further salary increases for teachers
saying Poland needed to close the gap with more developed EU
economies in building a knowledge-based economy.
 Tusk's government, hoping to win an unprecedented second
four-year mandate in October's election, has increased
value-added tax and capped spending growth to rein in the
deficit but has ruled out more radical measures.
 Earlier, a source close to the government told Reuters the
2011 central budget gap would be 35.7 billion zlotys, down from
a previous forecast of 40.2 billion, due to higher-than-expected
central bank profits and better economic growth.
 Poland's central bank said in April it would pay 6.2 billion
zlotys from its 2010 net profit to the state budget, exceeding
the government's forecast of a 1.7 billion zloty injection.
 Rostowski said the 2012 draft did not assume any net profit
from the central bank.
 Poland was the only country in the 27-member European Union
to avoid recession during the 2008-09 global financial crisis
but a sharp slowdown crimped tax revenues, driving up the
deficit to 7.9 percent of GDP last year.
 The government wants parliament to approve the 2012 budget
well ahead of schedule this year due to the election and also
Poland's assumption of the EU's rotating six-month presidency in
the second half of 2011.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - World stocks and crude oil

 By Sergio Goncalves and Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, May 5 (Reuters) - Portugal faces profound economic
problems and will have be bold to tackle them successfully, the
European Union and IMF said on Thursday as they confirmed a
three-year, 78 billion euro bailout for Lisbon.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet,
speaking after the bank decided to keep euro zone interest rates
on hold at 1.25 percent, said the deal had the necessary
ingredients to reboot Portugal's economy.
 The financial aid package will push Portugal into recession
for the next two years, require a painful overhaul of labour
markets and force the government to sell shares in state
utilities, but Portugal's finance minister said it would also
help overturn decades-old structural problems.
 ""This programme's success will require a truly national
effort,"" the EU and IMF said in a joint statement, saying it
combined the need to stimulate long-term growth, reduce the
deficit and restabilise Portugal's banking and finance sector.
 Trichet said it was up to Portugal's caretaker government,
and whichever government takes office after a parliamentary
election on June 5, to make the bailout work.
 ""The programme contains the necessary elements to bring
about a sustainable stabilisation of the Portuguese economy,"" he
told a news conference in Helsinki. ""We are confident. Of
course, it calls for the present government ... and future
governments to do the job.""
 Germany, as the euro zone's largest economy, pays the
largest share of bailouts; Chancellor Angela Merkel said the
package must be based on realistic growth targets.
 Portugal had resisted a bailout for months, mindful of the
hardship and popular resentment after it had to call in the
International Monetary Fund in the 1970s, when the nation was
emerging from decades of authoritarian rule.
 But financial markets pushed Lisbon's cost of borrowing to
historic highs, forcing the country to follow Greece and Ireland
into EU/IMF protection.
 While three of the euro zone's 17 member states are now
effectively quarantined, there is little evidence so far that
their rescue programmes are having the desired effect.
 Greece, whose debts are expected to rise to 340 billion
euros ($505 billion), or 150 percent of gross domestic product,
this year, has indicated it wants to renegotiate the terms of
the 110 billion of loans granted to it last May. Originally for
three years, the loans are now for seven years and have an
average interest rate of 4.2 percent.
 Ireland, which agreed an 85 billion euro bailout in
November, wants a lower interest rate on its seven-year loans,
which carry an average rate of 5.8 percent.
 Without any adjustment to the programmes, there is growing
concern among financial analysts and policymakers that Greece,
and possibly Ireland, will be forced to restructure their debts.
 That would have a profound knock-on impact on Greek and
Irish bondholders, who include many major French, German and
British banks and the European Central Bank. Seventy percent of
Greece's sovereign debts are held by foreign institutions.
 The ECB's Trichet insisted that any Greek move to negotiate
more lenient terms with its debtholders ""is not on the cards"".
 The ECB is particularly concerned to avoid a euro zone debt
restructuring to avoid inflaming market worries about Spain, a
much bigger economy and a large holder of Portuguese assets.
 In recent months, Spain has worked to distance itself from
others on the euro zone periphery and an auction on Thursday
suggested Madrid remains on track, raising five-year funds at an
average yield of 4.549 percent, up only marginally from 4.389
percent at the last comparable auction in March.
 
 WORK TO BE DONE
 While Portugal talked up the terms of its bailout on
Thursday, it has yet to agree the interest rate and when the
first tranche will be paid. Portugal will need outside help to
meet a 4.9 billion euro bond redemption on June 15.
 Euro zone finance ministers meet in Brussels on May 16 to
discuss the bailout, including the interest rate. It should get
the required unanimous backing from all 17 member states, but
Finland, where the anti-bailout True Finns party did well in a
parliamentary election last month, could prove a sticking point.
 The bailout allows around 12 billion euros for shoring up
Portugal's banks, eventually bringing their Tier 1 capital
ratios to 10 percent, though Portugal's banking association said
the money probably wouldn't be necessary.
 While tough -- and the EU and IMF insisted it would require
long and diligent work by Portugal -- caretaker Prime Minister
Jose Socrates has touted the fact the terms, including on budget
targets, are softer than for Greece or Ireland.
 A euro zone official said that partly reflected the fact
Portugal's budget deficit is not the most pressing issue -- its
banks and labour market are more immediate concerns -- as well
as lessons learnt since the Greek bailout agreed a year ago.
 The harsh conditionality attached to Athens' programme has
in some respects made the situation more difficult, the euro
zone official said, adding that the EU and IMF were now trying
to take a more realistic approach.
 ""If the aim is to have credibility with the markets, then
the assistance packages have to be credible,"" said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

811,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2011 04:24PM ET</span>",China rules US carmakers are guilty of dumping," BEIJING, May 5 (Reuters) - China has found some U.S.-made
passenger cars benefited from unfair subsidies, damaging its
carmakers, although Beijing side-stepped a potential trade row
with the United States by not hitting them with duties.
 That decision could ease fractious U.S.-China relations,
already strained by tensions over the appreciation of the yuan
and criticisms from the United States that Beijing is favouring
giant state-owned enterprises by keeping borrowing costs low.
 China's Commerce Ministry launched the investigation in
November 2009 in an attempt to defend Chinese carmakers against
U.S. competitors. U.S. exports of new and used passenger cars to
China tripled to $3.4 billion in 2010 over 2009's figures.
 ""After an investigation, the Commerce Ministry's final
decision is that U.S. firms that make sedans and sports utility
vehicles of 2.5 litres and bigger engaged in dumping and were
given subsidies,"" the ministry said in a statement.
 ""China's domestic car industry...has suffered substantial
damage. There's a causal link between the dumping and subsidies
and the material damage.""
 But the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council has
agreed ""not to impose anti-dumping duties and countervailing
duties for now on the products that are being investigated"", the
ministry said, adding further details would be released later.
 China's announcement came just days before the once-a-year
Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which covers various economic
and diplomatic issues between the United States and China. Trade
disputes are likely to feature prominently.
 China is an increasingly imnportant export market for the
U.S., worth $91.9 billion in 2010, a rise of 32.1 percent on
2009 levels. Total two-way trade was worth $456.8 billion.
 The duties were expected to hit cars made by companies
including General Motors Co, Chrysler and the U.S. units of
German firms BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, which are fighting
for a slice of China's booming car market -- the world's biggest
ahead of the United States.
 The commerce ministry's investigation centred on whether
these companies had benefited from incentives and tax breaks
granted by the U.S. federal government and the state of Michigan
at the expense of China's carmakers.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro stayed steady versus the
dollar on Thursday with markets on alert for signs the European
Central Bank would raise interest rates again in June.
 The euro showed little reaction after ECB's left interest
rates on hold as expected, but the single currency stayed in
positive territory against the dollar as markets awaited ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet's news conference at 1230 GMT.
[ID:nFLA5GE7NA]
 The yen  shot higher as investors slashed exposure to
riskier assets, sparking concern about possible further
intervention if the Japanese currency continues to rise sharply.
 Analysts said the euro could rise if Trichet used the phrase
""strong vigilance"" on price pressures to signal a likely rate
hike in June to follow last month's 25 basis point increase.
 If Trichet does not signal a June hike, however, analysts
said the euro could track moves in riskier and higher-yielding
currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars, which fell
sharply due to steep drops on commodity and equity markets.
 ""If Trichet does not use the phrase 'strong vigilance' then
it could be the catalyst for euro/dollar to play catch-up,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC.
 Analysts expected the euro to stay supported, however, due
to expectations for euro zone rates to rise.
""We think Trichet will hold off from ""strong vigilance""
today and initially we'll get a bit of a dip in the euro.
However it won't be negative over the medium-term perspective,""
said Adrian Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds.
 If U.S. jobs data on Friday is weak this could add support
to the euro, reinforcing diverging U.S. and euro zone rate
outlooks.
 The dollar fell below 80 yen for the first time since Group
of Seven intervention to curb yen appreciation as commodity and
equity markets.
 ""Declines in commodity markets and risk appetite has been
the catalyst for some significant moves, especially in
Aussie/yen. People are taking the view that the global story is
not as strong, with data in the western world weakening and
tightening measures in Asia,"" CIBC's Stretch said.
 Data on Thursday showed German industrial orders
unexpectedly slid 4.0 percent during March. [ID:nLDE74414K]
 Investors were also concerned that measures by Asian central
banks to tighten monetary policy in response to rising inflation
could weigh on global growth, with the Philippines and Malaysia
both raising rates by 25 basis points on Thursday.
[ID:nL3E7FC0DA]
 The euro was steady on the day against the dollar at $1.4827
, off a 17-month high of $1.4940 hit on Wednesday. Traders
said a large option structure with a barrier at $1.4950 was
expected to restrict any gains. 
 Against the yen, however, the euro  fell more than
1 percent to its lowest in more than 2 weeks around 117.98 yen
as a steep slide in commodities such as silver and gold prompted
investors to slash long positions in riskier currencies.
 
 LOW-YIELDING YEN
 Since many investors have used the low-yielding yen to fund
higher-yielding investments the yen shot higher across the
board, with the dollar  dropping as low as 79.57 yen, its
weakest since the aftermath of Group of Seven intervention. The
G7 intervened to sell the yen after March's earthquake.
 Falls accelerated on the move below 80 yen, with more stop
loss orders triggered on the break below 79.75, traders said.
 ""Already there has been increasing noise around a possible
intervention and it will be interesting to see if this move
leads to further liquidation of the margin traders' long
positions (in dollar/yen),"" a London-based trader said.
 For the latest Reuters poll on the yen see [ID:nLDE74400G] 
 The Australian dollar slid around 0.9 percent to a two-week
low of $1.0652  and tumbled more than 1.5 percent to

retail sales data helped weigh on the higher-yielding currency.

 * Focus shifts to quarterly inflation report on May 11
 
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept rates at
a record low 0.5 percent on Thursday, in a widely expected move
after a run of subdued data cast doubt on the strength of
Britain's economic recovery.
 The decision will disappoint arch-hawk Andrew Sentance, who
steps down at the end of the month after nearly 5 years on the
BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, and there is a strong risk that
pressure for higher rates will ebb away after his departure.
 Just a few weeks ago, markets were discounting a better than
evens chance that the MPC would agree to raise rates for the
first time since 2007 at May's rate meeting.
 But a surprise fall in inflation -- and a clutch of data
suggesting the economy has struggled to bounce back from an
unexpected slump at the end of last year -- has now pushed back
market expectations for a rate rise to the end of the year.
 ""Relatively soft UK activity data, plus the drop in CPI
inflation to 4.0 percent in March, had removed any realistic
expectations of a rate hike today,"" said Philip Shaw, an
economist at Investec.
 Financial markets did not move after the BoE announcement.
Sterling had fallen to a 13-month low against the euro
beforehand, due to the divergence between BoE policy and the
rate-tightening cycle that the European Central Bank looks to
have embarked on.
 
 MAY INFLATION REPORT
 British markets' focus is now switching to the economic
forecasts in the BoE's quarterly Inflation Report, which BoE
Governor Mervyn King will present next Wednesday.
 ""We look for a downward revision to the MPC's growth
projections for this year and next, which will be more than
enough to offset any short-term news on inflation,"" said David
Tinsley, an economist at National Australia Bank.
 King has long insisted that the overshoot in British
inflation -- which is double the Bank's 2 percent target -- has
been due to a series of one-off shocks from sterling weakness,
commodity price rises and increases in sales tax.
 These will fade, while growth remains vulnerable to the
government's programme fiscal tightening, that aims to largely
eliminate a budget deficit of around 10 percent of GDP over the
next four years, more dovish BoE members argue.
 Sentance, by contrast, has highlighted the risks of a steady
erosion of public confidence in the BoE's willingness to curb
inflation, as well as the long-term threat of imported inflation
from a strong global economy.
 In April, Sentance was supported in his call for higher
rates by external MPC member Martin Weale and BoE chief
economist Spencer Dale -- but two weeks ago Weale told Reuters
about his concerns regarding weak growth.
 A voting breakdown for Thursday's meeting will not be
published until May 18, but some economists think that Weale or
Dale may ditch their rate rise call.
 And Sentance's successor, former Goldman Sachs economist Ben
Broadbent, is unlikely to take as tough a line on inflation.
 ""We doubt that Broadbent will be as hawkish, but it remains
to be seen whether the change of personnel will be sufficient to
alter the dynamics on the committee,"" said Investec's Shaw.

 * 22 of 58 have euro at or above $1.50 in forecast horizon
 * Dollar to recover later in year as 1st Fed hike nears
 
 By Ross Finley
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will remain in a
chokehold over coming months, thanks to an easy monetary policy
out of step with other central banks now fretting over inflation
or battling against it, a Reuters poll showed.
 The euro looks set to cling to most of its double-digit
percent gains racked up against the dollar this year on
expectations of more interest rate hikes in coming months from
the European Central Bank -- and none from the Federal Reserve.
 Median forecasts from the poll had the euro at $1.48 by
end-May, a little below where it was trading on Thursday, and
$1.45 in three months.
 The vast majority of contributors were markedly more
negative on the dollar's prospects over the coming months,
partly a reflection of where the spot rate has moved since the
last poll as usual, but signalling a clear shift in sentiment.
 That said, the majority of analysts polled also forecast the
dollar to recover against the euro later in the year as the
expected date of the first Fed rate hike approaches, currently
pegged for the first quarter of 2012 at the earliest.
 ""The view that interest rates will rise at a much faster
pace in the euro zone than in the U.S. should represent the main
driver for EUR/USD over the coming quarters,"" said Roberto
Mialich, foreign exchange strategist at UniCredit in Milan.
 Increased speculation whether Greece may have to restructure
its massive debt pile, timed just as a third euro zone member,
Portugal, hammers out the terms of a bailout, so far remains a
peripheral issue for the roaring single currency.
 Instead, the euro remains solidly underpinned by powerful
economic growth in France and Germany. That has got ECB
policymakers tasked with keeping inflation close to or below 2
percent worried about future price rises.
 The ECB is expected to signal later on Thursday another hike
as soon as next month after raising its benchmark rate 25 basis
points to 1.25 percent in March.
 Demand from central banks has propped up the euro, which
made an attempt to reach $1.50 on Wednesday but retreated to
close at $1.4821. Twenty-two of 58 forecasters had the euro at
$1.50 or higher somewhere in the forecast horizon, compared with
only 7 of 66 in the April survey.
 
 FEW REASONS TO BET ON THE BUCK
 While the euro may look overvalued to some, particularly
given three of its members have had to go cap in hand to seek
international assistance to get their fiscal houses in order,
investors have few reasons to bet on dollar strength.
 The Fed still has weeks to go before it finishes off the
second leg of its $2.3 trillion bond-purchase programme. Its own
books are a sea of red, triggering last month the first outlook
downgrade for the U.S. sovereign rating in over 70 years.
 Central banks in emerging markets have also shown signs of
backing off the so-called currency wars as the Fed's QE
programme nears an end.
 That suggests a green light for the global carry trade,
where a cheap dollar is used to fund purchases of
higher-yielding assets elsewhere around the globe.
 And the U.S. economic outlook, while much improved from the
Great Recession, is moderating. First quarter growth was
disappointingly weak for this stage of an economic recovery with
so much stimulus behind it, at an annualised 1.8 percent.
 The latest services purchasing managers' survey for April
showed a collapse in new orders growth, with activity moderating
significantly, coming far below consensus expectations. That
suggests no improvement in the U.S. growth outlook.
 There are signs, too, that the dollar has lost some of its
traditional safe-haven status.
 A revolutionary wave rippling across the Middle East, a
catastrophic earthquake and nuclear accident in Japan and huge
bailouts for three euro zone members, have all failed to give
the U.S. currency a meaningful lift.
 But strategists equally seem agreed that the euro, which is
trading at its highest in more than a year against the British
pound, can't cling to its gains beyond this year.
 ""We remain bearish on the euro given structural weaknesses
and believe upside from ECB rate expectations is fairly
limited,"" said Chris Walker at UBS.

 * Sterling to gain ground on euro
 * 12 month forecast range $1.34-$1.80
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Sterling is set to hold steady
against the dollar in the coming year as despite high inflation
a tepid economic recovery gives the Bank of England little room
to raise interest rates, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
 The survey of almost 60 foreign exchange strategists, taken
over the past week, predicted the pound would be trading at
$1.66 in a month and $1.64 in a year's time, little changed from
where it was earlier on Thursday.
 The median one-month forecast was revised up from $1.61 in
an April poll as strategists grew more convinced the BoE will be
forced to act -- if not until later this year -- while the U.S.
Federal Reserve holds fire until 2012.
 Sterling stumbled to a fresh 13-month low against the euro
on Wednesday and slipped back against the dollar as a recent
slew of weak British data led markets to push back calls for a
July BoE policy tightening to around the end of the year.
 ""With rate hike expectations supporting sterling in recent
weeks now disappearing, sterling remains vulnerable,"" said Chris
Walker at UBS.
 The BoE is expected to leave rates at their record low of
0.5 percent later on Thursday in the face of inflation running
at double its 2 percent target, as it struggles to support a
fledgling recovery.
 Preliminary data released late last month showed the British
economy grew 0.5 percent in the first three months of the year,
but as GDP fell by 0.5 percent at the end of 2010, the economy
has basically stagnated since September.
 Similarly, the Fed said last week the U.S. economy was
clawing back from its own deep recession at a ""moderate pace""
and showed it was in no rush to remove its support, despite some
signs of inflation pressures building.
 The central bank of the world's largest economy is not seen
moving until next year at the earliest, according to a Reuters
poll of primary dealers.
 Strategists remain divided about the outlook for cable and
forecasts for the 12-month horizon were in a wide range, between
$1.34 and $1.80.
 ""Going forward, a number of factors such as the end of QE
II, (and) reduced risk appetite on investments made in emerging
countries using low-cost U.S. dollars, could assist the dollar,""
said Jenny Mannent, an FX strategist at Handelsbanken.
 Mannent, who claimed top spot in the accuracy league for
one-month forecasts in the April poll, was the most bullish
forecaster on the dollar this month.
 
 EURO STUMBLES
 The European Central Bank was the first of the big four to
act when it hiked rates last month by 25 basis points from 1.0
percent but is not expected to move again until July.
 Against the common currency, the pound is expected to gain
ground as the BoE plays catch-up with its European counterpart.
 Median forecasts see the euro worth 89 pence in a month, 86
pence in six months and 84 pence in a year, little changed from
forecasts in April's poll. The euro was worth 90 pence earlier
on Thursday.
 Sterling was seen more volatile against the dollar over the
coming month.
 Analysts say the divergence of forecasts in Reuters currency
polls offers a leading indicator of exchange rate volatility in
the following month.

"
816,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2011 04:21PM ET</span>",BoE keeps rates steady at 0.5 percent as expected," LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept its key
interest rate at 0.5 percent on Thursday, in a widely expected
move after a run of subdued data which has cast doubt on the
strength of Britain's economic recovery.
 The decision will be a disappointment to arch-hawk Andrew
Sentance after his final meeting after nearly five years on the
BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, and there is a strong risk that
momentum towards higher rates will dissipate after his
departure.
 A limited first-quarter bounceback from economic contraction
in the last three months of 2010, weakening April purchasing
managers' surveys, and a fall in inflation from 4.4 percent to
4.0 percent may already have dampened the MPC's enthusiasm for
tighter policy.
 While a May rate rise was seen as a strong probability
several weeks ago, by last week the overwhelming majority of
economists polled by Reuters expected rates to stay on hold.
 Last month, six of the nine policymakers voted to hold
rates.
 Before the rate decision, sterling had fallen to a 13-month
low against the euro, due to an apparent divergence between BoE
policy and the rate-tightening cycle that the European Central
Bank looks to have embarked on.
 The MPC based its decision on a new set of quarterly
economic forecasts, but these will not be published until next
Wednesday. Minutes and a voting breakdown of Thursday's meeting
are due on May 18.
 Sentance's MPC term expires at the end of May, and he will
be replaced by former Goldman Sachs economist Ben Broadbent.

 By Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Britain's dominant service sector
slowed more than expected in April, suggesting the UK economy
failed to pick up speed after its sluggish start to the year and
giving the Bank of England more reason to keep rates on hold.
 The Markit/CIPS headline services PMI index eased to 54.3 in
April from 57.1 in March, staying in positive territory for a
fourth straight month, but undershooting the 55.7 forecast.
 The survey, taken with downbeat manufacturing and
construction PMIs earlier this week, suggest GDP growth is
running at a quarterly rate of just 0.4 percent, Markit's chief
economist Chris Williamson said.
 That is lower than the 0.5 percent first quarter growth rate
seen after a shock contraction late in 2010.
 ""At the start of the second quarter, the economy appears to
have lost momentum,"" said Peter Dixon, an economist at
Commerzbank. ""In terms of what it means for policy, a rate hike
before the summer would appear to be out of the question.""
 The BoE will publish its interest rate decision at 1100 GMT
and the Bank is widely expected to keep rates at the current
record low of 0.5 percent. Markets have pushed back expectations
and price in a full 25 basis point increase only in early 2012.
 Sterling hit a 13-month low versus the euro after the survey
, but analysts stressed that the services sector was still
growing, despite easing back from March's spike.
 PMI surveys this week showed manufacturing grew at its
slowest pace in 7 months in April and construction eased after
two strong months.
 Signs of slowing growth could be worrying for Britain's
coalition government, which has staked its reputation on
eliminating a budget deficit, running at 10 percent of GDP, by
the time of the next election in 2015.
 On Thursday, the coalition faces its biggest test since it
was formed a year ago when voters go to the polls for local
elections and take part in a rare referendum on electoral
reform.
 
 TWIN DANGERS
 Excluding December's snow-related drop, the services PMI
headline index for April saw its largest decline since October
2008 and was blamed mainly on UK government spending cuts.
 The services sector saw average prices charged rise in
April, with the index jumping to 53.8 from 52.2 in March, its
strongest reading since September 2008.
 The figures underline the twin dangers of sluggish growth
and high inflation facing the BoE. It has so far resisted
pressure to raise rates in order to try to curb inflation
running at double its 2 percent target, opting to wait for signs
of a more robust recovery.
 Against a backdrop of mainly gloomy news for British
retailers, there was one positive note on Thursday. Supermarket
chain Wm Morrison said it beat first-quarter sales forecasts.
 The breakdown of the Markit/CIPS PMI survey gave a mixed
picture for the service sector at a time of weak consumer
confidence, government cuts and worries about the outlook.
 New business grew at its fastest pace since March 2010 and
the rise in input prices eased to its lowest in four months.
 However, the business expectations index -- which measures
the outlook for a year's time -- eased for a second consecutive
month in April to reach its lowest since December. Firms gave
government cuts and weaker public sector demand as the reason
for their less optimistic outlook.
 ""The service sector suffered a sharp loss of growth momentum
at the start of the second quarter,"" Markit's Williamson said.
""The deterioration in the sector's performance can be largely
linked to government spending cuts.""

 * Yuan appreciation may quicken during U.S.-China talks
 * China eyes SDR reforms to include BRICS currencies
 * Yuan at 6.4937, up 5.12 pct since depegging

 By Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 5 (Reuters) - The yuan closed a tad lower
versus the dollar on Thursday as the People's Bank of China
fixed its mid-point marginally weaker for the third straight
day, giving the currency a pause after a slew of record highs.	
 Traders said the central bank may be preparing for a new leg
of yuan appreciation during the U.S.-China Strategic and
Economic Dialogue both as a goodwill gesture to the United
States and as an extension of recent gains this year.	
 While the government paints a picture of resisting U.S.
calls for yuan appreciation, it typically lets the currency
strengthen during bilateral talks to give face to the United
States and in recognition of the importance of ties between the
world's two biggest economies.	
 The PBOC has guided the yuan to a slew of record highs this
year, with a rise of 0.9 percent in April, accelerating from 0.4
percent in March, at a time when the dollar sank to
three-year lows against a basket of currencies.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it clear they will deploy
the currency as a weapon to fight inflation, which hit a
32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, partly boosted by surging
global commodity prices.	
 As there are few signs of a reversal in the weak dollar and
surging commodity prices, the PBOC may continue to let the yuan
edge higher, possibly at a faster pace to rein in inflation.	
 ""The PBOC appears to have engineered a break in yuan
appreciation to pave the way for a relatively large rise for the
currency during next week's talks,"" said a European bank dealer
in Shanghai, adding appreciation could resume as soon as Friday.	
 
 SDR AMBITION	
 Spot yuan closed at 6.4937 versus the dollar,
down slightly from Wednesday's close of 6.4933. It has now
appreciated 5.12 percent since it was depegged from the dollar
in June 2010, and 1.46 percent since the start of this year.	
 Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.5025 against the dollar, slightly weaker than Wednesday's
6.5013. The central bank uses the mid-point to express the
governments' intention for the yuan's movements.	
 China has all along stressed that it will keep the yuan's
exchange rate relatively stable. In a quarterly monetary policy
report this week, the PBOC reaffirmed the government's will.	
 Besides protecting its exports and other labour-intensive
industries, the government also appears to believe that only a
stable currency, whether or not it is fully convertible, can
assume a role in the global reserve currency system.	
 The head of China's foreign exchange authority said in
remarks published on Thursday that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) should consider including currencies of the BRICS
countries and other emerging economies when it next reviews its
Special Drawing Right (SDR) system by 2015. [ID:nL3E7G5008]	
 Calls by Chinese officials for inclusion of the yuan to the
SDR are not new. In March 2009, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan
first sketched out China's long-term ambition to supplant the
dollar with a super-sovereign currency akin to the IMF's SDR and
implied that the yuan could be one of its constituents.	
 Meeting in the southern Chinese island of Hainan last month,
leaders of the BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa -- called for a revamped global monetary system
that relies less on the dollar. [ID:nL3EFE07J]. 
 Traders, however, pointed out that those efforts will not
have an immediate impact on the yuan's daily trading.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.3410 in late trade, up from 6.3290
at the previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a
year's time fell to 2.55 percent from 2.74 percent.	"

(Updates with details)	
 By Neil Chatterjee and Aditya Suharmoko	
 JAKARTA, May 5 (Reuters) - Indonesia's economy, the biggest
in Southeast Asia, expanded a strong 6.5 percent in the first
quarter from a year ago, in line with expectations and driven by
investment and emerging middle class consumers.	
 The pace of growth in gross domestic product slowed from the
previous quarter, when it was its fastest in at least six years.	
 The moderation should give the central bank room to leave
interest rates on hold again when it meets next week after
policymakers have allowed the Indonesian currency, the rupiah,
to rise 5 percent in 2011 to a 7-year high to keep a lid on
inflation.	
 Annual inflation slowed to a six-month low in April, though
most analysts see core inflation picking up further, which may
prompt Bank Indonesia to raise the benchmark rate in coming
months from 6.75 percent currently.	
 ""There is little sign here that the economy is becoming
overheated... The central bank will be in no hurry to move again
after CPI fell for three months running,"" said George
Worthington, economist at IFR Markets, a unit of Thomson
Reuters, in Sydney.	
 
 The economy appeared to be on track to meet government and
analyst forecasts for a 6.4 percent expansion in 2011, the
third-highest in Asia after China and India. Solid growth and
other factors have helped push stocks to a record high this week
and attract investors to a global bond issue.	
 ""The vital signs for the Indonesian economy are its
strongest in the last decade and the fundamentals are
improving,"" said Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo at an Asian
Development Bank forum in Hanoi on Thursday.	
 The minister said he is confident inflation can be kept
within the government's target this year and is comfortable that
exporters can cope with the stronger rupiah .	
 Indonesia's central bank has said it maintains a tightening
stance to manage inflation, after a surprise 25 basis points
rate rise in February to calm worried markets, though it is also
focused on spurring growth. The rate rise was its only move
since slashing rates during the financial crisis, and analysts
see up to 75 bps of further tightening this year.	
 Foreign portfolio investors, who offloaded Indonesian assets
earlier this year on concerns about the central bank's ability
to control inflation, have resumed buying, with foreign bond
ownership at record levels. Indonesia's credit rating is one
notch below a coveted investment grade that would put it on a
par with BRIC nations such as China. 
 
 RISING INCOMES	
 The statistics bureau said growth, which was 6.9 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2010, was led in the first quarter by the
telecommunications and transport sectors. These grew 13.8
percent, while trade, hotel and restaurants rose 7.9 percent.	
 Indonesia's main vehicle seller Astra saw first
quarter profits jump 43 percent, reflecting car sales that were
up around 30 percent in a buoyant consumer market that has
attracted investment interest this year from Japan's Daihatsu
and China's BYD .	
 Total investment grew 27 percent in the first quarter from a
year ago. China, seeking resources from the world's largest
thermal coal and palm oil exporter, said last week it will
provide Indonesia with $9 billion in loans for infrastructure.	
 While commuters in the capital are used to waiting, stuck in
traffic during tropical downpours, queues for Unilever's
 new Magnum Cafe -- the only one in the world -- can
also last three hours as rising disposable incomes enable more
people to splash out on luxury ice-creams.	
 ""Household consumption, as the main foundation of
Indonesia's economy, is good. We have just got out from a global
recession, and this means that investment is playing a key role
again, and can give a multiplier effect to Indonesia's economy,""
said Eric Sugandi, economist at Standard Chartered in Jakarta.	
 Unemployment in February dropped to 8.1 million people or
6.8 percent of Indonesia's labour force, from 7.4 percent a year
ago, the statistics bureau said.	
 Improvements in commodity-driven infrastructure outside the
main island of Java are giving a boost to transport,
construction, and banks. Top lender Mandiri saw first
quarter profit surge 89 percent, as overall growth in the
economy's financial and real estate sectors quickened to 7.3
percent.	
 Indonesia aims to reach annual growth of over 7 percent by
2014, but poor infrastructure, from bad roads to electricity
blackouts, remains an obstacle and the government is seeking to
overhaul it with $100 billion of private investment.

"
820,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2011 04:16PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Policy challenges for Australian Prime Minister Gillard ," May 5 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard
has declared 2011 the year of policy delivery and decision after
her ruling Labor Party limped back into power with support of
one Green and three independents after last August's dead-heat
elections.	
 Treasurer Wayne Swan will deliver the government's first
budget on May 10, with tax revenues to be hit by a summer of
natural disasters and an Australian dollar which has hit record
highs against the US Dollar.	
 Gillard holds a one-seat majority in parliament, and needs
support from three independents and one Green to hold on to
power.	
 Following are the key policy challenges for Gillard in 2011.	
 
 BUDGET/ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT:	
 Gillard and Swan are determined to deliver a small budget
surplus in the fiscal year to June 30, 2013, after running up
big deficits due to stimulus spending to help Australia avoid
recession during the global financial crisis.	
 Labor, under former prime minister Kevin Rudd from late 2007
and under Gillard since June 2010, has yet to deliver a budget
surplus, leaving the government vulnerable to opposition attack
on economic management. The summer floods, cyclones and fires,
and falling demand from Japan after a massive earthquake and
tsunami have put new pressures on finances.	
 At the same time, the central bank is starting to worry
about rising inflation and economists expect interest rates
could start to rise again in the second half of the year.
[ID:nL3E7G3041]	
 
 MINE TAX:	
 Gillard has made her new mine tax a priority for 2011, and
she should succeed in getting the plan endorsed by parliament
with broad support from Greens and independents.	
 The government wants to impose a 30 percent tax on coal and
iron ore mining profits from July 2012, to raise A$7.4 billion
in its first two years and to help the budget return a small
surplus by June 30, 2013. The opposition and mid-sized mining
companies oppose the tax and want it scrapped.	
 Legislation is due to be released later in May, after the
government offered more concessions by agreeing to refund any
future state-based royalty increases. [ID:nL3E7EO04L]	
 Global miners BHP Billiton 
 The Greens, who will hold the balance of power from July
this year, support the tax but want miners to pay more. That may
make mining companies nervous if the parliamentary debate drags
on beyond July, when the Greens will have the power to pass or
reject laws in the upper house Senate.	
 
 CARBON PRICE:	
 Gillard has promised to introduce a carbon tax from July
2012, ahead of a full emissions trade scheme three to five years
later. A committee of government, Greens and independents is due
to finalise the policy by July. [ID:nL3E7G406W]	
 Agreement on the scheme is far from certain. The government,
Greens and independents continue to argue about the scope and
size of the tax, what compensation will be available to big
business and what emissions targets Australia should adopt.	
 The government target is to cut emissions by at least 5
percent of 2000 levels by 2020. The Greens want cuts of 25
percent to 40 percent over the same period.	
 
 GAMBLING:	
 In order to win support from a key independent, Gillard has
promised to crack down on problem gambling by imposing new
restrictions on gaming machines. The Greens support the plans,
but the government is still short of the numbers needed to pass
the scheme through parliament. Gillard also faces a tough fight
with state governments, which rely upon gambling taxes for
around 10 percent of state revenues.	
 Gillard needs to deliver on the promise in order to ensure
she can rely on independent Andrew Wilkie to support her
minority government.	
 
 WATER REFORM:	
 The government faces a difficult challenge to reform water
policy in the foodbowl Murray-Darling Basin. It must find a way
to balance the needs of farmers, while also ensuring the river
basin in sustainable. The basin has suffered more than a century
of over allocating water to farmers.	
 A report in October last year proposed cutting more than a
third of irrigation water from farmers. That interim report
prompted anger in farm towns and forced the resignation of the
independent Murray Darling Basin Authority boss. Gillard's
government hopes to make a new decision by the end of 2011 on
how much water it will buy back from farmers. Any decision will
either anger environmentalists and Greens, or farmers and people
in towns who rely upon irrigation water.

 * Investors focused on ECB, interest rate differentials
 * Wall Street set for losses
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Disappointing results from
European banks dragged stocks lower on Thursday while investors
waited for the European Central Bank to give hints on the timing
of future interest rate rises.
 Wall Street also looked set to open lower, adding to recent
equity losses that have accompanied evidence that investors are
becoming concerned about global economic growth.
 Eyes were also on commodity markets where copper hit a
seven-week low and silver extended losses that have reached
nearly 20 percent this week.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were down almost a third of
a percent, particularly dragged down by Europe.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 lost more than three-quarters of a
percent after falling 1.4 percent on Wednesday, hurt then by
weak U.S. economic data, concern over China's growth outlook and
forecast-lagging company earnings.
 Data on Wednesday showed weaker U.S. private hiring than
expected in April and a sharper cooling of U.S. service sector
growth.
 The big drag on Thursday was from the banking sector.
 British bank Lloyds fell 8.6 percent after it suffered a
1.1 billion hit in Ireland and said it will take a 3.2 billion
pound ($5.3 billion) provision to cover it for losses from the
mis-selling of protection insurance. 
 Societe Generale, France's second-biggest listed bank, lost
4.2 percent after first-quarter results missed expectations. 
 Of the 38 percent of companies that have reported
first-quarter results on the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index, half
have missed expectations so far, according to Thomson Reuters
StarMine data.
 
 INTEREST RATES
 For many, though, Thursday was a case of listening for the
magic words -- waiting to see if ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet will point to a rate rise in June by mentioning ""strong
vigilance"" in a news conference later in the session.
 The ECB lifted interest rates in April, not only signalling
the launch of an anti-inflation programme but creating
expectations of rate differentials between the bank and other
monetary authorities, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 No change in euro zone rates is expected on Thursday, but
overall, as Koen De Leus, strategist at KBC Securities, put it,
""there is insecurity in the markets.""
 The higher yields available in the euro zone, Australia and
elsewhere have weakened the dollar, although it recovered on
Thursday from losses earlier in the session.
 The euro traded at around $1.48. Traders said that if
Trichet repeats the ""strong vigilance"" phrase, it could push
back above $1.49. But even if he leaves it out, the currency is
not seen likely to fall much from current levels given the
existing rate differences.
 Currency specialists FxPro said in a note that the euro zone
was thriving despite intense pressures.
 ""A possible Greek debt restructure, a Portuguese bailout, a
sharp decline in Spanish house prices, a Finnish electoral
revolt against bailouts -- all have been essentially ignored by
the single currency,"" it said.
 The firm said it was all down to interest rates, German
economic strength and increasing demand from Asia FX reserve
managers for something other than the ""brittle"" dollar.
 On euro zone government bond markets, yields on short-term
two-year core debt rose to their highest in almost
two-and-a-half years.

 * Tastes shifting away from high-end, pricier artworks
 * Regional political upheaval also factor in changes
 
 By Martina Fuchs and Shaheen Pasha
 DUBAI, May 5 (Reuters) - A dusty industrial zone in flashy
Dubai has become an unlikely home for a flourishing underground
art scene that has grown even as the emirate's fortunes
declined, curbing appetites for extravagant pieces.
 Al Quoz, home to stark warehouses and a huge cement factory
in the shadow of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa,
is a far cry from the glitz and glamour that has come to be
associated with Dubai.
 ""It's raw. It's a clean plate that we can work on. This is a
growing cultural hub, a warehouse district where the ceilings
are high and rents are low,"" said Rami Farook, founder of the
Traffic gallery, where Emirati, Iranian and Saudi artists show
works ranging from graffiti art to blaring video installations.
 That's a far cry from the art scene just a couple of years
ago, when upscale galleries hosted champagne-fuelled purchases
that reflected big money and status, like the Maseratis and
Bentleys cruising along the emirate's palm-lined streets.
 Now, affordability and artistic message seem to carry more
weight, and the seemingly underground vibe is drawing in a
different crowd.
 At Etemad Gallery, a former furniture warehouse in Al Quoz,
a beige wax sculpture of a human torso riddled with bullets and
shells stands in the shadows. Nearby is a series comparing the
iris of the human eye to constellations of dying stars.
 ""There is a growing confidence in local contemporary artists
and also an increase in interest in women artists from the
region,"" said Rory Miller, director of Middle East and
Mediterranean Studies at Kings College in London.
 ""Following the economic downturn which hit Dubai hard, there
is a move, especially among the younger age group, to look to
art that is grittier, more relevant and reflective of their own
lives and recent experiences.""
 Art houses have taken note of shifting local tastes, even as
the higher end of the art market sees signs of a rebound on the
back of Dubai's economic recovery.
 ""We included a lot more younger artists who are more
affordable because we want to increase the depth of
participation,"" said Michael Jeha, managing director of auction
house Christie's Middle East, which recently held a sale
focusing on contemporary artists from Saudi Arabia and Iran.
 A number of the pieces sold for less than $10,000, Jeha
said, with others available for between $2,000 and $3,000.
 All of the works in the Traffic gallery priced between
$1,000 and $3,000 sold out. ""This made me realize that people in
Dubai had this passion for the alternative,"" said Traffic's
Farook. ""This is the niche I am trying to tap into.""
 Raj Sehgal, managing director at Credit Suisse Private
Banking in the Middle East and Indian Subcontinent, said some of
his clients were looking for investments that could deliver
future returns.
 ""A trend that is quite evident among many of our clients in
Dubai is that they have started buying street art due to its
appreciation value over time,"" Sehgal said.
 The political and social upheaval sweeping across the Arab
role also appears to be playing a role in the renewed interest
in more affordable and urban art.
 At Art Dubai, the emirate's annual contemporary art fair, a
number of politically-themed pieces were on display, including
one painting that portrayed ousted Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak's using icons from Facebook, the social networking site
that played a role in uniting street protesters against him.
 ""Possessing a piece of art because of a certain name or
status is holding little relevance,"" said Omer Alvie, creative
director at Villa No. 6, which showcases emerging artists from
Pakistan and arranges exhibitions of alternative art in Dubai.
 ""Now collectors are interested in the theme of the piece and
what the artist is saying. It's a record of history.""

 (Changes dateline, adds quote, detail, previous TOKYO)
 
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro held near a 17-month high
against the dollar on Thursday as markets waited for the
European Central Bank to reinforce higher rate expectations,
with a hint of a June hike needed to boost the currency further.
 Markets players said that if ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet signalled April's rise would be followed by another as
early as June with the phrase ""strong vigilance"" on price
pressures, the euro could rise, but some analysts thought
further upside potential from Trichet's words was limited.
 ""Today it will be difficult to surprise on the upside for
the ECB and the euro as inflation expectations have remained
stable over recent weeks and growth momentum has slowed,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 ""Officially we expect the next ECB hike in July,"" he added.
 A large option structure with a barrier at $1.4950 was
expected to restrict further euro gains. Traders said the
structure would attract euro offers from the option holder to
keep the barrier in place and gain a pay-out at expiry on
Friday.
 ""With the forward curve already largely priced for the
cumulative rate increases we expect for the remainder of the
year (75 bps) and the market positioned for a very hawkish ECB,
it would take a bringing forward of rate hike expectations to
boost EUR meaningfully from current levels,"" RBC analysts said
in a note.
 The euro traded up around 0.5 percent on the day against the
dollar at $1.4895. It rose to a 17-month high of $1.4940 on
Wednesday as the dollar came under broad selling pressure.
 Traders reported demand at $1.4830 and on approach to
$1.4800, followed by option-related bids placed ahead of
$1.4750.
 Data showing weaker U.S. private hiring than expected in
April and a sharper slowing of service sector growth reinforced
diverging U.S. and euro zone rate outlooks. The Federal Reserve
is expected to keep policy loose for many months after its
bond-buying programme ends in June.
 On Wednesday, top Federal Reserve officials repeated their
cautious view on the policy outlook, saying inflation remained
well under control.
 Market participants are also watching commodities to see if
a further slide prompts short-covering in the dollar and an
unwind of dollar-funded carry trades. Copper hit a seven-week
low and silver extended losses, tumbling nearly 20 percent this
week.
 Some of the liquidation of leveraged positions was due to
profit taking before this week's big events, including the ECB
decision and the U.S. payrolls report on Friday, traders said.
 
 DOLLAR MIRED
 The dollar index hit its sixth three-year low in the last
seven sessions, but managed to rebound from the trough. The
index last traded at 72.914, down slightly from late U.S. trade
after having dipped as low as 72.696.
 The Australian dollar fell after data showing retail sales
fell in March and were flat in the first quarter, indicating
higher interest rates were keeping consumers cautious.
 But the data did little to shake views that the Australian
central bank would resume lifting rates in coming months as core
inflation shows signs of heating up. Earlier this week, the
Reserve Bank said underlying inflation was likely to head
higher, laying the ground for further tightening.
 The Aussie was down 0.2 percent at $1.0716 after dropping to
a session low of $1.0694.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 80.24 yen, mired near its
lowest levels since March 18 -- the day of the coordinated G7
intervention to weaken the Japanese currency following its surge
to a record peak against the greenback.

 SYDNEY/HONG KONG, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
17-month high against a struggling dollar on Thursday as
investors looked for the European Central Bank to reinforce
expectations of higher rates after its policy meeting later in
the day.	
 Markets are waiting to see if the ECB chief Jean-Claude
Trichet will use the ""strong vigilance"" code words to signal a
follow-up rate rise in June to the initial move in April as
central bank steps up its fight against inflation.	
 Traders said that if Trichet repeats the phrase, the euro
would push back above $1.49. But even if he leaves it out, the
single currency was unlikely to fall much from current levels
unless there is a bigger shake-out in risky assets.	
 Market players are watching commodities to see if a bigger
slide prompts short-covering in the dollar and an unwind of
dollar-funded carry trades. Copper hit a seven-week low
and silver extended losses, tumbling nearly 20 percent
this week.	
 Some of the liquidation of leveraged positions was due to
profit taking before this week's big events, including the ECB
decision and the U.S. payrolls report on Friday, traders said.	
 Data showing weaker U.S. private hiring than expected in
April and a sharper cooling of service sector growth only
reinforced the view the Federal Reserve will keep policy loose
for many months after its bond-buying programme ends in June.	
 ""The weak data is not enough to start a panic,"" said a
senior trader at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong, noting that some
funds have been buyers of the euro and Aussie during the fall
this week.	
 ""There have been people buying on the dip because they are
comfortable with the dollar and Fed story, with the Fed on hold
for the foreseeable future,"" he said.	
 
 
 MANAGED TO REBOUND	
 The dollar index hit its sixth three-year low in the
last seven sessions, but managed to rebound from the trough. The
index last traded at 72.972, down slightly from late U.S. trade
after having dipped as low as 72.696.	
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.4860 after having
reached a high of $1.4940 the previous day on EBS. Talk of
double-no-touch 1.4750/1.4950 in options market may contain the
range, traders said.	
 The Australian dollar took a brief hit after data showing
retail sales fell in March and were flat in the first quarter,
indicating that higher interest rates were keeping consumers
cautious even as the resource sector booms.	
 But the data did little to shake views that the Australian
central bank would resume lifting rates in coming months as core
inflation shows signs of heating up. Earlier this week, the
Reserve Bank of Australia said underlying inflation was likely
to head higher, laying the gourndwork for further tightening.	
 The Aussie was flat at $1.0735 on Thomson Reuters
Matching, up from a session low of $1.0694.	
 On the charts, the Aussie was looking vulnerable after
falling below its uptrend from the March lows. Near-term support
was at intraday lows between $1.0670/85, and a break through
that zone would open the way for a run at $1.0580 -- intraday
peaks from mid-April.	
 Even with the Aussie's woes, the U.S. dollar remains the
most battered of major currencies this year.	
 On Wednesday top Federal Reserve officials repeated their
cautious view on the policy outlook, saying inflation remained
well under control. 
 The contrast with the ECB is clear.	
 ""We expect the ECB to maintain a hawkish tone, pushing
EUR/USD to 1.5050,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a client note.	
 Against the Japanese currency, the dollar was down slightly
at 80.50 yen , mired near its lowest levels since March 18
-- the day of the coordinated G7 intervention to weaken the yen
following its surge to a record peak against the greenback.	
 The dollar has fallen some 6 percent from a high near 85.50
yen set early last month following a rare coordinated G7
intervention after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear scare.	
 Traders did not expect further intervention at current
levels because the yen remains off peaks against other
currencies, such as the euro, and Japanese shares have gradually
recovered.

 * Yuan appreciation may quicken during U.S.-China talks
 * China eyes SDR reforms to include BRICS currencies
 * Yuan at 6.4956, up 5.08 pct since depegging

 By Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 5 (Reuters) - The yuan edged lower against the
dollar on Thursday as the People's Bank of China fixed its
mid-point marginally weaker for the third straight day, giving
the Chinese currency a pause after a slew of record highs.	
 Traders said the central bank may be preparing for a new leg
of yuan appreciation during the U.S.-China Strategic and
Economic Dialogue both as a goodwill gesture to the United
States and as an extension of recent gains this year.	
 While the government paints a picture of resisting U.S.
calls for yuan appreciation, it typically lets the currency
strengthen during bilateral talks to give face to the United
States and in recognition of the importance of ties between the
world's two biggest economies.	
 The PBOC has guided the yuan to a slew of record highs this
year, with a rise of 0.9 percent in April, accelerating from 0.4
percent in March, at a time when the dollar sank to
three-year lows against a basket of currencies.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it clear they will deploy
the currency as a weapon to fight inflation, which hit a
32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, partly boosted by surging
global commodity prices.	
 As there are few signs of a reversal in the weak dollar and
surging commodity prices, the PBOC may continue to let the yuan
edge higher, possibly at a faster pace to rein in inflation.	
 ""The PBOC appears to have engineered a break in yuan
appreciation to pave the way for a relatively large rise for the
currency during next week's talks,"" said a European bank dealer
in Shanghai, adding appreciation could resume as soon as Friday.	
 
 SDR AMBITION	
 Spot yuan was trading at 6.4956 versus the dollar
at midday, down from Wednesday's close of 6.4933. It has now
appreciated 5.08 percent since it was depegged from the dollar
in June 2010, and 1.44 percent since the start of this year.	
 Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.5025 against the dollar, slightly weaker than Wednesday's
6.5013. The central bank uses the mid-point to express the
governments' intention for the yuan's movements.	
 China has all along stressed that it will keep the yuan's
exchange rate relatively stable. In a quarterly monetary policy
report this week, the PBOC reaffirmed the government's will.	
 Besides protecting its exports and other labour-intensive
industries, the government also appears to believe that only a
stable currency, whether or not it is fully convertible, can
assume a role in the global reserve currency system.	
 The head of China's foreign exchange authority said in
remarks published on Thursday that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) should consider including currencies of the BRICS
countries and other emerging economies when it next reviews its
Special Drawing Right (SDR) system by 2015. [ID:nL3E7G5008]	
 Calls by Chinese officials for inclusion of the yuan to the
SDR are not new. In March 2009, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan
first sketched out China's long-term ambition to supplant the
dollar with a super-sovereign currency akin to the IMF's SDR and
implied that the yuan could be one of its constituents.	
 Meeting in the southern Chinese island of Hainan last month,
leaders of the BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa -- called for a revamped global monetary system
that relies less on the dollar. [ID:nL3EFE07J]. 
 Traders, however, pointed out that those efforts will not
have an immediate impact on the yuan's daily trading.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.3340 at midday, up from 6.3290 at
the previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's
time fell to 2.66 percent from 2.74 percent.	"

 * Ireland's corporate tax rate not negotiable
 * Kenny says any state asset sales must create jobs
(Adds details throughout, background)
 By Mark Egan
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny
said on Wednesday he would press for lower interest rates for
Dublin's EU/IMF bailout but insisted higher corporate taxes
would not be part of any such deal.
 Kenny said a deal had already been reached in principle to
lower the nearly 6 percent interest rate on the European Union
and International Monetary Fund 85 billion euros bailout, and
that the details would be hammered out once Portugal finalized
details of its pending bailout package.
 ""At the recent (euro zone) meeting in Brussels ... it was
agreed that countries within the bailout package could have a
reduction of interest rates applied to them,"" Kenny told
Reuters Insider television.
 Kenny said that once details were finalized for a bailout
for Portugal, which said late on Tuesday it had reached a
three-year bailout deal with the EU and IMF, Dublin could
negotiate ""an interest rate reduction which would be
significant in Ireland's case.""
 But he refused to consider higher corporate tax rates in
Ireland and said his visit to New York was partly to reassure
American firms that might consider putting jobs in Ireland that
the country's 12.5 percent tax rate was set in stone.
 ""The corporate tax rate is not negotiable,"" he said. ""We
are not moving from our 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. Our
country is open for business.""
 'BREACH OF TRUST'
 Kenny said any such tax hike ""would be a massive breach of
trust, particularly with American foreign direct investment in
this country.""
 After a euro zone summit in March, Kenny said he had
reached a deal in principle to cut Ireland's interest rate by 1
percent, but that he was not prepared to raise corporate taxes
in return for the deal.
 Portugal's caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates announced
late on Tuesday that Lisbon had reached a bailout deal with the
EU and IMF after weeks of talks, becoming the third euro zone
country to do so, after Greece and Ireland.
 The interest rate on Portugal's bailout, which Socrates'
office says will total 78 billion euros, is expected to be set
at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in mid-May.
 Ireland's rescue package agreed to last November has failed
to resolve Ireland's banking crisis and Kenny's government,
elected in February, has said the current package must be
changed to avoid the risk of default.
 The Fine Gael leader said his coalition government is
committed to selling $2 billion euro worth of state-owned
assets and that any sale will be decided on the basis of which
deals could add most jobs to the beleaguered Irish economy.
 On Ireland's troubled banks, Kenny said if Anglo Irish Bank
needs more help that bondholders should expect to contribute.
 ""If a requirement comes in for further capital injection
into Anglo Irish Bank, the government will treat that
accordingly and we would look at the question of senior bond
holders in a very different light than we did when we didn't
decide to burn senior bond holders with either Allied Irish
Bank or Bank of Ireland,"" he said.
 A solution to Irish banks' funding crisis and a cut in the
cost of the deeply unpopular EU-IMF bailout would be a huge
coup for Kenny. But to get such a deal he will come under
intense pressure to concede on Ireland's low company tax rate,
viewed as an unfair advantage in other European capitals.
 Kenny's government has said it wants to cut the taxpayers'
bill for bailing out the banks -- 46 billion euros and climbing
-- by imposing losses on unsecured senior bonds in Irish banks
not covered by a state guarantee, valued at 16 billion euros.

including currencies of the BRICS countries and other emerging
economies when it next reviews its Special Drawing Right (SDR)
system by 2015, the head of China's foreign exchange
authority said in remarks published on Thursday.	
 Yi Gang, who is also a deputy governor of the People's Bank
of China (PBOC), called on the International Monetary Fund to
kick off a research of a ""shadow SDR"" this year, the
semi-official China Business News reported. 
 The IMF should then be able to accumulate enough
data to consider whether currencies of major emerging economies,
such as those of the BRICS countries, could be added to the SDR
basket by 2015, the newspaper quoted Yi as saying in a
lecture at Peking University this week.	
 ""We propose to the IMF to adjust its SDR currency basket by
2015 at the latest when it reviews the basket next time,"" Yi,
head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, was quoted
as saying. 
 The SDR, the IMF's internal accounting unit and reserve
asset, comprises the U.S. dollar, British pound, euro and
Japanese yen. Chinese officials have asserted that widening the
basket to include currencies such as China's yuan ,
would heighten its profile as a potential reserve currency.	
 Calls by Chinese officials for inclusion of the yuan in
particular to the SDR are not new. In March 2009, PBOC governor
Zhou Xiaochuan first sketched out China's long-term ambition to
supplant the dollar with a super-sovereign currency akin to the
IMF's SDR and implied that the yuan could be one of its
constituents.	
 Some commentators have called Zhou's vision naive, partly
because the yuan is not freely convertible nor is its value
determined solely by markets since Beijing manages it closely.	
 But with emerging markets projected to post stronger growth
while developed countries struggle with mounting debts, the
political clout of the BRICS countries has increased. 
 Meeting in the southern Chinese island of Hainan last month,
leaders of the BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa -- called for a revamped global monetary system

 Yi, whose comments appear to elaborate on Zhou's initial
proposal, said that China is patient.	
 ""China is in no hurry as the SDR has so far been only a
symbolic currency basket,"" Yi was quoted as saying.	
 ""Still, the SDR is a symbolic arrangement of international
currency system, and only widely used currencies of the world's
most powerful trade nations should be included,"" he said.	
 Yi named currencies of Saudi Arabia, South Korea and
Australia among other nations that have the potential to be
included in the SDR, the China Business News reported.

 * Euro holds near 17-month high ahead of ECB
 * Markets in consolidation phase after recent gains
 * U.S. yields dip after soft economic data

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 5 (Reuters) - Spot silver prices slid for the
fifth straight day on Thursday to the lowest in a month, while
the euro secured gains against the dollar on Thursday before the
European Central Bank meeting where it is expected to reinforce
its hawkish outlook.	
The precious metal's 20 percent slide from
a record high near $50 an ounce hit last Thursday rippled into
other markets such as crude oil and the Australian dollar
, encouraging investors to take profits after a recent
rally.	
 But some scattered short-covering by traders before the ECB
meeting pulled some markets off lows with the Aussie advancing
versus the yen and silver from the day's lows. 
 The pull-back in commodities this week pushed Asian shares
outside Japan down for the third consecutive
day, moving further away from a three-year high tested last
week, even as commodities trading giant Glencore readied for a
blockbuster IPO in London and Hong Kong.	
 Japanese markets are shut for a holiday.	
 Notwithstanding this week's softness in global equities,
partially fuelled by some soft U.S. economic data, markets have
been broadly steady after posting big gains last quarter.	
 ""This is more of a consolidation phase and we are likely to
see low double-digit returns this year after a recent nice run
up,"" said Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal
Global Investors in Hong Kong. The firm manages more than $200
billion in assets worldwide.	
 Reflecting that caution in credit markets, spreads on the
benchmark iTraxx investment grade index for Asia ex-Japan
widened slightly to 106/108 basis points after
narrowing sharply in recent weeks.	
 
 
 COMMODITIES RETREAT	
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a global benchmark
for commodities, fell nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, hit by the
sell-off in silver and declines in coffee, sugar and cocoa.
[ID:nWEN2635]	
 Until this week's retreat, commodities have been the best
performing asset class in the first four months of this year, up
more than 13 percent.	
 Copper extended losses briefly on Thursday, with London
futures dropping to seven-week lows as concerns grew
that Asian economies would probably sacrifice some growth in
exchange for keeping inflation under check, reducing demand.	
 India lifted interest rates by an aggressive half point this
week while a Reuters poll of economists marked down 2011 growth
forecasts for India and Australia. [ID:nL3E7G30BY]

 HAWKISH ECB 
 In the currency markets, the euro hovered near a 17-month
high against a struggling dollar on Thursday ahead of the ECB
meeting, while the dollar index hit its sixth three-year
low in the last seven sessions, but managed to rebound from the
trough. 
 The numbers raised worries that Friday's crucial non-farm
payrolls report will disappoint and prompted the euro to
consolidate its gains near a 17-month high against the dollar as
markets braced for more hawkish comments from the ECB.	
 The ECB is expected to signal its readiness to raise
interest rates when it meets on Thursday and may use its 'strong
vigilance' code words to signal a rise as soon as June.
[ID:nLDE7420ZV]	
 It raised euro zone rates by a quarter of a percentage point
to 1.25 percent last month, ending almost two years of
record-low interest rates and beginning what economists expect
to be a run of increases. 
 ""Positioning is light going into the ECB and talk of
double-no-touch 1.4750/1.4950 in options market may contain the
range. But I expect the ECB to keep the 'strong vigilance'
wording,"" a trader at a U.S. investment bank said. 
 In contrast, top Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday
U.S. inflation remained well under control, reaffirming the view
that the Fed will keep policy ultra loose. 
 That sent U.S. Treasury yields to their lowest levels since
mid-March, with the 10-year yield falling to 3.23
percent, down nearly 40 basis points down in less then a month.

 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The British government looks set
to miss its goal to balance the budget by 2015 because the
economy will post only sluggish growth as consumers tighten
their belts, a leading economic think tank said.
 The National Institute for Economic and Social Research
(NIESR) repeated its view that finance minister George Osborne's
austerity measures were too geared towards spending cuts and
limited the room for necessary rises in interest rates.
 ""We have a very unbalanced policy mix,"" Ray Barrell, NIESR's
Director of Macroeconomic Research and Forecasting, told
journalists. ""Fiscal policy is already far too tight, monetary
policy is far too loose as a consequence.""
 The Bank of England's loose policy bore the risk of fuelling
future bubbles, he said when presenting NIESR's quarterly
economic review. But given the bleak economic outlook, the Bank
was right to keep rates at the record low of 0.5 percent for
now.
 The BoE is expected to keep rates steady at its meeting on
Thursday despite inflation running at twice its 2 percent target
after the economy made sluggish start in the year, barely
recovering from a shock decline at the end of 2010.
 Recent data have continued to paint a bleak picture as
soaring prices, higher taxes and government spending cuts weigh
on consumer morale and spending.
 NIESR cut its growth forecast to 1.4 percent of GDP for 2011
from 1.5 percent predicted in January and sees growth of 2
percent in 2012. The government's Office for Budget
Responsibility (OBR) fiscal watchdog forecasts growth of 1.7
percent this year and 2.5 percent next.
 As a consequence of weak growth, tax revenue will fall short
of forecasts, too, NIESR said. ""We do not expect the government
to meet its target to balance the cyclically-adjusted current
budget by 2015-16,"" the think tank said.
 The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government is
attempting to eliminate most of a deficit of 10 percent of
national output before an election in 2015.
 NIESR said the current budget will still run a deficit of
2.2 percent of GDP compared with the OBR's deficit forecast of
0.2 percent in 2015-16.
 
 HOUSING GLOOM
 As the austerity measures were showing full effect, exports
were set to be the only driver of the economy, NIESR said.
 ""Growth this year will be constrained not just by the
government's spending cuts but by the squeeze on households from
higher taxes and rising inflation,"" the think tank said.
 Real disposable income was set to fall 1.3 percent this year
as inflation would reach 4.5 percent on average before falling
back to 1.9 percent in 2012 when the effect of soaring oil
prices and higher value added taxes should fade, it said.
 Overall, the crisis had left its mark on growth prospects
for the economy, NIESR said, estimating that the trend growth
rate had likely fallen to around 2.1 percent from 2.6 percent in
the ten years prior to 2008.
 NIESR director Barrell said the housing market was a major
drag for the economy as real house prices were set to fall by
some 10 percent over the next 5 years due to higher interest
rates.
 The drop may even be sharper if rules for banks were
tightened as planned, he said. 
 Tougher regulation was necessary to limit the risk of future
financial crises, he said. But higher capital requirements for
bank and loan-to-income ceilings would put pressure on house
prices, potentially leading to an additional 10 percent drop in.

 * Weale and Dale less likely to maintain vote for rate rise
 
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to
keep interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent later on
Thursday, after a string of disappointing data releases over the
past month have pointed to an anaemic economic recovery.
 Inflation is double the BoE's target at 4 percent, and a new
set of internal quarterly forecasts available to the nine-member
Monetary Policy Committee is likely to show it peaking even
higher in the coming months at just under 5 percent.
 But the majority of the MPC have long insisted that
Britain's above-target inflation is due to a series of one-off
shocks, and tepid first-quarter growth and several sub-par April
industry surveys are likely to strengthen their conviction that
domestic inflation pressures are minimal.
 ""Growth and inflation developments appear to have killed off
any prospect of an interest rate hike,"" said IHS Global Insight
economist Howard Archer, who has pushed back his own forecast
for a BoE rate rise to November.
 ""The MPC's concern over the underlying strength of the UK
economy and its ability to withstand the fiscal squeeze that is
increasingly kicking in from the start of April has likely been
heightened by the muted rebound in GDP growth,"" he added.
 Even before last week's GDP data -- which showed that
British output stagnated over the past six months -- a Reuters
poll of economists showed the overwhelming majority expected
rates to stay on hold.
 Since then, financial markets have pushed back bets on a
rate rise to the end of this year. April purchasing managers'
surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors suggest
that growth has slowed at the start of the second quarter, and
the equivalent service sector survey is due at 0828 GMT.
 
 END OF SENTANCE
 A decision to keep rates at 0.5 percent -- where they have
been since the depths of recession in March 2009 -- will be a
deep disappointment to Andrew Sentance, who steps down at the
end of the month after almost 5 years on the MPC.
 Over the past year, he has argued that the British public
and financial markets are losing faith in the MPC's commitment
to a 2 percent inflation target, and that supposedly one-off
inflation pressures are likely to prove persistent.
 A few weeks ago, a May rate rise looked a strong
possibility. But now even Sentance's allies, external MPC member
Martin Weale and BoE chief economist Spencer Dale seem to be
having second thoughts.
 Weale told Reuters two weeks ago that growth had proved
weaker than he had hoped when he first voted to raise rates in
January. 
 And Dale said in a speech a month ago that his call for
higher rates was partly based on the assumption growth would be
back to normal this year.
 This assumption is likely to come under strain in the May
Inflation Report, which it is Dale's job to supervise.
 The BoE's growth forecasts are already seen as too high by
most economists, and exceed those from Britain's fiscal
watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which sees
growth of 1.7 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2012. 
 BoE Governor Mervyn King has long been doubtful about the
need for higher interest rates to control inflation, and in
Brussels on Monday he warned of the dangers faced by heavily
indebted countries if long-term interest rates rose.
 The increasing contrast between the BoE's stance and that of
the European Central Bank -- which raised rates last month and
looks set to do so again -- has pushed the premium which British
government bonds pay over German ones to a two-year low.
 Sterling is also at a 13-month low against the euro and a
six-month low against a trade-weighted basket of currencies,
increasing the cost of imports.

 * Brazil real slips more than 1 pct to 1.603
 * Real reaches weakest intraday level since April 6
 * Mexico peso slips 0.75 pct; Chile Peso slips 1 pct.
 By Jeb Blount
 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 4 (Reuters) - Latin America's main
currencies weakened on Wednesday, and Brazil's real traded at
its lowest level in nearly a month as investors bet that
capital flows to the region will slow in coming months.
 The Brazilian real  weakened 1 percent to a bid price
of 1.603 reais to the dollar, its lowest intraday price since
April 6. Earlier, it slipped as much as 1.12 percent to 1.605.
 Mexico's peso  shed 0.75 percent to 11.646. Chile's
peso fell 1 percent to 465.70 to the dollar. Colombia's
peso  was little changed and Peru's new sol  gained
0.28 percent to 2.818 to the dollar.
 ""Investors are starting to see that the large amount of
liquidity in the U.S. is not going to last forever and that the
flows are likely to slow,"" said Raphael Martello, economist
with Tendencias Consultoria, a Sao Paulo economic research
company.
 Latin American currencies have soared in the last three
years after the United States slashed interest rates to near
zero to help the country recover from a banking crisis and
recession.
 Investors have borrowed billions in U.S. dollars and
invested them at higher rates in Brazil, Mexico and other Latin
American and emerging market economies.
 The flow of money to those economies has increased demand
for their currencies, driving up the value of their money
relative to the dollar.
 Much of the program of credit easing in the United States
is scheduled to end in June. Martello said that, and the
expectation the U.S. economy will eventually recover from the
2008-2009 downturn, means U.S. rates will rise over time,
making Latin American investments relatively less attractive.
 In Brazil, government measures to limit the real's gains --
including a 6 percent tax on foreign loans of two years or less
imposed April 6 -- have raised the cost of betting on Latin
America's largest economy, said Andre Perfeito, chief economist
with Gradual Investimentos in Sao Paulo.
 ""The loan tax and other measures taken by the government
are having their impact. It's wiped out much of the advantage
of borrowing abroad to invest in Brazil,"" he said. ""This has
prompted many of those with bets the real will gain to undo
them.""
 Mexico's peso decline was aided by concern the U.S.
economy, which buys 80 percent of Mexico's exports, is slowing.
Reports on Wednesday said the U.S. service sector and hiring
levels by private U.S. companies are slowing.
 Concern was heightened on expectations the slowdown may be
confirmed in the April jobs report due on Friday.
[ID:nN04209762]
 ""There is a bit of risk aversion and worries about the
(nonfarm payroll) number. It could point to slower growth,""
said Gabriel Casillas, an economist at JPMorgan in Mexico
City.
 Chile's peso weakened along with copper, which fell to a
two-month low of $9,124 a tonne on the London Metals Exchange.
 The metal, used in electric and electronic goods, is
Chile's main export and responsible for about a third of the
country's gross domestic product.
 The decline in the currencies was not tracked by similar
large increases in the yield spreads between emerging market
bonds and U.S. Treasuries, a measure of investor appetite for
Latin American risk.
 The JPMorgan EMBI+ index <11EMJ> was little changed from
Tuesday, rising 1 basis point to 276 basis points and was 2.76
percentage points more than a comparable U.S. Treasury,
suggesting short-term declines in speculative investment flows
may not result in a reduction in long-term investment.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped to a
three-year low against major currencies on Wednesday and its
outlook darkened further as surprisingly soft economic data
underpinned expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain
low this year.
 The greenback also fell to a record low against the Swiss
franc and against the yen fell below 80.50, the lowest level
since major central banks intervened to weaken the Japanese
currency on March 18.
 Separate reports on Wednesday showed a sharp slowdown in
the vast U.S. services sector and less hiring by private
companies in April.
 ""U.S. data have not been strong enough for the Fed to
resume raising interest rates,"" said Geoffrey Yu, senior
currency strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. For
details, see [ID:nN04209762]
 ""The Fed has raised the bar for a policy tightening and
it's going to remain the case for some time ahead. It's just a
question of, When will the Fed really signal a change in
direction? Right now, that doesn't seem to be the case.""
 In late afternoon trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index,
which measures the greenback against a basket of major
currencies, dropped to 72.696, its weakest level since July
2008. The index has fallen in 11 of the last 12 sessions and is
down 7.7 percent this year <.DXY>.
 The euro, on the other hand, remained fairly well supported
on expectations of higher euro zone interest rates and strong
sovereign demand.
 The European Central Bank is scheduled to hold a monetary
policy meeting on Thursday. It raised rates in April for the
first time since 2008, but may hold them steady at Thursday's
meeting.
 Markets, however, have already fully priced in expectations
of an ECB rate hike in July, on the need to rein in inflation,
and have started to factor in some probability of an increase
in June.
 Investors shrugged off news that Portugal had become the
third euro zone country in the last year to need a bailout.
 The single currency rose as high as $1.49404  on
trading platform EBS, the highest level since December 2009. It
was last at $1.48317, flat on the day. Traders said the euro
remained hampered by options barriers at $1.4950 and $1.5000.
 They said a move above $1.50 is likely but would probably
have to wait until after the ECB meeting.
 Implied volatility in one-month euro/dollar options gained,
rising to 11.20 percent on Wednesday from 10.90 percent
 on Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty as to the timing
of the next ECB rate increase.
 Options traders were also nervous that the ECB's president,
Jean-Claude Trichet, may disappoint investors and make
less-hawkish comments than in his previous statements.
 In addition, risk reversals, a broad measure of sentiment
in the options market, on one-month euro/dollar options are
still betting on a decline in the euro against the dollar. The
gauge is showing a solid bias for puts despite an 11 percent
surge in the single currency this year.
 On Wednesday, euro/dollar risk reversals were at -1.50 vols
, with a skew for puts, from -1.45 on Tuesday.
 Thomas Stopler, chief currency strategist at Goldman Sachs
in London, said continued concerns about euro zone debt are
only partly the cause.
""It is also important to recognize that many other dollar
crosses still display a similar skew,"" he said. ""This in turn
suggests FX option markets continue to be influenced by cross
asset hedging flows.""
 In other currencies, the dollar fell to a record trough
against the Swiss franc at 0.8554 franc  and last
changed hands at 0.8615 franc, down 0.2 percent.
 Against the yen , the dollar sank to 80.44, a
six-week low and last traded at 80.56 yen, down 0.5 percent.
 If it falls further, analysts said it could put markets on
alert for official intervention to slow the pace of yen gains.
 A strong yen could hurt Japan's export-led economy as it
struggles with slow growth and the aftermath of the March
earthquake and tsunami.
 The slide in commodities supported the greenback against
commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and Canadian
dollars.
 The Australian dollar fell further from a nearly
three-decade high of US$1.1012; it was last at US$1.0743, down
0.9 percent .
 The Canadian dollar also fell, pushing the greenback 0.5
percent higher at C$0.9573 .

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Crude oil and metals prices
fell sharply on Wednesday, driving world stocks lower, as
disappointing U.S. economic data and concerns about the
slowdown of the Chinese economy prompted investors to scale
back risky positions.
 The U.S. dollar hit a three-year low against major
currencies and Wall Street stocks fell as much as 1.0 percent
after a batch of disappointing U.S. economic data for April --
including a surprise slowdown in the services sector and less
hiring by the private sector. For details, see
[ID:nN04209762].
 The euro hit a 17-month high against the dollar with
investors interpreting the economic data as the latest sign
that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current monetary
stimulus while euro zone rates go higher.
 Signs of weakness in the U.S. economic recovery mounted as
reports on Wednesday showed a sharp slowdown in the vast
services sector and less hiring by private companies in April.
 Worries about rising fuel and commodity prices showed up in
the latest gauge of the vast U.S. services sector, which grew
at its slowest pace since August 2010, according to the
Institute for Supply Management.
 On the labor front, the ADP Employer Services report showed
U.S. private payrolls rose by 179,000 jobs last month, less
than economists' expectations for a gain of 198,000. For
details, see [ID:nN04209762]
 ""This appears to be a bump in the road for the recovery if
indeed the pace of job recovery has slowed,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, a strategist at BNY Mellon. ""It certainly feeds into
the notion that the Fed won't be hiking interest rates soon.""
 Economists expressed disappointment ahead of a key U.S.
labor market report on Friday that is also expected to show
payroll growth eased last month.
 ""Friday's jobs report will be important,"" said Michael
Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport,
Connecticut. ""If we get (200,000 job gains) or above, it will
reinforce the idea the economy continues to expand.""
 A Reuters poll forecast nonfarm job gains of 186,000 for
the month of April and private payroll gains of 200,000.
 CHINESE FEARS
 Concerns about the global economic recovery were on the
rise as investors anticipated further tightening measures in
China, the world's top consumer of commodities.
 In Hanoi, China's Vice Finance Minister Li Yong said the
government will continue to use measures such as higher
interest rates and bank deposit requirements to curb inflation.
[ID:nL3E7G421O]
 U.S. crude oil  closed down 1.63 percent at $109.24 a
barrel, weighed down by concerns over China and a
larger-than-forecast increase in U.S. crude stockpiles.
[EIA/S]
 However, crude is still near a 31-month peak, keeping alive
inflation worries.
 Copper prices dropped to a seven-week low, with three-month
contracts on the London Metal Exchange hitting a session low of
$9,135 per tonne, the lowest since March 15, compared with
$9,350 at the close on Tuesday.
 ""General risk appetite is under pressure at the moment.
There are some fears over China -- will they tighten too much?""
said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, an analyst with Danske bank.
 Silver fell more than 4.0 percent in a third straight
session of sharp losses, also dragging down gold, after the
Wall Street Journal reported that billionaire investor George
Soros has been selling silver and gold in the past month or
so.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
against a basket of key currencies, fell to a three-year low
after the U.S. data. It later recovered slightly to trade 0.25
percent lower.
 The euro  rose as high as $1.4939, a 17-month high,
according to Reuters data. It last traded 0.26 percent higher
at $1.4864
 On Wall Street, disappointment with the economic data
outweighed encouraging news of mergers and acquisitions. It
also left investors more cautious ahead of Friday's key nonfarm
payrolls data.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 83.93 points,
or 0.66 percent, to 12,723.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 13.39 points, or 0.47
percent, at 2,828.23.
 Energy and commodity stocks weighed on the market. The S&P
energy sector index <.GSPE>, which was up 34 percent since
September, lost 1.5 percent, while the materials index <.GSPM>
dropped 1.7 percent.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> lost 1.0

than 8.0 percent this year as investors grew confident that
strong corporate earnings, robust growth in emerging markets
and ample liquidity would keep global growth at a reasonable
level.
 Other safe-haven assets were on the rise, though. The

 * Mexico now ranks 33rd among official holders of gold
(Adds finance ministry response, link to factbox)
 By Dave Graham
 MEXICO CITY, May 4 (Reuters) - Mexico massively ramped up
its gold reserves in the first quarter of this year, buying
over $4 billion of bullion as emerging economies move away from
the ailing U.S. dollar, which has dipped to 2-1/2-year lows.
 The third-biggest one-off purchase of gold by any country
over the past decade took Mexico's reserves to 100.15 tonnes --
or 3.22 million ounces -- by the end of March from just 6.84
tonnes at the end of January, according to the International
Monetary Fund and Mexico's central bank.
 Gold has gained 11 percent this year, driven by concern
over euro zone debt and the violence in the Arab world, as well
as by the U.S. dollar's 7.6 percent decline against a basket of
currencies <.DXY>.
 Sergio Martin, chief economist for HSBC in Mexico, said the
government probably saw gold as a highly liquid asset that
would reduce exposure to the falling greenback.
 ""They're probably thinking that getting out of dollars and
into gold makes sense because we know that the dollar has some
trend to depreciate in the near future at least,"" said Martin.
""I don't think they're going to lose money with this.""
 According to the International Monetary Fund, Latin
America's No. 2 economy now owns $4.93 billion worth of gold
, which hit a record $1,575.79 an ounce on Monday.
 The central bank did not respond to a request for comment,
though Finance Minister Ernesto Cordero told reporters he
respected the Bank of Mexico's decision.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The gold purchased was worth roughly 4 percent of Mexico's
international foreign exchange reserves of about $126 billion.
 Other emerging economies such as China, Russia and India
have also beefed up bullion reserves over the past few years.
 SILVER LINING?
 Credit Suisse precious metals analyst Tom Kendall said it
was worthy of note that Mexico, whose economy is very closely
tied to the United States, had taken this step.
 ""The size (of the purchase) is certainly pretty chunky to
have been accomplished in that space of time. So it certainly
gives another sizable layer of support to gold's position in
the international reserves system,"" he added.
 George Milling-Stanley, managing director of government
affairs at the World Gold Council industry group, said Mexico
was following a recent trend among central banks to restore a
""prior balance between gold and currency reserves.
 ""This is further supported by the fact that the May IMF
numbers show continued buying by Russia and Thailand of 18.8
tonnes and 9.3 tonnes respectively,"" he added.
 Mexico's reserves rank it 33rd among the top official
holders of gold. The United States is the largest official
holder of gold, with 8,133 tonnes, which account for 73.8
percent of its total international reserves.
 China is the sixth-largest holder of gold, with 1,054.1
tonnes, or just 1.6 percent of total reserves, while
eighth-ranked Russia has some 811 tonnes of gold, up from
788.78 in January, according to the IMF data.
 Silver, which hit a record price earlier this year, may
also have been on Mexico's buying list, said HSBC's Martin.
 ""I think Mexico has moved from second to first place in the
list of global silver producers, so they may have been buying
silver to help the price,"" he added.

 * Dollar dance with safety/risk/TBond, but also exports
 * Foreign central banks with 30 pct of Treasuries remain key
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Years of angst about a
self-feeding downward spiral of the U.S. dollar and Treasury
bond prices were swept aside when the credit crisis blew up four
years ago, but there may well be unfinished business.
 The dollar and Treasury bond prices actually surged when the
last decade's boom went bust, banks foundered and both the
safety and cash-like liquidity of U.S. debt became premium for
those fearful of systemic collapse.
 Yet with little fanfare this year -- even as a euro debt
crisis intensified, Middle East unrest raged, oil surged and
Japan's earthquake hit -- investors declined to afford the
dollar safe haven status and let it fall to its lowest since the
gold-based Bretton Woods system broke down in 1973.
 Measured by the inflation-adjusted cut of the Fed's broad
trade-weighted index, the greenback is now down more than 15
percent since the height of the recent global recession. And it's
three percent below a floor set three times over the past 38
years of floating exchange rates -- in 1978, 1995 and 2008.
 So for all the seeming chaos elsewhere, the greenback's
descent into uncharted territory certainly raises the question
of whether pre-crisis dollar fears may yet prove well-founded.

 PRE-CRISIS TENSION
 Before the credit crunch hit in 2007, the gloomier macro
economists and international think tanks had for years warned
that the biggest risk to the world economy was a disorderly
market workout of yawning U.S. external deficits.
 Tiring of ever-greater accumulation of dollars and
Treasuries to balance America's books and stabilise its exchange
rate, they argued, overseas investors and governments would
eventually balk at U.S. securities and diversify holdings.
 The net result would be a sharply weaker dollar and soaring
U.S. government borrowing costs and long-term interest rates --
sending the world's biggest economy into recession and damaging
its trading partners.
 That scenario never materialised. Or, at least not yet.
 The global recession of 2008/2009 was rooted in more micro
considerations of banking credit, housing values and lax
oversight. But the shock was global and the outcome impossible
to predict, and the lack of visibility sparked a dash for highly
liquid, plain vanilla T-bonds.
Extraordinary monetary easing and bond-buying programmes by
the Federal Reserve helped drive Treasuries even higher and
ultimately the dollar's index rose some 15 percent in the year
to Spring 2009.
 But if only extreme financial stress rallied the dollar
then, and some ""normalisation"" now is letting it sink to new
lows, there is reasonable concern that the problem of U.S.
deficit funding and foreign reserve diversification is coming
back into play.
 For one, it's hard to build a case for the dollar with U.S.
fiscal and monetary policy still on full throttle. There may be
a prospect of future tightening of both, but budget plans remain
sketchy and the Fed is unlikely to raise rates this year.
 What's more, political concern about the dollar's decline is
hardly pressing. If anything, it will be welcomed with open arms
by a White House moving into re-election mode next year and
seeking to honour a 2010 pledge to double exports in five years.
 And if, as per 2008, the fate of Treasuries and the dollar
are intertwined, then Standard & Poor's warning last month that
foot-dragging on budget cuts threatens the United States' top
credit rating will at least raise questions about any renewed
""safety"" bid.
 Rating threat or not, the Fed's decision to end its
bond-buying, or quantitative easing, programme in June will test
the resilience of the Treasury market.
 Perhaps one reason S&P's warnings passed relatively smoothly
though the bond market is that the credit shock showed there
were few easy alternatives to the dollar as a deep and liquid
reserve currency in a crisis.
 But even though the U.S. current account gap has halved from
peaks of six percent of national output in 2006, it's still on
course for almost $500 billion in 2011 -- or $40 billion a
month. And with 30 percent of the Treasury market still held by
overseas central banks, the prime actors have not changed.
 ""While S&P might make the headlines it is clear that the
real power over U.S. Treasury yields lies with the central banks
and particularly the biggest holder of foreign exchange
reserves, China,"" said Schroders chief economist Keith Wade.
 China is hardly being alarmist, not least because it's
sitting on at least $2 trillion worth of dollar reserves. But
neither is it being hugely encouraging about the exchange rate
either as speculation mounts about a revaluation of its yuan.
 ""It is not necessary for China to worry about the impact of
the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign exchange reserves
because we are pushing forward with a strategy of diversifying
our investments of foreign reserves,"" former currency regulator
Wei Benhua said in Hanoi on Tuesday.
 A slow burn rather than a disorderly unwinding may be
possible, but some nervous times lie ahead at least.

 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Oil and commodity prices fell
on Wednesday, driving world stocks lower, as disappointing U.S.
economic data and concerns about the slowdown of the Chinese
economy prompted investors to scale back risky positions.
 The dollar hit a three-year low against major currencies
and Wall Street fell as much as 1 percent after a batch of
disappointing U.S. economic data for April -- including a
surprise slowdown in the services sector and less hiring by the
private sector. For details, see [ID:nN04209762].
 The euro hit a session high against the dollar at a
17-month high as investors interpreted the data as the latest
sign that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current
monetary stimulus while euro zone rates go higher.
 ""This appears to be a bump in the road for the recovery if
indeed the pace of job recovery has slowed,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, a strategist at BNY Mellon. ""It certainly feeds into
the notion that the Fed won't be hiking interest rates soon.""
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
against a basket of key currencies, fell to a three-year low
after the U.S. data. It later recovered slightly to trade 0.25
percent lower.
 The euro  rose as high as $1.4939, a 17-month high,
according to Reuters data. It last traded 0.26 percent higher
at $1.4864
 CHINESE FEARS
 Concerns about the global economic recovery were on the
rise as investors anticipated further tightening measures in
China, the world's top consumer of commodities.
 In Hanoi, China's Vice Finance Minister Li Yong said the
government will continue to use measures such as higher
interest rates and bank deposit requirements to curb inflation.
[ID:nL3E7G421O]
 Copper prices dropped to a seven-week low, with three-month
contracts on the London Metal Exchange hitting a session low of
$9,135 per tonne, the lowest since March 15, compared with
$9,350 at the close on Tuesday.
 ""General risk appetite is under pressure at the moment.
There are some fears over China -- will they tighten too much?""
said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, an analyst with Danske bank.
 On Wall Street, disappointment with the economic data
outweighed encouraging news of mergers and acquisitions. It
also left investors more cautious ahead of Friday's key nonfarm
payrolls data.
 ""Friday's jobs report will be important,"" said Michael
Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport,
Connecticut. ""If we get (200,000 job gains) or above, it will
reinforce the idea the economy continues to expand.""
 A Reuters poll forecast nonfarm job gains of 186,000 for
the month of April and private payroll gains of 200,000.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 66.30 points,
or 0.52 percent, to 12,741.21. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 7.24 points, or 0.53 percent, at 1,349.38. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> declined 7.13 points, or 0.25
percent, to 2,834.49.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> lost 0.87

last week.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed down
1.41 percent, pressured by mining and oil shares. Emerging
stocks <.MSCIEF> lost 1.2 percent.
 Before this week's decline, world stocks had risen more
than 8 percent this year as investors grew confident that
strong corporate earnings, robust growth in emerging markets
and ample liquidity would keep global growth at a reasonable
level.
 OIL DOWN FOR THIRD DAY
 U.S. crude oil  closed down 1.63 percent at $109.24 a
barrel, weighed down by concerns over China and a
larger-than-forecast increase in U.S. crude stockpiles.
[EIA/S]
 However, crude is still near a 31-month peak, keeping alive
inflation worries.
 Silver fell more than 4 percent in a third straight session
of sharp losses, also dragging down gold, after the Wall Street
Journal reported that billionaire investor George Soros has
been selling silver and gold in the past month or so.
 Other safe-haven assets were on the rise, though. The
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose 6/32 in
price, putting its yield at 3.227 percent.
 Portuguese bond yields fell after the country agreed to a
three-year, 78-billion-euro ($116 billion) bailout with the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday,
becoming the third euro zone country in a year, after Ireland
and Greece, to seek financial aid. [ID:nLDE7420RT]

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped to a
three-year low on Wednesday and the currency's outlook darkened
further as softer-than-expected employment and services sector
data affirmed expectations U.S. interest rates would remain low
this year.
 The greenback also fell to a record against the Swiss franc
and at one point dropped below 80.50 against the yen, the
dollar's weakest level since major central banks intervened to
weaken the Japanese currency on March 18.
 ""U.S. data have not been strong enough for the Fed to
resume raising interest rates,"" said Geoffrey Yu, senior
currency strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. For
details, see [ID:nN04209762]
 ""The Fed has raised the bar for a policy tightening and
it's going to remain the case for some time ahead. It's just a
question of 'When will the Fed really signal a change in
direction?' Right now, that doesn't seem to be the case.""
 In early afternoon trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index
dropped to 72.696, its weakest since late July 2008. The index
has fallen in 11 of the last 12 sessions and lost 7.7 percent
in 2011 <.DXY>.
 The euro, on the other hand, remained fairly well supported
in anticipation of higher euro zone interest rates and strong
sovereign demand.
 The European Central Bank is scheduled to convene on
Thursday for its monetary policy meeting. It raised rates in
April for the first time since 2008, but may hold them steady
at Thursday's meeting.
 Markets, however, have fully priced an interest rate hike
by the ECB in July as it attempts to rein in inflation and have
started factoring in some probability of an earlier rate
increase in June.
 Investors also shrugged off news Portugal had become the
third euro zone country in the last year to need a bailout.
 The single currency rose as high as $1.49404  on
electronic trading platform EBS, the highest since December
2009. It was last at $1.4864, up 0.3 percent. Traders said
there are options barriers at $1.4950 and $1.5000.
 They said a move above $1.50 was likely but would probably
have to wait until after the ECB meeting.
 Implied volatility in one-month euro/dollar options
continued ascending, rising to 11.20 percent on Wednesday from
10.90 percent  on Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty as
to the timing of next ECB rate increase.
 Investors were also nervous ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet may disappoint investors and make less-hawkish comments
than in his previous statements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to 0.8554 franc
 and last changed hands at 0.8592, down 0.2 percent.
 Against the yen , the dollar fell as low as 80.44,
a six-week low.
 If it falls further, analysts said it could put markets on
alert for official intervention to slow the pace of yen gains.
 Major central banks actively sold the yen earlier this year
after it hit a record high against the dollar. A strong yen
could hurt Japan's export-led economy as it struggles with slow
growth and the aftermath of March's earthquake and tsunami.
 ""People are watching that 80 level, which isn't very far
away,"" said BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk.
 The slide in commodities, however, provided support for the
U.S. dollar against commodity-linked currencies such as the
Australian and Canadian dollars.
 The Australian dollar moved further away from a nearly
three-decade high of US$1.1012 and was last at US$1.0774, down
0.6 percent .
 The Canadian dollar also fell, pushing the greenback 0.5
percent higher at C$0.9573 .

 * Treasury undersecretary says no new measures for 2011
 * Italy's deficit has stayed relatively low during crisis
 
 (Adds quotes from govt officials, background)
 ROME, May 4 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet will present an
emergency decree by early June with 7 or 8 billion euros of
belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting the budget deficit and
financing additional spending, a government source said.
 He told Reuters on Wednesday that the measures would rein in
the deficit in both 2011 and 2012.
 Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right government is aiming for
the budget gap to fall to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product
this year, from 4.6 percent in 2010, and to decline further to
2.7 percent in 2012.
 ""We're working on a decree worth 7 to 8 billion euros,
partly to meet our deficit targets and partly to finance some
spending measures,"" the source said.
 The latest deficit targets were confirmed by the Treasury in
a new economic plan presented last month and now being debated
in parliament.
 Asked to comment on the source's information, Industry
Minister Paolo Romani replied, ""I don't confirm them.""
 Treasury Undersecretary Luigi Casero said no corrective
mini-budget was planned for this year's accounts.
 Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti has kept a tight rein on
public spending and the deficit has risen far less than those of
most of Italy's euro zone neighbours during the financial crisis
of the last two years.
 Analysts say this has been the main reason why Italy,
despite having one of the largest debt piles in the euro zone,
has escaped the kind of market turmoil which has forced Greece,
Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts from the European Union.

841,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2011 04:00PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Gordhan says S.Africa not planning rand intervention," * Rand gains have helped with inflation
 * Govt still concerned about capital inflows
 * Trade Minister says rand overvalued
 
 (Adds details, background)
 CAPE TOWN, May 4 (Reuters) - South Africa's government is
not planning to intervene to weaken the rand currency that has
helped to cushion the impact of higher oil and food prices,
Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Wednesday.
 The government's rand policy is a touchy issue between the
ruling African National Congress and its leftist allies who
would rather see the currency weakened and Gordhan's comments
could add to ongoing tensions in the alliance over policy.
 The rand has gained more than 30 percent against the dollar
since the beginning of 2009. It hit its strongest levels in more
than three years this week and was last trading at 6.64.
 ""At this stage we are not planning on intervening,"" Gordhan
said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
 Gordhan told SABC TV earlier on Wednesday that it was
fortunate that the biggest economy in Africa was experiencing a
strong currency, adding had it not been for the rand's gains,
fuel and food prices would be much higher.
 Like other emerging markets, strong capital inflows into
South Africa in the wake of loose monetary policy in developed
countries have been the main driver of the rand's gains.
 Gordhan said the government was still concerned about the
impact of short-term capital inflows. South Africa rejected the
idea of implementing a tax on capital inflow, like other
countries such as Brazil, but has opted to raise its foreign
exchange reserves to limit rand gains.
 Inflation has been within the central bank's target of
between 3 and 6 percent since February 2010, and the central
bank expects it to stay in that band until the end of 2012. It
stood at 4.1 percent year-on-year in March.
 South Africa's benign inflation environment has allowed the
central bank to keep the repo rate steady at 5.5 percent at a
time when other emerging markets are starting to tighten
monetary policy.
 Analysts expect South Africa to start raising interest rates
only towards the end of the year, after decreasing them by 650
basis points between December 2008 and December 2010.
 The rand's gains have hurt the manufacturing sector, Gordhan
acknowledged. ""It does have a negative impact on manufacturing,""
he said.
 At current levels, it is considered too strong by
manufacturers who would rather see it trading above 8.00 to the
dollar.
 The sector was the hardest hit by a recession in 2009 and
although it is on a recovery, output levels are still below
pre-recession levels.
 Trade Minister Rob Davies, a left-leaning cabinet member,
said the currency was overvalued but did not say what currency
policy the government should pursue.
 ""The rand is overvalued due to the continued uneven nature
of the world economic recovery and the policies that are being
followed by some of the major players,"" Davies said at the WEF.
 ""The overvalued rand is still hitting us in the value-added
sectors,"" he added.
 With a quarter of the labour force jobless, South Africa has
to balance the impact of the rand on inflation with ensuring
that the currency does not strangle key sectors such as
manufacturing and constrain economic growth.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a fresh
three-year low on Wednesday and the euro briefly rose above
$1.49 as weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data convinced
investors that U.S. interest rates would remain low this year.
 The yen also hit a six-week high against the dollar after
data showed the pace of growth in the dominant U.S. services
sector also slowed unexpectedly in April, another sign the U.S.
economy may be hitting a soft patch.
 With markets worried about a yawning U.S. budget deficit,
traders said signs of slower growth will only add to trouble
for the dollar, which fell to a three-year low against major
currencies Wednesday. It has lost 7.7 percent in 2011.
 ""The dollar got beat up pretty badly against the euro,""
said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange trading at BMO
Capital Markets. ""The U.S. fiscal situation is a concern. Now
it seems the U.S. economy isn't just tepid but actually cooling
off again. That's not encouraging.""
 But Askari and others said concerns about slower U.S.
growth also dulled appetite for commodities and higher-yield
assets for fear a U.S. slump would reverberate globally.
 That sent the safe-haven Swiss franc to a record high
against the greenback and drove the U.S. currency up against
the Canadian dollar. Canada's economy is heavily depend on
exports to its southern neighbor.
 EURO SUPPORT
 The euro remained fairly well supported in anticipation of
higher euro zone interest rates and strong sovereign demand.
Investors brushed off news that Portugal had become the third
euro zone country in the last year to need a bailout and drove
the euro to $1.4939, a 17-month high. It later eased to
$1.4860, up 0.3 percent and about a cent above the day's low.
 Traders said a move above $1.50 was likely but would
probably have to wait until after Thursday's European Central
Bank meeting, which should offer clues on future rate hikes.
 The ECB raised rates in April for the first time since 2008
and is expected to do so again this year to tame inflation,
even as higher rates make it more difficult for countries such
as Portugal to service their debts.
 ""The currency market seems to have learnt to live with the
struggles of the peripheral euro zone nations."" said Audrey
Childe-Freeman, currency strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank.
 Markets do not expect the Fed to raise rates from near zero
until the middle of 2012.
 YEN STRENGTHENS
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 80.68 yen. If it falls
further, analysts said it could put markets on alert for
official intervention to slow the pace of yen gains.
 Major central banks actively sold the yen earlier this year
after it hit a record high against the dollar. A strong yen
could hurt Japan's export-led economy as it struggles with slow
growth and the aftermath of March's earthquake and tsunami.
 ""People are watching that 80 level, which isn't very far
away,"" said BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.0754,
retreating from a post-float high above $1.10 as a decline in
silver weakened demand for commodity-sensitive currencies.
 Some gauges of market positioning suggest speculators and
hedge funds are heavily short the dollar, leaving open the
possibility of more position unwinding.
 But the U.S. dollar has been unable to build on
short-covering support seen in past days, and investors are
likely to look for fresh selling opportunities.
 ""There are still no big incentives to go short euros,"" said
Roberto Mialich, strategist at Unicredit in Milan. ""At the end
of the day, the dollar will be sold again, and it's just a
matter of time for a test of $1.50.""

percent
 * Soaring prices stoke anger across east Africa

(Adds union, manufacturers, analyst quote, details)
 By James Macharia
 NAIROBI, May 4 (Reuters) - Kenya's main union said on
Wednesday it would call a strike in 21 days unless the
government raised wages further to help workers cope with rising
food and fuel prices.
 Higher food and fuel costs have become a flashpoint in east
Africa, where inflation rates have surged into double digits.
They have sparked deadly protests in neighbouring Uganda and
widespread discontent in Kenya, east Africa's biggest economy.
 The cost of bread, flour and petrol has shot up in Kenya and
analysts say labour unrest is a likely destabilising factor in
the country -- despite government measures to rein in prices by
cutting fuel taxes and import duty on grains.
 On Labour Day, the government raised the minimum wage by
12.5 percent. But the Central Organisation of Trade Unions
(COTU) said this was not enough and demanded a 60 percent pay
rise for its members, and a 10 percent rise for other workers.
 ""To our astonishment and surprise, the ... government
dismayed and disillusioned lowly placed Kenyan workers by
announcing 12.5 percent as an increase to minimum wage,"" Francis
Atwoli, COTU's secretary general said in a statement.
 He said COTU's top body would review the situation and make
a final decision on May 21 on the exact timing of the strike.
 ""The 1.5 million members of COTU will lead the general
workers strike in a nationwide strike,"" he told Reuters.
 He said the gap between rich and poor was widening, and
warned this could incur anger and possibly provoke protests.
 A strike could bring the flower- and tea-exporting nation,
with a vibrant tourism industry and a regional financial hub to
a standstill, damaging prospects for sub-Sahara's fourth biggest
economy, which is projected to grow about 6 percent this year.
 The threat of worker unrest is further bad news for a
coalition cabinet shaken by divisions over the handling of
suspects named by the International Criminal Court as having
sponsored the country's post-election violence.
 
 DOUBLE-DIGIT INFLATION
 Hundreds of people marched against rising prices in main
towns across Kenya last month, and the union hopes to tap into
this anger in its wage showdown with the state.
 The year-on-year inflation rate rose for the sixth month in
a row to 12.05 percent in April from 9.19 percent in March,
putting basic items out of reach for many Kenyans.
 However, political analysts said few Kenyans would risk
being away from work at a time when jobs are scarce for fear of
being sacked, even if the strike is protected by law.
 ""People are very angry with the rising prices, but it's a
Catch-22 situation where workers fear they can be replaced so
easily,"" political commentator Kwamchetsi Makokha said.
 ""I think the Kenyan public will cut the government a little
more slack as compared with Uganda, where there are political
undertones to the protests, and the government here can get away
with a few half measures in addressing the situation.""
 The average minimum monthly wage in 2009 for a worker in the
agricultural sector stood at 4,076 shillings ($49), while that
of a worker in urban areas was an average 7,607 shillings,
according to the government's 2010 Economic Survey.
 Kenyan manufacturers, who have said they would pass on the
costs of the increased wages to their customers, warned that a
strike would hurt the economy even further.
 ""Any disruption to work is problematic and will push this
economy backwards. It's unfortunate that (Atwoli) wants to do
that ... Withdrawal of labour is not a good idea at this point,""
Betty Maina, chief executive officer of the industry group Kenya
Association of Manufacturers, told Reuters.

trade bill with the European Union on Wednesday that is expected
to double the value of trade in goods between them to about 100
billion euros ($135 billion). 
Below are estimates of the impact, caveats and environmental
concerns of the accord, which is set to take effect in July. For
main story, click on [ID:nL3E7G31EP]	
 
DUTY CUTS 
The agreement will eliminate 1.6 billion euros in Korean
import duties annually for EU exporters of industrial and farm
products and about 1.1 billion euros in EU duties. 
 
NON-TARIFF BARRIERS 
In areas such as the automotive, pharmaceutical and consumer
electronics sectors, South Korea will consider EU standards as
equivalent to its own, cutting red tape that has hampered trade.	
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
The pact provides for improved enforcement of copyright and
anti-piracy measures, protecting the exclusivity of EU food and
drink names such as Champagne, Scotch whisky and Parma ham. 
 
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT 
Trade disputes will be fast-tracked to 120 days, faster than
typical settlement procedures in the World Trade Organization. 
 
FOREIGN CONTENT 
A fought-over part of the pact is how much foreign content --
such as Chinese-made parts -- to allow in Korean goods. Korea
can export cars with 45 percent foreign input. 
However, a ""duty drawback"" clause can force Korea to limit
duty refunds to its manufacturers if the EU finds a surge in
Korean imports made with foreign parts, and vice versa. 
 
TARIFF CUTS ON CARS 
This is one of the most contentious parts of the accord, with
widespread concern among European and Japanese car makers alike
that cheap Korean cars will flood EU markets. 
The EU and Korea will eliminate import duties on large and
medium cars over three years and on small cars over five years. 
 
SAFEGUARDS 
In the case of a significant import surge, the executive EU
Commission can reimpose an import duty on cars for two years,
with an option to renew duties for two-year periods. 
Safeguards must be requested case-by-case by EU governments
or European industry and can apply to limited market segments. 
They can be blocked by a weighted majority of EU states. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS 
South Korea has eased car emissions standards for big cars,
largely imported from the EU. A two-tonne car may now emit up to
193 grams of CO2 per kilometre instead of 184 grams. 
Hailed by the EU as a victory for free trade, Korea's consent
has raised concerns of a precedent in making environmental
standards vulnerable to accusations of trade protectionism.

847,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2011 03:55PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-S.Korea parliament approves EU free trade bill," * Free trade agreement to come into effect July 1
 * Expected to boost trade by 100 bln euros
 * U.S.-S.Korea deal still in limbo

 By Jack Kim and Dahee Lim	
 SEOUL, May 4 (Reuters) - South Korea's parliament approved a
free trade bill with the European Union on Wednesday, clearing
the last obstacle for the pact to take effect in July that is
expected to boost the value of trade in goods between them to
about 100 billion euros.	
 A text of the deal had to be pulled from parliament's
consideration in early April after it was found to be riddled
with translation errors, causing embarrassment for President Lee
Myung-bak's administration.	
 South Korea's government scheduled a special parliamentary
session on Wednesday to push through the bill which will lift
most tariffs and trade barriers between South Korea and the
European Union within the next five years. 
 ""We expect the deal to create 250,000 jobs, which is the
greatest form of welfare for working people, and contribute
hugely to their lives by stabilising prices and improving income
potentials,"" said ruling Grand National Party spokeswoman Bae
Eun-hee.	
 The main opposition Democratic Party boycotted the session.	
 Delays to the European pact also delayed the processing of a
separate free trade deal with the United States, which faces
potentially greater resistance from the country's small but
powerful farm lobby. 
 The United States and South Korea say they want their
long-delayed FTA to be concluded by the end of the year. 
 The European Parliament approved the deal in February,
clearing the way for the EU's largest bilateral free trade deal
to take effect from July as pledged by the two sides. 
 The pact aims to scrap 98 percent of import duties -- 1.6
billion euros of South Korean duties and 11 billion euros of EU
duties -- as well as trade barriers in manufactured goods, farm
products and services by 2016. 
 The European Union and South Korea signed the pact, which is
Europe's first with an Asian country, in October, saying it
could double trade between them. 
 South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has said the deal would
allow Asia's fourth-largest economy to grow at more than 5
percent a year, create thousands of jobs and set a model for
international trade relations. 
 The European Union and the United States have been in a race
to be the first to seal a free trade agreement with South Korea,
the world's 15th largest economy, hoping to get a jumpstart on
the benefits of increased business deals. 
 Both Seoul and Washington are facing resistance to their
deal which was signed in 2007 but had been held up by U.S. auto
and beef industry concerns. 
 South Korean farmers say the government has done little to
provide relief for the expected damage from the U.S. trade pact.	
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a visit
to Seoul last month that Washington was committed to getting the
deal done this year. 
 Washington says the pact will increase exports of U.S. goods
by $11 billion and create tens of thousands of jobs.

 * EU source says still being finalised, could be higher
 * Greece says hopes Lisbon package will settle markets
 * Ireland worries Portugal may get better bailout terms
 * Euro zone debt crisis remains in critical phase

(Adds details on range of package, paragraph 3)
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, May 4 (Reuters) - Portugal and Greece talked up
the benefits of Lisbon's decision to accept a multi-billion euro
bailout from the European Union and IMF on Wednesday, but the
outlook for both countries and Ireland remains highly uncertain.
 Portugal's caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates announced
late on Tuesday he had reached preliminary agreement with the
EU, IMF and the European Central Bank for a three-year package
of support, including help for Lisbon's banks.
 Portuguese government officials said the aid would total 78
billion euros, with 12 billion of that going to Portugal's
banks. But a senior euro zone source said the range EU officials
were working with was still 75-90 billion euros, depending on
how much the banks ended up needing.
 The figures are expected to be finalised in talks in the
coming days, the source said.
 The bailout means three of the euro zone's 17 countries are
now effectively in financial intensive care -- Greece accepted
110 billion euros of bilateral loans a year ago and Ireland
signed an 85 billion euro bailout last November -- with the
long-term fiscal and economic prognosis for all three clouded.
Financial markets reacted cautiously but positively to the
Portuguese deal, even though key details have yet to be formally
announced, including the interest rate on the loans and the
precise measures Lisbon must enact in exchange for aid.
 Yields on Portuguese government debt fell, with the spread
of 10-year government bond yields over German Bunds tightening
by around 20 basis points to 675, an indication of lower risk,
although it remains at extremely high levels.
 Socrates, who is seeking re-election on June 5, said he had
secured a good deal, although he added: ""There are no financial
assistance programmes that are not demanding.""
 Greece, which has raised the possibility of renegotiating
elements of its package and which many analysts believe may be
forced to restructure its debts despite its bailout, said the
aid to Portugal should help settle financial markets.
 ""This agreement will contribute to reducing uncertainties in
the markets, which is something all of Europe needs,"" said
government spokesman George Petalotis.
 
 DIFFERING PLANS
 But there were less positive noises about the package from
other quarters, with Ireland concerned Lisbon may be getting a
better deal than Dublin received five months ago.
 Portugal's bailout must still be agreed by opposition
parties and signed off by euro zone finance ministers at a
meeting on May 16. There, Finland, where the anti-bailout True
Finns party did well in an election last month, could throw a
spanner in the works.
 The euro zone has three patients on three different medicine
regimes: Greece's loans must be repaid over seven years at an
average interest rate of 4.2 percent, Ireland's over seven years
at an average rate of 5.8 percent (although it is pushing to
change the rate), and Portugal's will be finalised in days.
 ""I think the terms inevitably are going to be different in
each country because the circumstances are ... different,"" said
Eamon Gilmore, Ireland's minister for foreign affairs.
 ""The government would be very fed up too if another country
was getting a bailout deal better than the terms that we are
getting,"" he told state broadcaster RTE.
 More than a year into the sovereign debt crisis, which at
its peak threatened to tear the single European currency apart,
EU leaders still find themselves battling to get on top of the
problem, rather than bedding down reliable long-term solutions.
 Many analysts still expect Greece, whose debts will climb to
around 340 billion euros, or 150 percent of annual output, this
year, to have to restructure its debts, either by writing off a
portion of them or by rescheduling the repayments.
 Such a decision could have widespread repercussions on major
French and German banks and the European Central Bank, all of
which own large amounts of Greek debt. Seventy percent of
Greece's sovereign bonds are owned by foreign institutions.
 Greece's finance minister has repeatedly dismissed the
possibility of a debt restructuring, saying on Tuesday it would
be a disaster for the country and its economy.
 But there is a growing sense that Greece will not be able to
avoid some form of restructuring, with its debt-to-GDP ratio
increasing as the economy contracts and the cost of short-term
loans unsustainable -- two-year yields stand at 25.7 percent.
 Michael Meister, deputy parliamentary leader of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said on Tuesday
extending the repayment schedule on Greece's euro zone bailout
loans made sense and European Central Bank policymaker Nout
Wellink has said he is open to the idea of extending maturities
on all Greek debt.
 That might help Greece better weather its sovereign debt
problems, but it would send reverberations through the rest of
the euro zone economy, and immediately raise questions about
whether Ireland and Portugal also need to restructure debts.
 Portugal must roll over nearly 5 billion euros of debt on
June 15. It is hoping that all the details of its bailout will
be agreed by then so that it can carry out the refinancing. 
 Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital
Economics in London, said Portugal's bailout should provide
reassurance that Lisbon can meet its upcoming redemption, but
added: ""It won't put an end to speculation that -- along with
Greece and perhaps others -- it will sooner or later need to
undertake some form of debt restructuring.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered just above
a three-year low on Wednesday and the euro jumped as data
showed the United States added fewer private jobs than expected
in April, boosting views U.S. interest rates would remain low.
 The euro rose above $1.49, its highest level since late
2009, and traders expect an imminent break of $1.50. Investors
brushed off news of a euro bailout package for Portugal, the
third euro zone country to need emergency aid.
 For more, see [ID:nLDE7422CB] and [ID:nEAPA40EH0]
 ""This appears to be a bump in the road for recovery if
indeed the pace of job recovery has slowed,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon. ""It certainly feeds into
the notion that the Fed won't be hiking interest rates soon.""
 Unlike the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank rose
rates last month for the first time since 2008 and is expected
to do so again this year, though most traders expect it to
stand pat at its policy meeting on Thursday.
 Markets do not expect the Fed to raise rates from near zero
until 2012.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4928, a 17-month peak, and was
last up 0.7 percent at $1.4920 . The dollar was flat at
80.94 yen . Against a basket of major currencies was a
breadth away from a three-year low <.DXY>.
 Analysts expect the euro rise above $1.50, though some say
the market may wait for Thursday's ECB meeting.
 DOLLAR SENTIMENT STILL NEGATIVE
 Investors will get another look at the U.S. job market
Friday with the government's nonfarm payrolls report, expected
to show a 186,000 job gain after March's 216,000 tally.
 Signs of softer U.S. economic growth coupled with worries
about U.S. ability to get the country's large fiscal deficits
under control have increased negative sentiment on the dollar,
which is down some 8 percent against the basket of major
currencies this year.
 The ECB, meanwhile, is expected to signal on Thursday it
will raise rates in the coming months to tame inflation, even
as higher rates make it even more difficult for weak euro zone
countries -- including Portugal -- to service their debts.
 Traders said reserve managers and investors positioning for
higher rates were buyers and said a correction would probably
require the euro to fall below Tuesday's low around $1.4750.
 ""The currency market seems to have learnt to live with the
struggles of the peripheral euro zone nations."" said Audrey
Childe-Freeman, currency strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank.
 Roberto Mialich, strategist at Unicredit in Milan, said,
""there are still no big incentives to go significantly short
euros. At the end of the day, the dollar will be sold again,
and it's just a matter of time for a test of $1.50.""
 If the ECB surprises markets, though, and doesn't signal
more hikes ahead or if U.S. jobs gains are bigger than expected
on Friday, the dollar could be ripe for some buying interest.
 Some gauges of market positioning suggest speculators and
hedge funds have hefty short dollar positions against emerging
Asian currencies and others including the Australian dollar,
leaving open the possibility of more position unwinding.
 But the U.S. dollar has been unable to build on
short-covering support seen in past days, and investors are
likely to look for fresh selling opportunities.
 The Australian dollar  up 0.2 percent at $1.0860,
well supported by Asian sovereign demand, traders said.
 The Aussie, which hit a near-three decade high above $1.10
this week, suffered losses after it and other commodity-based
currencies took a hit from a drop in silver prices.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Wednesday, edging closer to $1.50, with the U.S. currency
under renewed pressure on expectations that U.S. interest rates
will stay low in coming months.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4870, with demand from
Asian sovereigns as well as European real money interest
boosting the single currency. Traders cited talk of option
barriers at $1.4950 and at $1.50 while large offers were said to
be at $1.4930/35.
 Market participants said the euro brushed off a widely
expected announcement Portugal had secured a 78 billion euro
bailout. Portugal is the third euro zone country to seek a
bailout after Greece and Ireland.
 Portugal sold three-month T-bills at higher yields on
Wednesday, but that did little to ruffle euro bulls, traders
said..
 A push above $1.50 is imminent, many analysts say, although
some expect investors will wait to see if the European Central
Bank maintains its tightening stance at a policy meeting on
Thursday before driving it through the psychological level.
 ""Euro/dollar is in consolidation mode ahead of the ECB
meeting and the non-farm payrolls data on Friday,"" said Audrey
Childe-Freeman, EMEA head of currency strategy at JP Morgan
Private Bank.
 ""The trend is clearly on the upside for the euro as the
interest rate differential story is the overwhelming driver. The
currency market seems to have learnt to live with the struggles
of the peripheral euro zone nations. The euro is a buy on dips.""
The ECB is expected to signal on Thursday it will raise
rates in the coming months to tame inflation, even as higher
rates make it even more difficult for weak euro zone countries
-- including Portugal -- to service their debts.
 Investors have focused on how such tightening will widen the
euro's rate differential against many currencies as a reason to
buy euros. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve intends to run
its quantitative easing programme until the end of June and
policy normalisation is still some months away.
 ""There are still no big incentives to go significantly short
euros; at the end of the day, the dollar will be sold again, and
it's just a matter of time for a test of $1.50,"" said Roberto
Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Traders said their order books were loaded with offers
around $1.4880-1.4950, which would cap gains. They cited offers
from a semi-official European name around $1.4870, adding that
unless the euro fell past its Tuesday's low of around $1.4750,
investors would not unwind their bullish bets on the euro.
 
 DOLLAR GAINS FIZZLE
 In the options market, implied volatilities in euro/dollar
are holding a firmer tone ahead of Thursday's ECB rate decision
and Friday's U.S. employment report. 
 One-month was trading around 11.25 percent versus 11.05
Tuesday, although risk-reversals remain biased for euro
downside, with the one-month 25-delta at 1.05 in favour of euro
puts, unchanged from Tuesday.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent versus a currency basket to
73.000. It hit 72.722 at the start of the month, its weakest
since mid-2008.
 Some gauges of market positioning suggest speculators and
hedge funds have hefty short dollar positions against emerging
Asian currencies and others including the Australian dollar,
leaving open the possibility of more position unwinding and a
further rebound in the U.S. currency.
 But the dollar has been unable to build on short-covering
support seen in past days, and given signals from the Federal
Reserve that rates would stay long for a prolonged period,
investors are likely to look for fresh selling opportunities.
 The high-yielding Aussie was flat at $1.0830, easing from a
session high of $1.0877, but well supported by Asian sovereign
demand, traders said.
 The Aussie was picked up at dips, having suffered losses in
the past few days after it and other commodity-based currencies
took a hit from a drop in silver prices.
 The dollar was up slightly at 81.02 yen.

 * Firms pass on rising costs to customers
 * Indian, Chinese services PMI bounce higher
 * U.S. PMI seen higher
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone service sector companies
eased off the accelerator slightly last month but ratcheted up
prices, while Indian firms also turned up the heat, according to
the latest business surveys to show inflation is on the rise.
 Businesses in the United States are also expected to have
performed strongly, while Chinese services-based companies grew
at their fastest pace in 11 months in April, despite a raft of
policy tightening measures imposed in recent months by Beijing.
 But growth is coming at a cost, with output price indexes in
closely-watched purchasing managers' surveys hitting new highs
across the world as firms increasingly pass rising costs from
soaring commodity and energy prices on to customers.
 ""The PMI confirms that for now at least it is still
consistent with pretty healthy growth in the euro zone. They
(prices) have been at high levels for some time now and that
will be of a concern,"" said Ben May at Capital Economics.
The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
which measures changes in the activity of euro zone companies
ranging from banks to restaurants, slipped to 56.7 in April from
the previous month's near 4-year high of 57.2.
 That marked its 20th month in a row above the 50 mark that
divides growth from contraction.
 Expansion was again dominated by Germany and France, which
masked virtual stagnation in Spain and slowing growth in Italy
and Ireland.
 Separately, euro zone retail sales fell sharply in March,
pointing to weaker household demand, as soaring prices and harsh
austerity measures weighed on consumers' minds.
 The biggest monthly decline in sales was in Portugal, where
the government secured a 78 billion euros bailout on Tuesday but
will be expected to cut debt sharply in return.
 Data due next week is expected to show the 17-nation bloc's
economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter, a modest step up
from the lacklustre 0.3 percent expansion seen in the last
months of 2010.
 Markit said that if sustained, the latest PMI figures were
consistent with quarterly growth of around 0.8 percent in the
second quarter of the year.
Data later in the day is expected to show the U.S. services
sector, which accounts for 80 percent of the world's largest
economy, expanded slightly faster last month than in March.
 The Federal Reserve said last week the economy was clawing
back from its deep recession at a ""moderate pace"" and showed it
was in no rush to change its ultra-loose policy, despite some
signs of inflation pressures building.
 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 The euro zone's output price index rose to 53.0 last month,
its highest level since July 2008 and up from March's 52.3, as
firms grew increasingly confident about passing on soaring input
costs to customers.
 The figures will bolster those policymakers at the European
Central Bank who believe the strong recovery in Europe's core
economies calls for more interest rate rises before inflation
becomes entrenched, even while weaker euro zone states remain
engulfed in the debt crisis.
 Data released on Friday showed consumer prices in the bloc
rose 2.8 percent year-on-year in April, up from March's 2.7
percent and well above the ECB's two percent target ceiling.
 The ECB holds a rate-setting meeting on Thursday, having
raised rates for the first time in two years last month. The
next tightening is expected in June or July.
 ""They need to hike because of the growth of the core
countries in Europe like Germany. They can't sustain this very
low interest rate and emergency measures,"" said Jan Dubsky at
RBS.
 Earlier on Wednesday, a comparable survey showed India's
services sector gained momentum in April, with strong growth in
new business orders despite stubbornly high inflation and
expectations of further interest rate increases.
 The Reserve Bank of India raised rates for the ninth time
since March 2010 on Tuesday in a bid to rein in stubborn
inflation that rose to nearly 9 percent in March, above the
central bank's target of 8 percent.
 China's PMI for its services sector, published on Tuesday,
rose to an 11-month high of 62.5 in April from 60.2 in March.

 * Higher food and energy costs subdue household demand
 
 (Recasts with economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell
sharply in March, data showed on Wednesday, indicating that
rising food and energy prices were curbing household demand and
that economic recovery was still mainly industry-driven.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said retail
sales in the 17 countries using the euro fell 1.0 percent
month-on-month in March for a 1.7 percent year-on-year drop.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1 percent
monthly rise and a flat year-on-year reading.
 The March year-on-year decline in the sales figures, which
are a good indication of household demand, was the biggest since
November 2009, when they fell 2.4 percent in annual terms.
 ""Even allowing for the fact that retail sales were likely
dragged down in March by the later Easter in 2011, the drop is
disappointing, given the importance of consumer spending to
growth prospects and the fact that it has been fragile through
the euro zone's recovery so far,"" said Howard Archer, economist
at IHS Global Insight.
 ""If the euro zone is to see sustained, decent growth in
2011, it needs consumers to increasingly step up to the plate.
And worryingly, euro zone consumer confidence fell for a second
month running in April, to be at a nine-month low,"" he said.
 But Eurostat also revised upwards the retail sales data for
February -- to 0.3 percent monthly growth from a 0.1 percent
decline and to a 1.3 percent annual rise from 0.1 percent.
 ""Retail sales now would be slightly down on the quarter, but
then retail sales are the most volatile numbers, and are often
revised more than once, so we should take them with a pinch of
salt,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING bank.
 The data was unlikely to have an impact on the European
Central Bank's monetary policy, he added.
 The ECB meets on interest rates on Thursday and economists
will be watching for indications that the bank would aim for a
rate rise in June, rather than in July, to stem a rise in
consumer prices, fuelled by more expensive oil.
 ""The weakness in private consumption does not come as a
surprise if you see that inflation has been picking up -- energy
prices and food prices. Consumers are the first to feel that,""
Brzeski said.
 ""If anything, the numbers would point to a deflationary
impact from the higher food prices and energy, but this was
known already last month and the month before and the ECB still
started its tightening cycle,"" he said, referring to the ECB's
April rate rise.
 Eurostat said the biggest monthly decline in retail sales in
the euro zone was in Portugal, where the government is
implementing a tough austerity programme to regain the
confidence of financial markets. Sales volumes were down 4.7
percent from February.
 The second biggest monthly drop, of 3 percent, was in
Slovenia and the third biggest, a fall of 2.1 percent, was in
the euro zone's biggest economy, Germany.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 4 (Reuters) - The yuan closed slightly
higher against the dollar on Wednesday as the Chinese and
U.S. administrations reiterated their positions regarding the
value of the two countries' currencies ahead of their top-level
talks in Washington next week.	
 In a quarterly monetary policy report late on Tuesday, the
People's Bank of China reaffirmed that the government will keep
the yuan's exchange rate basically stable - a phrase that
implies yuan appreciation against the dollar will be gradual and
controlled in line with China's economic conditions.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday
that China is starting to let the yuan rise more rapidly to curb
inflation but needs to move even more swiftly toward a
market-driven exchange rate. [ID:nN03126290]	
 Dealers said these remarks ahead of the U.S.-China Strategic
and Economic Dialogue next week appear routine, but added that
U.S. pressure for China to let its currency appreciate has
significantly eased this year compared with last year.	
 ""We don't expect the latest dialogue to give much play to
the yuan issue,"" said a trader at a U.S. Bank in Shanghai. ""The
(U.S.) administration is realistic in handling the currency
issue. With a conspicuous lack of congressional pressure this
year, it is expected to be much more polite and more
diplomatic.""	
 Still, the PBOC has guided the yuan to a slew of record
highs this year, with the currency rising by 0.9 percent against
the dollar in April, accelerating from 0.4 percent in March, at
a time when the dollar sank to three-year lows against a
basket of currencies.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it clear they will deploy
the currency as a weapon to fight inflation, which hit a
32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, partly boosted by surging
global commodity prices.	
 As there are few signs of a reversal in the weak dollar and
surging commodity prices, the PBOC may continue to let the yuan
edge higher, possibly at a faster pace to rein in inflation,
traders said.	
 
 TEMPORARY PBOC CAUTION	
 Reflecting caution over rising anticipation of yuan gains
ahead of the dialogue, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.5013 against the dollar on Wednesday, slightly weaker than
Tuesday's 6.5002.	
 The central bank uses the mid-point to express the
governments' intention for the yuan's movements.	
 Spot yuan closed at 6.4933 versus the
dollar, up marginally from Tuesday's close of 6.4968. It has now
appreciated 5.12 percent since it was depegged from
the dollar in June 2010, and 1.48 percent since the
start of this year.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.3280 at midday, up from 6.3150 at
the previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's
time fell to 2.73 percent from 2.95 percent.	"

 (Adds reaction, detail)
 By David Milliken and Sven Egenter
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Growth in Britain's construction
industry slowed more than expected last month, an industry
survey showed on Wednesday, casting further doubt on the
strength of the country's patchy economic recovery.
 The sharp fall in the Markit/CIPS construction PMI survey
followed weaker-than-expected figures for mortgage and consumer
lending from the Bank of England, as well as a marked decline in
house prices.
 Sterling hit a 13-month low against the euro in the wake of
the data, and financial markets had already pushed back
expectations of a first BoE interest rate rise to the end of the
year, after a slew of poor figures since last week's tepid first
quarter GDP reading.
 ""It's hard to find any evidence in today's data to suggest
that the overall economic recovery is back on track,"" said
Capital Economics's Samuel Tombs.
 Markit said the construction PMI fell to 53.3 in April from
56.4 in March, below the 55.5 forecast, after the first fall in
house building this year. On Tuesday, the manufacturing PMI also
showed a bigger than expected slowdown in activity.
 Both measures are still above the 50 mark that separates
growth from contraction, and Wednesday's figures gave some
economists hope that official Q1 GDP data showing the biggest
fall in construction output since early 2009 may prove wrong.
 The economy grew by just 0.5 percent in the first three
months of the year -- a poor performance given economists had
expected some catch-up after heavy snow contributed to a 0.5
percent fall in output in the last three months of 2010.
 This makes it a near certainty that the BoE will not raise
interest rates from a current record low of 0.5 percent on
Thursday, when it concludes its May Monetary Policy Committee
meeting, despite inflation running at twice its official target.
 
 HOUSING WEAKNESS
 Nonetheless, the BoE, mortgage lender Nationwide and the
country's official Land Registry all reported evidence of
renewed housing market weakness on Wednesday.
 The Land Registry said house prices suffered their biggest
monthly drop in more than two years in March, and net mortgage
lending figures from the BoE came in lower than any of the
forecasts in a Reuters poll of nine economists.
 British house prices fell less after the credit crunch than
in countries like the United States and Spain, due to less new
construction beforehand, but have edged lower since the middle
of last year when a partial recovery petered out.
 Mortgage lender Nationwide -- which said prices were down
1.3 percent in the year to April -- predicted that house prices
would end 2011 flat to slightly lower.
 Mortgage approvals were a relative bright spot, with 47,557
home purchases given the go-ahead in March, the highest number
since November. But even this was slightly less than the 48,000
economists had predicted.
 ""The big picture is of a pretty lifeless housing market,
with low turnover and very little new money coming into it,""
said Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 The BoE also reported growth in unsecured consumer lending
slowing to 0.1 billion pounds in March from February's 0.8
billion, below expectations and pointing to broader weakness in
consumer demand.
 High inflation, rising taxes and slow wage growth have
caused Britons' real household disposable income to suffer its
first fall in a generation, depressing the consumer spending
that was the mainstay of British growth before the recession.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Wednesday, edging closer to $1.50 as early gains in the U.S.
currency were wiped out on expectations low U.S. interest rates
will keep the greenback weak.
 The euro raced to a session high of $1.4860, with demand
from Asian sovereign as well as European real money interest
cited as lifting the single currency. Market participants said
the euro brushed off a widely expected announcement Portugal had
secured a 78 billion euro bailout.
 A push above $1.50 is imminent, analysts say, although some
expect investors will wait to see if the European Central Bank
maintains its tightening stance at a policy meeting on Thursday
before driving it through the psychological level.
 ""There are still no big incentives to go significantly short
euros; at the end of the day, the dollar will be sold again, and
it's just a matter of time for a test of $1.50,"" said Roberto
Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 The ECB is expected to signal on Thursday it will raise
rates in the coming months to tame inflation, even as higher
rates make it even more difficult for weak euro zone countries
-- including Portugal -- to service their debts.
 Investors have focused on how such tightening will widen the
euro's rate differential against many currencies as a reason to
buy euros.
 The euro was well supported on Wednesday, but traders said
their order books were loaded with offers around $1.4880-1.4950,
which would cap significant near-term gains. Traders also cited
offers from a semi-official European name around $1.4870.
 Analysts at ING said the euro had taken the details of
Portugal's debt rescue package in its stride even though some
doubts remained as to whether the deal would be approved later
in the month. Portugal is the third euro zone country to seek a
bailout after Greece and Ireland.
 ""Undoubtedly the market is very short dollars and the EZ
debt story still poses a risk to the EUR,"" ING said in a note.
""Yet structural factors should see demand return for EUR/USD
should it briefly correct below $1.47.""
 
 DOLLAR GAINS FIZZLE
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent versus a currency basket to
73.000. It hit 72.722 at the start of the month, its weakest
since mid-2008.
 Some gauges of market positioning suggest speculators and
hedge funds have hefty short dollar positions against emerging
Asian currencies and others including the Australian dollar,
leaving open the possibility of more position unwinding and a
further rebound in the U.S. currency.
 But the dollar has been unable to build on short-covering
support seen in past days, and given signals from the Federal
Reserve that rates would stay long for a prolonged period,
investors are likely to look for fresh selling opportunities.
 The high-yielding Aussie rose 0.3 percent to a session high
of $1.0877, also recovering from early losses thanks to Asian
sovereign demand, traders said.
 This helped the Aussie pare losses suffered in the past few
days after it and other commodity-based currencies took a hit
from a drop in silver prices.
 The dollar was up slightly at 81.02 yen.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - World stocks dropped further from
recent three-year highs on Wednesday as falling commodity prices
and concerns about signs of economic slowdown in China prompted
investors to scale back risky positions.
 Portuguese bond yields fell after the country agreed a
three-year 78-billion-euro ($116 billion) bailout with the
European Union and IMF on Tuesday, becoming the third euro zone
country in a year, after Ireland and Greece, to seek financial
aid.
This week's 14 percent plunge in silver prices and a
lower-than-forecast manufacturing growth reading in China have
made investors nervous about holding big bets ahead of the
European Central Bank meeting on Thursday and the April U.S.
jobs report due on Friday.
 Before this week's decline, world stocks had risen more than
eight percent this year as investors grew confident strong
corporate earnings, robust growth in emerging markets and still
ample liquidity would keep global growth at a reasonable level.
 ""The market had a reasonably good run over the last couple
of weeks and investors are just taking profits,"" said Bernard
McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 ""Looking into the back end of this year, equities are still
in a cyclical bull market and there is no ending signal yet. The
market will also get support from earnings.""
 The MSCI world equity index was down 0.3 percent, after
hitting its highest level in almost three years last week.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index was also down around
a third of a percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 percent, led by weak
mining and oil shares. U.S. stock futures fell around 0.2
percent, pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street.
 Emerging stocks lost 0.8 percent. Asian stocks outside Japan
dropped 1.3 percent. 
 U.S. crude oil was down 0.3 percent to $110.70 a barrel,
weighed by concerns that China may tighten monetary policy
further to curb inflation. Crude is still near a 31-month peak,
keeping alive inflation worries.
 German bond futures fell 40 ticks. The Portuguese/German
10-year government bond yield spread tightened to 677 basis
points versus 695 bps at Tuesday's settlement close.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies, edging towards a three-year low hit earlier this
week. The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4853.
 The ECB is expected to keep interest rates on hold having
raised them in April, but the bank is expected to signal its
readiness to tighten again and it may use its 'strong vigilance'
code words to signal a rise as soon as June.
 ""We expect the ECB to send a fairly straightforward signal
on Thursday. Either the Governing Council states its 'strong
vigilance' and the next rate hike would come in June or it
'monitors very closely' all developments, and a July rate hike
is more likely,"" Credit Agricole said in a note to clients.
 ""On balance, we still favour July, mostly because delivering
a second rate hike two months after the first one on 7 April
would signal a rapid tightening in the near term, thus running
the risk of pushing the currency even higher.""

919,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2011 04:04AM ET</span>","Euro zone private sector prospers, prices a worry"," * Euro zone service sector growth slows moderately
 * Firms increase prices at fastest rate since July 2008
 * Composite PMI suggests quarterly growth of 0.8 pct
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - The euro zone's dominant service
sector eased off the accelerator last month but a strong
manufacturing performance meant the bloc's economy made a solid
start to the second quarter, surveys showed on Wednesday.
 The expansion was again dominated by Germany and France,
which masked virtual stagnation in Spain and slowing growth in
Italy and Ireland, and has come at a cost as firms ramped up
their prices.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
which measures changes in the activities of euro zone firms
ranging from banks to restaurants, slipped to 56.7 in April from
the previous month's near 4-year high of 57.2.
 This marked its 20th month in a row above the 50 mark that
divides growth from contraction with the figure revised slightly
down from a preliminary reading of 56.9 released two weeks ago.
 ""Despite the fall in the euro zone PMI's Activity Index, the
April survey provides little to worry about on the growth front,
consistent with the service sector growing at a quarterly rate
of roughly 0.7-0.8 percent at the start of the second quarter,""
said Chris Williamson at data compiler Markit.
 ""Of greater concern was the news on inflation and national
variations in performance, with fast growth stoking inflationary
pressures in France and Germany while the region's periphery
stagnates.""
 The output price index rose to 53.0 last month, its highest
level since July 2008 and up from March's 52.3, as firms grew
increasingly confident about passing on soaring input costs to
customers.
 Official flash data released on Friday showed consumer
prices in the bloc rose 2.8 percent in April, up from March's
2.7 percent and above expectations for 2.7 percent.
 The figures will bolster those policymakers at the European
Central Bank who believe the strong recovery in Europe's core
economies calls for more monetary tightening before price rises
become entrenched, even while weaker euro zone states remain
engulfed in the debt crisis.
 The ECB was the first of the big four central banks to raise
rates when it increased them by 25 basis points from a record
low of 1.0 percent last month but it is not seen making its next
move until July. [ECB/INT]
 
 PARTING WAYS
 The composite PMI, which combines data from Monday's
manufacturing survey with the latest service sector figures,
edged up to 57.8 from March's 57.6, in line with the flash
reading.
 Markit said the data marked a good start to the second
quarter for the euro zone's private sector, consistent with GDP
rising by around 0.8 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
Economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.4 percent.

 Earlier data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed
expansion in its service sector slowed but remained strong while
France's growth accelerated. Spain's indicator just nudged over
the 50 mark to record a negligible upturn.
 ""The worrying two-speed nature of the upturn shows no signs
of fading, with soaring growth in France and Germany failing to
spill over to stimulate similar buoyancy in the periphery,""
Williamson said.
 The composite employment index held steady last month at
March's 53.1, just below February's post-recession high of 53.3,
as firms took on more workers to meet demand.
 Unemployment held steady at 9.9 percent in March, official
data released last week showed.

 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - IT services company Logica Plc

market to grow by ""low single digits"" this year, driven by
continued demand for outsourcing and low-level growth in
consulting.
 ""There are clear of economic recovery across many of our
markets and we believe we are well placed to benefit from that,""
he said.
 Customers have been reluctant to embark on major IT upgrades
during the downturn, putting pressure on Logica's consulting and
systems integration unit, although the company has benefited
from demand for outsourcing as firms cut costs.
 Industry research group Gartner said on Wednesday that
worldwide IT services revenue returned to growth in 2010 after
the global recession in 2008 and 2009, with spending up 3
percent to $793 billion.
 Logica's first-quarter sales grew 5 percent to 978 million
pounds ($1.6 billion), above a forecast for 951 million in a
company poll and boosted by 13 percent growth in outsourcing.
 Logica shares rose 3.6 percent in London and 3.3 percent in
Amsterdam by 0921 GMT against a 0.3 percent weaker European
technology sector.
 
 NEW HIRES
 Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor said the first
quarter update indicated that Logica was trading in line with
full-year expectations.
 O'Connor said revenue and order book were both ahead of his
expectations, but he noted that in the early stages of recovery
IT service companies have a tendency to miss margin guidance as
overall staff utilisation weakened due to additional hires.
 Green said Logica was recruiting in offshore locations like
India as well as in the UK and France. 
 ""First-half profitability will be affected by costs to
ensure we have the right skills base in place to meet market
demand"" Green said.
 Logica's rival Accenture reported an increase of 9 percent
in dollars and 14 percent in local currency in Europe for its
fiscal second quarter to end-February. 
 Logica said a 30 million pound restructuring it was
undertaking would deliver around 15 million benefit starting
from the end of the second quarter and contributing to the
expected 2011 margin improvement.
 In Britain, where the government has been imposing deep
spending cuts, Logica reported a 4 percent fall in revenue with
public-sector revenue down 9 percent, but orders from other
customers, including oil company Shell, rose threefold.
 France, Logica's biggest market and which accounts for about
23 percent of revenue, increased sales by 11 percent and Logica
made 400 new hires to support growth. Units in northern and
central Europe, Sweden and outside Europe also grew.
 Benelux sales fell 5 percent because of public-spending
cuts, and Logica used only about 75 percent of its capacity
there. The company said it was seeking to move more employees in
Benelux onto commercial-sector work.

 HELSINKI, May 4 (Reuters) - Finnish lender and insurer
Pohjola Bank reported higher-than-expected earnings for the
first quarter, citing a rebound in corporate loans, although
higher claims eroded insurance profits.
 January-March pretax profit rose 61 percent from a year ago
to 94 million euros ($139.7 million), compared with a forecast
for 84.8 million in a Reuters poll.
 Its non-life insurance combined ratio -- a key measure of
underwriting profitability which expresses costs and claims
expenses as a proportion of premium income -- weakened to 100.5
percent from 95.9 percent a year earlier, compared with a
forecast of 92.5 percent.
 ""Higher claims expenditure, especially among corporate
customers, weakened the operating combined ratio,"" said Chief
Executive Mikael Silvennoinen in a statement.
 Pohjola repeated it expected its pretax profit to rise this
year. It estimated the full-year non-life insurance combined
ratio at 89-94 percent.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 4 (Reuters) - The yuan was little changed
against the dollar on Wednesday as the Chinese and U.S.
administrations reiterated their positions regarding the value
of the two countries' currencies ahead of their top-level talks
in Washington next week.	
 In a quarterly monetary policy report late on Tuesday, the
People's Bank of China reaffirmed that the government will keep
the yuan's exchange rate basically stable - a phrase that
implies yuan appreciation against the dollar will be gradual and
controlled in line with China's economic conditions.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday
that China is starting to let the yuan rise more rapidly to curb
inflation but needs to move even more swiftly toward a
market-driven exchange rate. [ID:nN03126290]	
 Dealers said these remarks ahead of the U.S.-China Strategic
and Economic Dialogue next week appear routine, but added that
U.S. pressure for China to let its currency appreciate has
significantly eased this year compared with last year.	
 ""We don't expect the latest dialogue to give much play to
the yuan issue,"" said a trader at a U.S. Bank in Shanghai. ""The
(U.S.) administration is realistic in handling the currency
issue. With a conspicuous lack of congressional pressure this
year, it is expected to be much more polite and more
diplomatic.""	
 Still, the PBOC has guided the yuan to a slew of record
highs this year, with the currency rising by 0.9 percent against
the dollar in April, accelerating from 0.4 percent in March, at
a time when the dollar sank to three-year lows against a
basket of currencies.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it clear they will deploy
the currency as a weapon to fight inflation, which hit a
32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, partly boosted by surging
global commodity prices.	
 As there are few signs of a reversal in the weak dollar and
surging commodity prices, the PBOC may continue to let the yuan
edge higher, possibly at a faster pace to rein in inflation,
traders said.	
 
 TEMPORARY PBOC CAUTION	
 Reflecting caution over rising anticipation of yuan gains
ahead of the dialogue, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.5013 against the dollar on Wednesday, slightly weaker than
Tuesday's 6.5002.	
 The central bank uses the mid-point to express the
governments' intention for the yuan's movements.	
 Spot yuan was trading at 6.4960 versus the
dollar, up marginally from Tuesday's close of 6.4968. It has now
appreciated 5.08 percent since it was depegged from the dollar
in June 2010, and 1.44 percent since the start of this year.	
 Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were bid at 6.3280 at midday, up from 6.3150 at
the previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's
time fell to 2.73 percent from 2.95 percent.	"

 * Hong Kong, China stocks lead region lower
 * Silver down 14 percent so far this week
 * Falling commodities keep US dollar supported
 * Profit taking in risky assets may have more to run

 By Raju Gopalakrishnan	
 SINGAPORE, May 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Wednesday,
led by Chinese markets, with soft commodity prices making
investors nervous a broader pullback in risk taking may be
unfolding.	
 This week's 14 percent plunge in silver prices and a
lower-than-forecast manufacturing growth reading in China have
made investors nervous about holding big bets ahead of the
European Central Bank meeting on Thursday and the April U.S.
payrolls report due on Friday.	
 Sentiment was also turning negative after the U.S. S&P 500
stocks index , which hit a 3-year high on Monday, closed
lower for a second day, hurt by fears that corporate earnings
would not live up to high expectations.	
 ""Risky assets are having a respite, having advanced rather
quickly in more recent weeks,"" said Andy Ji, a currency
strategist and economist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia in
Singapore.	
 ""I continue to see fundamental support either waning or
fully priced in many risky assets, including currencies that are
more risk-sensitive.""

 
 UNWOUND POSITIONS	
 The U.S. dollar was steady though had gained as much as 0.7
percent on the day against a basket of currencies ,
rebounding from a near 3-year low hit on Monday, as hedge funds
unwound some stretched short positions against the dollar vs
Asian currencies.	
 Deutsche Bank's internal gauge of market positioning that
tracks moves among hedge funds had shown that long positions in
some of the Asian currencies had been close to a record high as
of last Thursday, said Mirza Baig, the bank's senior currency
strategist in Singapore.	
 ""In general it feels really, mostly like a position
reduction kind of a move,"" he said, referring to the dollar's
broad rise against emerging Asian currencies. ""Positioning was
definitely quite stretched.""	
 Ji said the likelihood of further unwinding was making some
Asian assets less attractive.	
 ""While I still think the general USD weakness would linger
and provide a lift to risky assets, the trade-off in chasing
aggressively the strength in these assets has turned less
attractive or is dependent primarily on the extent of USD
weakness in the coming months,"" he said.	
 Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets were stung by weakness
in commodity-related shares as well as a glut of new equity
issuance. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.6 percent to a one-month
low and Shanghai's composite index slid 2.3 percent ,
with losses the most acute in cyclical sectors such as oil and
coal producers and metals and mining companies. 
 Glencore International AG , the world's largest
diversified commodities trader, set the price range for its
London and Hong Kong IPO, enabling it to raise up to $10
billion, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
[ID:nL3E7G407X] 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan
, which also has a strong correlation to silver
prices, fell 1.5 percent.	
 Japanese markets were closed for holidays.	
 Silver suffered its biggest two-day loss since October 2008,
dragging down gold and other commodities. After hitting an
all-time high within a whisker of $50 an ounce last Thursday,
spot prices were at $41.16 on Wednesday, down 1.2
percent. Gold was also down about 0.5 percent.	
 Oil prices were dragged down after data showed U.S. crude
stocks rose sharply last week, adding to concerns about demand
and gains in the dollar that helped spark a technical sell-off. 
 However, ICE Brent crude for June  fought back from
early deep losses and traded at $122.32 a barrel, nearly
unchanged on the day but still near Monday's low of $121.67.	
 In currency markets, euro/sterling was at 0.8990
, within striking distance of a 13-mth high of 0.9006
hit on Tuesday. The pair climbed one percent on Tuesday after
disappointing UK PMI data signalled that a rate hike may be
further away than expected.	
 In contrast, the European Central Bank is expected to signal
its readiness to raise interest rates after its policy meeting
on Thursday, and may prepare the market for a June hike.

 By Axel Bugge and Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, May 3 (Reuters) - Portugal agreed a three-year
78-billion-euro ($116 billion) bailout with the European Union
and IMF on Tuesday, making it the third euro zone country in a
year, after Ireland and Greece, to need financial help.
 Giving few details except that Portugal has more time to
meet budget deficit targets than previously promised by the
government, caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates warned:
 ""There are no financial assistance programmes that are not
demanding.""
 The deal is more complicated than Ireland's 85 billion euro
package, agreed last November, or Greece's 110 billion euro
programme agreed on May 2, 2010 -- a deal that looks
increasingly inadequate to shore up Greece's finances.
 Portugal for its part has high public sector debts, banking
problems and structural economic shortcomings, with rigid labour
markets and a costly state pension system.
 ""The Portuguese bailout is certainly not good enough,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, vice president for capital markets at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 ""What it is is very similar to the situation in Greece last
year where it's simply a band-aid. If you look at the plan that
was put in place for Greece, for Ireland, and now Portugal, none
of them really addressed the underlying fundamentals, which have
caused the problem,"" Salvaggio said.
 Portugal is also set to hold a parliamentary election on
June 5 after the previous government collapsed when its plans
for austerity measures were voted down by parliament. 
 The political limbo means the EU and IMF have negotiated a
deal with politicians looking for re-election. The caretaker
government will have to win the endorsement of major opposition
parties before agreeing any bailout deal.
 But even then, there is the risk that any package will not
be approved by all 17 countries in the euro zone. 
 Finland's likely next prime minister on Tuesday split the
issue of EU bailouts from talks on forming a government with the
True Finns and the Social Democrats, both against the bailout.
 Jyrki Katainen, whose National Coalition party won last
month's election, said he would delay formation of a government
and hoped instead to secure informal parliamentary approval for
the bailout before EU ministerial meetings on May 16 and 17.
 
 DEVIL IN THE DETAILS
 Few details were given on a deal Portugal has been
negotiating with the European Commission, the European Central
Bank and the International Monetary Fund for three weeks.
 Portugal's new deficit target is 5.9 percent of gross
domestic product this year, rather than the 4.6 percent target
of its existing austerity plan. The target is 4.5 percent next
year and 3 percent in 2013. A European Commission source said
the interest rate would be set by EU ministers on May 16.
 ""He showed us the bright side of the moon, it is the dark
side that remains to be seen, and that includes the interest
rate,"" said Filipe Garcia, head of Informacao de Mercados
Financeiros consultants in Porto.
 Meanwhile the deal struck with Greece exactly one year ago
looked to be unravelling.
 Greece's finance minister said on Monday he hoped Athens
might get more time to repay the EU/IMF bailout loans, already
extended from three to seven years, at a lower rate.
 Greece's sovereign debt is set to rise to 340 billion euros,
or 150 percent of annual output, this year, a debt that it looks
unable to finance without a massive pick-up in growth or one-off
income from privatisations.
 Michael Meister, deputy parliamentary leader of Germann
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said he saw
logic in extending the repayment schedule.
 On Monday, European Central Bank policymaker Nout Wellink
said he was open to the idea of extending maturities on all
Greek debt -- the first senior ECB official to admit the
possibility of a restructuring publicly.
 ""The direction of the debate is sensible,"" Meister told
Reuters, adding that any softening of the terms would not come
without a 'quid pro quo' down the line. ""For further aid, Greece
must also offer additional measures,"" he said.
 European Union and IMF inspectors are in Greece to assess
whether its new austerity plans are tough enough, a review that
could determine whether the loan terms are changed.
 A restructuring would alarm bondholders, who include many
major French and German banks and the European Central Bank.
Seventy percent of Greece's debt is owned by foreign
institutions.
 Under the umbrella of ""debt restructuring"", there are
various options, ranging from writing down the value of the debt
by a set amount, known as a haircut, to rescheduling when the
debt will be repaid, which is a softer form.
 But Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said that any
restructuring would be a disastrous mistake.
 ""It would have a very big cost and we would not have the
benefit, we would stay out of markets for 10-15 years, the
wealth of Greek pension funds would suffer writedowns, we would
have problems in the banking system and hence the real economy.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The euro was up slightly
against the dollar on Tuesday in choppy trading and seen likely
to post further gains this week amid strong institutional
buying as investors ratcheted up expectations of more euro zone
rate hikes.
 Weakness in stocks and commodities, however, has capped
gains in the euro with investors paring back risky trades given
fears of a geopolitical backlash following the death of al
Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
 The euro, along with the Australian and Canadian dollars,
tends to fall when there is heightened risk aversion in the
market.
 But the focus was seen squarely on divergent rate
expectations between the European Central Bank and Federal
Reserve.
 ""I think the market has discounted for the moment European
debt risk and the market is focused on what the Fed intends to
do and what the ECB is doing,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice
president for capital markets at Tempus Consulting. ""The ECB is
currently hiking rates. The Fed, on the other hand, is actually
delayed in any course of action that would raise rates. That
should keep the euro above $1.47 at least.""
 Before a key European Central Bank meeting on Thursday,
euro-priced, bank-to-bank lending rates hit their highest
levels in two years on Tuesday.
 The three-month Euribor rate  -- traditionally
the key gauge of unsecured interbank euro lending, rate
expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to 1.402
percent on Tuesday, the highest since April 2009 and up from
1.395 percent on Monday. For details, see [ID:nLDE7420U9]
 The ECB raised rates last month for the first time since
2008 and is expected to do so again this year, though traders
expect it to stand pat when it meets this week.
 Portugal's announcement late in the afternoon that it has
reached a three-year bailout loan with the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund drew little reaction from the
euro. According to sources, the deal was placed at 78 billion
euros ($116 billion). [ID:nLIS002659] [ID:nLSB001099]
 However, Tempus' Salvaggio was skeptical about the Portugal
deal.
 ""What it is is very similar to the situation in Greece last
year where it's simply a Band-Aid. If you look at the plan that
was put in place for Greece, for Ireland, and now Portugal,
none of them really addressed the underlying fundamentals,
which have caused the problem,"" he said.
 Further squeezing shorts on the euro built after hitting a
17-month high, traders said, was an influential think-tank
report, saying the ECB will likely raise interest rates to 2
percent this year from 1.25 percent. That's about three further
rate increases this year, one more than what was expected.
 Among major currencies, only sterling was down sharply
against the dollar, falling after weak factory data cast doubt
on when the Bank of England would lift interest rates. The
pound fell nearly 1.0 percent to $1.6487 .
 In late afternoon trading, the euro was up slightly at
$1.4833 , more than a cent above its session low and near
Monday's 17-month high above $1.49. It rose 1.0 percent against
sterling to 89.94 pence .
 Implied volatility in one-month euro/dollar options rose to
more than 11 percent  on Tuesday from 10.65 percent on
Monday, reflecting heightened uncertainty as to the timing of
next ECB rate increase.
 The dollar had earlier posted broad gains as investors took
profits after weeks of steady selling took it to a three-year
low against major currencies on Monday <.DXY>. But by late
morning, it was either flat or weaker against all major
currencies save sterling.
 The dollar has lost nearly 8 percent against major
currencies this year -- almost 4 percent in April alone -- and
that prompted profit-taking overnight.
 Some analysts have tied the retreat of higher-yield
currencies and assets such as oil to fears of reprisal after
U.S. special forces killed Bin Laden, but David Watt, currency
strategist at RBC Capital said that sounded like ""an excuse to
take profits.""
 The dollar hit a record low of 0.8595 Swiss franc
. It was last at 0.8609, down 0.4 percent.
 The Australian dollar fell after the central bank left
rates at 4.75 percent and sounded a bit less hawkish than
expected. It last traded at US$1.0855 , down 0.8
percent, but not far from Monday's $1.1011, its highest in
nearly three decades.

 By Barani Krishnan and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Commodities suffered their
biggest one-day loss in two weeks on Tuesday, pulling stocks on
Wall Street down as well, after fear that huge price gains last
month had made everything from oil to silver too costly.
 The dollar's rebound after a 10-day slide was a catalyst to
the selloff. The greenback was volatile, rising as U.S. markets
opened, then falling at midday before surging again toward the
close.
 Analysts said the dollar swung on concerns that it may have
been oversold to a three-year low while stocks and commodities
marched to some of their biggest gains in April.
 ""You've had a tremendous run-up here, so you've got some
profit-taking and an underlying rotation"" out of commodity
shares into more defensive sectors, said Paul Mendelsohn, chief
investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte, Vermont.
 ""My modeling tells me (commodities) are very, very
overextended,"" which means a pullback in commodity sectors may
be due, he said.
 Shares on Wall Street extended losses in afternoon trading,
with technology stocks falling more than 1 percent.
 Oil prices slid up to 3 percent, ending sharply off
Monday's 31-month highs of above $114 a barrel in New York
 and above $126 per barrel in London . The selloff
began early in the session, after a higher-than-expected
interest rate hike by India, and accelerated in the afternoon.
[O/R]
 Analysts said oil could be headed even lower.
 ""I think this market has gotten way ahead of itself,"" said
Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. ""I can see this market easily dropping back below
$100. We'll seen build after build after build.""
 Gold  fell more than half a percent on the day and
about 2 percent off Monday's record highs of above $1,575 an
ounce. Traders said the dollar's rebound took away some of
gold's luster as an alternative currency. [GOL/]
 While the volatile dollar was certainly a factor for
Tuesday's liquidation in commodities, analysts said some of the
selling could be due to smaller markets such as silver ,
which fell nearly 6 percent in value as it retreated sharply
from recent record highs near $50 per ounce.
""We are seeing accelerated margin selling in silver ... and
it's spilling over into gold and crude oil. When you have big
margin selling in one commodity, it has a cascading impact on
the markets,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner at New Jersey's LOGIC
Advisers.
 Robust corporate earnings in the United States and Europe
have buoyed equities recently, though some investors say the
market is reaching overbought levels. High commodity prices,
sparked by a weak dollar and supply worries, have also raised
concern about company margins.
 U.S. stocks were trading lower at 3:52 p.m. EDT (1952 GMT).
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 9.04 points,
or 0.07 percent, at 12,798.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 5.41 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,355.81. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 24.24 points, or 0.85
percent, at 2,839.84.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> shed 1 percent after five sessions of gains,
and the emerging share index <.MSCIEF> lost 1.7 percent to a
two-week low. The MSCI world gauge gained 3.9 percent last
month, and is up about 7.5 percent so far this year.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> was
down 0.9 percent, posting its largest one-day loss since April
18.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the dollar against a
basket of major currencies, settled up 0.3 percent after
falling 0.4 percent earlier in the session.
 A Reuters poll on Tuesday showed that investors have pulled
back some of their exposure to equities acquired in April,
buying bonds and turning to safe-haven cash amid worries that
global economic growth could falter from its rapid pace.
 Investors are facing uncertain times regarding interest
rates, with the European Central Bank having already tightened
and the Bank of England under pressure to follow suit. India's
bigger-than-expected hike of 50 basis points in interest rates
on Tuesday spooked investors. [ID:nL3E7G30NW]
 In the United States, the Federal Reserve has committed to
keeping extraordinarily low rates while signaling that its $600
billion bond purchase program will end as scheduled in June.
 ""The most uncertainty is probably about future economic
policy. ... A slowdown while policy is being tightened may be
unnerving for investors used to three years of very easy policy
conditions,"" said Chris Paine, associate director for asset

 By Glenn Somerville and Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - China is showing more policy
flexibility as its economic star rises, although it still needs
to allow for a more market-driven exchange rate, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday.
 Speaking before the U.S.-China Business Council ahead of
top-level talks with Chinese officials in Washington next week,
Geithner cited ""promising signs"" that Beijing is altering its
former rigid policies.
 ""You can see that in the exchange rate, which two years ago
was frozen and now is moving again, gradually moving again,
against the dollar,"" he said. U.S. companies that compete with
Chinese firms have long complained that China kept the value of
the yuan unfairly low.
 Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will
co-chair two days of talks next Monday and Tuesday with China's
Vice Premier Wang Qishan and State Councilor Dai Bingguo. The
once-a-year Strategic and Economic Dialogue covers various
economic and diplomatic issues.
 The currency issue has been central to U.S.-China
discussions for years. Washington believes that Beijing is now
more willing to let it rise because it needs to do so to keep a
curb on inflation.
 In the past, Beijing has resisted and said it will reform
its currency practices at its own speed. Geithner suggested
China needs to reassess that policy.
 ""There are risks in gradualism, not just risks in moving,
and China has to figure out how to balance those risks,"" he
said.
 The Peoples Bank of China guided the yuan up by 0.9 percent
in April compared with 0.4 percent in March, accelerating its
appreciation at a time when the dollar has fallen to three-year
lows against a basket of currencies.
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it increasingly clear
they are willing to use the currency as a means to fight
inflation, which hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March,
boosted by surging global commodity prices.
 The U.S. Treasury was to issue a semi-annual report on
April 15 on currency practices of U.S. trade partners that, in
theory, could have labeled China a foreign exchange
manipulator.
 The report has been delayed indefinitely and signs are the
Obama administration will keep urging Beijing to let its
currency appreciate but avoid harsher actions such as saying
that China deliberately keeps the yuan undervalued to gain a
trade edge.
 ""Our judgment is that it would be better for the world,
more fair for us and I think in China's interest to let the
exchange rate appreciate more rapidly than they've been doing,""
Geithner said. ""Hopefully they'll make that same judgment and
feel more confident now as they see inflation accelerating.""

 By Barani Krishnan and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - A volatile U.S. dollar kept
markets on edge on Tuesday, pressuring stocks and commodities,
as investors tried to balance the currency's weak outlook with
the notion that some markets have risen too much.
 The dollar rose as U.S. markets opened, then fell by midday
before rising again in late trading. The greenback swung on
concerns that it may have been oversold to a three-year low
while stocks and commodities marched to some of their biggest
gains last month.
 ""You've had a tremendous run-up here, so you've got some
profit-taking and an underlying rotation"" out of commodity
shares into more defensive sectors, said Paul Mendelsohn, chief
investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte, Vermont.
 ""My modeling tells me (commodities) are very, very
overextended,"" which means a pullback in commodity sectors may
be due, he said.
 Shares on Wall Street extended losses in afternoon trading,
with technology stocks falling more than 1 percent.
 Oil slid about 3 percent, sharply off from Monday's
31-month highs of above $114 a barrel in New York  and
above $126 per barrel in London . The sell-off began
early in the session, after a higher-than-expected interest
rate hike by India, and accelerated in the afternoon. [O/R]
 Gold fell about 2 percent from record highs of above $1,575
an ounce the previous session. Traders said the dollar's
rebound took away some of gold's luster as an alternative
currency. [GOL/]
 While the volatile dollar was certainly a factor for
Tuesday's liquidation in commodities, analysts said some of the
selling could be due to smaller markets such as silver ,
which fell nearly 5 percent in value as it retreated sharply
from recent record highs near $50 per ounce.
""We are seeing accelerated margin selling in silver ... and
it's spilling over into gold and crude oil. When you have big
margin selling in one commodity, it has a cascading impact on
the markets,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner at New Jersey's LOGIC
Advisers.
 Robust corporate earnings in the United States and Europe
have buoyed equities recently, though some investors say the
market is reaching overbought levels. High commodity prices,
sparked by a weak dollar and supply worries, have also raised
concern about company margins.
 U.S. stocks were trading lower by 2:03 p.m. EDT (1803 GMT).
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 25.01 points,
or 0.20 percent, at 12,782.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 7.91 points, or 0.58 percent, at 1,353.31. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 31.19 points, or 1.09
percent, at 2,832.89.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> shed 1 percent after five sessions of gains,
and the emerging share index <.MSCIEF> lost 1.7 percent to a
two-week low. The MSCI world gauge gained 3.9 percent last
month, and is up about 7.5 percent so far this year.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> was
down 1 percent, heading for its largest one-day loss since
April 12.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the dollar against a
basket of major currencies, was up 0.03 percent versus an
earlier gain of 0.2 percent.
 U.S. government debt prices rose initially in anticipation
of a lower supply of Treasury paper before paring gains. [US/]
 Investors pulled back some of their exposure to equities
acquired in April, buying bonds and turning to safe-haven cash
amid worries that global economic growth could falter from its
rapid pace, Reuters polls showed on Tuesday.
 Investors are facing uncertain times regarding interest
rates, with the European Central Bank having already tightened
and the Bank of England under pressure to follow suit. India's
bigger-than-expected hike of 50 basis points in interest rates
on Tuesday spooked investors. [ID:nL3E7G30NW]
 In the United States, the Federal Reserve has committed to
keeping extraordinarily low rates while signaling that its $600
billion bond purchase program will end as scheduled in June.
 ""The most uncertainty is probably about future economic
policy. ... A slowdown while policy is being tightened may be
unnerving for investors used to three years of very easy policy
conditions,"" said Chris Paine, associate director for asset
allocation at Henderson Global Investors in London.
 Reuters' poll of 56 leading investment houses in the United

 * Syrian pound weakened slightly to 51 to dollar from 49 
 * Baraka bank to open five new branches this week in Syria
 
 By Mariam Karouny
 BEIRUT, May 3 (Reuters) - Syria's unrest has prompted the
conversion of up to seven or eight percent of local currency
into dollars but this was a limited move and Syrian banks are in
a healthy state, the chairman of the Union of Arab banks said on
Tuesday.
 ""We have noticed there have been some withdrawals of Syrian
pounds (that) have been changed to dollars but it was limited
and the money did not leave the country,"" Adnan Yousif told
Reuters in an interview.
 ""It was not big, not more than 7 or 8 percent. The Syrians
banks are good, they are in a good position. The central bank
has also pumped money into the market. This is a wise policy.""
 ""All what happened is that it fluctuated ... there has been
a minor weakening of the lira (the Syrian pound) and it went
from 49 to 51 lira to dollar, whhich means that the latest
events did not have a strong impact on it.""
 The Union of Arab Banks which Yousif heads is based in
Beirut and comprises more than 300 Arab financial and banking
institutions.
 Yousif, a Bahraini, is also the chief executive officer of
the Bahraini Islamic bank al-Baraka, which operates in Syria
which he visited last week.
 Pro-democracy protests have swept the country in the past
six weeks and sometimes turned violent, claiming the lives of
more than 500 people so far. Syrian authorities have arrested
more than a thousand people in the past two days.
 ""I have checked with the banks today and the withdrawals
have stopped ... They told me that the deposits did not change,""
Yousif said.
 The unrest had not changed his bank's business plans to open
five new branches this week, he said.
 ""We are going to open five branches in the next two days.
The branches will be in Homs, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo. What is
happening there did not change our plans,"" he said.
 Syria has been slowly opening up its economy after decades
of socialist practices, ending its monopoly on the banking
sector eight years ago. 
 Around 14 privately-owned banks and six government banks
operate in Syria. Government banks still have a dominant share
of the market, although most non-government business goes to the
private banks.
 Bankers say Syria, a country of 20 million people with one
bank branch for every 45,000 people, is ready for more banks. In
Lebanon it is around a branch for every 5,000 people and in
Jordan it is 10,000 per branch.
But U.S. sanctions, first imposed on Syria in 2004, have
discouraged Western investors from doing business.
 Total assets in the banking sector amount to 2 trillion
Syrian pounds ($43 billion), a small sum compared with
neighboring countries. Syrian state-owned banks hold around
three-quarters of the assets.

 * Dollar rebound fades, euro, Swiss franc rise
 * Sterling slumps; weak data casts doubt on rate hikes
 * Rate outlook, fiscal issues leave dollar vulnerable
 (Recasts, updates prices, adds detail, comment)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar was near a 17-month
trough against the euro and hit a record low against the Swiss
franc on Tuesday as expectations U.S. interest rates would stay
low indefinitely dulled demand for the greenback.
 Among major currencies, only sterling was down sharply
against the dollar, falling after weak factory data cast doubt
on when the Bank of England would lift interest rates.
 The European Central Bank raised rates last month for the
first time since 2008 and is expected to do so again this year,
though traders expect it to stand pat when it meets this week.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.4874, more than a cent
above its session low and near Monday's 17-month high above
$1.49. It rose 1.1 percent to 89.94 pence.
 ""The story has been about divergent rate expectations,""
said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov. ""The Fed is on
hold and now the BoE may be coming out of the picture. The ECB
is uniquely the only major central bank expected to raise
rates, and that benefits the euro.""
 The dollar had earlier posted broader gains as investors
took profits after weeks of steady selling took it to a
three-year low against major currencies on Monday.
 But by late morning, it was either flat or weaker against
all major currencies save sterling.
 ""The backdrop hasn't changed, and there's really no trigger
for a sustained (dollar) rally,"" said David Watt, currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The dollar has lost nearly 8 percent against major
currencies this year -- almost 4 percent in April alone -- and
that prompted a brief bit of profit-taking overnight
 Some analysts have tied the retreat of higher-yield
currencies and assets such as oil to fears of reprisal after
U.S. special forces killed Osama bin Laden, but Watt said that
sounded like ""an excuse to take profits.""
 The dollar hit a record low of 0.8595 Swiss francs and shed
0.3 percent to trade at 80.98 yen. The Swiss and Japanese
currencies often rise when risk appetite fades.
 But the U.S. currency hardly looks ready to stage a
sustained rally, analysts said, particularly with the U.S.
central bank hinting that interest rates will remain at zero
for some time and with markets fretting about Washington's
ability to get a yawning federal budget deficit under control.
 Emerging market currencies, which unlike some majors are
far from overvalued against the dollar, will also continue to
appreciate, which will keep the dollar under pressure.
 BNP Paribas strategists said a euro retreat below $1.47,
may prove an opportunity for traders to ""look for even better
levels to re-set dollar shorts"" ahead of Thursday's ECB policy
meeting and Friday's U.S. employment data.
 Hawkish comments about inflation from the ECB and any sign
of slower U.S. job growth on Friday could add to dollar
selling, they said.
 ""It's very much a case of buying the dips in euro/dollar at
these levels. Rate hike expectations are anchoring the euro,""
said Chris Walker, currency strategist at UBS in
London.
 The Australian dollar fell after the central bank left
interest rates at 4.75 percent but sounded a bit less hawkish
than expected. But it recovered from session lows and was last
down just 0.2 percent at $1.0916, not far from Monday's
$1.1011, its highest level in nearly three decades.
 The Canadian dollar rose up modestly after Canada's ruling
Conservatives won a crushing victory in the federal election.

 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - A brief rebound in the U.S.
dollar pushed stocks and commodities lower on Tuesday, but the
greenback's resurgence was short-lived as investors sold the
dollar's rally.
 Still, investors fearing risk assets had risen too much,
too fast, channeled some money back into cash and bonds as
stocks and commodities ran sharply higher through April.
 The dollar erased earlier gains against the euro and hit a
record low against the Swiss franc on Tuesday, as expectations
that U.S. interest rates would remain at record lows dulled
demand for the greenback.
 Oil fell more than 1 percent, backing away from 31-month
highs, after India's interest rate hike to clamp down on
inflation further doused the rally in energy markets.
 Gold slipped over 2 percent from the record highs of the
previous session as the greenback's rebound took away some of
the shiny metal's luster as an alternative to currencies.
 U.S. government debt prices rose initially in anticipation
of lower supply of Treasury paper before paring gains.
 Investors pulled back some of their exposure to equities
garnered in April, buying bonds and turning to safe-haven cash
amid worries that global economic growth could falter from its

last months we are expecting to see a flattening in the market

(Releads, adds details on ownership of Greek debt)
 By Andreas Rinke and George Georgiopoulos
 BERLIN/ATHENS, May 3 (Reuters) - An influential member of
Germany's governing coalition backed the possibility on Tuesday
of easing the terms of Greece's euro zone bailout, a move that
might help Athens better weather the debt crisis.
 Michael Meister, deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor
Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said he saw logic in
extending the repayment schedule for the 110 billion euros of
loans granted to Greece on May 2, 2010.
 His intervention followed European Central Bank policymaker
Nout Wellink, who said on Monday he was open to the idea of
extending maturities on all Greek debt, becoming the first
senior ECB official to admit the possibility of a restructuring
publicly.
 ""The direction of the debate is sensible,"" Meister told
Reuters, adding that any softening of the terms would not come
without a 'quid pro quo' down the line. ""For further aid, Greece
must also offer additional measures,"" he said.
 Greece's finance minister said on Monday he hoped Athens
might get more time to repay the EU/IMF bailout loans -- already
extended from three to seven years -- at a lower interest rate.
 European Union and IMF inspectors are in Greece to assess
whether the country's new austerity plans are tough enough, a
review that could determine whether the loan terms are changed.
 If they were to be altered, it could help Greece better
manage its massive sovereign debt pile, which is set to rise to
340 billion euros, or 150 percent of annual output, this year.
 Without a massive pick up in growth or one-off income from
privatisations, Greece is not expected to be able to finance its
debts, which means a restructuring of some kind or another is
probable.
 That would alarm bondholders, who include many major French
and German banks and the European Central Bank -- 70 percent of
Greece's debt is owned by foreign institutions.
 Two German government advisers said last week a Greek
restructuring was inevitable, and financial markets appear to
hold a similar view.
 Yields on Greek 2-year government bonds now stand around 25
percent -- an unsustainable figure that implies Greece cannot
finance itself without at least rescheduling some repayments.
 Under the umbrella ""debt restructuring"" there are various
options, ranging from writing down the value of the debt by a
set amount, known as a haircut, to rescheduling when the debt
will be repaid, which is a softer form.
 JP Morgan said the likelihood of a Greek restructuring this
year was rising, although it was not guaranteed.
 ""We are not yet ready to forecast that a debt restructuring
will occur this year, but we have to recognise that the risk has
risen relative to our baseline assumption that any decisions
about debt restructuring would be delayed until 2013,"" it said.
 But Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on Tuesday
any restructuring would be a disastrous mistake.
 ""It would have a very big cost and we would not have the
benefit, we would stay out of markets for 10-15 years, the
wealth of Greek pension funds would suffer writedowns, we would
have problems in the banking system and hence the real economy.""
 
 LISBON BAILOUT NEAR?
 In Portugal, EU and IMF experts are expected to wind up
nearly three weeks of negotiation over Lisbon's bailout in the
next day or two, sources in Portugal said.
 Euro zone officials say Portugal is likely to need about 80
billion euros of assistance, but Portuguese newspaper Diario
Economico reported on Tuesday the figure could be greater than
100 billion euros ($148 billion), including up to 10 billion
euros in aid for Portugal's banks.
 The newspaper did not cite any sources but said the banking
sector needed at least 5.3 billion euros to cover a hole left by
the failure of BPN, a bank nationalised in 2008, as well as
additional funds to help banks raise their capital ratios.
 Officials in Brussels have described Portugal's bailout as
more complicated than either that of Ireland, which received 85
billion euros last November, or Greece, which agreed its 110
billion euro programme on May 2, 2010.
 The problem for Lisbon is that it has high public sector
debts, banking problems and structural economic shortcomings,
including rigid labour markets and a costly state pension
system, all of which require attention in the same package.
 At the same time, the country is to hold a parliamentary
election on June 5 following the resignation of the previous
government, which collapsed when its plans for austerity
measures were voted down by the parliament. 
 The political limbo means the EU and IMF are negotiating
with politicians who are thinking about re-election. The
caretaker government will have to win the endorsement of major
opposition parties before agreeing any bailout deal.
 But even then, there is the risk that any package will not
be approved by all 17 countries in the euro zone. 
 Finland, where the eurosceptic True Finns party came third
in a parliamentary election last month, would likely find it
impossible to back the bailout if the True Finns end up being in
the next governing coalition.
 Jyrki Katainen, whose right-leaning party came top in the
polls and who is expected to be the next prime minister, is to
begin formal coalition talks on May 18.
 The True Finns have said definitively that they will not
support a bailout of Portugal, a position that may rule them out
of government. But it is still unclear whether Finland will be
able to form a government that backs Portugal's bailout in time
for Lisbon to receive the money it needs by a June 15 deadline.

 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Stocks on major markets fell on
Tuesday as investors locked in profits after a five-session
winning streak, while the U.S. dollar paused after a ten day
slide and commodity prices mostly slipped also.
 Robust corporate earnings in the United States and Europe
have buoyed equities recently, though some investors say the
market is reaching overbought levels. High commodity prices,
sparked by a weak dollar and supply worries, have also raised
concern about company margins.
 The dollar edged off a three-year low against major
currencies as sellling, based on loose U.S monetary policy, ran
out of steam. The trend for a weaker dollar, however, remains
intact, traders said.

 DOLLAR BOUNCES
 The strength in the dollar eroded investors's risk appetite
for commodities as copper prices  eased 0.6 percent and
Brent crude  lost 1.1 percent to trade below $124 a
barrel. U.S. crude  fell 0.8 percent.
 Analysts said the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden
could reduce the threat against the United States in the long
term, but the potential for retaliatory attacks in the short
term would support oil prices.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the dollar against a
basket of major currencies, was up 0.2 percent after hitting a
three-year trough on Monday.
 Sentiment for the dollar has been overwhelmingly bearish as
near zero U.S. interest rates have made it the funding currency
of choice in carry trades.
 ""In the near term, the dollar's fall could extend further
still but levels are now becoming more stretched in terms of
valuation and positioning. Momentum indicators are also showing
the dollar is very oversold,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
strategist at BTM-UFJ in London.
 The Australian dollar  dipped 0.5 percent to
$1.0872, pulling back from a post-float high of $1.1012 set on
Monday, after the country's central bank kept interest rates
unchanged at 4.75 percent as expected. The Canadian dollar
earlier rose after the ruling Conservatives won a crushing
victory in a federal election.
 The euro  was down 0.1 percent at $1.4811, though
still up more than 10 percent against the dollar this year.
 Credit Suisse said in a note that the common currency could
appreciate another 5 to 10 percent before it became a problem
for the euro zone economy.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar on Tuesday rebounded
from a three-year low as investors booked profits after four
weeks of steady selling, but traders said the respite was
likely to be brief because of an extended run of low U.S.
interest rates.
 The Australian dollar moved further away from a post-float
high above $1.10 and sterling fell after weak factory data cast
doubt on when the Bank of England would lift interest rates.
 The European Central Bank raised rates last month for the
first time since 2008 and is expected to do so again this year,
though traders expect it to stand pat when it meets this week.
 Traders said these developments coupled with the speed of
the dollar's decline -- it has lost almost 8 percent against
major currencies this year, losing nearly 4 percent in April --
prompted investors to unwind some bets against the currency.
 ""The market is exceptionally short and the dollar's move
lower over the past few weeks has been so exceptionally quick
that it simply couldn't continue like that,"" said David Watt,
senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 73.100 against a basket of
major currencies <.DXY> after falling to a three-year low of
72.722 on Monday. It hit a record low of 70.698 in 2008.
 Some analysts have tied the retreat of higher-yield
currencies and assets such as oil and other commodities to
fears of reprisal after U.S. special forces killed Osama bin
Laden, but Watt said that sounded like ""an excuse to take
profits.""
 The dollar hit a record low at 0.8615 Swiss francs 
and shed 0.6 percent to trade at 80.71 yen . The Swiss
and Japanese currencies often rise when risk appetite fades.
 But the dollar hardly looks ready to stage a sustained
rally, analysts said, particularly with the U.S. central bank
hinting that interest rates will remain at zero for some time
and with markets fretting about the U.S. ability to get a
yawning federal budget deficit under control.
 Emerging market currencies, which unlike some majors are
far from overvalued against the dollar, will also continue to
appreciate, which will keep the dollar under pressure.
 ""The backdrop hasn't changed, and there's really no trigger
for a sustained (dollar) rally,"" Watt said.
 After falling as low as $1.4751 overnight, the euro was
last at $1.4820 , unchanged on the day and within
striking distance of Monday's 17-month high above $1.49.
 BNP Paribas strategists said the euro could retreat below
$1.47, at which point traders ""may well be able to look for
even better levels to re-set dollar shorts"" ahead of Thursday's
ECB policy meeting and Friday's U.S. employment data.
 Hawkish comments about inflation from the ECB and any sign
of slower U.S. job growth on Friday could reignite dollar
selling, they said.
 ""It's very much a case of buying the dips in euro/dollar at
these levels. Rate hike expectations are anchoring the euro,""
said Chris Walker, currency strategist at UBS in London.

 LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar edged off three-year
lows on Tuesday as a build-up of bets to sell it based on loose
U.S monetary policy ran out of steam, though gains against the
euro were capped by good demand on dips for the shared currency.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance against a
basket of major currencies, was last up 0.5 percent at 73.296,
still not far off a three-year low of 72.722 hit this week. Its
decline in the past few weeks has taken it ever closer to a
record low of 70.698 set in March 2008.
 The dollar slipped to a record low against the Swiss franc
around 0.8615 francs, slipping under Friday's low of 0.8626.
 The fact currency speculators have already piled up bets
against the dollar means it could get a lift if short-covering
sets in.
 ""In the near term the dollar's fall could extend further
still but levels are now becoming more stretched in terms of
valuation and positioning. Momentum indicators are also showing
the dollar is very oversold,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4772 after falling to
$1.4751 in early European trade. Dealers reported good demand to
buy into the $1.4750 zone.
 ""It's very much a case of buying the dips in euro/dollar at
these levels. Rate hike expectations are anchoring the euro,""
said Chris Walker, currency strategist at UBS in London.
 The single currency hit a 17-month high of $1.4903 on
Monday on trading platform EBS on the view that euro zone
interest rate would be raised again this year, in contrast to an
ultra-loose outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
 Surging energy costs drove euro zone producer price
inflation to its highest level in 2-1/2 years in March,
strengthening the case for more interest rate rises.
 
 STERLING KNOCKED
 Sterling fell to its lowest level since March 2010 against
the euro at 89.80 pence after a survey of UK manufacturing came
in below market expectations. The pound also shed over half a
U.S. cent to trade at $1.6468 against the dollar.
 ""Core UK data has begun to disappoint to the downside. It
seems like all bets are off for a UK rate hike until year-end,""
said Walker at UBS.
 The Canadian dollar pared gains after a brief relief rally
as Canada's ruling Conservatives won a crushing victory in the
federal election.
 The U.S. dollar was last at C$0.9538, up around 0.4 percent
on the day after slipping to C$0.9460 in overnight trade.
 The Australian dollar dipped after Australia's central bank
kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent as expected. The
Reserve Bank of Australia said underlying inflation looked to
have bottomed and would increase somewhat as the economy
strengthened, sounding a little less hawkish than some analysts
had expected.
 The Aussie dollar last stood at $1.0859, having dipped from
around $1.0920 after the RBA's decision.
 Sentiment for the U.S. dollar has been overwhelmingly
bearish as ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has made it the
funding currency of choice in popular carry trades that helped
propel the Aussie to a 29-year high of $1.1012 on Monday.
 The dollar hit a one-month low around 80.79 yen in late
morning trade, with the yen helped by a broad fall in global
equity markets.

970,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2011 07:28AM ET</span>","WRAPUP 1-Year after bailout, Greece rejects debt restructuring"," * Greece remains adamant about no debt restructuring
 * Portugal bailout negotiations seen concluding in days
 * Doubts remain over Finland's backing for Lisbon aid
 
 By George Georgiopoulos and Andrei Khalip
 ATHENS/LISBON, May 3 (Reuters) - Greece insisted on Tuesday
any restructuring of its debts would be a disaster for the
economy, but financial markets continue to view it as likely and
are betting that the euro zone debt crisis will worsen.
 In Portugal, European Union and International Monetary Fund
experts pursued negotiations over a bailout with Lisbon's
caretaker government, with one newspaper that the headline
figure could end up being substantially higher than expected.
 A year and a day since the EU and IMF agreed to extend
Greece 110 billion euros ($163 billion) in loans in exchange for
deep structural adjustments to its economy, the finance minister
again dismissed growing suggestions that Athens will have to
restructure its debts, which are set to hit 150 percent of
annual output, or around 340 billion euros, this year.
 ""A restructuring, haircuts on debt, would be a huge mistake
for the country,"" Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou told
state television as EU and IMF inspectors began a new visit to
assess if the government's austerity plans are sufficient.
 ""It would have a very big cost and we would not have the
benefit, we would stay out of markets for 10-15 years, the
wealth of Greek pension funds would suffer writedowns, we would
have problems in the banking system and hence the real economy.""
 Despite the minister's insistence, two German government
advisers said last week a restructuring of the debt pile, which
is only increasing as Greece's output contracts, was now
inevitable, and markets hold the same view.
 European Central Bank policymaker Nout Wellink said on
Monday he was open to the idea of extending maturities on Greek
debt, becoming the first senior ECB official to admit that
possibility publicly.
 JP Morgan said the likelihood of a Greek restructuring this
year was rising, although it was not guaranteed.
 ""We are not yet ready to forecast that a debt restructuring
will occur this year, but we have to recognise that the risk has
risen relative to our baseline assumption that any decisions
about debt restructuring would be delayed until 2013,"" it said.
 Yields on Greek 10-year government bonds now stand at 15.5
percent, nearly 12 percentage points higher than equivalent
German bonds, a stark measure of the extra risk investors take
on by holding Greek sovereign debt.
 An even clearer illustration that some form of debt
restructuring is inevitable can be seen in the two-year bonds,
which are yielding 25.7 percent -- an unsustainable figure that
implies Greece cannot but reschedule some repayments.
 Under the umbrella term ""debt restructuring"" there are
various options, ranging from writing down the value of the debt
by a set amount, known as a haircut, to rescheduling when the
debt will be repaid, which is a softer form of restructuring.
 While Greece is adamant that there will be no haircuts, a
move that would alarm bondholders including many of Europe's
biggest banks and the European Central Bank, some form of
rescheduling is a possibility, euro zone sources have said.
 ""It's very difficult to imagine what else Greece can do,"" a
euro zone finance official said last week. ""Without growth, its
debts just keep growing. If it's going to get back on top of
them, it's got to reschedule at some point.""
 
 PORTUGAL BAILOUT GROWING?
 In Portugal, EU and IMF experts are expected to conclude
nearly three weeks of negotiations over Lisbon's bailout in the
coming days, sources have said. Officials have said Portugal
is likely to need about 80 billion euros of assistance, but
Portuguese newspaper Diario Economico reported on Tuesday the
figure could be greater than 100 billion euros ($148 billion),
including up to 10 billion euros in aid for Portugal's banks.
 The newspaper did not cite any sources but said the banking
sector needed at least 5.3 billion euros to cover a hole left by
the failure of BPN, a bank nationalised in 2008, as well as
additional funds to help banks raise their capital ratios.
 Officials in Brussels have described Portugal's bailout as
more complicated than either that of Ireland, which received 85
billion euros last November, or Greece, which received agreed
its 110 billion euro programme on May 2, 2010.
 The problem for Lisbon is that it has high public sector
debts, banking problems and structural economic shortcomings,
including rigid labour markets and a costly state pension
system, all of which require attention in the same package.
 At the same time, the country is to hold a parliamentary
election on June 5 following the resignation of the previous
government, which collapsed when its plans for austerity
measures were voted down by the parliament. 
 The political impasse means the EU and IMF are negotiating
with caretakers -- at a time when politicians are thinking about
voters and their own re-election. The caretaker government will
have to win the endorsement of major opposition parties before
agreeing to any euro zone bailout deal.
 But even then, there is the risk that any package will not
be approved by all 17 countries in the euro zone. 
 Finland, where the eurosceptic True Finns party came third
in a parliamentary election last month, would likely find it
impossible to back the bailout if the True Finns end up being in
the next governing coalition.
 Jyrki Katainen, whose right-leaning party came top in the
polls and who is expected to be the next prime minister, began
preliminary talks with potential coalition partners on Tuesday.
 The True Finns have said definitively that they will not
support a bailout of Portugal, a position that may rule them out
of government. But it is still unclear whether Finland will be
able to form a government that backs Portugal's bailout in time
for Lisbon to receive the money it needs by a June 15 deadline.

 LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Investors pulled back some of
their exposure to equities in April, buying bonds and turning to
safe-haven cash amid worries that global economic growth could
falter from its rapid pace, Reuters polls showed on Tuesday.
 Surveys of 56 leading investment houses in the United
States, Europe ex-UK, Japan and Britain showed exposure to
stocks falling to 51.3 percent in the month from 52.6 percent in
March. [ASSET/WRAP]
 Bonds rose slightly to 34.6 percent from 34.0 while cash was
lifted to 5.1 percent in a balanced portfolio from 4.7 percent a
month earlier.
 It was the highest exposure to cash -- where investors park
money in times of uncertainty -- since September, around the
time stock markets began rallying on prospects for renewed asset
buying by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Interviews with poll participants suggested a degree of
concern has grown about the impact of a rising oil price on
growth that may also be peaking.
 ""We're moving into seasonally weak conditions (for equities)
with May and June here, and the macro story may be at risk if
oil prices shoot to $130 per barrel or so. There are too many
things that can go wrong,"" said Keith Wirtz, chief investment
officer at U.S. firm Fifth Third Asset Management.
 Investors are also facing uncertain times vis-a-vis interest
rates, with the European Central Bank having already tightened,
the Bank of England under pressure to follow suit and the Fed
signalling its $600 billion bond purchase programme will end,
but offering a slightly more downbeat assessment of the U.S.
economy.
 ""The most uncertainty is probably about future economic
policy ... a slowdown while policy is being tightened may be
unnerving for investors used to three years of very easy policy
conditions,"" said Chris Paine, associate director for asset
allocation at Henderson Global Investors in London.
 Equity markets have also enjoyed a strong run, with the MSCI
all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> up around 16
percent over the past 12 months and 37 percent from a 2010 low.

 REGIONALLY
 U.S. fund managers slightly cut their exposure to equities
in April and raised their allocation in bonds, booking some
profits after an impressive rally for equities.
 Some 15 U.S.-based fund management firms held an average of
63.3 percent of their assets in equities compared with 64.9
percent a month earlier.
 Bond exposure increased to 29 percent in April from 27 in
March. Cash holdings rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent.
[US/ASSET]
 European investors outside Britain reduced equities for a
third consecutive month and added to bonds and cash.
 The survey of 17 Europe-based asset management firms showed
a typical balanced portfolio holding 46.8 percent in equities in
April, compared with 48.3 percent in the previous month.
 It held 38.6 percent in bonds, compared with 37.3 percent
last month. Cash holdings rose to 8.1 percent from 6.9, hitting
their highest level in at least a year. [EUR/ASSET]
 The global stock weighting for Japanese fund managers
hovered near a 12-year low in April, hurt by worries about the
impact of Japan's triple disaster that also kept their weighting
for bonds near record highs, according to Reuters' poll.
 The survey, released on Monday, showed the average weighting
for equities among 12 firms inched up to 42.6 percent after
tumbling to a 12-year low of 42.4 percent in March.
 Bonds were trimmed to 48.8 percent in April from a
record-high 49.6 percent. Cash was at 5.1 percent from 5.2
percent. [JP/ASSET]
 The monthly poll of asset allocations among 12 British fund
managers showed the average exposure in global equity portfolios
fell to 52.5 percent from 54.7 percent.
 Bond exposure was also trimmed -- to 22.1 percent from 22.2
percent -- with alternatives, including commodities, and cash
rising. [GB/ASSET]

973,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2011 06:56AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Euro zone PPI at 2-1/2 yr high firms rate rise case," * Euro zone March PPI up 0.7 m/m, 6.7 y/y
 * Energy prices contribute to PPI rise above expectations
 * Seen adding to ECB concerns about inflationary pressures
 
 (Recasts with economist's comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 3 (Reuters) - Surging energy costs drove euro
zone producer price inflation to its highest level in 2-1/2
years in March, strengthening the case for more interest rate
rises.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices
at factory gates in the 17 countries using the euro rose 0.7
percent month-on-month in March for a 6.7 percent year-on-year
increase, the highest since September 2008, when it reached 7.7
percent.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.6 percent
monthly rise and a 6.6 percent annual gain.
 Rises in prices charged by producers, unless absorbed by
intermediaries or retailers, mean higher prices for consumers
and therefore signal inflationary pressures.
 The European Central Bank increased its benchmark interest
rate to 1.25 percent last month from a record low 1.0 percent as
inflation rose to 2.8 percent in April from 2.7 percent in
March. 
 The ECB has led the way among the big four central banks in
raising interest rates, emphasising its determination to bring
keep inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium
term. It meets to review rates again on Thursday.
 ""The further spike up in euro zone producer prices in March
will reinforce the ECB's concern that high energy and commodity
prices are continuing to exert serious inflationary pressures
lower down the supply chain,"" said Howard Archer, economist at
IHS Global Insight.
 ""It will likely fuel the central bank's belief that it needs
to raise interest rates further to show it is prepared to take a
tough stance on inflation despite the still difficult economic
situations in many euro zone countries and the global economic
uncertainties resulting from high oil prices and events in
Japan,"" Archer said.
 The main driver of higher producer prices in March was
energy, the price of which rose 1.9 percent against February, to
be 13 percent higher than a year earlier.
 Without the volatile energy and construction figures,
producer prices rose 0.2 percent month-on-month and 4.5 percent
year-on-year.
 ""We currently expect the ECB to lift interest rates by a
further 25 basis points to 1.5 percent in July, but there is a
very real likelihood that it could act again as soon as June,""
Archer said.
 ""Further out, we see gradual increases in the ECB's key
interest rate to 2.50 percent by the end of 2012,"" he said.

 LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar hobbled near a
three-year trough against a currency basket on Tuesday,
undermined by loose U.S. monetary policy, but analysts said it's
fall was looking overextended due to extreme short positioning.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance against a
basket of major currencies, was last up 0.3 percent at 73.171,
still not far off a three-year low of 72.722 hit this week. Its
decline in the past few weeks has taken it ever closer to a
record low of 70.698 set in March 2008.
 The dollar slipped to a record low against the Swiss franc
at 0.8619 francs on trading platform EBS in early trade,
slipping under Friday's low of 0.8626.
 ""In the near-term the dollar's fall could extend further
still but levels are now becoming more stretched in terms of
valuation and positioning. Momentum indicators are also showing

 The fact currency speculators have already piled up bets

 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.4802 after falling back
to $1.4751 in early European trade. Dealers reported good demand

 ""It's very much a case of buying the dips in euro/dollar at

 The single currency hit a 17-month high of $1.4903 on Monday

 Sterling fell to its lowest level since March 2010 against

in below market expectations. The pound also shed over half a

 AUSSIE DIPS
 The Canadian dollar staged a brief relief rally as Canada's
ruling Conservatives won a crushing victory in the federal
election.
 Provisional results showed the Conservatives had 166 seats

minority government into a majority.
 The U.S. dollar was last at C$0.9500, near a 3-1/2 year low
of C$0.9440 hit last week.
 The Australian dollar dipped after Australia's central bank
kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent as expected. The
Reserve Bank of Australia said underlying inflation looked to

 LAGOS, May 3 (Reuters) - Economic growth in sub-Saharan
Africa has largely returned to pre-financial crisis levels but
monetary tightening has failed to keep pace, with rising fuel
and food prices a growing threat, the IMF said on Tuesday.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated its
forecast of 5.5 percent GDP growth for the region this year and
5.9 percent in 2012, with low-income countries that make up the
bulk of the continent recovering the fastest.
 ""Sub-Saharan Africa's recovery from the crisis-induced
slowdown is well under way, with growth in most countries now
back fairly close to the high levels of the mid 2000s,"" the IMF
said in its latest regional economic outlook.
 But it warned rising food and fuel prices were about to test
the region's resilience of the past few years once again.
 ""These price shocks, coupled with the recovery, are likely
to lead to higher inflation in most countries and to
deteriorating current account deficits in a number of fuel
importers,"" the 122-page report said.
 ""Monetary policy remains looser than desirable in many
countries in the region ... Interest rates have failed to keep
pace with the cyclical recovery, and policy now needs to move
ahead of the curve,"" it said.
 Growth forecasts varied, with the poorest countries
recovering the fastest -- such as Ethiopia, forecast to grow 8.5
percent this year -- and middle-income countries lagging behind.
South Africa is expected to grow just 3.5 percent.
 The report assumed an average oil price of $107 per barrel
for this year compared to $80 per barrel in 2010, an increase of
more than a third which would result in higher import bills for
most countries in the region, it said.
 ""Should prices rise sharply higher than assumed in the
baseline, there almost certainly will also be an adverse effect
on growth,"" the report said.
 ""In particular, simulations suggest that if oil prices were
to increase to an average of $150 per barrel in 2011, growth in
oil importing sub-Saharan African countries would decline by
0.5-0.7 percent,"" it said.
 
 FOREIGN INVESTMENT
 The report said private capital inflows had not yet returned
to pre-crisis levels in all areas with some countries -- in
particular Ghana and Mauritius -- seeing a marked increase last
year but others seeing little sign of a resumption.
 ""Private investors, possibly still smarting from the global
financial losses of recent years, seem to be distinguishing
between markets,"" the report said.
 Increased investor inflows into Ghana had partly been
triggered by a tightening of fiscal and monetary policy in 2009
and 2010, the strong performance of its cocoa and gold sectors
and the start of oil production last December.
 There had also been a rise in portfolio equity investment in
Zimbabwe following a 2009 economic stabilisation programme.
 It was a different picture in Nigeria, where $3.6 billion of
portfolio investment left the country in 2008-09 compared to a
net inflow of $2 billion in the previous two years, although
inflows had since started to recover.
 Debt portfolio inflows recovered more slowly due to sharply
lower domestic interest rates than in the period before the
financial crisis, with government debt yields mirroring policy
rates, the report said.
 The IMF noted that high levels of foreign inflows into
relatively small economies had posed challenges for policy in
several countries before the crisis and again when investors
pulled out, increasing exchange rate volatility.
 It said some countries may consider temporary controls on
capital inflows to try to mitigate a recurrence of such
instability.
 ""The long-term trend has been toward more open capital
accounts,"" the report said.
 ""However, Tanzania and Zambia tightened capital controls in
an effort to discourage speculative inflows following their
experience with abrupt reversal of flows during the global
crisis,"" it said.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong	
 SHANGHAI, May 3 (Reuters) - The yuan pulled back slightly
against the dollar on Tuesday from a slew of recent record
highs, as the People's Bank of China fixed a marginally weaker
mid-point, signalling the central bank will stick to gradualism
in reforming the country's currency regime.	
 The consolidation came after the yuan breezed past 6.50 per
dollar last Friday, surpassing the psychologically important
level for the first time and raising expectations that Beijing
will continue to let the currency strengthen quickly to battle
stubbornly high inflation.	
 Monday was a public holiday in China.	
 Traders said Tuesday's weaker PBOC fixing indicated again
that the government may choose not to conduct drastic reforms,
such as a one-off revaluation or to widen the trading band. It
may opt to let the yuan rise gradually in line with global
market conditions, such as the fluctuation of commodity prices.	
 The indication was in contrast to speculation in overseas
markets since late April that China may unshackle its tightly
controlled foreign exchange regime.	
 Rumours have been fanned by a slew of record high PBOC
fixings this year, and media reports quoting a PBOC adviser
saying that a one-off revaluation could not be ruled out.	
 But academic adviser to the central bank, Xia Bin, is not a
policymaker and his views do not represent the government's
stance.	
 ""Here we see some sort of behind-the-curve speculation on
yuan appreciation that goes to the extreme in some cases,"" said
a trader at a European bank in Shanghai. ""We see little chance
of China giving up its approach to gradualism for now.""	
 Spot yuan closed at 6.4968 versus the dollar,
down from 6.4910 at the close on Friday. It has now appreciated
5.07 percent since it was depegged from the dollar in
June 2010, and 1.42 percent since the start of this
year.	
 Before trading began, the PBOC set the day's mid-point at
6.5002, marginally lower than Friday's record fixing of 6.4990.
The central uses the mid-point to express the governments'
intention for the yuan's movements.	
 
 NO SURPRISE	
 Onshore traders said a quicker pace of yuan appreciation
this year has been expected for months as China uses the
exchange rate to help fight imported inflation and adjust the
economic structure and relieve a heavy reliance on exports for
growth. [ID:nTOE71H052]	
 Traders cautioned against shorting dollars too aggressively
in long-term offshore dollar/yuan forwards because
the recent fall in forwards has nearly closed the window on
betting on yuan appreciation in these tenors.	
 One-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) were
bid at 6.3210 in late trade on Tuesday, up from 6.2970 at the
previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's time
fell to 2.83 percent from 3.22 percent.	
 ""The NDFs responded to the news of the killing of bin Laden
with some investors expecting the dollar to rebound due to the
news,"" said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shenzhen.
""But this piece of news is unlikely to have a lingering effect.""	
 Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. special forces assault
on a Pakistani compound, then quickly buried at sea, in a
dramatic end to the long manhunt for the al Qaeda leader who had
been the guiding star of global terrorism. [ID:nL3E7G30GI]	
 While drastic reforms are seen unlikely, the PBOC guided the
yuan up by 0.9 percent in April compared with 0.4 percent in
March, accelerating its appreciation at a time when the dollar
has fallen to three-year lows against a basket of currencies.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it increasingly clear they
are willing to use the currency as a means to fight inflation,
which hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, partly
boosted by surging global commodity prices.	"
980,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2011 05:00AM ET</span>",PROFILE-Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero," Position: Prime Minister of Spain
 Incumbent: Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
 Date of birth: Aug 4, 1960
 Term: Prime minister since April 2004 and reelected in 2008.
The next election in Spain is scheduled for 2012.
 
 Key Facts:
 -- His ratings hammered by the highest unemployment rate in
the European Union and a stagnant economy, Socialist Zapatero
announced in April 2011 he would not run for a third term. He
has been praised abroad for austerity measures and economic
reforms that have persuaded investors that Spain can reduce its
deficit and avoid the financial crises that have hit Greece,
Ireland and Portugal. But the same measures made him unpopular
at home.
 -- Economic and fiscal crisis dominated most of Zapatero's
second term. Earlier, his main initiatives were: the withdrawal
of Spanish troops from Iraq, a bill to liberalise abortion laws
in the predominantly Catholic country, the legalisation of
same-sex marriage and the reform of the Statute of Catalonia, an
autonomous region in Spain.
 -- He controversially started peace talks with the Basque
separatist group ETA, which wants independence for Basque
territories in Spain and France. However, he ended the
negotiations after ETA bombed a Madrid airport parking lot,
killing two people, in December 2006.
 -- Apart from a stint as a teacher, Zapatero has devoted his
entire life to politics, and was the youngest member of
parliament when first elected in 1986.
 -- The holder of a law degree, he is the country's fifth
prime minister since democracy came to Spain in 1978 after a
36-year dictatorship under Francisco Franco that ended in 1975.

 By Yoo Choonsik	
 HANOI/SEOUL, May 3 (Reuters) - South Korea is not
considering imposing restrictions on non-deliverable forward
(NDF) currency trades or adopting any fresh capital controls ""as
of now"", Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun told Reuters even as
the authorities widened a probe into banks.	
 Seoul has been cracking down on the forwards market in a bid
to staunch rising short term debt in order to prevent
potentially destabilising capital flows. [ID:nL3E7FM003]	
 ""We will focus on the existing three-way measures (aimed at
mitigating capital flows) and are not considering introducing
new measures,"" Yoon said in an interview while in Hanoi to
attend the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) annual meeting.	
 He denied market speculation the country might impose
restrictions on dollar/won NDF trading as a means to stem the
won's fast appreciation, saying effects from such
restrictions were doubtful.	
 South Korea liberalised NDF trades in 1999 following the
Asian financial crisis. It temporarily set some limits on the
NDF market in 2004 only to end up with shrinking trade and
distorted market prices.	
 Yoon's remarks come as Asia's No.4 economy is set to widen
its ongoing probe of foreign exchange derivatives trade, which
started last week, into more banks and extend the period of the
probe.	
 The Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Bank of Korea, the
Financial Supervisory Service said in a joint statement that
they were planning to pick two more banks to be included in the
inspection from as early as mid-May. 
 ""Banks subject to the inspection will be picked, considering
their NSF transactions and the size of foreign currency debt
underwriting in the domestic market,"" the joint statement said.	
 South Korean policymakers believe that speculative
dollar-selling in the NDF market on expectations of a stronger
won is behind the sharp rise in short-term external debt.	
 Foreign-currency bond sales by South Korean companies at
home are also blamed for the rising foreign debt as issuance in
dollars is cheaper and the proceeds are eventually converted
into won. 
 ""We will consider revising relevant laws in order to stem
rule-evasive trade such as foreign currency-denominated bond
issuance for use at home in the won currency,"" the joint
statement added. 
 Choi Jong-ku, one of Yoon's deputies, told Reuters last week
he would think about if there were additional steps to take to
slow capital inflow, giving rise to market speculation NDF
trading could be the target. [ID:nL3E7FS1NC]	
 Foreign investors are flooding into riskier assets such as
emerging Asian currencies, stocks and bonds, drawn by the
region's strong growth and the prospect of higher returns as the
U.S. dollar flounders at three-year lows. 
 To slow fund inflows, Seoul has imposed restrictions on the
amount of foreign exchange derivatives positions banks can hold,
revived taxes on interest income from foreign investment in
government bonds and instituted a levy on foreign debt held by
banks. 
 
 ASEAN FUND BOOST	
 Yoon said he planned to propose more than doubling the $120
billion emergency fund set up between the 10-member Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Japan, China and South
Korea at his meeting with other members on Wednesday.	
 ""There is strong support from member countries to the idea,""
he added, although admitting chances were slim for any
conclusion to be reached this week.	
 He said strengthening cooperation between the International
Monetary Fund and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation
(CMIM), as the Asian fund is called, would also be discussed
between the 13 member countries.	
 ""I've repeatedly said the IMF's involvement should be at
least the level of their contribution to the European bailout
fund or more,"" said Yoon.	
 He said rising inflation, flooding capital inflows and
firmer commodities prices were among the key topics to be
discussed at the ASEAN+3 finance ministers' meeting to be held
on the sidelines of the ADB meeting.	
 On domestic issues, Yoon said the need to boost South
Korea's supply of homes while containing the heavy household
debt posed a dilemma to policymakers, but added the current
household debt -- ranking the heaviest in OECD countries next to
Britain -- had a sound structure.	
 ""You should look at more than just the absolute size (of the
debt). More than 70 percent of the debts are owed by high-income
people and the delinquency rate is low at just 0.6 percent,""
Yoon said of the debt structure.	
 He was responding to criticism among some investors and
economists that the government was making contradictory remarks
on housing policy and its desire to contain household debt
growth.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday as
investors pocketed gains after a five-session winning run, while
the dollar edged off a 33-month low, sending crude and copper
prices lower.
 Equities have been buoyed by robust company earnings in the
United States and Europe though high commodity prices, driven by
ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy and turmoil in oil-producing
Middle East and North Africa, could threaten company margins.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
shed 0.6 percent after five sessions of gains, and the emerging
share index lost 1.2 percent to a two-week low.
 The MSCI world gauge gained 3.9 percent last month, and is
up 7.5 percent this year.
 ""After the strong performance of equity markets over the
last months we are expecting to see a flattening in the market
in the coming months,"" Patrik Lang, head of equity research at
Julius Baer, said.
 ""Some of the key forward-looking (economic) indicators are
showing weaknesses meaning that the prospect and chance of
equity growth over the coming months is limited.""
 Lang recommended investors should cut their exposure to
cyclical stocks and focus on defensives, which are least
affected by changes in economic conditions.
 U.S. stock index futures lost 0.2 to 0.4 percent, indicating
a soft open on Wall Street, and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of
leading European shares dropped 0.8 percent, while Asia-Pacific
shares excluding Japan fell 1.4 percent.
 Nearly 80 percent of 339 S&P 500 companies that have so far
reported first-quarter earnings have either beat or met
analysts' forecasts, data from Thomson Reuters StarMine showed.
 Of the 98 European companies that have reported quarterly
results, 56 percent of them either beat or met expectations.
 Copper prices eased 1.1 percent and Brent crude lost 1
percent to trade below $124 a barrel.
 Analysts said the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden
could reduce the threat against the United States in the long
term, but the potential for retaliatory attacks in the short
term would support oil prices.
 
 DOLLAR BOUNCES
 The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket
of major currencies, was up 0.4 percent after hitting a 33-month
trough on Monday.
 Sentiment for the dollar has been overwhelmingly bearish as
near zero U.S. interest rates have made it the funding currency
of choice in carry trades that helped propel the Australian
dollar to a 29-year high of $1.1012 on Monday.
 ""In the near term, the dollar's fall could extend further
still but levels are now becoming more stretched in terms of
valuation and positioning. Momentum indicators are also showing
the dollar is very oversold,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
strategist at BTM-UFJ in London.
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.6 percent to $1.0872 on
Tuesday after the country's central bank kept interest rates
unchanged at 4.75 percent as expected, while the Canadian dollar
rose after the ruling Conservatives won a crushing victory in a
federal election.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.4788, though still up
more than 10 percent against the dollar this year.
 Credit Suisse said in a note that the common currency could
appreciate another 5 to 10 percent before it became a problem
for the euro zone economy.
 ""The current level of the euro is not a significant problem
for the real economy. It could probably appreciate by a further
5-10 percent before it became so. That would be consistent with
a euro-dollar cross rate of over $1.60,"" Credit Suisse said.

 LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar hobbled near a
three-year trough against a currency basket on Tuesday,
undermined by loose U.S. monetary policy, but analysts said it's
fall was looking overextended due to extreme short positioning.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was last up 0.2 percent at
73.091, still not far off a three-year low of 72.722 hit this
week. Its decline in the past few weeks has taken it ever closer
to a record low of 70.698 set in March 2008.
 The dollar slipped to a record low against the Swiss franc
at 0.8619 francs on trading platform EBS, slipping under
Friday's low of 0.8626 .
 ""In the near-term the dollar's fall could extend further
still but levels are now becoming more stretched in terms of
valuation and positioning. Momentum indicators are also showing
the dollar is very oversold,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 The fact currency speculators have already piled up bets
against the dollar means the dollar could get a lift if
short-covering sets in. [IMM/FX]
 The Canadian dollar went against the grain, enjoying a
relief rally as Canada's ruling Conservatives won a crushing
victory in the federal election.
 Provisional results showed the Conservatives had 166 seats
in Parliament, well above the 155 they needed to transform their
minority government into a majority. [ID:nN02265133]
The left-leaning New Democratic Party, which wants to raise
corporate taxes, increase social spending and toughen policy on
climate change, had gained in opinion polls ahead of the
election, casting some uncertainty over the Canadian dollar's
outlook.
 The U.S. dollar slid 0.3 percent to C$0.9479 ,
nearing a 3-1/2 year low of C$0.9440 hit last week.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.4812 , pulling away
from a 17-month high of $1.4903 hit the previous day on trading
platform EBS.
 Still, the diverging outlook for monetary policy in the
United States and Europe suggests the dollar is unlikely to get
much reprieve against the euro, said Andrew Robinson, currency
analyst for Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.
 ""I think you'll see quite a few willing buyers if the euro
dips,"" Robinson said. ""Towards the rest of the week, maybe we'll
see a slow but steady crawl up to the $1.50 level,"" he added.
 
 AUSSIE DIPS
 Sentiment for the dollar has been overwhelmingly bearish as
ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has made it the funding
currency of choice in popular carry trades that have helped
propel the Aussie to a 29-year high of $1.1012  on
Monday.
 The Australian dollar  dipped after Australia's
central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent as
expected. The Reserve Bank of Australia said underlying
inflation looked to have bottomed and would increase somewhat as
the economy strengthened, sounding a little less hawkish than
some analysts had expected. [ID:nL3E7G2094]
 The Aussie dollar last stood at $1.0884 , having
dipped from around $1.0920 after the RBA's decision. The Aussie
also fell against the yen to trade down around 0.6 percent at
88.36 yen.
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 81.02 yen  in light
trade, with Japanese markets closed for a national holiday. The
dollar fell as low as 80.971 yen earlier on Tuesday, its lowest

 By Tony Munroe and Suvashree Dey Choudhury	
 MUMBAI, May 3 (Reuters) - India's central bank stepped up
its fight against stubbornly high inflation on Tuesday, raising
interest rates by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points and
vowing to battle price pressures even at the cost of some
economic growth.	
 The rate rise exceeded forecasts for a 25 basis point rise,
although the case for stronger action had been building since
data showed March inflation reached nearly 9 percent. It also
cast doubt on the government's ambitious growth targets.	
 The Reserve Bank of India has been among the most aggressive
central banks anywhere with nine rate rises since March 2010 but
its gradual policy tightening has failed to cool inflation
initially driven by high food and fuel prices, and more recently
by demand pressures.	
 ""Current elevated rates of inflation pose significant risks
to future growth,"" RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in the
bank's annual monetary policy statement. ""Bringing them down,
therefore, even at the cost of some growth in the short-run,
should take precedence.""	
 The RBI lifted its repo rate , at which it lends
to banks, to 7.25 percent from 6.75 percent. The reverse repo
rate was increased by a similar amount to 6.25 percent.	
 It warned that wholesale inflation, the main measure of
price pressures in Asia's third-biggest economy, would remain
around March levels in the first half of the fiscal year that
began in April, before easing.	
 It set an inflation target of 6 percent, with an upward
bias, for the end of the fiscal year.	
 The inflation warning and tough language prompted economists
to raise their forecasts for interest rates this year.	
 A snap Reuters poll showed they now expect India's repo rate
to reach 8 percent by the end of 2011, a full percentage point
higher than expectations in a poll in January. [ID:nL3E7G31UO]	
 The 1-year overnight indexed swap rate jumped
as much as 20 basis points and the 5-year rate
rose 11 basis points, flattening the curve after the
central bank meeting. The 10-year benchmark bond yield
rose as much as 8 basis points.	
 Indian shares tumbled 2.44 percent, and banking
shares dropped more than 3 percent as investors
factored in a hit to earnings from higher credit costs.	
 
 The central bank's decisive action and comments restore some
of the inflation-fighting credibility it lost while sticking
with a ""calibrated"" approach to tightening in the face of the
government's pro-growth bias, which some analysts said had
underplayed inflation risks.	
 ""The RBI is talking more realistically about the inflation
trajectory and responding a little more aggressively,"" said
Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank in New Delhi.	
 ""It is a more adequate action than in the past. In the long
term, it will help to curb inflation, but not immediately. We
are expecting another 75 basis points hike in 2011,"" he said.	
 Central banks in other developing markets have also been
raising rates as their economies emerged from the global
financial crisis much faster than industrialised countries. Data
showing slowing manufacturing growth in China indicates that a
series of policy measures by Beijing is having an
effect.[ID:nL3E7G100E]	
 
 ""UNHINGED""	
 Much of India's stubbornly high inflation is blamed on
supply bottlenecks, including in food output, which are beyond
the scope of monetary policy. 
 However price pressures have become more widespread
prompting the central bank to take more decisive action to
prevent the price pressures seeping deeper into the economy.	
 ""Inflation has consistently surprised on the upside and
there is little choice but for the central bank to send a strong
tightening signal/anti-inflation stance as they have done,""
said Ramya Suryanarayanan, economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.	
 Suryanarayanan predicted a further 50 basis points of
tightening by July. 
 Food price inflation of more than 9 percent and double-digit
fuel price growth have added pressure on a Congress party-led
government already reeling from a spate of corruption scandals.	
 Slower economic growth would be another political headache
for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.	
 His government counts on growth of 9 percent for the current
fiscal year to help fund increased social spending and keep the
fiscal deficit in check.	
 The target is in excess of most private forecasts and the
central bank's expectation for growth of about 8 percent, which
assumes a normal summer monsoon and global crude oil prices of
$110 a barrel.	
 The economy grew by an estimated 8.6 percent in the year
that ended in March 2011.	
 With inflation high despite a flurry of rate rises, the
central bank also said it would make the repo rate its main
policy tool, a move analysts said was designed to ensure rate
changes had a more direct impact on the economy.	
 The repo rate will now be the only independent rate, unlike
previously when the central bank could change the repo rate or
the reverse repo rate, or both. [ID:nL3E7G317O]	
 Subbarao said India needed to maintain price stability if
medium-term growth was to be sustained.	
 ""Persistently high rates of inflation raise the risks of
inflationary expectations becoming unhinged,"" he said.	
 Earlier in the day, Australia's central bank held interest
rates steady at 4.75 percent on Tuesday but warned that
underlying inflation could head higher, reinforcing the case for
a further tightening in the coming months. [ID:nL3E7G3041]

 SHANGHAI, May 3 (Reuters) - The yuan pulled back slightly
against the dollar on Tuesday from a slew of recent record
highs, as the People's Bank of China fixed a marginally weaker
mid-point, signalling the central bank will stick to gradualism
in reforming the country's currency regime.	
 The consolidation came after the yuan breezed past 6.50 per
dollar last Friday, surpassing the psychologically important
level for the first time and raising expectations that Beijing
will continue to let the currency strengthen quickly to battle
stubbornly high inflation.	
 Monday was a public holiday in China.	
 Traders said Tuesday's weaker PBOC fixing indicated again
that the government may choose not to conduct drastic reforms,
such as a one-off revaluation or to widen the trading band. It
may opt to let the yuan rise gradually in line with global
market conditions, such as the fluctuation of commodity prices.	
 The indication was in contrast to speculation in overseas
markets since late April that China may unshackle its tightly
controlled foreign exchange regime.	
 Rumours have been fanned by a slew of record high PBOC
fixings this year, and media reports quoting a PBOC advisor
saying that a one-off revaluation could not be ruled out.	
 But academic adviser to the central bank, Xia Bin, is not a
policymaker and his views do not represent the government's
stance.	
 ""Here we see some sort of behind-the-curve speculation on
yuan appreciation that goes to the extreme in some cases,"" said
a trader at a European bank in Shanghai. ""We see little chance
of China giving up its approach to gradualism for now.""	
 Spot yuan was trading at 6.4969 versus the dollar
at midday, down from 6.4910 at the close on Friday. It has now
appreciated 5.06 percent since it was depegged from the dollar
in June 2010, and 1.42 percent since the start of this year.	
 Before trading began, the PBOC set the day's mid-point at
6.5002, marginally lower than Friday's record fixing of 6.4990.
The central uses the mid-point to express the governments'
intention for the yuan's movements.	
 
 NO SURPRISE	
 Onshore traders said a quicker pace of yuan appreciation
this year has been expected for months as China uses the
exchange rate to help fight imported inflation and adjust the
economic structure and relieve a heavy reliance on exports for
growth. [ID:nTOE71H052]	
 Traders cautioned against shorting dollars too aggressively
in long-term offshore dollar/yuan forwards because
the recent fall in forwards has nearly closed the window on
betting on yuan appreciation in these tenors.	
 One-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) were
bid at 6.3170 at midday on Tuesday, up from 6.2970 at the
previous close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's time
fell to 2.90 percent from 3.22 percent.	
 ""The NDFs responded to the news of the killing of bin Laden
with some investors expecting the dollar to rebound due to the
news,"" said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shenzhen.
""But this piece of news is unlikely to have a lingering effect.""	
 Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. special forces assault
on a Pakistani compound, then quickly buried at sea, in a
dramatic end to the long manhunt for the al Qaeda leader who had
been the guiding star of global terrorism. [ID:nL3E7G30GI]	
 While drastic reforms are seen unlikely, the PBOC guided the
yuan up by 0.9 percent in April compared with 0.4 percent in
March, accelerating its appreciation at a time when the dollar
has fallen to three-year lows against a basket of currencies.	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it increasingly clear they
are willing to use the currency as a means to fight inflation,
which hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, partly
boosted by surging global commodity prices.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled to pull away
from a three-year trough on Tuesday with higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian dollar still seen in favour
even as markets become more concerned over stretched positions.	
 A steep fall in silver the previous day highlighted
just how vulnerable overbought assets can be to a sudden
sell-off and suggested investors may be primed to take profits. 
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was last up 0.1 percent at
73.026, still not far off a three-year low of 72.722 hit this
week. Its decline in the past few weeks has taken it ever
closer to a record low of 70.698 set in March 2008.	
 ""There could be some exhaustion in terms of dollar selling.
The fact is, from a pure market positioning perspective, the
market is extremely short U.S. dollars,"" said Mitul Kotecha,
head of global FX strategy at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.	
 The Canadian dollar went against the grain, enjoying a
relief rally as Canada's ruling Conservatives won a crushing
victory in a federal election.	
 Provisional results showed the Conservatives had 166 seats
in Parliament, well above the 155 they needed to transform their
minority government into a majority. [ID:nN02265133]	
 ""I think generally this is probably very good for the
Canadian dollar,"" said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange
trading at BMO Capital Markets. ""I think this provides a measure
of stability that the market was looking for."" [ID:nN02262838] 
 The left-leaning New Democratic Party, which wants to raise
corporate taxes, increase social spending and toughen policy on
climate change, had gained in opinion polls ahead of the
election, casting some uncertainty over the Canadian dollar's
outlook.	
 The U.S. dollar slid 0.4 percent to C$0.9474 ,
nearing a 3-1/2 year low of C$0.9440 hit last week.	
 The U.S. dollar was mostly higher against other major
currencies, with the euro dipping 0.1 percent to $1.4812 ,
pulling away from a 17-month high of $1.4903 hit the previous
day on trading platform EBS.	
 The fact that currency speculators have already piled up
bets against the dollar means the dollar could gain a lift if
short-covering sets in. 
 Still, the diverging outlook for monetary policy in the
United States and Europe suggests that the dollar is unlikely to
get much reprieve against the euro, said Andrew Robinson,
currency analyst for Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.	
 ""I think you'll see quite a few willing buyers if the euro
dips,"" Robinson said. ""Towards the rest of the week, maybe we'll
see a slow but steady crawl up to the $1.50 level,"" he added.	
 Sentiment for the dollar has been overwhelmingly bearish as
ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has made it the funding
currency of choice in popular carry trades that have helped
propel the Aussie to a 29-year high of $1.1012 on
Monday. 
 The Australian dollar dipped after Australia's
central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent as
expected. The Reserve Bank of Australia said underlying
inflation looked to have bottomed and would increase somewhat as
the economy strengthened, sounding a little less hawkish than
some analysts had expected. [ID:nL3E7G2094]	
 The Aussie dollar last stood at $1.0910 , having
dipped from around $1.0920 after the RBA's decision. The Aussie
also fell against the yen, touching an intraday low near 88.25
yen and was last down 0.6 percent at 88.36 yen. 
 Against the yen, the dollar dipped 0.3 percent to 81.02 yen
in light trade, with Japanese markets closed for a
national holiday. The dollar fell as low as 80.971 yen earlier
on Tuesday, its lowest in more than a month.

 By David Stanway	
 CHENGDU, China, May 3 (Reuters) - The congenial Professor
Duan Xuru doesn't look like a stereotypical mad scientist as he
shows guests into a cluttered laboratory filled with canisters,
vacuum pumps and patched-up pipes tied together with spirals of
blue wire and rubber tubing.	
 But Duan, based in the southwest Chinese city of Chengdu, is
working on an audacious project described as a ""man-made sun"".
He hopes it will eventually create almost unlimited supplies of
cheap and clean energy.	
 Duan is no maverick either, but a pioneer in one of the many
expeditions that China has launched to map out its nuclear
energy options in the future.	
 Old-fashioned atom splitting has been in the spotlight after
Japan's biggest earthquake and tsunami left an aging nuclear
reactor complex on the northeast coast on the verge of
catastrophic meltdown.
    While Germany and Italy have turned their backs on nuclear
power, China is pressing ahead with an ambitious plan to raise
capacity from 10.8 gigawatts at the end of 2010 to as much as 70
or 80 GW in 2020.	

    Many of the nuclear research institutes across the country
are working on advanced solutions to some of the problems facing
traditional reactors, from the recycling and storage of spent
fuel to terrorist attacks.	
 But Duan and his state-funded team of scientists are on a
quest for the Holy Grail of nuclear physics: a fusion reactor
that can generate power by forcing nuclei together instead of
smashing them apart -- mimicking the stellar activity that
brought heavy elements into existence and made the universe fit
for life.	
 Duan said fusion could be the ultimate way forward: it is
far safer than traditional fission, requires barely 600 grams of
hydrogen fuel a year for each 10-gigawatt plant, and creates
virtually no radioactive waste.	
 ""Due to the problems in Japan, the government hopes nuclear
fusion can be realised in the near future,"" said Duan, the
director of fusion science at the Southwestern Institute of
Physics, founded in 1965 and funded by the state-owned China
National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).	
 While fusion has moved some way beyond the purely
hypothetical after more than half a century of painstaking
research, it still remains some distance away from being
feasible. Critically, the energy required to induce a fusion
reaction far exceeds the amount of energy produced.	
 Fusion might be the ultimate goal, but in the near future,
all China's practical efforts will continue to focus on a new
model of conventional fission reactors.
    While China's nuclear industry awaits the results of a
government review in the wake of the Fukushima crisis, all signs
point to China pushing ahead with its long-term strategy.	
 The National Development and Reform Commission said last
week China would continue to support the construction and
development of advanced nuclear reactors and related nuclear
technologies.	
 ""Suddenly, China has become even more important to the world
-- as other people ask whether they still want to go ahead,
China still seems intent on going ahead at full speed,"" said
Steve Kidd, deputy secretary general with the World Nuclear
Association, a London-based lobby group.	
 If traditional nuclear power represents the civil
application of the atomic weapons dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in 1945, fusion is an extension of the hydrogen bomb,
first tested by the United States in 1952.	
 Showing Reuters around a sweltering, hermetically-sealed lab
designed to bring hydrogen isotopes to an unthinkable 55-million
degree boil in a 1.65 m vacuum chamber, Duan said progress had
been slower than first expected at the dawn of the nuclear age.	
 ""It took about nine years to go from the atomic bomb to
nuclear power, and we hoped it would take a maximum of 20 years
to get from the first H-bomb to a fusion reactor,"" he said. ""But
in reality it was very difficult because there were so many
technical and scientific challenges.""	
 Described by one observer as an attempt to put the sun in a
box, nuclear fusion has been derided as the province of cranks
and charlatans -- the modern equivalent of the perpetual motion
machines that plagued U.S. patent offices in the 19th century.
Sceptics scoff the world is now 50 years away from fusion power
-- and always will be.	
 Duan shrugged off the criticism. He has spent more than 20
years in the field, including eight years in Germany, and found
reasons to be optimistic.	
 ""Actually, the concept of nuclear fusion is very simple,"" he
said with a wry smile. ""The first thing is to generate the
plasma. The second thing is to heat the plasma to a few hundred
million degrees. And then you need to confine it.""	
 The devil, of course, is in the details.

 EXOTIC OPTIONS	
 As Japan's stricken Fukushima plant lurched from crisis to
crisis in March and April, the safety of nuclear power was
called into question -- including in China. Five days after the
quake and tsunami knocked out the 40-year-old Fukushima Daiichi
complex, China said it was suspending approvals for nuclear
power plants pending safety checks of plants in operation or
under construction.	
 China by most calculations is already the world's biggest
energy consumer, and demand for power is set to soar in the next
decade. But its dependence on fossil fuels have also turned it
into the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas.	
 Duan's fusion reactor could be the answer to China's energy
conundrum. It does not require acres of space or tonnes of
scarce fuel or water resources. It produces no CO2 emissions or
waste, and is completely safe, even if struck by an earthquake.	
 A large part of China's fusion research is now focused on
the tokamak, a Russian acronym meaning ""toroidal magnetic
chamber"". It is a doughnut-shaped vacuum vessel wrapped in
superconducting magnetic coils that confine and control the
ultra-high temperature soup of ions and electrons known as
plasma.	
 But tokamaks can only run a few seconds in experiments
conducted every five months or so, creating a brief 500-megawatt
burst of energy before fizzling out.	
 Unlike the tokamak, new conventional technologies are on the
cusp of being commercialised, including ""third-generation""
designs imported from U.S.-based Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba
, and France's Areva .	
 Also on the horizon are fourth- and fifth-generation
technologies that go by names like fast-breeder, travelling
wave, or high-temperature gas-cooled, as well as small and
versatile ""modular"" reactors with shorter construction times.	
 ""(China) has investments in the more exotic reactor designs
and they also have got cooperation on fast reactors with the
Russians,"" said Kidd of the World Nuclear Association. ""They are
keeping their options open, and Fukushima will encourage that
tendency towards next-generation reactors.""	
 The allure of the next generation reactors is they can
eliminate, or at least defer, the problem of fuel shortages by
reprocessing spent uranium into plutonium and other actinides
and boost the amount of usable fuel by a factor of 50.	
 Like fusion, some of these advanced reactors remain a long
way from the market, said Adrian Heymer, executive director at
the Nuclear Energy Institute in Washington, D.C.
High-temperature gas-cooled reactors are unlikely to be ready
until 2030, and fast breeders could have to wait until the
2040s.	
 ""When we say future, we are really looking at the distant
future -- they not only need a step forward in technology but
certainly also a step-up in operator acumen,"" Heymer "

 SINGAPORE, May 3 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Tuesday,
with falling commodity prices dragging on mining stocks, while
the Aussie dollar eased after the central bank held interest
rates and Canada's currency rose as the ruling Conservatives won
a federal election.	
 The U.S. dollar struggled to pull away from a three-year
trough, while oil and copper prices eased as investors focused
on the still-fragile state of the recovery in many developed
economies.	
 A slew of data this week will help gauge the strength of the
world economy, with particular focus on U.S. non-farm payrolls
on Friday. 
 ""Everyone is waiting to see how uncertainties in the
macro-economic situations of major economies will pan out,""
China Futures Co. analyst Yang Jun said. 
 European shares were expected to open mostly down, with Euro
Stoxx 50 futures  shedding 0.4 percent, while S&P 500
futures  fell 0.3 percent, pointing to a weaker start on
Wall Street. Financial spreadbetters called London's FTSE 100
flat-to-higher after a four-day weekend. 
 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan

percent. Japan's financial markets were closed for a public
holiday. 
 ""Our number one headwind for equities right now is the
Aussie dollar,"" said IG Markets institutional dealer Chris
Weston.	
 The U.S. currency has been under pressure for months due to
the Federal Reserve's ultra-loose monetary policy, which has
opened up a yield gap between the dollar and currencies such as
the euro and the Aussie.

 The Aussie eased from a 29-year high above $1.10 ,
to trade around $1.09 after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept
interest rates unchanged, as expected.	
 The central bank, the first in the developed world to begin
tightening policy in late 2009, said underlying inflation was
likely to head higher, laying the groundwork for further rate
rises in the months to come.	
 ""That addition to the statement suggests they're preparing
to move in the next few months -- though there's no sense of
urgency about it,"" said Brian Redican, a senior economist at
Macquarie.	
 
 LOONIE GAINS	
 The Canadian dollar edged up as provisional results
from Canada's election showed the pro-business Conservatives
cruising to victory, on course to transform their minority
administration into a majority government.	
 The loonie has lagged other commodity-linked currencies, in
part due to uncertainty about the outcome of Monday's election,
with the opposition New Democrats pledging to raise corporate
taxes, increase social spending and toughen climate change
policies.	
 ""I think generally this is probably very good for the
Canadian dollar,"" said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange
trading at BMO Capital Markets. ""We haven't had a majority

 Oil, the asset often most sensitive to perceptions of
geopolitical risk, fell nearly half a percent, but remained
about $2 above the Monday low hit after news of the killing of
Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by U.S. special forces.	
 While the death of bin Laden could reduce the threat against
the United States by militant Islamists in the long-term, the
potential for retaliatory attacks in the short-term would
support prices, analysts said. 
""The potential of violence from retaliation has more upside
than downside risks, and would support the market,"" said Serene
Lim, commodities analyst with ANZ Bank in Singapore.	
 U.S. crude futures  eased 50 cents to $113.02 a

 Spot gold was a little firmer at $1,547.59 an ounce,
after retreating from a record $1,575.79, and copper
fell 0.3 percent. 
 Weaker industrial metals prices dragged on shares of big
mining firms, with BHP Billiton down 1.4 percent and
Rio Tinto 0.7 percent.

 * Stock gains fizzle, euro jumps on manufacturing data
 * Oil volatile as investors weigh geopolitical risks
 * Treasuries trim losses, impact of bin Laden death muted
(Updates with U.S. markets' close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks erased gains,
ending slightly down, and oil prices closed modestly lower on
Monday as investors concluded Osama bin Laden's death will do
little to ease global economic and political risks.
 The U.S. dollar erased early gains and the euro hit a
17-month high against the greenback on bets euro-zone interest
rates will keep rising to fend off inflation.
 News that the al Qaeda leader had been killed by U.S.
forces on Sunday initially encouraged investors to take on
risk, driving stocks higher. Oil fell by more than 3 percent.
 But investors refocused on the state of the global economy
and the recognition that bin Laden's death would not lessen
political risks in the Middle East and North Africa, which have
driven oil prices higher in the past few months.
 ""This is a great story for freedom lovers, but it will only
impact the economy insofar as it brings the price of oil down,""
said Christian Wagner, chief executive officer at Longview
Capital Management in Wilmington, Delaware.
 After its initial plunge, oil prices zigzagged between

 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index edged
higher on Monday after falling to a three-year trough, but is
seen poised to move lower again as investors seek higher rates
offered abroad and shun the low-yielding greenback.
 News that U.S. forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden had a muted impact on the foreign exchange market, with
investors remaining fixated on interest rate differentials. For
the latest on bin Laden, see [ID:nL3E7G21FJ] and
[ID:nBINLADEN]
 The Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy loose while
other central banks, such as the European Central Bank and the
Bank of England, have already raised rates or are on the verge
of doing so. Australia and Canada are expected to tighten
lending conditions in the months ahead.
 Higher rates in Europe have undermined support for the
dollar, boosting the euro by 11 percent so far this year.
Sterling has gained 7 percent on the dollar.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
versus a basket of currencies, hit a three-year low of 72.722
earlier in the day, edging closer to the record low of 70.698
set in March 2008. It last traded up 0.2 percent at 73.046.
 The euro climbed to a 17-month high above $1.49 after
surprisingly strong manufacturing data bolstered chances that
interest rates in the euro zone will rise further.
[ID:nSLATFE7TJ]
 ""The dollar's deteriorating yield appeal relative to its
major counterparts is likely to keep it vulnerable as long as
the Fed remains comfortable with its very low borrowing costs,""
said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 In late New York trading, the euro was up 0.2 percent to
$1.4834  after earlier rising as high as $1.4902,
according to Reuters data.
 Volatility was generally higher and should remain elevated
this week given an ECB monthly policy meeting on Thursday and
U.S. jobs data on Friday. But with the Fed firmly set on
keeping rates low for an extended period, it would take very
strong jobs data for it to change its assessment materially.
 Steven Englander, head of G10 strategy at CitiFX, a
division of Citigroup, in New York, said with the ECB not
likely to raise rates until July, the big risk would be an
indication that it would move sooner or move beyond 1.75
percent by the end of the year.
 The ECB last month raised rates by a quarter of a
percentage point, to 1.25 percent, its first rate hike since
July 2008.
 ""At this stage, the euro remains very sensitive to rates,
so the indication of an 'extra' hike would be very material,
especially given the Fed's current orientation,"" Englander
said.
 One-month implied euro/dollar vols rose to around 10.95
percent  on Monday, up from 10.6 percent late last
week, but below 11.0 percent reached earlier in the week.
 One-month EUR/USD risk reversals  were around
0.75 in favor of euro puts, suggesting the premium to sell
euros remains relatively low even as investors brush off euro
zone debt problems and plow into the single currency.
 Risk reversals have seen a limited move even as spot
euro/dollar climbs higher, suggesting the risk of a sharp
turnaround in the euro remains limited at the moment.
 Analysts said any retaliation for bin Laden's killing could
be positive for the dollar if it provoked a flight-to-safety
bid, but added that it was unlikely for the moment.
 ""Bin Laden's death is seen as having little long-term
impact on the U.S. dollar's broadly negative tone, which
continues to be fueled by the Federal Reserve's very dovish
monetary policy outlook,"" Commonwealth's Esiner said.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 81.20 yen 
while the Australian dollar hit a post-float high above $1.10
before easing to $1.0940  late in the day.

 WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The United States kept Russia
on Monday on its list of countries with the worst records of
preventing copyright theft for the 14th straight year and said
China was on the list for the seventh year.
 The U.S. Trade Representative's office also issued an ""open
invitation"" to the dozens of countries listed in the report to
work together on a plan to resolve U.S. concerns.
 ""This year's Special 301 Report comes with a call to action
for our trading partners. We are ready to work intensively with
you to stop intellectual property theft that threatens
IP-related jobs in the United States and other countries,"" U.S.
Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement.
 An estimated 18 million Americans work in software, music,
movie and other industries that depend on strong enforcement of
copyright and other intellectual property rights, the USTR
said.
 Canada, India and eight other countries joined Russia and
China on the annual ""priority watch list."" It carries no threat
of sanctions, but hopes to shame governments into cracking down
on piracy and updating their copyright laws.
 Twenty-nine other countries were put on the lower level
""watch list,"" including Brazil, Colombia, Greece, Jamaica,
Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Turkey and Vietnam.
 ""Today's report is a springboard for ambitious and
collaborative partnerships in the coming year to strengthen
protection for the innovation and creativity that drive jobs
and exports for the United States and our partners around the
world,"" Kirk said.
 The International Intellectual Property Alliance, a U.S.
coalition of film, software, music and publishing groups,
estimates that U.S. companies lost more than $15 billion in
2009 due to international copyright theft.
 About $14 billion of the total was due to software piracy,
with an estimated $3.5 billion in losses in China and $1.4
billion in Russia.
 USTR identified a number of concerns in China, including
the country's ""indigenous innovation"" policies that call on
U.S. companies to transfer valuable technology to participate
in the Chinese market.
 It saw some ""early signs of progress"" in fighting online
piracy in China, but said more work needs to be done there with
an estimated 457 million Internet users and reports that 99
percent of all music downloaded is illegal.
 Russia, which hopes to join the World Trade Organization
this year, was kept on the priority watch list for a number of
""ongoing concerns, particularly with respect to piracy over the
Internet and enforcement generally,"" USTR said.
 The report criticized Canada for failing to enact
long-awaited copyright legislation and urged the northern U.S.
neighbor and major trading partner to take stronger efforts,
including at the border, to stop intellectual property theft.
 ""Canada stands virtually alone among developed economies in
failing to bring its laws up to global minimum standards for
the digital networked environment,"" the International
Intellectual Property Alliance said.

 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar declined to a
three-year trough against major currencies on Monday and will
likely remain under pressure as investors seek higher rates
offered abroad and shun the lower yielding greenback.
 The Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy loose while

interest rates in the euro zone will rise further. The euro was
last up 0.5 percent to $1.4876 , after earlier rising as
high as $1.4902, according to Reuters data.
 Many believe it is only a matter of time until EUR/USD
breaks $1.50, but the euro's rally will run out of steam at
$1.5151, a level in which multiple levels of resistance
converge, according to Brad Gareiss, technical analyst at GFT
Forex in New York.
 Data on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing expanded at a
brisker pace than expected in April while another report showed
construction spending rose at its fastest pace in 11 months in
March.
 ""The reaction should reaffirm how difficult it is for the
U.S. dollar to get a sustained lift from strong growth and
price numbers until such data starts to significantly pull
forward U.S. rate expectations,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head
of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
 The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback versus
a basket of currencies, hit a three-year low of 72.722, edging
closer to the record low of 70.698 set in March 2008. It last
traded down 0.1 percent at 72.874.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - The euro gained on Monday on
bets euro zone interest rates will keep rising, while a rally
in U.S. stocks fizzled after investors concluded the death of
al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden does little to ease global
economic and political risks.
 U.S. stocks traded higher in the morning, and oil prices
initially fell more than 3 percent as news of bin Laden's
killing by U.S. forces encouraged investors to take on risk.
 But the focus gradually shifted back to the state of the
global economy as it became clear that the death of al Qaeda's
leader would not lessen political risks related to the unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa.
 ""If anything, bin Laden's death is more symbolic,"" said
Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset
Management, with $17.5 billion in assets. ""I personally cannot

the capital markets.""

service industry groups on Monday said major emerging economies
like China, India and Brazil need to make better offers to open
their markets to save faltering world trade talks.
 ""We continue to seek an outcome that would open markets
around the world, produce new trade flows, grow our economies
and sustain and create jobs. But an agreement will not be
possible unless all major economies make meaningful
contributions,"" the eight groups said.
 The joint statement followed World Trade Organization
Director General Pascal Lamy's warning two weeks ago that an
""unbridgeable"" gap in the negotiations on manufactured goods
could doom the ten-year-old trade round.
 The U.S. groups, which included the American Farm Bureau
Federation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the
Coalition of Service Industries, said it wasn't fair to blame
just one area for the impasse since gaps in services and
agriculture also ""appear to be unbridgeable"" now.
 A ""real change in the substantive direction of the
negotiations"" is needed to produce an agreement that opens up
markets around the world to more trade, they said.
 The Doha round of world trade talks was launched in late
2001 with the goals of helping poor countries prosper through
trade. Since then, it has suffered a number of setbacks and
missed deadlines as countries have clashed over formulas for
cutting subsidies and tariffs.
 U.S. groups aren't ready to give up on the talks, but ""what
we were trying to say in the statement is there isn't any point
in continuing the negotiations in the current manner,"" said
Stephen Jacobs, director of international business policy at
the National Association of Manufacturers.
 Still, an European Union proposal that aims to bridge the
differences between the demand of the United States and major
emerging economies like China, India and Brazil is worth
exploring for the next several weeks, he said.
 Jacobs conceded a deal was unlikely by the end of 2011, as
was hoped at the start of the year.
 But he insisted it was realistic for U.S. negotiators to
believe China, India and Brazil can be persuaded to make better
offers to open their markets even though they have been
resisting for almost ten years.
 ""I honestly don't think for a good nine, maybe even ten, of
those years our friends across the negotiating table were
really listening to us,"" Jacobs said.
 ""It's finally starting to sink in"" that the United States
will not agree to a deal unless it gets new market access in
major developing countries, he said.

 * No sign that other ECB policymakers agree with him

 * Greek finance minister insists restructuring not on table
 * Suggests instead an extension of bailout loans
 
 By Gilbert Kreijger
 TILBURG, Netherlands, May 2 (Reuters) - European Central
Bank policymaker Nout Wellink said on Monday that he was open to
the idea of extending maturities on Greek debt, becoming the
first senior ECB official to admit that possibility publicly.
 Wellink, a member of the ECB's Governing Council, said he
opposed any cut in the principal of Greek bonds. But in contrast
to other ECB policymakers, who have rejected any talk of debt
restructuring as dangerous, he added that it might make sense to
extend deadlines for repaying the principal.
 ""Restructuring is essentially saying: 'Send me the bill. We
feel sorry for you.' You shouldn't do that. Paying the bill
hurts,"" Wellink said, taking questions from students at Tilburg
University in the Netherlands.
 ""It may sometimes take longer than expected. It can
sometimes lead to a restructuring -- but not in the way some
advocate it to be -- that...leads to a longer maturity of debt.""
 Wellink did not elaborate on how Greece might reschedule its
327 billion euro debt, and it was not clear whether his comments
might signal any change of stance at the ECB as a whole.
 His term as president of the Dutch central bank will end on
June 30, after which his successor, who has not been selected
yet, will take over his seat on the ECB's 23-member Governing
Council.
 Financial markets have increasingly been speculating that
some form of Greek debt restructuring may be necessary to get
its economy on a recovery track. Two German government advisers
said on Saturday that a restructuring was inevitable.
 But other ECB officials have insisted that any talk of
restructuring would be counter-productive, by panicking
investors and worsening the market environment for other
debt-ridden countries such as Ireland and Portugal.
 For example, ECB Executive Board member Jose Manuel
Gonzalez-Paramo said last month that a Greek debt restructuring
would probably do more damage to the region's financial system
than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 
 NOT ON THE TABLE
 ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio repeated that line at a
financial conference in Brussels on Monday. Asked whether a
Greek restructuring was on the table at the moment, he told
reporters: ""No. We have said that clearly enough many times.""
 In a newspaper interview published on Monday, Greece's
finance minister George Papaconstantinou also ruled out a debt
restructuring, saying an alternative idea might be to delay
repayment of emergency loans under the country's 110 billion
euro international bailout. [ID:nLDE7410L3]
 Some Greek politicians and officials in European governments
believe a ""soft"" restructuring, which would involve creditors
voluntarily extending maturities on Greek bonds, could help the
country without causing panic in markets or seriously damaging
banks in Greece and around the region.
 Many analysts, however, think this would just push some of
Greece's debt burden into the future without addressing its root
problem, the size of its debt relative to its economy.
 ""Lengthening the maturity of debt for Greece does not solve
anything. It's a temporary solution like it was with the bailout
package. They have to reduce the overall level of debt to GDP,""
said Alessandro Gainsanti, a strategist at ING.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
three-year low against major currencies on Monday, and
expectations the Federal Reserve will keep monetary policy
loose even as interest rates are rising elsewhere raised the
prospect of further weakening.
 The euro climbed to a 17-month high above $1.49 after
surprisingly strong manufacturing data bolstered chances that
interest rates in the euro zone will rise further. Traders said
a break of $1.50 is just a matter of time.
 Data showed U.S. manufacturing expanded at a brisker pace
than expected in April, although growth slowed from the prior
month, while prices of raw materials hit near three-year highs.
Another report showed construction spending rose at its fastest
pace in 11 months in March.
 ""The reaction should reaffirm how difficult it is for the
U.S. dollar to get a sustained lift from strong growth and
price numbers until such data starts to significantly pull
forward U.S. rate expectations,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head
of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
 The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback versus
a basket of currencies, hit a three-year low of 72.722, edging
closer to the record low of 70.698 set in March 2008.
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.4876, after earlier rising
as high as $1.4902 on Reuters data. Traders cited demand from a
UK bank and European sovereign names but added that flows were
scarce due to market holidays in parts of Asia and in Britain.
 ""We've come a long way without a correction but there's
really no sign of anything that would pull the euro lower right
now,"" said Shaun Osborne, senior strategist at TD Securities.
 At this point, he said, every European Central Bank meeting
carries at least the risk of a rate hike, though he predicted
authorities would stand pat this month after hiking in April.
 The ECB holds its monthly policy meeting on Thursday.
 FLEETING GAINS ON BIN LADEN'S DEATH
 The dollar rose briefly and oil prices fell overnight after
U.S. forces said they had killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden, but traders said the news was not enough to reverse the
dollar-selling trend that has pushed the currency in recent
weeks toward a record low against its major rivals.
 World leaders called for vigilance toward any possible
retaliation. Analysts said such action could be positive for
the dollar if it provoked a flight-to-safety bid but added this
was unlikely for the moment.
 ""An event like a retaliatory action would be dollar
positive if it affects risk sentiment. But risk as a driver of
the FX market has been much less than it has been,"" said Kasper
Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.
 Strategists at BNP Paribas said, ""While it may be a heroic
assumption to presume a lowering of geopolitical risk, were
that to prove the case it may bring some area of the U.S.
defense budget previously seen as sacrosanct into the
spotlights as legitimate targets for spending reduction.
 ""Anything that enhances prospects for medium-term fiscal
consolidation plays to the 'tighter fiscal policy, monetary
policy easier for longer' theme that is a dollar negative,""
they wrote in a note to clients.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 81.22 yen while the
Australian dollar hit a new post-float high above $1.10 before
easing to $1.0967.
 A sharp fall in silver prompted some profit-taking in the
Aussie and other high-flying commodity currencies, including
the Canadian dollar, which pulled back from a 3-1/2-year high
versus it U.S. counterpart.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Monday
after the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, but oil
prices rose as investors concluded his death would not reduce
the risks in the world economy.
 The euro hit a 17-month high against the greenback after
surprisingly strong manufacturing data in the euro zone added
to expectations that European policy makers will keep raising
interest rates.
 U.S. President Barack Obama announced late on Sunday that
bin Laden had been killed in a firefight with U.S. forces, and
the news initially drove oil prices down more than 3 percent.
However, oil markets later resumed their rise on the view that
bin Laden's death did not lessen geopolitical risks related to
the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. For details,
see [ID:nBINLADEN].
 Major U.S. stock indexes gained about 0.4 percent and
European shares rose for an eighth straight session. In
addition to the bin Laden news lifting market sentiment, a spat
of proposed mergers and acquisitions, as well as data on
manufacturing and construction spending, provided economic
justification for the equities rally. [ID:nN02208702]
 ""If anything, Bin Laden's death is more symbolic,"" said
Keith Wirtz, Chief Investment Officer at Fifth Third Asset
Management, Inc., with $17.5 billion in assets.
 ""I personally cannot draw a linkage between this macro
event and the fundamentals of the capital markets,"" he added.
 Jerry Harris, president of asset management at Sterne Agee
in Birmingham, Alabama, added that stocks seemed to be in a
position to go higher anyway, due to good corporate news.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 59.68 points,
or 0.47 percent, to 12,870.22, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> gained 5.84 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,369.45.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 10.03 points, or 0.35
percent, at 2,883.57.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares climbed 0.11 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.32 percent.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for June
delivery  rose to a session high of $114.60, up 67 cents,
after falling to $110.82 overnight. In London, ICE Brent crude
 hit a session high of $126.35, up 46 cents, after
dropping to $121.67 overnight.
 Spot gold prices  rose $10.15, or 0.65 percent, to
$1,573.70 an ounce.
 EURO AT 17-MONTH HIGH
 The dollar slipped because the impact of bin Laden's death
was ultimately negligible for the dollar, said Shaun Osborne,
senior strategist at TD Securities. [ID:nL3E7G2092]
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.26 percent.
 ""In the end it's monetary policy expectations which are the
driving force for dollar weakness,"" said Marcus Hettinger,
currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 The euro hit a 17-month high above $1.48 on Monday as
surprisingly strong manufacturing data in the euro zone
bolstered the chances interest rates there could rise again to
fend off inflation.
 Against the dollar, the euro  was up 0.64 percent at
$1.4893.
 U.S. Treasury prices initially slipped after the killing of
the al Qaeda leader reduced the appetite for safe-haven bonds,
but later erased losses.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
3/32, with the yield at 3.2788 percent.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2011 11:32AM ET</span>",EMERGING MARKETS-Colombian peso gains on rate hike outlook," * Colombia peso gains on outlook for rate hikes
 * Brazilian real, Mexican peso little changed
 * Chile peso slips back from record highs
 By Jeb Blount
 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 2 (Reuters) - Colombia's peso gained
against the U.S. dollar on Monday, extending 32-month highs,
after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate and
suggested more increases were to come.
 The Colombian peso  gained 0.25 percent to a bid
price of 1763.30 to the dollar on the local spot market. On
Friday the central bank raised the benchmark rate a quarter
percentage point to 3.75 percent.
 Elsewhere in Latin America, the Chilean peso  and
Peruvian sol  firmed against the dollar, while the
Brazilian real  and Mexican Peso  were little
changed from Friday.
 Rate hikes make Colombian investments more attractive
relative to those in countries such as the United States, where
rates near zero have led investors borrow in dollars to invest
in higher-yield emerging markets -- a strategy known as the
carry trade.
 The rate outlook overcame concern that the government
purchase of $20 million or more a day of U.S. currency will
stem the peso's surge, said Katia Diaz, foreign exchange
analyst with 4Cast Inc. in New York.
 ""The Colombian peso is firmer despite uncertainty
surrounding the government's dollar purchases because the carry
trade remains strong,"" she said. ""It helps that the central
bank had a hawkish interest rate tone in its latest
statement.""
 Strengthening in the peso may continue. One-month Colombian
peso non-deliverable forwards, or NDFs, gained 0.1 percent to
1.764.90 bid from 1.766.60 bid on Friday. NDFs are a popular
way for investors to hedge their risk or speculate on the peso
without having to sell the actual Colombian currency.
 Because the Colombian peso is not convertible and subject
to government exchange controls, some investors find it more
convenient to trade NDFs, which settle in dollars, rather than
pesos.
 Brazil's real was little changed, gaining 0.06 percent to
1.579 bid to the dollar. Mexico's peso firmed 0.02 percent to
11.4964 to the dollar.
 ""We are likely to see little movement in the next few days
in the real,"" said Carlos Gandolfo, a partner at Pioneer
Corretora de Cambio, a Sao Paulo currency brokerage.
 Chile's peso weakened 0.13 percent to 460.90, easing from
three-year highs, and the Peruvian sol gained 0.39 percent to
2.8370 bid.

 * Exports rise to $20.17 bln vs $19.29 bln in March

(Recasts, adds details, context)
 SAO PAULO, May 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's trade surplus in
April widened for the third consecutive month, the trade
ministry said on Monday, as exports grew at a faster pace than
imports despite the strong local currency.
 Brazil posted a trade surplus  of $1.86 billion
last month, up from $1.55 billion in March and a $1.28 billion
surplus in April 2010.
 A surge in commodities prices and a recovery in global
demand have improved Brazil's trade balance over the past few
months, which may lead the government to revise upward its
surplus forecast for the year, currently at $12 billion to 13
billion.
 In 2010, Brazil's trade surplus dwindled to $20.3 billion
from $25.3 billion the previous year as the fastest economic
expansion in nearly three decades, coupled with a strong
currency, increased demand for imports.
 In April, exports reached $20.17 billion, up from $19.29
billion in March and $15.16 billion in April last year.
 Imports last month totaled $18.31 billion, compared with
$17.73 billion in March. In April 2010, imports were $13.88
billion.
 Brazil is a major exporter of food and mineral commodities,
including soybeans, beef and iron ore.

(Recasts, adds quotes)
 By Gilbert Kreijger
 TILBURG, Netherlands, May 2 (Reuters) - European central
banker Nout Wellink said on Monday he opposed a debt
restructuring for struggling Greece but was open to the idea of
a possible extension of maturities.
 In the first public comments from a member of the ECB's
Governing Council pointing to a possible rescheduling of
repayments for the debt-mired euro zone state, Wellinck said:
""Restructuring is essentially saying: 'Send me the bill. We feel
sorry for you.' You shouldn't do that. Paying the bill hurts.
 ""It may sometimes take longer than expected. It can
sometimes lead to a restructuring -- but not in the way some
advocate it to be -- that ... leads to a longer maturity of
debt.""
 Wellink, taking questions from students at Tilburg
University in the south of the Netherlands, said that if Greece
did not repay borrowed funds in full, it could stay frozen out
of the financial markets.
 ""You also have to say: 'If you don't pay the bills you never
have to knock on our doors again. That your access to financial
markets is closed...
 ""That you will come in a downward spiral, whose negative
effects are even bigger than the pain you suffer and have to
suffer on the short term.' You have to explain that it
(restructuring) is not an option,"" Wellink said.
 He added that Greece must find a way to reduce its budget
deficit ""in such a way to balance spending and income again.""
 Wellink, who also heads the Dutch central bank, said he
expected Spain to be able to resolve its budget problems.
 ""Spain has a tradition of solid government finances. It has
now gotten out of hand and they are dealing with it. Spain had a
low debt (to gross domestic product) ratio. Spain should be able
to solve its problem,"" Wellink said.

 (Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - The dollar trimmed gains on Monday
as investors said Osama bin Laden's death would do little to
repair negative sentiment for the dollar, which has been stung
by prospects that U.S. interest rates will stay low.
 The euro recouped earlier losses versus the dollar after
surprisingly strong euro zone manufacturing data fuelled
speculation that overall growth in the region would prompt the
European Central Bank to keep raising interest rates.
 In contrast, the Federal Reserve has signalled U.S. rates
will stay low.
 This is seen keeping intact the dollar's rate disadvantage
against the euro and pushing the single currency to the
psychological $1.50 level, while the dollar is hobbled near a
three-year low hit against a currency basket earlier on Monday.
 ""We saw a pretty good reading of manufacturing PMI in the
euro zone,"" said Marcus Hettinger, currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in Zurich.
 ""In the end it's monetary policy expectations which are the
driving force for dollar weakness,"" he said, adding that the
long-term impact of bin Laden's death on the dollar was
negligible.
 By 1014 GMT, the euro traded 0.2 percent higher on the day
at $1.4830, recovering from a session low $1.4765.
 Traders cited demand from a UK bank and European sovereign
names as pushing the euro higher, but they added that flows were
scarce due to market holidays in parts of Asia and in Britain.
 Euro gains stung the dollar, which had initially climbed
after U.S. officials said U.S. Special Forces had killed Bin
Laden in Pakistan. The death of the al Qaeda leader was seen as
positive for Washington, which had been hunting him for nearly a
decade.
 The announcement triggered short-covering dollar demand, but
the U.S. currency was unable to maintain its upward momentum,
suggesting risk sentiment stemming from geopolitical events was
not the key focus of a market overwhelmingly concerned with
relative interest rate differentials.
 World leaders called for vigilance towards any possible
retaliation. Analysts said such action could be positive for the
dollar if it provoked a flight to safety towards the U.S.
currency but added this was unlikely for the moment.
 ""An event like a retaliatory action would be dollar positive
if it affects risk sentiment. But risk as a driver of the FX
market has been much less than it has been,"" said Kasper
Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.
 
 EURO SUPPORTED
 The single currency remained close to $1.4882, a 17-month
high hit last week, and technical analysts at Commerzbank saw
support around $1.4720, a high hit in December 2008.
 In a note, they said they also saw support at $1.4747, a
level on a trend line drawn from highs of February and April.
Many analysts say a rise to $1.50 is just a matter of time.
 The dollar index traded at 73.026, a touch higher on the
day. It retreated from a session high, and hovered near 72.813
touched in the Asian session, its weakest since mid-2008.
 The index's decline of almost 4 percent in April has raised
some concern about a correction in its downward momentum. Some
measures, such as the 14-day relative strength index, show the
dollar is oversold from a short-term perspective.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 81.50 yen.
 Illiquid markets resulted in choppy trade in the Australian
dollar, which fell about 0.2 percent to $1.0943, retreating from
a 29-year high of $1.1011 hit in early trade.
 A sharp fall in silver has prompted profit-taking in the
Aussie and other high-flying commodity currencies including the
Canadian dollar, which pulled back from a 3 1/2-year high versus
it U.S. counterpart.

 * Manufacturing PMI strengthens in India, eases in S. Korea
 * China manufacturing growth slows in April on tightening
 * Euro zone bounce again driven by Germany
 
 By Jonathan Cable and Tony Munroe
 LONDON/MUMBAI, May 2 (Reuters) - Euro zone factories ramped
up output and prices last month while manufacturers in India
also powered ahead, business surveys showed on Monday, keeping
two cycles of likely further interest rate hikes on track.
 In China, monetary tightening looked to be biting into the
economy more deeply than expected as the factory sector there
cooled, while data due later from the United States is expected
to show factories in the world's largest economy have eased off
the gas too.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), which records manufacturing activity across all the major
euro area economies, rose to 58.0 last month from March's 57.5.
The index hit a near-11 year high of 59.0 in February.
 Frustratingly for policymakers, the bounce was once again
driven by Germany, Europe's largest economy, and France whose
growth overshadowed a continued slide to stagnation in Spain and
a persistent contraction in Greece.
 ""Manufacturing activity was once again robust in April in
the core northern euro zone economies, led by Germany. Elsewhere
the situation was not so bright,"" said Howard Archer at IHS
Global Insight.
 Earlier figures showed India's factories expanded in April
for the 25th consecutive month and at their strongest pace since
November with the PMI rising to 58.0 from 57.9 in March, well
above the 50 mark that divides growth from expansion.
[ID:nBMA009736]
 Data on Sunday showed China's official PMI fell to 52.9 in
April from 53.4 in March, falling short of market forecasts for
a rise to 54 as growth in new orders weakened to an eight-month
low. [ID:nL3E7G100E]
 ""Overall, the PMI shows there is still a possibility that
the Chinese economy may slow down, especially as falling demand
growth leads to adjustments in inventories, increasing the
possibility of slowing economic growth,"" said Zhang Liqun, a
government researcher.
 ""The fall may show that export growth will continue to slow
down,"" Zhang said in a comment on behalf of the China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing, which compiles the official PMI.
 The data sends worrying signals to the global economy, which
has grown reliant on Chinese demand as a source of growth with
the United States, Europe and Japan struggling to recover from
the financial crisis.
 South Korea's HSBC Markit manufacturing PMI fell to its
lowest level since November last year at 51.69 in April from
52.84 in March.
 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 The increase in output is coming at a cost and the euro zone
PMI output price index stayed high at 61.0, only nudging down
from March's survey peak of 61.5, which was revised up from a
flash reading of 60.7.
 Official flash data released on Friday showed consumer
prices in the bloc rose 2.8 percent in April, up from March's
2.7 percent and above expectations for an unchanged reading.
 The figures will bolster those policymakers at the European
Central Bank who believe the strong recovery in Europe's core
economies calls for more monetary tightening before price rises
become entrenched, even while weaker euro zone states remain
engulfed in the debt crisis.
 The ECB was the first of the world's big four central banks
to raise rates when it upped them by 25 basis points from a
record low of 1.0 percent earlier this month but is not seen
making its next tightening move until July. [ECB/INT]
 ""By showing ongoing robust euro zone manufacturing activity
and rising price pressures, the purchasing managers' survey
reinforces belief that the ECB will pull the interest rate
trigger sooner rather than later,"" Archer said.
 Indian inflation indicators showed some easing in price
pressures but from elevated levels, suggesting the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) will also hike again, as early as Tuesday, for
the ninth time since March 2010. [ID:nL3E7FT073]
 ""The number confirms that growth is not a concern and that
the RBI can continue its tightening cycle uninterrupted,"" said
Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India and ASEAN at HSBC.
 The Reserve Bank of India is expected to hike on Tuesday,
probably by 25 basis points but possibly by 50 after March
headline inflation rose to nearly 9 percent.
 In China, inflation is running at its fastest in nearly
three years even after a series of policy steps to rein in
prices, including raising interest rates and banks' reserve
requirements several times, as well as ordering banks to lend
less and speeding the pace of currency appreciation.
 Economists polled by Reuters still expect strong economic
growth in China this year of over 9 percent, so remain on guard
for further monetary tightening to bring inflation under
control.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - The euro zone's manufacturing
sector kept its foot firmly on the accelerator last month and
factories continued to ramp up their prices, a business survey
showed on Monday.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), which records manufacturing activity across all the major
euro area economies, rose to 58.0 last month from March's 57.5.
The index hit a near-11 year high of 59.0 in February.
 The figure was revised up from a flash reading of 57.7 and
marked the index's 19th month above the 50 mark dividing growth
from contraction.
 The euro zone manufacturing PMI output index rose to 60.2
from the previous month's 58.5 and the flash estimate of 60.0.
 ""Euro zone manufacturers reported that the growth surge
continued into April, meaning 2011 has so far seen the best
start to a year since the dot-com boom of 2000,"" said Chris
Williamson at Markit.
 But the bounce was once again driven by Germany, Europe's
largest economy, and France whose growth overshadowed a
continued slide to stagnation in Spain and a persistent
contraction in Greece.
 ""The two disappointments were the near-record increase in
manufacturers' selling prices, which will fuel inflationary
concerns among policymakers, and the growing divergence between
the performances of the core and periphery,"" Williamson said.
 The output price index dropped from March's survey high of
61.5 to 61.0, revised up from a flash reading of 60.7.
 Official flash data released on Friday showed consumer
prices rose 2.8 percent in April, up from March's 2.7 percent
and above expectations for 2.7 percent.
 The figures will bolster those policymakers at the European
Central Bank who believe the strong recovery in Europe's core
economies calls for more monetary tightening before price rises
become entrenched, even while weaker euro zone states remain
engulfed in the debt crisis.
 The ECB was the first of the big four central banks to raise
rates when it upped them by 25 basis points from a record low of
1.0 percent earlier this month but is not seen making its next
move until July.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2011 03:56AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar up,Wall St eyes gains after bin Laden news"," * Bin Laden death gives initial perception of reduced risk
 * Stocks, dollar rise; oil falls
 * Wall Street set for gains
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - The killing of Al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces prompted investors on Monday to
strip some of the risk premium underpinning world asset prices,
lifting the dollar, boosting stocks and weakening commodities.
 Wall Street looked set to open with solid gains, lifted also
by signs of economic growth in Europe and India.
 Oil, gold and silver prices all fell as reaction to the
death of the West's most wanted man swept across thinly traded
financial markets.
 But investors warned that this kind of reaction to major
news is often only temporary, and the initial gains were already
cooling.
 ""Markets across the globe received a bit of a boost ... as
news broke that U.S. forces had killed Osama bin Laden. However,
like many euphoric bounces, they are often short-lived,
especially given the possibility for reprisal attacks from
extremists,"" said Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Index.
 Holidays in many countries -- including China, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Thailand and Britain -- meant trading was limited.
 Nonetheless, the initial reaction was a boost for U.S.
assets and a modest fillip for equities.
 The dollar rebounded from a three-year low against a basket
of currencies, where it had languished as a result of
perceptions that the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no hurry to
tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent, well off its earlier daily
highs. The announcement of bin Laden's death triggered
short-covering demand for the dollar after the dollar index had
hit its weakest since mid-2008.
 Analysts said the news would have only a limited impact on
the dollar in general because interest rates, not geopolitical
events, are the overriding driver.
 ""Risk as a driver of the FX market has been much less than
it has been ... The main trend is relative dollar weakness due
to monetary policy,"" said Kasper Kirkegaard, currency strategist
at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
 Dollar-sensitive oil and gold fell, dipping by as much as 2
percent at some point. U.S. crude was down close to 1.8 percent
below $112 a barrel compared with its 31-month peak of $114.18
set on Friday.
 Silver tumbled 10 percent, its steepest fall since late
2008, hit by the dollar, increased margins for futures trading
and a technical overhang after a 170 percent rally over the last
12 months to a record high last week.
""There is nothing from a fundamental perspective to cause a
fall this large. Silver has been the most rapidly appreciating
of the metals in the past months and if there was one that
looked a bit frothy it was silver,"" said Ben Westmore,
commodities economist at National Australia Bank.
 
 STOCKS GAIN
 European shares, minus Britain's usual contribution, gained
around 0.2 percent, lifting MSCI's all-country world stock index
by 0.2 percent.
 Japan's Nikkei average earlier rose 1.4 percent on the day,
closing above the closely watched 10,000 mark for the first time
since the March 11 earthquake.
 Economic news played into the mood. Euro zone factories
ramped up output and prices last month while manufacturers in
India also powered ahead, according to business surveys.
 In China, monetary tightening looked to be biting more
deeply than expected as the factory sector there cooled.
 U.S. Treasury yields initially pushed higher across the
curve, with the 10-year rising from a six-week trough of 3.273
percent. It was later at 3.299 percent.
 ""By lowering national security risks overall, this is likely
to bolster equity markets and lower U.S. Treasury prices in a
reverse flight to quality movement,"" said Mohamed El-Erian,
Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer at
PIMCO, which oversees $1.2 trillion in assets.
 ""Oil markets are likely to be the most volatile given their
higher sensitivity to the tug of war between lower risk overall
and the possibility of isolated disturbances in some parts of
the Middle East and central Asia,"" he said.

Monday.	
 The 21,000-tonne vessel MV Gemini, operated by

 The ship had 25 crew members on board from South Korea,

outwit an international flotilla of warships patrolling the busy

 Typically the pirates anchor the vessels off their land base
until a ransom is paid, at which point the vessel along with its
crew and cargo is released.	
 More than 40 percent of the world's seaborne oil supply
passes through the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea and is at
risk from pirate gangs.

 SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from
three-year lows and U.S. crude slid more than 1 percent on
Monday after news al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in
a firefight with U.S. forces reduced the perception of security
risks facing the United States.	
 The news appeared to have provided a reason for investors to
unwind extended positions in many assets, including very short
dollar positions in holiday-thinned Asian trade.	
 Earlier, investors had a taste of how vulnerable overbought
assets can be to a sudden sell-off when silver dropped 10
percent after hitting a record high last week and the Australian
dollar slumped nearly a full cent after reaching a post-float
peak of $1.1011 .	


 U.S. President Barack Obama said the Al Qaeda leader was
killed in a firefight with U.S. forces and his body was
recovered.	
 U.S. stock index futures  added to gains, Japan's
Nikkei average rose 1.4 percent on the day, while U.S.

 U.S. crude  fell more than 1 percent to a session low
of $112.21, retreating from a 31-month peak of $114.18 set on
Friday. 
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, jumped from a three-year
low of 72.813 to 73.227.	
 U.S. Treasury yields pushed higher across the curve with the
10-year rising to 3.308 percent from a six-week
trough of 3.273 percent.	
 Meanwhile, silver was nursing heavy losses after skidding
about 10 percent to a low of $42.58 . It last stood at
$44.64, off a record high of $49.51 set last week. Gold fell to
$1,548 from an all-time high of $1,575.79.	
 Still, once the dust settles, analysts expect the recent
trends including a weak U.S. dollar and higher commodity prices
to resume, especially given that the U.S. Federal Reserve in no

soft side and the market is going to keep a lid on yields and

 * Dollar rises after U.S. says Osama Bin Laden killed
 * But greenback climb seen as temporary, knee-jerk reaction
 * Trade illiquid as many Asia markets on holiday
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rebounded from a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Monday as news
that a U.S.-led operation had killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden prompted short-covering in a heavily-sold greenback,
though traders think any impact will be temporary.
 The currency was due for a corrective rebound, dealers said,
with players having sold the dollar against pretty much
everything from the euro and commodity currencies to oil and
precious metals for the past few weeks.
 Still, perceptions that the U.S. central bank's stimulative
policy stance will continue to cheapen its value is likely to
keep hurting the dollar, they said.
 In a knee-jerk reaction to the news that Al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden was killed on Sunday in a firefight with U.S.
forces in Pakistan and his body was recovered, the dollar was
bought back broadly.
 U.S. stock futures price rose while oil prices fell, though
illiquid trading conditions due to holidays in many markets in
Asia and the UK on Monday are exaggerating price moves.
 ""Although some could argue that this news has taken out one
risk factor for the global economy, my overall impression is
that Osama bin Laden already seemed like he was from a page in a
history book,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust Bank.
 ""The dollar's probably been bought back as dollar-selling
had gone a bit too far. But there's no change in the fact that
the Fed's exit (from its easy policy) will still be some way
off,"" he added.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> rose about 0.2 percent to
73.152, after falling to 72.813, a fresh three-year low in
earlier trade.
 As the index has continued to slide for the past two weeks
and logged a decline of almost 4 percent in April, a fall big
enough to cause worries about speed correction. Some
oscillators, such as the 14-day RSI, showed the dollar was
oversold in the near term.
 Highlighting how much market players are going short on the
dollar, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
released on Friday showed currency speculators boosted bets
against the greenback in the week ended April 26.
 Their euro long positions rose to 68,279 contracts, the
highest since December 2007, from 62,195 contracts the previous
week.
 The euro stood at $1.4792 , down 0.1 percent on the
day and off a 17-month high of $1.4882 hit last week.
 The Australian dollar had a rollercoaster ride, falling
about 0.2 percent , after marking a 29-year high of
$1.1011.
<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Graphic on Aussie dollar http://link.reuters.com/cun39r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 A staggeringly sharp fall in silver has also prompted
profit-taking in high-flying commodity currencies, such as the
Aussie and the Canadian dollar, and served as a reminder of how
a reversal in positioning can cause massive swings.
 The price of silver  fell more than 9 percent in
holiday-thinned Monday trade, and gold  also fell after
hitting a record high. The move in silver came after news last
week the CME had raised margins on Comex 5000 silver <0#SI:>.
 ""If adjustment is confined to just silver, it won't be a big
deal. But if this moves spills over to other commodities, that
could certainly hurt commodity currencies, such as the
Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. And we could see a
rebound in the U.S. dollar,"" said Koji Fukaya, chief strategist
at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.
 The U.S. dollar slipped rose 0.4 percent to 81.50 yen 
after having fallen to a fresh one-month low of 81.05 yen 
in early Monday trade.
 Some players are ready to buy the dollar above 80.90 yen, a
50 percent retracement of its rise from a record low of 76.25 to
a high of 85.53 hit in early April, market players said.
 The dollar also gained 0.5 percent against the safe-haven
Swiss franc to 0.8694 franc  on the news of bin Laden's
death

 The U.S. dollar fell to a fresh three-year low against a

 This has helped the high-flying Australian dollar

 With both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan maintaining
ultra-loose monetary policies, investors have been seeking
higher yielding assets in many fast-growing emerging markets in
Asia.	
 This has prompted many Asian authorities to tighten policy
as inflationary pressure grows. Data on Sunday showed China's

1069,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2011 11:32PM ET</span>",POLL-Japan fund managers' global stock weighting near 12-yr low," * Fund managers nudge equity weightings up from 12-yr low
 * Bond allocation slips from record high hit in March
 * Concern over commodity prices, monetary tightening weigh

 By Hugh Lawson and Yoshiko Mori	
 TOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - The global stock weighting for
Japanese fund managers hovered near a 12-year low in April, hurt
by worries about the impact of Japan's triple disaster that also
kept their weighting for bonds near record highs.	
 The March 11 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis
resulted in severe power and parts shortages in Japan,
disrupting domestic and overseas production for many global
manufacturers, with auto and electronics makers among the worst
affected. 
 The Reuters survey, taken before earnings seasons in the
United States and Japan got into full swing, showed the average
weighting for global equities inched up in April to 42.6 percent
after tumbling to a 12-year low of 42.4 percent in March.	
 Fund managers were also concerned about high oil and other
commodity prices and a gradual shift towards tighter monetary
policy in some regions.	
 ""Financial markets may see a negative effect from declining
purchasing power amid rising commodity prices. We are cautious
about the generally optimistic view on economic prospects and
think risk assets face a correction in the next few months,""
said a fund manager who declined to be identified.

 
 The equities weighting for Japan fell 1.5 percentage points
to a seven-month low of 26.9 percent in April.	
 ""Tokyo stocks may not necessarily stick to the scenario of a
traditional recovery, and they may be in for an unsettled
period,"" said a separate fund manager.  
 Japanese corporate earnings are widely expected to take a
big hit in the April-September first half of this fiscal year
although many see a recovery in the second half.	
 The poll of 12 asset management companies was conducted from
April 14 to 22, when Japan's Nikkei stock average traded
mostly between 9,500 and 9,700 after plunging as low as 8,227.63
the previous month.	
 Heartened by better-than-expected domestic earnings and more
visibility from some companies about when they will return to
full production levels, the benchmark index has since climbed to
around 9,900.	
 The equities weighting for the United States and Canada fell
to a five-month low of 38.9 percent, while that for the euro
zone rose to a five-month high 14.2 percent. 
 For bonds, fund managers trimmed their global average
weighting to 48.8 percent in April from a record-high 49.6
percent.	
 The Japanese debt weighting in their bond portfolios rose to
a record 36.4 percent from 34.8 percent, despite dismal
government bond yields and the fact that Japan's public debt --
already twice the size of its $5 trillion economy -- is set to
grow as the country pays for reconstruction work.	
 ""For Japanese government bonds, the focal point is how much
of an impact the two big supply shocks of the earthquake and
high oil prices have on the Japanese economy. Instead of being
inflationary factors, they are likely to slow down the economy
and push yields lower via a worsening of consumer and corporate
sentiment,"" said Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda
Life Insurance.	
Oil prices hit their highest level since the
September 2008 global financial crisis just before the April
survey period, and have since set fresh 2-1/2 year highs. 
 ""Japan's deteriorating fiscal position could possibly push
up yields. We don't expect the Bank of Japan to underwrite JGBs,
but fiscal discipline will be in doubt if there is a significant
amount of additional bond issuance,"" Kodama added.	
 Fund managers cut their average bond weighting for the euro
zone to a record-low 24.1 percent as the region struggles with a
debt crisis of its own. 
 The average weighting for U.S. and Canadian bonds fell back
to 28.2 percent in April from 28.8 percent in March.	
 In one sign of a slight return to risk, Japan's money
managers raised their average weighting for alternative assets
including hedge funds to 1.8 percent, the highest since such
positions were first included in the survey in January 2010. 
 Their weighting for cash positions edged down to 5.1 percent
after jumping a percentage point to 5.2 percent in March.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Monday as
investors cheered gains on Wall Street, but commodity prices
suffered a bout of profit taking with silver sliding about 10
percent.	
 Financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia
and Thailand are all shut on Monday for public holidays, a
factor seen contributing to thin trading conditions that could
exaggerate price action.	
 Of the few markets in the region that are open, Japan's
Nikkei average rose 1.1 percent, South Korea's KOSPI
put on 0.9 percent, but Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index
slipped 0.5 percent.	
 MSCI's gauge of Asian stocks excluding Japan
climbed 0.2 percent, recovering from Friday's 0.4 percent
decline.	
 The dollar, however, stayed under pressure and fell to a
one-month low against the yen at 80.97 . Analysts said
this could curb further gains in the Nikkei.	
 ""A stronger yen may put cap on exporters, so profit-taking
may kick in around 9,950,"" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general
manager at Daiwa Securities of the Nikkei average.	
 Silver skidded about 10 percent to a low of $42.58 ,
well off a record high of $49.51 set on Thursday. Gold fell to
$1,543.50 from an all-time high of $1,575.79.	
 The move came after data last Friday showed speculators had
scaled back their bullish bets in COMEX silver futures and
options to the lowest level since early February. It also
followed news last week the CME had raised margins on Comex 5000
silver <0#SI:>.	
 ""The reduction in COMEX length before the weekend, margin
increase and holidays in large parts of Asia and Europe set the
stage for a move like this,"" said Natalie Robertson, analyst at
ANZ in Melbourne.

 DOLLAR DOLDRUMS	
 With the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates near zero,
the dollar saw little respite. The dollar index , which

 By Amena Bakr and Reem Shamseddine
 DUBAI/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, May 1 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's
crude oil output edged back up in April to around 8.5 million
barrels per day (bpd) from roughly 8.3 million bpd in March as
demand picks up, Saudi-based industry sources said on Sunday.
 The kingdom slashed output by 800,000 bpd in March, due to
oversupply, oil minister Ali al-Naimi said last month, adding
that he expected production in April to be a little higher than
March's level. [ID:nLDE73G0AA]
 ""Production was around 8.5 (million bpd) in April and the
reason we raised output is because there was higher demand,""
said one Saudi-based industry source, declining to comment on
where demand had strengthened.
 A second industry source said the 8.5 million bpd may not
include production from the Neutral Zone, which Saudi shares
with Kuwait.
 Saudi crude exports were also higher in April from February
and March, said a trader without quantifying figures.
 
 ANTICIPATED DEMAND
 Since the start of the year consumers have urged the oil
exporters to pump more crude to put a cap on oil prices, which
surged to more than $127 a barrel last month, its highest level
in 2-1/2 years amid unrest in North Africa and the Middle East
and a declining dollar exchange rate.
 ""But the key is, Saudi will only increase output if there is
a supply gap in the market or to meet extra demand (and) not for
any price-related reason because the price today is due to
speculation,"" said another Saudi-based source.
 Gulf oil exporters expect demand to go up in the coming
months as European refiners return from their spring maintenance
period and Japan scrambles to rebuild its earthquake-shattered
electricity grid.
 ""I expect [Saudi] production to respond to market demand ...
and I expect it to be around 9 million bpd towards end of
May-early June,"" said Sadad al-Husseini, a former top executive
at State oil giant Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL].
 A Gulf-based trader also said there is strong demand for
lighter grades on the back of Japan's requirements.
 The top OPEC producer had sold 2 million barrels of a
special blend of crude to compensate for the high-quality Libyan
barrels lost.

 * Merkel also wants Germans in other top financial posts
 
 By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, May 1 (Reuters) - German chancellor Angela Merkel is
hesitating to back the nomination of Italy's Mario Draghi as the
next president of the European Central Bank because she wants
several demands met in return, a magazine said on Sunday.
 Der Spiegel said that Merkel wants two Germans to be
appointed to top European finance positions in addition to
further concessions on the permanent euro zone bailout fund, the
European Stability Mechanism (ESM). [ID:nLDE72K2B0]
 German government officials on Friday rejected media reports
that Merkel has already agreed to back Draghi, the head of the
Bank of Italy, to succeed ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet
after France threw its own support behind Draghi last week.
[ID:nLDE73S1G3]
 ""Merkel is hesistating in endorsing Draghi (because) she
wants to win at least a few consolation prizes through
bargaining,"" Der Spiegel said, a reference to her dashed hopes
of having a German succeed Trichet when Bundesbank head Axel
Weber quit.
 ""But more important for Merkel are concessions on the ESM,""
added the normally well-informed magazine in its Monday edition.
 ""Even though government leaders agreed to a permanent crisis
fund in March there are still many disputed issues,"" it said.
 The ESM, with an effective lending capacity of 500 billion
euros ($740 billion), will raise funding for and provide loans
to euro zone states in financial trouble to safeguard the
stability of the euro zone.
 Der Spiegel said Merkel would like to have the unresolved
details on the ESM cleared up definitively by June whereas
countries such as Italy are pushing for non-binding language.
 ""And these aren't minor issues but rather include questions
such as what kind of majority will be needed for ESM decisions
and whether the fund itself will be empowered to create new
instruments,"" Der Spiegel said.
 The magazine added Merkel would also like to revisit an
issue that was thought to have been resolved -- whether private
creditors will be obliged to take part in future rescues.
 On top of that, Merkel would also like to see two Germans
appointed to key European jobs in exchange for her supporting
Draghi's nomination -- leading the EU's Economic and Financial
Committee (EFC) and the London-based Financial Stability Board
(FSB).
 Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Asmussen should take over the
EFC, while continuing in his role as deputy to Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble, and new Bundesbank president Jens Wiedmann
should replace Draghi as the FSB's chairman.
 Bild newspaper said last week that according to sources in
the chancellery Merkel had abandoned the search for a German
candidate for Trichet's post [ID:nLDE73R2DC]
 The Wall Street Journal Europe had said on Friday that
Merkel supported Draghi and would try to sell his nomination to
a sceptical German public by arguing that his southern European
origins will be an asset in persuading the euro's southern
members to adopt a stricter financial discipline.

 By Richard Leong and Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Global markets closed out a
week to remember on Friday as Federal Reserve chairman Ben
Bernanke's pledge to keep cheap money flowing through the
economy pushed the Nasdaq to a 10-year high, and gold and
silver broke records.
 Commodity investments were especially hot. Prices on
everything from oil to silver have now risen eight straight
months through April in their longest winning streak since
2003. Silver alone shot up 27 percent.
 Bernanke signaled on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank
is in no rush to scale back its support for the economy with
the labor market still in a ""very, very deep hole.""
 ""Bernanke's assurance this week to maintain very low
policy rates is encouraging investors to take even more risk
in a variety of asset classes and commodities, both within and
outside the U.S,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., which oversees
$1.2 trillion in assets.
 Investors also dumped the dollar, pushing it to a
three-year low on concerns the Fed's money-printing operation
will further debase the greenback's value. They also have deep
concerns about growth in the United States, which is slower
than many of its largest trading partners.
 Showing how important the Fed's easy money policy has been
in upending traditional investment views, money has been
pouring into transportation stocks even though oil prices -- a
primary expense for transport companies -- are at multi-year
highs.
 The Dow Jones Transportation Average <.DJT> surged to an
all-time high on Thursday, the same day U.S. oil prices 
touched a 31-month high.
 Benchmark U.S. silver futures  rose almost 4 percent
for the week after racing to near $50 an ounce. Gold 
saw its biggest daily gain in five months on Friday, finishing
near $1,550 an ounce. The Dow Jones industrial average racked
up its best month since December and small- and mid-sized
stock indexes hit record highs.
 Major stock indexes, including the Nasdaq, lagged precious
metals but booked solid weekly and monthly gains, despite
worries over the unrest in the Middle East, unsolved public
debt problems on both sides of the Atlantic and the cost of
the natural disasters that ravaged Japan in March.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 47.23
points, or 0.37 percent, at 12,810.54. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.13 points, or 0.23 percent, at
1,363.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 1.01
points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,873.54.
 The billions of dollars the U.S. central bank has created
to help the economy have succeeded in inflating asset prices
and stemming deflation, but have failed to generate robust
growth and slash unemployment.
 Bernanke's promise of keeping U.S. interest rates near
zero -- made at a news conference after a two-day policy
meeting -- crushed the dollar as traders piled into ""carry
trades"" using the cheap dollar to fund them.
 World equities, as measured by the MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>
index, rose 3.9 percent in April, despite anxiety over oil
prices slowing global growth.
 Benchmark crude oil prices  finished above $125 a
barrel in London, as the tumbling dollar and violence in North
Africa and the Middle East outweighed concerns about slowing
U.S. economic growth. [O/R] U.S. crude  settled at
$113.93 a barrel after earlier touching $114.18, the highest
intraday price since crude reached $130 on Sept. 22, 2008.
 Boosted by the rally in precious metals, the 19-commodity
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a broad indicator of the
commodity market, is up 10 percent for the year, making it the
world's best-performing asset group. On Friday, the CRB Index
gained 1.2 percent to end at 370.56, after earlier touching
370.71, a 52-week intraday high.
 April's strength in equity and commodity markets came
almost entirely at the dollar's expense after Standard &
Poor's revised downward its outlook for the United States'
stellar triple-A sovereign credit rating.
 Friday's economic reports reinforced this fragile outlook.
Data showed slowing growth in regional manufacturing and high
gasoline prices reducing Americans' purchasing power.
[ID:nN29101956]
 The U.S. dollar index versus major currencies <.DXY> fell
as low as 72.834, the lowest since 2008. Late Friday, the
dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 73.036.
 The euro  touched a 17-month high against the
greenback, trading at $1.4844 by 1500 GMT.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose, punctuating an April rally
that lifted the market into positive territory for the year,
as traders bet on slowing economic growth and the Fed's
accomodative monetary policy. [US/]

 (Updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a
three-year low against a basket of major currencies on Friday,
with month end capital flows likely to see further selling of
the greenback as the Federal Reserve keeps short term interest
rates near zero.
 By contrast European Central Bank has raised rates,
boosting the euro by 11 percent so far this year.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> hit a three-year low of 72.834
on Friday and has now fallen for five straight months, with
April posting a 3.8 percent April decline.
 ""It's pretty close to a one-way bet (on the dollar), but in
foreign exchange markets, anything can happen,"" said Chris
Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING Commercial
Banking in London. ""U.S. monetary policy is reflationary policy
which is great news for the commodity currencies and frames the
weak dollar.""
 The euro rose about 4.6 percent against the dollar in April
for its best month since September . The dollar fell 2.5
percent this month against the yen, its worst month since
December .
 On Friday the euro was buoyed by stronger-than-expected
euro-zone inflation data that increased the chance of another
ECB rate rise. Trading was thinned by a holiday in the U.K. for
Britain's royal wedding. For more, see [ID:nBRLTFE7E0]
 The euro closed around $1.4816 , little changed on
the day but still near its highest since early December 2009.
 The U.S. Labor Department will publish its April employment
report next week, and analysts at Citigroup said dollar
bearishness should persist.
 ""It is hard to be optimistic on the (dollar's) long-term
prospects, given the Fed's ability to surprise on the dovish
side, the ongoing overhang of U.S. dollar assets among reserve
managers and the concerns that have emerged on long-term U.S.
fiscal prospects,"" CitiFX said in a research note.
 Overextended speculative positioning suggest the dollar's
decline may slow next week, according to Vassili Serebriakov,
currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""However, with the Fed sending a strong dovish message, we
see few significant triggers for an immediate dollar
turnaround,"" he said.
 The Swiss franc was buoyed by upbeat comments from the
Swiss National Bank's chairman and an above-forecast Swiss
sentiment survey. [ID:nLDE73S0I0]
 The Swiss franc rose to hit a record high of 0.86256 francs
per dollar  on EBS. Speculators remained net long the
Swiss franc to the tune of 17,841 contracts, according to CFTC
data. The euro ended the week down about 1.0 percent 
at 1.2820 francs.
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.6 percent at 81.07
yen . The net short yen position dropped by 15,986
contracts to 36,997 from 52,983 the week before, according to
CFTC data. Most of the shift was from a decline of 14,858 total
short contracts to 51,060 contracts.
 Euro resistance was expected around $1.4905, the peak in
Dec. 7 2009, with a substantial options barrier at $1.5000.
Beyond $1.5000, the key target was the 2009 high of $1.5145,
analysts said.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals last traded at -1.3 on
Friday , according to Reuters data, with a bias
toward euro puts and dollar calls, suggesting more investors
are betting the euro will fall than will rise.
 But the same measure traded at -1.48 on Tuesday, which
indicates relatively less bearishness, the day before Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hosted his first-ever post-policy
decision news conference.
 Still, euro long positions rose to 68,279 contracts in the
latest week, the highest since December, 2007, according to
data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on
Friday. [ID:nN29170657].

for a $1 billion contract to supply New York City with new
taxis, Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Friday said the choice will
be based on safety, reliability and passengers' convenience.
 Turkey's Karsan  hopes its offer to assemble the
cars at a new Brooklyn plant -- and use union labor -- will
give it an edge over rivals Nissan <7201.T> of Japan and Ford
Motor Co  in winning the 10-year contract. Both Nissan and
Ford would build the cars at overseas plants.
 Bloomberg, a political independent, wants the new taxi to
be green and sport an ""iconic design"" identifying it with New
York City, according to a city document posted at:
http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/press_release_02_20_08.pdfdocument.
 ""You've got to look at how much experience companies have
in building cars; what do you do if after two years the wheels
start falling off?"" Bloomberg asked rhetorically on WOR radio.
 ""This is data-driven; it's a nice thing if it's built in
Brooklyn ... but not at the expense of getting the right car,""
he said. ""If it were tied, yeah, sure, these things matter,"" he
concluded. The Bloomberg administration will choose the
winner.
 The Turkish vehicle also is the only one that has a ramp
for wheelchairs, an important consideration in protecting the
legal rights of disabled people. But Bloomberg suggested that
the city might not need to equip all of its taxi fleet with
cars that can handle wheelchairs.
 Taxi drivers are pushing for a fare hike because gasoline
prices have topped $4 a gallon. Bloomberg said he was
sympathetic to that request, but the city must be sure that
drivers are not refusing to take fares to the outer boroughs.

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, April 29 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar hit a 3-1/2
year high against a broadly weaker U.S. currency on Friday,
shrugging off uncertainty over next week's federal election and
data that showed Canada's economy shrank unexpectedly.
 ""The fact that the Canadian dollar continues to rally amid
a secular decline in the U.S. dollar is of no great surprise,""
said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at
National Bank Financial.
 ""The fact that it was able to withstand a miss on the GDP
and ahead of any kind of political uncertainties leading into
the election has been more of an indicator of the fundamental
support for the currency going forward.""
 Canada's gross domestic product slipped 0.2 percent in
February, initially nudging the currency lower and reinforcing
expectations the central bank will hold interest rates steady
until the second half of this year. [ID:nN29119495]
 But the currency  later firmed to C$0.9450 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0582, its strongest level since November,
2007 and up from Thursday's North American finish at C$0.9510
to the U.S. dollar.
 Some analysts say breaking through that resistance could
see the currency target the modern-day high of C$0.9059, or
US$1.1039, that it reached in late 2007.
 Strong oil prices and positive U.S. equities also lent
support, as did sober second thoughts about the GDP miss.
 ""It doesn't take much away from what's going to be a strong
first quarter for the Canadian economy, so any weakness that we
see in the Canadian dollar as a result of this number should be
relatively short-lived,"" said David Tulk, chief Canada macro
strategist at TD Securities.
 Contributing to the volatility was end-of-month positioning
and thin volumes due to holidays in Britain and Japan.
 Looking ahead, currency traders are keeping a close eye on
the upcoming federal election. The left-leaning New Democrats
have closed in on the ruling Conservatives just days before the
May 2 vote. [ID:nN29120747]
 The unprecedented success of the NDP has forced apathetic
markets to sit up and take notice of their platform, fretting
about plans to raise corporate taxes, spend more and redo
energy policy. [ID:nN27126329]
 ""The only thing I think is going to be market-moving is the
election on Monday night. I think the NDP can play a spoiler
role in the Canadian dollar rally,"" said Firas Askari, head of
foreign exchange trading at BMO Capital Markets.
 ""If they are the official opposition then I think people
will take some Canadian dollar bets off the table.""

another ECB interest-rate increase soon. [ID:nBRLTFE7E0]
 On the other side of the Atlantic, tame inflation in the
U.S. supported values of longer-dated U.S. government bonds.
 The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note  was up
4/32 in price in light volume, yielding 3.29 percent, its

accommodative monetary policy in the months ahead. [US/]

 (Updates prices, adds quote, adds details)
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday and is
expected to decline for the a sixth straight week in the coming
sessions on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep interest
rates low while the European Central bank raises them.
 Higher interest rates in Europe have undermined support for
the dollar, boosting the euro by 11 percent so far this year.
 The U.S. dollar index hit a three-year low of 72.834 on
Friday and has now fallen for five straight months after
tallying a 3.8 percent April decline.
 ""It's pretty close to a one-way bet (on the dollar), but in
foreign exchange markets, anything can happen,"" said Chris
Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING Commercial
Banking in London. ""U.S. monetary policy is reflationary policy
which is great news for the commodity currencies and frames the
weak dollar.""
 The euro was on track to rally 4.7 percent against the
dollar in April for its best month since September. The dollar
fell 2.3 percent this month against the yen, its worst month
since December.
 The euro was buoyed by stronger-than-expected euro-zone
inflation data that increased the chance of another ECB rate
rise, sooner rather than later.
 The euro last traded at $1.4832, up 0.1 percent, and near
its highest since early December 2009. But the euro ran into
some selling and could struggle ahead of a reported options
barrier at $1.4900.
 Resistance was expected around $1.4905, a peak from Dec. 7
2009, ahead of a substantial barrier at $1.5000. Beyond
$1.5000, the key target was the 2009 high of $1.5145.
Technical factors and overextended speculative positioning
suggest the dollar's decline may slow next week, according to
Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New
York.
 ""However, with the Fed sending a strong dovish message, we
see few significant triggers for an immediate dollar
turnaround,"" he said.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals last traded at -1.2 on
Friday, according to Reuters data, with a bias toward euro puts
and dollar calls, suggesting more investors are betting the
euro will fall than will rise.
 But the same measure traded at -1.48 on Tuesday, which
indicates relatively less bearishness, the day before Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hosted his first-ever post-policy
decision news conference. The U.S. Labor Department will
publish its April employment report next week, and analysts at
Citigroup said dollar bearishness should persist.
 ""It is hard to be optimistic on the (dollar's) long-term
prospects, given the Fed's ability to surprise on the dovish
side, the ongoing overhang of U.S. dollar assets among reserve
managers and the concerns that have emerged on long-term U.S.
fiscal prospects,"" CitiFX said in a research note.
 Trading was thinned by the holiday for Britain's royal
wedding.
 The Swiss franc was buoyed by upbeat comments from the
Swiss National Bank's chairman and an above-forecast Swiss
sentiment survey.
 The Swiss franc rose to hit a record high of 0.8644 francs
per dollar on EBS. The euro was last down 0.8 percent at 1.2839
francs. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.4 percent at
81.21 yen.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average headed for its best
month since December, and the dollar hit 3-year lows on the
Federal Reserve's pledge to keep ultra-low interest rates.
 For global markets, it was one of the most momentous weeks
of the year as the Fed's word opened the floodgates for a rush
of new money into equities, commodities and almost every asset
but the dollar.
 The MSCI index of world equities <.MIWD00000PUS>, rose 0.3
percent on Friday. The index is up about 5 percent over the
past two weeks.
 Benchmark crude oil prices  climbed above $125 per
barrel in London, as the tumbling dollar and violence in
North Africa and the Middle East outweighed concerns about
slowing U.S. economic growth. [O/R] U.S. crude  rose as
high as $113.55 a barrel, near the 31-month high reached on
Thursday.
 U.S. gold futures  soared to a third consecutive
record high, hitting $1,553.70 an ounce. [GOL/] Spot gold
 extended gains to a record high at $1,551.20 an ounce.
 Robust U.S. corporate earnings, ample liquidity from the
Federal Reserve, and the prospect of ultra-low interest rates
for the rest of the year have driven stock prices higher,
pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index up to a 10-year peak and
sending the S&P 500 index up over 8.0 percent this year.
 Shares of heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc 
climbed 2.5 percent to $115.48 after reporting a fivefold
increase in quarterly profit and raising its full-year
forecast. Drug maker Merck & Co Inc  rose 0.6 percent
to $35.99 and major oil company Chevron  added 0.4
percent to $109.21, after both reported earnings that exceeded
Wall Street's expectations. [ID:nN29109180] [ID:nN29113830]
[ID:nN29188488]
 But after a strong April, equities will head into one of
their traditionally weakest months of the year, according to
the Stock Trader's Almanac.
 ""Once we get past (earnings), it is going to be awful
tough,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of
OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois,
 ""As the memory of strong earnings begins to fade, we
probably will go back into a sideways market.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 62.21
points, or 0.49 percent, at 12,825.52 -- not far below its
session high at 12,832.83. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 3.03 points, or 0.22 percent, at 1,363.51. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 1.70 points, or 0.06
percent, at 2,874.23.
 Earlier, the S&P 500 rose as high intraday as 1,363.87.
 European shares rose modestly following a six-session
winning streak, with volumes crimped by a holiday in Britain
for the royal wedding. The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of
top European shares gained 0.3 percent to end at 1,156.81.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a
broad indicator of the commodity market, is up 10 percent for
the year, making it the world's best-performing asset group.
Early Friday afternoon, the CRB was up 0.9 percent at 369.46
-- just a touch below a fresh 52-week intraday high at
369.58.
 April's strength in equity and commodity markets came
almost entirely at the dollar's expense after Standard &
Poor's revised downward its outlook for the United States'
stellar triple-A sovereign credit rating.
 The dollar's slide was exacerbated by the Federal
Reserve's statement on Wednesday that it intends to keep
interest rates at historic lows to help bolster the tepid U.S.
economic recovery.
 Evidence to support the Fed's point of view came on
Thursday from economic data showing U.S. gross domestic
product grew less than expected in the first quarter of 2011
and initial weekly jobless claims rose more than
forecast.[ID:nCAT005418]
 ""It's still a story of general dollar weakness,"" said
Richard Wiltshire, chief FX broker of ETX Capital. ""Markets
are pretty thin and there's not a lot of depth to them.""
[USD/]
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of major currencies, fell as low
as 72.834, the lowest since 2008.
 The euro  neared a 17-month high against the
greenback, trading at $1.4835 in early afternoon in New York.
 Inflation in the 17-nation euro-zone bloc edged up 2.8
percent in April compared with a year ago -- well above the
2.0 percent target ceiling of the European Central Bank.
Earlier this month, the ECB raised interest rates for the
first time in two years. The latest inflation numbers raised
prospects for another ECB interest-rate increase soon.
[ID:nBRLTFE7E0]
 The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note  was
flat in price in light volume, yielding 3.31 percent as it
consolidated gains made this week on softer economic data and
prospects for accommodative monetary policy in the months
ahead. [US/]

"
1110,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2011 01:24PM ET</span>",Iran says Indian oil funds freed in Germany -agency," TEHRAN, April 29 (Reuters) - Iran has secured the release of
some funds that India had paid for Iranian oil and that had been
frozen in Germany, a news agency reported.
 ""When Iran sells its oil to a country, it should be able to
receive the payments,"" the Central Bank of Iran's governor,
Mahmoud Bahmani, was quoted as saying by Iran's semi-official
Mehr news agency.
 ""One of these transactions was related to India, which had
to pay for Iran's oil ... but Germany blocked the money. A part
of this money which had been blocked, has been released now and
the rest will be released in the future,"" Bahmani said, without
giving further details.
 In December, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that oil
trade payments to Iran could no longer be settled using a
long-standing clearing house system run by regional central
banks.
 The White House, which wants governments to stop dealing
with Iran because of its nuclear programme, praised the move.
 Iran already faces sanctions from the United Nations over
its nuclear programme, and though the sanctions do not ban
purchases of crude oil, Washington has been lobbying governments
and companies to stop dealings with Tehran.
 Germany agreed in March to help India settle payments to
Iran via Hamburg-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank (EIH,
European-Iranian Trade Bank) but later announced that handling
the money through the bank had been halted.
 The move followed discussions between Chancellor Angela
Merkel and the Indian government in which India said it was
moving to a new payment method, a German official said earlier
this month.
 India pays some 9 billion euros ($12.77 billion) a year for
purchases of Iranian oil.
 The United States, Israel and the European Union suspect
Iran is seeking to acquire atomic weapons. The Islamic state
denies the allegations and insists its programme is for peaceful
energy needs.

 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday, ending
the month with its biggest loss since September, with more
weakness expected as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates
low while the European Central bank raises them.
 Higher interest rates in Europe have undermined support for

said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in

 In contrast, the euro/dollar gained 4.7 percent in April,
marking its strongest month since September.
 The euro was buoyed by stronger-than-expected euro zone
inflation data that increased the chance of another ECB rate

 The euro last traded at $1.4834 , up 0.1 percent,
after hitting a high of $1.4878. The euro on Thursday hit a
17-month peak of $1.4882 on trading platform EBS.
 But the euro ran into selling and could struggle ahead of

 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.2 percent to hit
72.984, just shy of a three-year low of 72.871 plumbed on
Thursday.
 Nevertheless, based upon the price action in the foreign
exchange market, there are some initial signs that the dollar
may be reaching a bottom, GFT Forex's Kathy Lien said.
 ""From a purchasing power parity perspective, the dollar is
undervalued against every major currency with the trade
weighted index now approaching its lowest level since before
the Plaza Accord in the 1980s,"" she said.
 ""The recent extremeness of the dollar's move could attract
value hunters but with a number of key event risks next week
posing a threat to the U.S. dollar, we don't expect a material
recovery.""
 Next week the U.S. Labor Department will published the
monthly U.S. payrolls and unemployment data.
 However, analysts at Citigroup said dollar bearishness
should persist.
 ""It is hard to be optimistic on the USD's long-term
prospects, given the Fed's ability to surprise on the dovish
side, the ongoing overhang of US dollar assets among reserve
managers, and the concerns that have emerged on long-term US
fiscal prospects,"" CitiFX said in a research note.
 ""Moreover in the very short term our month-end model points
to additional US dollar selling at month end for hedge
rebalancing purposes, so there is the risk that investors will
be even shorter US dollar within a couple of days.""

 * Tough German inflation-fighting stance not seen changing
 * May be less likely to oppose ECB debt purchasing-economist
 
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - Germany presented the
government's chief economic advisor, Jens Weidmann, a letter of
appointment on Friday to succeed his former mentor Axel Weber at
the head of the country's central bank, the Bundesbank.
 In a short ceremony attended by both men at the presidential
palace in Berlin, President Christian Wulff transferred the post
to Weidmann, until now Chancellor Angela Merkel's top economic
adviser, who will take up the new job in Frankfurt on Monday.
 ""We are counting on you to maintain the currency's
stability,"" Wulff said, adding, ""May you have much success.""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Weidmann's proximity to Weber's school of thought has most
economists believing Germany's tight stance on monetary policy
is unlikely to change with the appointment, which also and
perhaps more importantly puts him on the 23-member governing
council of the European Central Bank.
 ""It would be surprising for a German Bundesbanker to express
anything but hawkish sentiments -- it's required for the euro
zone at the moment, said Guillaume Menuet from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.
 Weidmann, who just recently turned 43 years old, has spent
the last five years as Chancellor Angela Merkel's top economic
adviser, wielding major influence over policy as Germany
struggled to contain the financial crisis and its worst
recession since World War Two.
 He is expected to bring youth, political savvy and a new
low-key style to replace Weber, who at times alienated European
politicians with public policy outbursts.

 LESS HAWKISH?
 Weber shocked Germany and its European partners in February
by announcing plans to resign from the Bundesbank a year before
his term was to end, and pulling out of the race to become
president of the European Central Bank. 
 He had alienated other countries in Europe, notably France,
by coming out publicly against the ECB's decision to buy the
bonds of struggling euro zone members -- a move ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet agreed to reluctantly at the height of
Greece's debt crisis last May.
 Such vocal opposition is likely to moderate with Weber's
departure, as Weidmann is known more for work behind the scenes.
 There could also be a shift in Germany's stance, if pressure
on the ECB resurfaces to shore up weak economies on Europe's
periphery with extraordinary measures.
 Weidmann's years with Merkel has put him closer to
politicians than the academic Weber was, and many see a man with
his background as more likely to support controversial
intervention.
 ""If for example questions over a possible Greek
restructuring lead to instability on financial markets, then
calls for the further purchasing of sovereign debt by the ECB
would not be far off,"" said Claudia Windt from Helaba.
 ""I think here Weidmann would be slightly less hawkish than
Weber, and would vote for the purchasing,"" she added.
 Still, it is difficult to say how exactly he will decide
when he trains his reputed sharp intellect and strong opinions
on inflation-tracking data.
 ""I think he's a very good economist, but it's hard to
classify him beforehand,"" said Dirk Schumacher from Goldman
Sachs.

(Adds further details, KOF barometer)
 By Catherine Bosley
 BERNE, April 29 (Reuters) - Inflationary risks are beginning
to emerge in Switzerland due to rising oil and commodity prices,
which could hit the economy if the Swiss franc falls rapidly,
the head of its central bank said on Friday.
 Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said that
despite the strength of the franc, which shot up some 15 percent
against the euro last year, the domestic economy was growing
more vigorously than expected.
 In a further sign of buoyant economic performance, the KOF
barometer, which indicates its strength in six months' time,
rose more than expected in April.
 ""Certain upside risks are beginning to emerge with regard to
price stability,"" Hildebrand told the SNB's annual general
meeting. ""Should the Swiss franc weaken again rapidly, rising
commodity prices could also have an impact in our country.""
 Swiss inflation rose more than expected in March to 1.0
percent year on year, though Hildebrand said that the increase
overstated actual pressures.
 The Swiss franc spiked up on the comments, pushing through
the 1.29 francs per euro mark and hitting a new record against
the dollar of 0.8663. show a high chance of a 25 basis point
move in September, fully pricing a hike in December.
 
 NEW RECESSION UNLIKELY
 The SNB still sees growth slowing to roughly 2 percent this
year from 2.6 percent in 2010, however, and Hildebrand also
reiterated warnings on downside risks to growth from global
factors and Europe's sovereign debt crisis. 
 ""Nevertheless, given the economic recovery in Switzerland
and abroad, a new recession looks unlikely from the current
perspective,"" he said.
 Exports -- which he said have held up well considering the
strength of the franc -- have not yet returned to their
pre-crisis level and companies were starting to consider moving
production abroad to cut costs, the SNB chief also said.
 To stave off deflationary risks, the SNB slashed its
benchmark rate target in March 2009 and began intervening in
foreign exchange markets to cap the franc's rise against the
euro. The SNB halted its interventions last June.
 Domestic conditions in Switzerland -- including low levels
of joblessness and a booming real estate market -- are now seen
by many analysts as meriting an interest rate rise.
 But the SNB is seen as reluctant to increase its target for
the 3-month Swiss franc LIBOR from the current 0.25 percent for
fear of fuelling fresh gains in the currency.
 Hildebrand, who has been harshly criticised for the
interventions since they led to a record annual loss for 2010,
said that the SNB's expansive monetary policy carried long-term
risks for price stability, which were showing up in rising
monetary aggregates and mortgage lending.
 ""It is especially in these areas that imbalances with
serious repercussions can occur if interest rates remain at a
very low level for a long time,"" Hildebrand said, adding
inflation expectations remained well within the range of price
stability.
 Inflation is set to breach the SNB's price stability
threshold by mid-2013, the SNB said at its most recent policy
assessment.

 * Decision gives boost to the rouble
 * Rise in refi rate surprises market

(Adds detail, quotes, background)
 By Elena Fabrichnaya and Lidia Kelly
 MOSCOW, April 29 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank raised
its key interest rates on Friday, surprising markets with a
broad tightening move and signalling that it is ready to let the
rouble rise to curb inflation as elections loom.
 The need to raise rates, the central bank said, came as an
increase in consumer prices has proven to be more than just a
short-term supply shock caused by last summer's drought, which
killed a third of the country's harvest.
 ""The decision was taken in connection with the persistent
level of high inflation expectations, which exceed targets for
this year,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 Although inflation has stabilised somewhat, it remains
perilously close to double digits at 9.6 percent -- above the
official target of below 7 percent by the end of 2011.
 Inflation has been become an increasingly political issue as
Russia prepares for parliamentary elections in December and a
presidential poll next spring in which Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev may run.
 ""Probably, a decision that fighting inflation is the
priority ahead of elections was taken at the top level,"" said
Dmitry Polevoy, an analyst at ING in Moscow.
 The Bank of Russia said it would raise its refinancing rate,
overnight deposit rates and a series of other rates by 25 basis
points, effective May 3.
 
 PRE-EMPTIVE MOVE
 By raising the benchmark refinancing rate --- which has no
direct impact on rouble liquidity -- the central bank signalled
its concern about inflation and willingness to tame it, even if
this means a stronger currency.
 The rouble hit a fresh 2-1/2-year high against the dollar on
the news [ID:nLDE73S0NN]. The currency has firmed 11 percent
versus the greenback already this year, pushed up by rallying
oil prices [O/R].
 ""The central bank decided to take a pre-emptive step,"" said
Olga Sterina, an economist at UralSib in Moscow.
 ""Everything is directed to battling inflation.""
 The central bank's gradual monetary tightening has been
accompanied by other administrative measures, such as clamping
down on gasoline prices and a ban on grain exports -- all aimed
at keeping prices low and voters happy.
 But some of the measures have started backfiring.
 Russia, the world's largest oil producer, faces a regional
fuel supply crisis blamed by the industry on regulatory pressure
on pump prices, forcing Putin on Thursday into a hurried move to
hike gasoline export duties to keep more fuel in the country.
 
 MORE TO COME
 The central bank warned that future decisions will have to
balance out the needs to tame inflation, spur economic growth
and avoid excessive rouble appreciation.
 ""Further steps regarding changes in the monetary policy of
the central bank will depend on the balance between the risks of
inflation pressures and slowing economic growth,"" it said.
 A Reuters poll this week showed most economists had
expected the central bank to raise overnight deposit rates by 25
basis points to 3.25 percent, while keeping the refi rate on
hold at 8.00 percent [ID:nLDE73Q0PH].
 ""The central bank will need to raise deposit rates more
aggressively than lending rates in the future (cumulative 100
bps for the year) in order to tighten the interest rate corridor
and thus make monetary policy more effective,"" said Aurelija
Augulyte, an analyst at Nordea.
 Against analyst expectations, the bank did not raise minimum
reserve requirements on bank liabilities this time, after
increasing them for the three previous months. Augulyte said she
expected reserve requirements to be raised in the coming months.

 * Economists see inflation driving interest rates higher
 * Spain data shows economy struggling with austerity

(Adds more economist comment, Belgian GDP)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose
further above the European Central Bank's target in April,
increasing the chances of an interest rate rise in June, despite
a weakening of economic sentiment and household demand.
 Inflation in the 17 countries using the euro rose to 2.8
percent year-on-year this month from 2.7 percent a month
earlier, the highest level since October 2010, when it was 3.2
percent.
 Consensus expectations had been for a flat reading compared
to March ahead of next Thursday's European Central Bank meeting
on interest rates. Analysts said the numbers raised the odds on
a rise in rates in June.
 ""Although we expect a rate increase at the July meeting, the
balance of risks is tilted towards an earlier move,"" said Aline
Schuiling, senior economist at ABN AMRO. 
 The ECB raised its main interest rate from record lows of
1.0 percent to 1.25 percent in April, concerned about the impact
on consumer prices of rising costs of energy and food.
 ""The upside surprise relative to our forecast may be due to
a stronger-than-expected impact of the late Easter, meaning that
core inflation probably was a touch firmer than we had thought,""
said Marco Valli, economist at Unicredit.
 ""We see inflation hovering around the current level for some
time, with a further acceleration to 3 percent likely towards
the end of the summer.""
 Other data this month, however, has suggested growth in both
Germany and the euro zone is peaking and figures from Spain, the
biggest economy under threat in Europe's debt crisis, showed
unemployment soaring and retail sales sinking.
 A monthly European Commission survey showed economic
sentiment in the euro zone as a whole fell for the second month
in a row to 106.2 in April, down from 107.3 in March and below
market expectations of a decline to 107.0.
 ""The combination of high oil prices, a strong euro, and
fiscal and monetary tightening has started to dent the economic
mood in the euro zone,"" said Martin van Vliet, economist at ING.
 The decline in sentiment ran through all sectors of the
economy except construction, with consumer optimism falling the
most to -11.6 from -10.6 in March.
 
 NO LOAN BOOST
 ECB data also showed that the annual growth rate of loans to
the private sector in the single currency area slowed in March,
bucking expectations for a rise, but M3 money supply growth
accelerated.
 Belgium, a bellwether for the euro zone economy, reported
faster than expected first quarter economic growth of 1 percent
quarter-on-quarter, against 0.6 percent expected on average by
economists polled by Reuters.
 ""Monetary data continue to point to a modest recovery in
euro area money and loan growth,"" said Christoph Balz, economist
at Commerzbank.
 ""While the data in itself do not indicate upside risks to
price stability that require further monetary tightening, they
are further proof that the economic situation has changed
substantially since 2009 -- which is why the ECB thinks that
extremely low interest rates are no longer appropriate.
 GDP data for the whole euro zone is due on May 13.
 More evidence of weakening household demand could be seen in
retail sales data. 
 Sales in Germany fell in March, defying expectations of a
rise as consumers bought fewer groceries and textiles during a
month when inflation surpassed the 2 percent threshold. 
 Adjusted for consumer price rises, sales declined by 2.1
percent month-on-month, and by 3.5 percent year-on-year.
 The drop in consumer demand was more pronounced in the
""peripheral"" euro zone countries seeking to win back market
confidence in their public finances with tough austerity
measures.
 In Spain sales fell 8.6 percent year-on-year in March and in
Greece the decline was 10.6 percent in February.
 Euro zone consumer inflation expectations, which have been
rising quickly since November 2010, edged marginally lower to
30.7 from 30.8. Selling price expectations among manufacturers,
on the rise since August 2010, fell more markedly to 21.5 from
24.4.
 The European Commission's business climate indicator, which
points to the phase of the business cycle, also fell for the
second month in a row, to 1.28 points from 1.43 in March.
 ""Despite this, the current level of the indicator remains
close to historic peaks, suggesting that the recovery in
industry will continue in the coming months,"" the Commission
said.
 Eurostat data also showed that unemployment in the euro zone
held stable at 9.9 percent of the workforce in March.

 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Union presented a
last-minute plan to keep hopes alive for a new global free trade
deal on Friday, telling weary and sceptical negotiators there
were still avenues to explore after 10 years of trying.
 Unveiled at a meeting of World Trade Organization (WTO)
member countries, the plan aims to find some middle ground
between the United States and major emerging economies,
especially China, on the main sticking point of the discussions
-- tariffs on industrial goods.
 ""Our view has always been that not all options and avenues
in this market access area had been explored,"" said Jean-Luc
Demarty, European Commission Director General for Trade.
 ""This is why we felt we should formulate ideas to stimulate
further engagement,"" he told the meeting of the 153-member WTO's
Trade Negotiations Committee. Gaps can close ""if the political
will is there,"" he said.
 The so-called Doha Development Round of talks which began in
2001 in the Qatari city are complex and cover all areas of
barriers to trade in industrial goods, services and agriculture,
but the industrial tariffs row goes to the core of the blockage.
 The United States and China both said they would study the
idea, but U.S. ambassador Michael Punke said he did not
subscribe to the view that a breakthrough on industrial tariffs
would mean a breakthrough for the whole round.
 ""Fundamental differences also exist with respect to
agriculture and services,"" he said.
 Nevertheless he said the plan did offer a way forward. ""We
can't know what the outcomes might be but we can certainly know
very quickly whether or not it can catalyse negotiations,"" Punke
told reporters outside the meeting.
 A Chinese official said the world's number one exporter
would also study the EU plan. China's Ambassador Yi Xiaozhun
made no direct reference to it in his statement, in which he
bemoaned a loss of idealism in discussions over the years.
 ""We are very much concerned that the development objective
and mandate may have been marginalised,"" he said. India also
criticised what it called the increasingly ""mercantalist""
approach to the talks.
 
 DESPONDENCY
 China, India and Brazil entered the talks with developing
country exemptions which the United States now challenges given
their emergence as export powers.
 The big three developing nations want to keep their status,
and point out that the round was launched partly to correct some
of the trade imbalances of the existing General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
 The EU's proposal, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters
on Thursday, focuses on tariffs for chemicals, machinery and
electronics and seeks an approach that is tailored for different
products.
 It keeps the zero-for-zero tariff approach favoured by the
United States for some, but seeks more modest reductions in
others to a tariff level somewhere between what the big
developing countries are entitled to according to their status,
and the zero that the United States wants to see.
 It aims to succeed where months of U.S.-China bilateral
talks have failed, but did little to lift the mood of
despondency at the WTO's Geneva lakeshore headquarters.
 Several diplomats used the word ""disappointment"" to describe
their feelings on the failure to produce any real movement since
the last push for completion took place in 2008.
 Some farm export countries were sceptical of the EU's
motives. One said the EU may be looking to distract attention
from its own sins against free trade in farming subsidies.
 Still, diplomats were ""appreciative that the EU has revived
the spirit of the talks,"" said one ambassador from a G7 nation.
 
 $15 TRLN MERCHANDISE TRADE LAST YEAR
 The Doha talks aim to keep at bay the self-defeating spiral
of tariffs, subsidies and quotas that can choke trade and,
economists argue, global prosperity.
 With $15 trillion of goods changing hands last year around
the globe, no country wants to be blamed for stabbing the
policeman of commerce through the heart.
 Some delegates wanted to make clear that the WTO itself is
""bigger than Doha"" -- a clear suggestion that they still fear
failure for the round and are looking at damage limitation.
 Others suggest an ""early harvest"" where those areas where
negotiators do agree get signed and sealed without the tricky
ones. China is one supporter of that approach.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, who has staked his
reputation on getting a deal done this year, begged countries
not to return to the ""law of the jungle"".
 Lamy told delegates that from here on he would consult in
various configurations, including at the ministerial level, in
APEC and at an OECD meeting on May 26.

 By Jason Subler and Emma Ashburn	
 SHANGHAI, April 29 (Reuters) - China's yuan breezed past
6.50 per dollar on Friday, surpassing the psychologically
important level for the first time and raising expectations that
Beijing will continue to let the currency strengthen quickly to
battle stubbornly high inflation.	
 While the 6.50 per dollar level is not significant from a
technical standpoint, Chinese media and economists are likely to
seize on it as evidence of how far the government has come in
allowing it to appreciate since its landmark currency reforms in
2005. It has gained 27.5 percent since then.	
 China's decision to loosen the reins on the yuan
could also encourage further rises in other emerging-market
currencies, especially in Asia, helping to temper the impact of
high commodity prices as governments from Beijing to Bangkok
battle imported inflation.	
 Traders seized on momentum created by the central bank
through its daily mid-point settings, pushing the currency to as
high as 6.4892 per dollar in spot market trade on Friday before
closing at 6.4910, meaning the currency has now gained 5.2
percent against the dollar since it was unleashed from a de
facto peg last June.	
 ""This is a signal they will continue appreciation. We can't
see any signs they will actually speed up appreciation, but they
are likely to keep to the pace that we're seeing now,"" said Liu
Dongliang, analyst at China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.

 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) guided the yuan up by 0.9
percent in April compared with 0.4 percent in March,
accelerating its appreciation at a time when the dollar has
fallen to three-year lows against a basket of currencies.	
 The PBOC set the tone for Friday's trade by setting the
yuan's mid-point -- the level from which dollar/yuan may rise or
fall 0.5 percent during the day -- at another fresh high, after
a string of record high fixings over the last few weeks.	
 
 CRITICS IN WASHINGTON UNIMPRESSED	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it increasingly clear that
they are willing to use the currency as one way of fighting
inflation, which hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, by
helping to buffer the impact of imported commodity prices.	
 That is in keeping with Beijing's long-standing stance that
it will let the yuan become more flexible over time, out of its
own interests -- and not because of pressure from the outside.	
 Still, some of the strongest critics of China's currency
policy have continued to keep up their pressure for more action.	
 U.S. Senator Charles Schumer said on Thursday that he had
come away from meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing with
the impression that they thought the yuan's recent gains were
adequate.	
 ""Despite its rampant inflation problem, China's government
does not seem prepared to let the value of the yuan rise much
higher above its present level,"" the New York Democrat said in a
statement. [ID:nW1E7FI01E]	
 Analysts and traders expect the yuan to continue to rise at
a relatively rapid pace. Many onshore forex traders expect
roughly 5-6 percent appreciation for the year as a whole, which
would imply around 4.5 percent further in gains yet this year.	
 Traders in offshore yuan forwards have also
begun to bet on more gains in recent weeks. At the end of March,
implied yuan appreciation over the next year stood at just 1.7
percent, but that has risen to 2.9 percent now.	
 Bets on more yuan gains have also risen in the offshore yuan
market in Hong Kong, which tends to have a strong
correlation with expected yuan appreciation.	
 While the spread between offshore and onshore yuan had
virtually disappeared in recent months on a surge of yuan into
the territory from mainland importers, the differential have
sprung up again of late, widening to a chunky 0.04 yuan on
Monday before narrowing somewhat later in the week.	
 
 FREEING UP EMERGING CURRENCY GAINS?	
 With China continuing to allow only incremental gains
against the dollar, however, the yuan has continued to fall
against the currencies of other major trading partners such as
Japan and European countries as the dollar has plunged.	
 The yuan's nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), its value
against a trade-weighted basket, has fallen by around 2 percent
since November 2010, adding to pressure on Beijing to do more if
it does not want imports on a broader basis to become more dear.	
 Still, most analysts do not expect any drastic measures from
the government, despite some market rumours in recent weeks
about the possibility of a one-off revaluation to help temper
expectations of stronger imported inflation.	
 For one, China racked up a rare trade deficit in the first
quarter, partly due to higher import prices, something the
powerful export lobby is likely to be pointing to as a reason to
proceed with caution on the yuan, sometimes referred to as CNY.	
 More likely than a revaluation might be some further tweak
to the foreign exchange regime, such as a widening of the daily
trading band, which would at least send a signal on authorities'
intentions, even if the band is rarely fully used.	
 ""We haven't heard that they will widen the trading band, but
if they did so it wouldn't be too surprising,"" said Liu.	
 A continued rise in the yuan would probably be welcomed as
well in other Asian emerging markets, as it would put them at
less of a disadvantage in trade if they let their own currencies
rise.	
 ""The currency war has clearly morphed into a war against
inflation among EM policymakers in recent weeks, and China's
willingness to see a faster pace of CNY appreciation is likely
to provide more support for EM currencies going forward,"" said
Nizam Idris, emerging market strategist at UBS in Singapore.

further above the European Central Bank's target in April, data
showed on Friday, increasing the chances of another interest

 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated
consumer prices in the 17 countries using the euro rose 2.8
percent year-on-year this month, more than market consensus of a

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a
three-year low on Friday after inflation data suggested euro
zone interest rates will rise again this summer, while stocks
paused for breath and gold climbed to a new record.
 Analysts see little upside for the dollar following the
Federal Reserve's pledge this week to continue with near-zero
rates for an ""extended period"" while central banks in Europe,
Asia and Latin America are tightening policy.
 Inflation in the 17-nation currency bloc edged up to 2.8
percent in April, well above the 2 percent target ceiling of the
European Central Bank, which raised rates for the first time in
two years earlier this month. [ID:nLDE73S0UT]
 ""The inflation numbers support the view that the ECB will
deliver another interest rate hike before long. Indeed, although
we expect a rate increase at the July meeting, the balance of
risks is tilted towards an earlier move,"" said Aline Schuiling,
senior economist at ABN AMRO.
 The euro was trading at $1.4870  by 1200 GMT, close to
a 17-month peak of $1.4882 hit on Thursday. The single currency
also rose to a six-month high against sterling. [FRX/]
 With Thursday's weak U.S. GDP and jobless data offering no
relief to the dollar, the index <.DXY> which tracks its
performance against a basket of major currencies fell to its
lowest level in three years.
 The dollar index fell as low as 72.850 and the greenback
also hit a record low against the Swiss franc , while the
high-yielding Australian dollar  posted a new 29-year
high.
 The index is down about 7.5 percent this year, making the
dollar one of the world's worst-performing assets, and is on
track for its biggest weekly fall since mid-January.
 Sean Callow, a strategist at Westpac in Sydney, said
sentiment towards the dollar was ""profoundly bearish with no
catalyst for reversal"", at least until all-important U.S.
non-farm payrolls data next week.
 With investors assuming rock bottom U.S. rates will continue
to drive money into riskier assets, world equities as measured
by the MSCI index <.MIWD00000PUS> are up by some 5 percent over
the past two weeks. They inched up again on Friday.
 European shares <.FTEU3> gained just 0.1 percent following a
six-session winning streak, with volumes crimped by a holiday in
Britain for the Royal Wedding.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat or slightly
higher open on Wall Street .

 GOLD ASCENDANT
 A broad commodity rally, which had showed signs of flagging
earlier in the day, picked up momentum again as the dollar
plumbed new depths.
 Spot gold hit a record for the third straight session,
approaching $1,540 an ounce as a falling dollar increased the
metal's appeal as a hedge against the U.S. currency.
 Bullion  was up 0.3 percent at $1,539.15 by 1200 GMT
after earlier setting an all-time high of $1,539.60. It has
posted records in 10 out of the last 11 sessions.
 U.S. crude futures for June  climbed 0.35 percent to
$113.25 a barrel, reversing earlier losses.
 Further gains are expected unless the dollar recovers.
 ""If the dollar continues to weaken, then it's only likely to
boost gold as well as silver as the inverse relationship between
the two assets persists,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst
at Phillip Futures in Singapore.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a broad

 * But trading seen subdued with holidays in UK, Japan
 * Month-end flows seen tilted toward dollar selling
 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday and was
on track for its biggest weekly fall since mid-January, with
more losses possible due to month-end demand to sell dollars.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.1 percent, keeping the
euro near the previous day's 17-month high and on track to vault
$1.50, while the Australian dollar hovered close to its 29-year
peak against the greenback. 
 The dollar was sold heavily after the Federal Reserve made
clear to markets on Wednesday it was in no hurry to change its
ultra-loose monetary policy, although traders said volumes were
thin due to holidays in the UK and Japan and could limit moves.
 ""The dollar remains under pressure, but it has been a very
fast move and it can be difficult to extend a move like that,""
said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""If the euro can break above a crucial level around $1.5140
then the pattern is constructive for a substantial move higher"".
 The euro was expected to meet resistance ahead of a reported
options barrier at $1.4900, while the Aussie was likely to need
strong momentum to lift it through large barriers at $1.10.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance against a
basket of major currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 73.052,
having plumbed a three-year low of 72.871 on Thursday.
 It is down around 1.4 percent this week, on course for its
biggest drop since a 2.5 percent fall in the week to Jan. 16.
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.4840 , off a
17-month peak of $1.4882 hit on Thursday on trading platform
EBS. The first resistance was expected at $1.4906, a peak from
Dec. 7 2009, ahead of a substantial barrier at $1.5000.
 Beyond $1.5000, the key target was the 2009 high of $1.5145.
 Flash estimates of euro zone inflation for April due at 0900
GMT could support the euro. They are expected to show inflation
remaining elevated at 2.7 percent year-on-year, adding weight to
expectations of further euro zone interest rate hikes.
 The Australian dollar  was steady at $1.0922, still
within easy reach of a 29-year peak of $1.0948. Option barriers
around $1.10 could cap the currency for now.

 MONTH-END FLOWS
 Analysts and traders said the dollar could face selling
pressure during the day, as investors tweak their portfolios at
the end of the month, with flows biased towards dollar selling.
 Compared with the steep falls against other currencies, the
dollar has held up reasonably well versus the yen in the past
few sessions. It last traded at 81.57 yen , steady on the
day and near a one-month low of 81.27 yen hit earlier this week.
 ""The signal to sell the USD against JPY is particularly
strong, as Japanese equities continued to underperform their
global counterparts,"" analysts at Citi said in a research note,
referring to their FX hedge rebalancing model.
 Month-end portfolio rebalancing can spur buying of
currencies that saw their asset markets underperform against
global peers during the month, and vice versa.
 Japanese shares have slid since last month's tsunami and
earthquake. MSCI's index of Japanese equities is down 1.7
percent in April <.MIWD00000PUS>, lagging well behind a 3.5
percent rally in MSCI's index of global shares.
 A trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore said the yen
may eventually come back under pressure against the dollar once
market players start re-focusing on weakness in Japan's economy
and the extent of the damage caused by the earthquake.
 Trading was subdued with Japanese financial markets shut for
a public holiday and UK markets closed for a royal wedding.

 * ECB, BoE meetings keep focus on European rate policy

 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - The prospect of low U.S.
interest rates for some time is likely to trigger more dollar
selling next week, with upcoming central bank meetings in Europe
serving as a reminder of greater chances of rate rises
elsewhere.
 The Federal Reserve's promise this week of continued
ultra-loose monetary policy in the world's largest economy has
taken U.S. and global shares to new peaks -- the Nasdaq index
hit 10-year highs and the MSCI index of world stocks hit its
highest in nearly three years.
 At the Fed's first post-meeting press conference, chairman
Ben Bernanke also soothed stock markets by saying inflation was
a transitory problem.
 The upshot is that the dollar is looking like the carry
trade of choice -- as a low-yielding borrowing tool to buy
higher-yielding currencies -- especially after the European
Central Bank raised rates in April.
 The dollar is hitting three-year lows against an index of
currencies, as well as its lowest since the Bretton Woods system
collapsed in 1973 against the inflation-adjusted version of the
Fed's broad trade-weighted index. The weak dollar and persistent
inflation concerns have propelled gold and silver to record
highs.
 The ECB holds its policy meeting on Thursday, with analysts
seeing a 90 percent probability of no change to current euro
zone rates of 1.25 percent. But they see a 45 percent
probability of a rate hike by end-June.
 ""Markets are positioned for further interest rate hikes from
the ECB,"" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe at
Standard Chartered.
 ""But if we have an indication next week that the ECB is
likely to raise rates in June, that's sooner than the market is
anticipating and would be euro-supportive and dollar-negative.""

 For POLL-Reuters BOE May pre-meeting poll results, see
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The dollar's fall is also an indication of structural
worries about the U.S. economy, its deficits, its ageing
population and the vulnerabilities inherent in a far-from-secure
reserve currency status.
 ""The euro is going up because it is the prime reserve
alternative to the dollar,"" said Neil Mellor, currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. 
 The euro has spurted nearly 2 percent since Monday's close,
and analysts expect it to pack on another two cents in the next
week or two, to hit $1.50 for the first time since Dec 2009.
 The U.S. economy is still showing some signs of life,
however, with employment data on Friday seen giving a further
sturdy boost to non-farm payrolls in April, following a 216,000
increase in March.
 
 EQUITY TREND
 If U.S. and European first-quarter earnings data next week
continue the current trend, they will also support a bright
equity outlook.
 Of 248 S&P 500 companies that have reported first quarter
earnings, 78 percent beat or met expectations, and 22 percent
came in below, according to data from Thomson Reuters StarMine.
 For the 81 STOXX Europe 600 companies which reported so far,
a slightly less stellar 58 percent beat or met expectations.
 Major European companies to report first quarter earnings
next week include Siemens and France Telecom and banks RBS and
Commerzbank.
 In the U.S., earnings are due from Kellogg, Time Warner and
AIG.
 
 GOVERNOR WATCH
 In addition to the ECB's post-meeting press conference,
which takes place in Helsinki, president Jean-Claude Trichet
speaks again at a conference in Finland, alongside his likely
successor, Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, and other
central bank governors.
 The Bank of England also meets next week, with an 80 percent
probability seen of no change in rates of 0.50 percent. But
another quarter point is expected on rates by the end of the
third quarter.
 Britons go to the polls on Thursday in a referendum on the
way legislators are elected, along with local elections in some
areas.
 The vote lacks headline appeal but is likely to show up
cracks in the coalition government, which is attempting to push
through tough austerity measures.
 ""We fear that the UK will experience a long period with poor
growth which can result in a larger rise in the debt burden than
currently anticipated,"" Danske analysts said in a note. 
 ""There is a good chance that rates will be kept at record
lows for a long time. The weak underlying growth and the tough
fiscal austerity measures crowd out monetary normalisation.""
 In bond markets, Spain auctions five-year debt on Thursday
as investors continue to fret about the euro zone periphery, in
particular the possibility of Greek debt restructuring.
 The worries have punched out peripheral debt spreads against
core German debt. But for now, the euro is proving resilient to
the debt woes.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2011 04:16AM ET</span>",TEXT-The EU's plan to rescue Doha trade talks," GENEVA, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Union has launched
a bid to rescue stalled global free trade talks with a
compromise proposal on the main sticking point -- industrial
tariffs.
Below is a full text copy of the proposal obtained by Reuters:
 Non-paper: a compromise on sectorals?
 Introduction
 Negotiations on sectoral tariff liberalisation are at this
moment the biggest obstacle to an Agreement in the Doha Round.
Negotiations on sectorals are a mandated part of the Doha
undertaking. 
 ""Tariff elimination"" was part of the initial Doha mandate.
The Hong Kong declaration confirmed sectorals would be part of
the package, but also specified they would be voluntary in
nature, or ""non-mandatory"". 
 At the same time, all proposals specify that sectorals will
only come into force when countries representing a ""critical
mass"" of trade are willing to participate. The reason for the
critical mass provision is the legitimate wish to avoid ""free
riders"", countries which do not participate in the sectoral
arrangement, but benefit from the tariff reductions. 
 The critical mass is usually defined as 90% of trade,
although certain sectorals have come into force with a smaller
share of trade covered, at least initially. However, the concept
of voluntary participation combined with the critical mass
concept has lead to a situation of blockage in the Round. 
 In practice, no sectoral can come into force without the
participation of major world traders, such as EU, US, China and
Japan, but also need the participation of a number of other
Members, developed and developing, in order to reach the
threshold. 
 So far no sectoral proposal has gathered enough support to
come into force, with even the more successful proposals stuck
at around 60 percent of world trade.
 
 Considerations
 The product basket approach has been presented as an attempt
to bring the parties together, but there have been no concrete
proposals by Members as to how to fill the baskets. The sectoral
negotiations have focussed so far mostly on tariff elimination,
or 0/0, which has been the traditional approach in sectoral
agreements, including those that came from the Uruguay Round. 
 However, these sectorals were much smaller in scope. For
instance the pharmaceutical arrangement covers only one chapter
out of chemicals chapters 28-39. 
 Sectorals in machinery were so far limited to construction
and agricultural machinery only. Even the largest (and most
successful) sectoral agreement, the Information Technology
Agreement (ITA) is only a limited subsector of the electronics
and electrical machinery sectoral which has been proposed in the
Doha Round. 
 Also, changes in world trade patterns have shifted trade
flows significantly in the favour of developing and emerging
countries, which now cover the majority of world trade. Some of
the major emerging countries whose participation is now required
for sectorals have significantly higher bound and applied
tariffs than the traditional trading powers, such as the EU, US
and Japan. 
 Therefore, participation of these countries in a purely 0/0
arrangement would require steeper tariff reductions, and thus be
challenging. At the same time, in those sectors where developing
countries now cover the large majority of world trade, developed
countries can hardly be expected to lower tariffs to 0 without
reciprocity from their main competitors.
 Another aspect of sectorals is preference erosion. Specific
provisions in the agreement have been designed to soften the
impact of erosion of preference margins for some of the poorest
WTO members. 
 Studies by the Secretariat show that most of the lines most
sensitive to preference erosion are in fish and clothing. Tariff
elimination in these sectors would undermine the benefits of the
preference erosion provisions in the NAMA-text.
 
 General principles
 A compromise on sectorals would have to take all of these
factors into account. Sectoral liberalisation has to be
substantial, but realistic and negotiable. If a compromise is to
stand a chance of success, participating countries should accept
the following guiding principles:
 * Recognising the principle of Special & Differential
Treatment, developing countries should be allowed to exercise
their rights to take flexibilities, as provided for in the par.
7 of the NAMA-text, also in sectorals.
 * Modalities and product baskets cannot be the same for all
sectors, as trading interests and conditions differ per sector,
but arrangements should not be overcomplicated. The simpler the
modality, the higher the chance of success.
 * All major traders should participate in a sectoral, but
contributions can be different and depend on a Member's level of
development, export performance and tariff levels in a sector.
 * Sectors where preference erosion is particularly strong
for LDC's and other groups of countries benefitting from
preferences should be avoided, as tariff elimination would
worsen the erosion of preference margins.
 A possible compromise 
 The core of a compromise on sectorals will have to consist
of the three biggest, commercially most important sectors:
chemicals, machinery and electronics. The following modalities
are proposed for these sectors:
 Chemicals and Machinery (a combination of 0/0 and 0/X):
developed countries move to 0 across the board. Developing
countries are also expected to participate in a 0 basket for
some products, in particular where sectoral arrangements are
already in place (for machinery: construction and agricultural
machinery). A 0/0 basket in chemicals could cover at least the
existing 0/0 arrangement (pharmaceuticals). 
 For other products, Developing countries would have access
to additional Special & Differential Treatment by applying X,
where X = the result following the application of the Swiss
formula cut plus a further reduction of a fixed percentage
point. This modality takes into account the fact that tariff
levels are generally already lower in developed countries than
in developing ones. 
 It also recognises that to fully eliminate tariffs, Members
with relatively high protection after the application of the
Swiss formula would have to do a very large effort. X for
developing members would be calibrated in a way that delivers
significant liberalisation, proportionate tariff reductions and
efforts commensurate with those of developed members. 
 The contribution of developing countries will be equivalent,
but not the same; end rates would be different, depending on the
base level after formula. For chemicals tariff reductions should
lead at least to the existing Chemicals Tariff Harmonisation
Agreement (CTHA) levels for all developing country participants.
 Those developing Members already applying the levels of the
CTHA should reduce their tariffs by the Swiss formula cut plus
a fixed percentage point cut, with new end rates ending up
between the CTHA levels and 0.
 Electronics & electrical machinery (0/0): in this sector the
overwhelming majority of world exports come from developing
countries. 
 Therefore it seems reasonable to expect that those
developing countries with a strong export performance in the
sector join the effort of developed countries and eliminate
tariffs in the sector. This also corresponds to current practice
in the ITA, which covers a large number of products in this
sector. 
 However, recognising the sensitivities in the audiovisual
sector in several Members, the audiovisual sector should be
excluded from the sectoral.
 Other sectors could also be considered, but progress would
first have to be made on the three biggest sectors. For all
other sectors, more limited in scope and coverage, and more
similar to the original sectorals from the Uruguay Round, the
only meaningful modality would be 0/0.

(Adds closing share performance, analyst comment, links)	
 By Elzio Barreto	
 HONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's first
yuan-denominated IPO plunged as much as 11 percent on its Friday
debut as investors turned their noses up at the low yields
offered by billionaire Li Ka-shing's Hui Xian real
estate investment trust.	
 Seeking to tap a growing pool of low-yielding Chinese
currency deposits in the territory, Hui Xian was hoping the lure
of an appreciating yuan would help attract stronger interest for
the REIT.	
 The weak debut came after Hui Xian, which owns the Oriental
Plaza commercial complex in Beijing, priced its $1.6 billion
offer at the low end of expectations.	
 ""This IPO was never popular from the word go,"" said Sylvia
Wong, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian. ""The underlying asset is not
particularly attractive. They only have one property so you have
to ask yourself why you want to buy this REIT when others in the
market are offering higher yields.""	
 Market sentiment for China IPOs has also soured in the past
week, with Chinese car dealer Pangda Automobile Trade Co Ltd
tumbling 23 percent in its Shanghai debut on
Thursday. [ID:nL3E7FS079] China stock markets closed out their
worst week this year on Friday. 
 
 
 
 Hui Xian closed down 9.4 percent at 4.75 yuan, after earlier
trading as low as 4.66 yuan, compared with its 5.24 yuan IPO
price.	
 The dismal debut comes nearly one month after another flop
for billionaire Li, the $5.5 billion initial offering of
Hutchison Port Holdings Trust . The Singapore-listed
trust is down 9.4 percent since going public last month, trading
below its IPO price for all but two days.	
 A disappointing start to Hui Xian could prevent other
property developers from rushing to the market with similar
products, analysts say. 
 When asked about Hui Xian's debut, Hong Kong Exchange and
Clearing CEO Charles Li said: ""Any transaction that is
completed is a successful transaction. But in the end, whether a
particular transaction trades better or worse, that's really up
to the market.""
 
 BALLOONING YUAN DEPOSITS	
 A surge in yuan-denominated deposits in Hong Kong has been
driving many companies to issue bonds in the Chinese currency in
the territory. Equity offerings are seen as the next step as
Beijing looks to make its currency more international.	
 Investors holding yuan deposits in Hong Kong get paid rates
of 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent, while yuan-denominated bonds
yield between 1 percent and 3 percent, making IPOs denominated
in the Chinese currency an attractive option for yield-hungry
investors. Some investors are also drawn by the prospect that
the yuan will steadily appreciate against the U.S. dollar.	
 On Friday, the yuan breezed past 6.50 per dollar, surpassing
the psychologically important level for the first time and
rising 27.5 percent since China's landmark currency reforms in
2005. [ID:nL3E7FT0RH].	
 Yuan deposits in Hong Kong totalled 407.7 billion yuan at
the end of February, more than quadrupling from a year earlier,
with authorities and analysts expecting the amount to rise to
nearly 1 trillion yuan by the end of 2011.	
 
 YIELD NOT ATTRACTIVE	
 Hui Xian priced at 5.24 yuan, the low end of a 5.24-5.58
yuan range, signalling demand was not as strong as previously
anticipated as investors looked for higher-yielding
alternatives. 
 The REIT will yield 4.33 percent in 2011 and 4.73 percent in
2012, the term sheet said. 
 By comparison, other REITs listed in Hong Kong offer higher
returns, although all of those are denominated in Hong Kong
dollars, which is tied to the U.S. dollar. 
 REITs must pay out most of their earnings in dividends to
attract favourable tax treatment.	
 Link REIT is forecast to yield 4.5 percent in
2011, Regal REIT 4.8 percent, GZI REIT 6.9
percent, Prosperity REIT 5.8 percent and Fortune REIT
6.5 percent, according to estimates by UBS.	
 Prosperity and Fortune REITs are also controlled by Li.	
 Li is a complex figure, regarded for his humble origins and
philanthropy and known locally as ""superman"" for his deal-making
prowess. His no-nonsense, hard-driving style helped make him the
world's 11 richest man, according to Forbes magazine.	
 His two major holdings, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and
Cheung Kong , are heavyweights not only at home but
also globally, owning the world's largest operator of container
ports, the biggest health and beauty retailer, and Husky Energy
, Canada's No. 4 oil company, among others.	
 Hui Xian's Oriental Plaza complex in Beijing includes a
shopping center, two serviced-apartment towers, a high-end hotel
and eight office buildings. 
 Office rents in Beijing are a fraction of the rents in Hong
Kong or Shanghai because of an abundance of space in the Chinese
capital, but that situation should reverse in coming years and
could boost Hui Xian, said Nicole Wong, regional head of
property research at brokerage CLSA. 
 Hui Xian's IPO was split, with 80 percent sold to
institutional investors and hedge funds overseas and 20 percent
to retail investors in Hong Kong, according to a term sheet of
the offering seen by Reuters last week.	
 The retail portion of the IPO was subscribed just 2.5 times,
which is relatively low compared with other initial offerings in
Hong Kong.	
 BOC International , Citic Securities and HSBC
were hired as joint bookrunners for the Hui
Xian offering.

 By Jason Subler and Emma Ashburn	
 SHANGHAI, April 29 (Reuters) - China's yuan breezed past
6.50 per dollar on Friday, surpassing the psychologically
important level for the first time and raising expectations that
Beijing will continue to let the currency strengthen quickly to
battle stubbornly high inflation.	
 While the 6.50 per dollar level is not significant from a
technical standpoint, Chinese media and economists are likely to
seize on it as evidence of how far the government has come in
allowing it to appreciate since its landmark currency reforms in
2005. It has gained 27.5 percent since then.	
 China's decision to loosen the reins on the yuan
could also encourage further rises in other emerging-market
currencies, especially in Asia, helping to temper the impact of
high commodity prices as governments from Beijing to Bangkok
battle imported inflation.	
 Traders seized on the signal, pushing the currency to as
high as 6.4898 per dollar in morning spot market trade, meaning
the currency has now gained over 5 percent against the dollar
since it was unleashed from a de facto peg last June.	
 ""This is a signal they will continue appreciation. We can't
see any signs they will actually speed up appreciation, but they
are likely to keep to the pace that we're seeing now,"" said Liu
Dongliang, analyst at China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.	
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has guided the yuan up by
more than 1 percent over the past month, accelerating its
appreciation at a time when the dollar has fallen to three-year
lows against a basket of currencies.	
 The PBOC set the tone for Friday's trade by setting the
yuan's mid-point -- the level from which dollar/yuan may rise or
fall 0.5 percent during the day -- at another fresh high, after
a string of record high fixings over the last few weeks.	
 
 CRITICS IN WASHINGTON UNIMPRESSED	
 Policymakers in Beijing have made it increasingly clear that
they are willing to use the currency as one way of fighting
inflation, which hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, by
helping to buffer the impact of imported commodity prices.	
 That is in keeping with Beijing's long-standing stance that
it will let the yuan become more flexible over time, out of its
own interests -- and not because of pressure from the outside.	
 Still, some of the strongest critics of China's currency
policy have continued to keep up their pressure on the issue.	
 U.S. Senator Charles Schumer said on Thursday that he had
come away from meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing with
the impression that they thought the yuan's recent gains were
adequate.	
 ""Despite its rampant inflation problem, China's government
does not seem prepared to let the value of the yuan rise much
higher above its present level,"" the New York Democrat said in a
statement. [ID:nW1E7FI01E]	
 Analysts and traders expect the yuan to continue to rise at
a relatively rapid pace. Many onshore forex traders expect
roughly 5-6 percent appreciation for the year as a whole, which
would imply around 4.5 percent further in gains yet this year.	
 Traders in offshore yuan forwards have also
begun to bet on more gains in recent weeks. At the end of March,
implied yuan appreciation over the next year stood at just 1.7
percent, but that has risen to 2.8 percent now.	
 
 FREEING UP EMERGING CURRENCY GAINS?	
 With China continuing to allow only incremental gains
against the dollar, however, the yuan has continued to fall
against the currencies of other major trading partners such as
Japan and European countries as the dollar has plunged.	
 The yuan's nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), its value
against a trade-weighted basket, has fallen by around 2 percent
since November 2010, adding to pressure on Beijing to do more if
it does not want imports on a broader basis to become more dear.	
 Still, most analysts do not expect any drastic measures from
the government, despite some market rumours in recent weeks
about the possibility of a one-off revaluation to help temper
expectations of stronger imported inflation.	
 For one, China racked up a rare trade deficit in the first
quarter, partly due to higher import prices, something the
powerful export lobby is likely to be pointing to as a reason to
proceed with caution.	
 More likely than a revaluation might be some further tweak
to the foreign exchange regime, such as a widening of the daily
trading band, which would at least send a signal on authorities'
intentions, even if the band is rarely fully used.	
 ""We haven't heard that they will widen the trading band, but
if they did so it wouldn't be too surprising,"" said Liu.	
 A continued rise in the yuan, commonly referred to as CNY,
would probably be welcomed as well in other emerging markets, as
it would put them at less of a disadvantage in trade if they let
their own currencies rise.	
 ""The currency war has clearly morphed into a war against
inflation among EM policymakers in recent weeks, and China's
willingness to see a faster pace of CNY appreciation is likely
to provide more support for EM currencies going forward,"" said
Nizam Idris, emerging market strategist at UBS in Singapore.

 SHANGHAI, April 29 (Reuters) - China's yuan breezed past
6.50 per dollar on Friday, surpassing the psychologically
important level for the first time and raising expectations that
Beijing will continue to let the currency strengthen more
quickly as a way of battling inflation.	
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the tone for the day
by setting the yuan's mid-point at another fresh high, and
traders seized on the signal, pushing the currency to as high as
6.4929 per dollar in early trade.	
 The yuan, also known as the renminbi, has now gained over 5
percent against dollar since it was unleashed from a de facto
peg last June, and 1.5 percent so far this year.	
 While the 6.50 per dollar level is not significant from a
technical standpoint, Chinese media and economists are likely to
seize on it as evidence of how far the government has come in
allowing it to appreciate since its landmark currency reforms in
2005. It has gained 27.5 percent since then.	
 ""This is a signal they will continue appreciation. We can't

Dongliang, analyst at China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.	
 Beijing has made it increasingly clear that it is willing to
use the currency as one way of fighting inflation, which is
running at over 5 percent from a year earlier, partly as a way
of blunting rising commodity prices.	
 Critics in the United States and elsewhere continue to press
for Beijing to take more action to let the yuan strengthen, to
alleviate what they view as an unfair advantage for Chinese
exporters.	
 Indeed, the yuan's gains against the dollar are only part of
the picture, because that has happened against the backdrop of
the dollar falling to nearly three-year lows against a basket of
currencies .	
 The yuan has accordingly been falling on a trade-weighted
basis as well, meaning the rise Beijing has been engineering
against the U.S. currency has in effect managed only to temper
its fall on a broader basis.	
 Most onshore forex dealers still expect the yuan to rise by
roughly 5-6 percent versus the dollar this year as a whole, as
the central bank continues with its gradualist approach to
flexibility.	
 Market rumours have surfaced recently that the PBOC could be
planning more drastic moves, from a widening of the daily
trading band to a one-off revaluation, but most forex dealers do
not expect such moves anytime soon because faster appreciation
can already be carried out under the current system.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - The dollar floundered at
three-year lows against a basket of currencies on Friday,
keeping precious metals near record highs, although the risk of
dealers covering bets against the beleaguered U.S. currency in
thin trading looms, especially given holidays in some centres
including Japan.	
 Though some signs of dollar short covering versus some Asian
currencies, particularly the Malaysian ringgit was seen,
the medium-term outlook continues to be for dollar weakening,
given U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's pledge to
continue with the ultra-easy monetary policy.	
 Sean Callow, a strategist at Westpac in Sydney said
sentiment towards the dollar is ""profoundly bearish with no
catalyst for reversal"" at least, until the all important
non-farm payrolls data next week.	
 With U.S. economic data this week also offering no succour
to the ailing dollar, the dollar's index , which tracks
its performance against a basket of major currencies, fell to
its lowest level since July 2008 before recovering somewhat.	
 The dollar index is down 7.5 percent this year, making it
one of the world's worst-performing assets.	
 ""The likely indicator of a reversal in the USD's
(mis)fortunes is global equities. A sustained bout of
profit-taking would assuredly spillover into foreign exchange
markets, with the EUR and AUD returning back to earth,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon.	
 For now, that reversal looked unlikely with world equities
up by some 5 percent in the past two weeks while
Asian stocks outside Japan hovering close to a
three-year peak hit on Thursday.	
 For the month, Asia-ex Japan is set to rise by nearly 4
percent while its year-to-date gain so far is 5 percent.	
 On Friday though, stocks ran out of steam as traders took
profits after a recent rally with Australian shares
falling by 1.5 percent led by miners due to the strong Aussie
while rising mortgage rates pushed Hong Kong stocks
lower. 
 ""It's across the board, apart from the banking sector...the
high Aussie dollar is now starting to weigh on this market,
particularly with the miners,"" Burrell Stockbroking dealer Jamie
Elgar said. 
 The Australian dollar stood at $1.0902, still
within easy reach of a 29-year peak of $1.0948, having gained
nearly 13 percent since the March lows. 
 
 ROARING CREDIT	
 While equities had a somewhat lukewarm week, Asian credit
markets had a smashing one with investors snapping up issuances
out of the region and credit spreads narrowing substantially.	
 Primary markets enjoyed one of their best weeks with
Indonesia's $2.5 billion dollar bond sale garnering blockbuster
demand while a Chinese utility company and a Philippine port
operator pushed through perpetual bond offerings.	
 Robust demand for perpetual bonds or perps indicated that
investors were scampering to lock in high yielding rates in an
otherwise low interest rate environment with outlook positive
for yields.	
 Weekly average of issuances in the first 17 weeks of the
year is nearly $2 billion helping the Asia ex-Japan year to date
total a whopping $33.45 billion. The weekly average of supply is
nearly a fifth higher than the average for 2010. 
 
 COMMODITIES SOFTEN	
 The broad commodity market rally softened with silver
pulling back by nearly a dollar after rocketing to $49.51 per
ounce, its highest since 1980, while NYMEX crude for June 
pulled away from the $113 per barrel mark. 
 Both Shanghai copper futures contracts  and wheat
futures too declined.	
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a broad
indicator of the commodity market, is however up nearly 10
percent this year, making it the world's best performing asset
group.	
 Thursday's batch of weak U.S data meant bonds had
yet another good day with benchmark ten-year U.S. yields
steadying near 3.32 percent, well on track for its
biggest monthly drop in eight months.	
 Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan cracked through the
6.5 per dollar line for the first time, indicating Beijing's
determination to fight inflation and giving a leg up to other
currencies.[ID:nL3E7FT04P]

 * Colombia, Chile, Peru also integrating stock markets
 LIMA, April 28 (Reuters) - Leaders of Latin America's most
aggressive free traders -- Peru, Chile, Colombia and Mexico --
agreed on Thursday to deepen their existing commercial ties and
further open doors to lucrative Asian markets.
 The so-called Pacific Alliance, which Panama could also
join, creates a framework for ""deep integration"" that will
eventually allow for the freer movement of goods, people and
services.
 It would help the bloc negotiate as a group with
fast-growing Asian countries and offer an alternative platform
for global firms who tend to look first to Brazil's vast but
relatively more closed economy when they come to Latin America
to invest.
 ""This is a historic step for our continent,"" Peruvian
President Alan Garcia, who leaves office in July, said of what
has become his signature foreign policy project.
 The initiative, which would supplant a bevy of bilateral
pacts the four countries already share, represents a greater
emphasis on so-called south-south integration among booming
emerging markets in Latin America and Asia.
 Though the four countries have trade deals with the United
States, it has lost its allure as a trade partner because of a
sluggish economy. And Colombia has grown frustrated by a U.S.
Congress reluctant to approve a bilateral agreement.
 Mexico spent years sending roughly 80 percent of its
exports to the United States, only to find itself thrown into
recession during the global crisis when shipments north
slumped.
 In Asia, both Chile and Peru have trade pacts with China,
among other markets. Peru, Chile and Mexico also belong to the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade pact, a club of 21
economies that Colombia has long aspired to join.
 Trade experts say the Pacific Alliance could progress more
quickly than existing regional trade blocs such as Mercosur,
which is led by Brazil and includes Argentina, Chile and
Uruguay. It has been around for years but has made fewer
advances breaking down trade barriers.
 Brazil also balked at efforts to form the 34-nation
Free-Trade Area of the Americas, backed by the United States.
 ""Of the many integration projects in Latin America, this
agreement has a better chance of success,"" said Carlos Aquino,
director of the center for economic studies at Lima's San
Marcos University. ""The four countries are stable democracies
with open economies.""
 STOCK MARKET INTEGRATION
 In another integration effort, this month the stock
exchanges of Colombia, Chile and Peru will formally launch an
bourse known as MILA that cross-lists shares of the companies
in all three countries.
 MILA will trail only Brazil's bourse in size, and Garcia on
Thursday encouraged the Mexican stock market to join the group,
though Mexican President Felipe Calderon did not openly support
the idea.
 At the end of December the Chilean, Peruvian and Colombian
exchanges had a combined market cap of $718.8 billion.
 Investors have worried Peru's open economy and
pro-investment stance will be threatened if left-wing
nationalist Ollanta Humala is elected president on June 5, and
markets have fallen as a result.
 The most recent polls give him a narrow lead over
right-wing lawmaker Keiko Fujimori.
 Humala has in the past sounded skeptical about free trade
but says he would work to boost exports and favors regional
integration.

 * EU takes middle ground on thorny sectoral issue
 * Introduces ""X"" factor tariff cut plan for some products
(adds details, background) 
 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, April 28 (Reuters) - The European Union launched a
bid to rescue stalled global free trade talks on Thursday with a
compromise proposal on the main sticking point -- industrial
tariffs.
 The plan, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters on the eve
of a key meeting of World Trade Organisation (WTO) members, aims
to find some middle ground between the United States and major
emerging economies, especially China.
 Using the technical language and complex formulae of global
trade, the two-and-a-half page plan focuses on tariffs for
chemicals, machinery and electronics and seeks an approach that
is tailored for each sector.
 ""Negotiations on sectoral tariff liberalisation are at this
moment the biggest obstacle to an agreement in the Doha Round,""
the proposal said in a reference to the 10-year-old set of
negotiations named after the Qatari capital where they began.
 The Doha talks are the disarmament negotiations of the
commercial world -- aiming to keep at bay the self-defeating
spiral of tariffs, subsidies and quotas that can choke trade
and, economists say, global prosperity.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, speaking in Washington,
said countries should give another push to finish the
negotiations despite wide differences that have raised fears
that the round is dead.
 Traditionally, ""sectoral"" negotiations on industrial tariffs
have aimed for a finishing point where no country charges any
tariffs at all.
 Under existing Doha proposals, developed countries like the
United States are expected to deliver zero tariffs, while
developing countries reduce tariffs under an agreed formula.
 The United States argues that some developing countries,
especially China, should do more, because in the decade since
the talks began their exporting power has grown significantly.
China says that Doha -- officially called the Doha Development
Round -- was put together with just such growth in mind.
 The EU has tended to sit between the two, though its
interests are closely aligned to those of the United States.
 The EU proposal would add a negotiated ""X"" factor to
developing country tariffs cuts in some product areas in a bid
to shift the balance some way towards the U.S. position, while
keeping a certain level of protection for developing countries.
 In others -- electronics and electrical machinery for
example -- where developing countries dominate the export
market, some developing countries would be expected to eliminate
tariffs completely.
 ""Modalities and product baskets cannot be the same for all
sectors as trading interests and conditions differ per sector,
but arrangements should not be overcomplicated. The simpler the
modality, the higher the chance of success,"" the EU proposal
said.
 The EU's plan was circulated among trade missions on
Thursday and presented to an informal meeting of representative
nations called to prepare for Friday's Trade Negotiations
Committee session which oversees Doha discussions.
 An EU official declined to comment.

 * Brazil to see prolonged tightening cycle - central bank
 * Central bank sees wage increases as risk to inflation
 * Some policymakers urged aggressive action to tame prices
(Recasts first two paragraphs)
 By Vanessa Stelzer and Luciana Lopez
 SAO PAULO, April 28 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank said
interest rates will remain high for a long time as it grapples
with strong inflation and it revealed growing concern about
above-inflation wage deals.
 Brazil's interest rates are already among the world's
highest but a key inflation reading is now nearing a government
ceiling and the fight against higher prices is dominating the
early months of President Dilma Rousseff's administration.
 With labor unions pushing for wage hikes above inflation,
price pressures will likely remain a worry for some time.
 Brazil's biggest economic boom in more than two decades has
created a labor shortage that is driving up wages amid threats
of strikes.
 In minutes released Thursday of its April 20 meeting, the
central bank's monetary policy committee (COPOM) said the
economy faced an ""important risk in the possibility of wage
increases incompatible with production.""
 It added wage hikes could affect the ""inflation dynamic.""
 The central bank last week raised its benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points to 12 percent to cool inflation.
 That was less than the 50 basis points expected by most
analysts, leading economists to worry the central bank, under
new chief Alexandre Tombini, might be turning too dovish.
 But the minutes of last week's meeting sounded more
hawkish, sending up yields on short-term interest rate futures
as investors bet borrowing costs would remain higher for longer
than initially thought.
 ""This is a really tough document, maybe the most hawkish of
the new central bank,"" said Jankiel Santos, the chief economist
for Espirito Santo Investment bank in Sao Paulo.
 ""They're clearly signaling that they've rethought their
policy strategy ... For anyone who thought there might be a
pause at the next meeting, that's not what the bank signaled.""
 Last week, the COPOM said its seven members were split on
the magnitude of the rate hike: five wanted a 25 bps hike while
two wanted to raise rates by 50 bps.
 The crack in the central bank's usually unanimous facade
underscores the challenges for Brazil. The government wants to
slow inflation without derailing the brisk growth that has
boosted Brazil's status on the global economic stage and lifted
millions into the middle class.
 Already 12-month inflation has sped to 6.44 percent through
mid-April. The central bank this year is targeting inflation of
4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.
 ""The (monetary policy committee) understands unanimously
that... the total adjustment to the benchmark interest rate, as
of this meeting, should be sufficiently prolonged,"" the bank
said in the minutes.
 Under Tombini, the central bank has been reluctant to raise
interest rates aggressively because that would likely boost the
country's currency even further.
 The real's 49 percent gains since 2008 have hurt Brazilian
companies by making exports more expensive abroad and fueling a
wave of cheap imports, especially from China.
 Instead, the bank has signaled its reliance on so-called
macroprudential tools such as reserve requirements, which limit
how much banks can lend out. Economists have been split on the
effectiveness of such measures, though.
 SLOW AND STEADY WINS?
 Yields on shorter-termed interest rate futures contracts
rose after the minutes, as investors raised their bets for more
interest rate hikes in the coming months.
 But yields on longer-dated contracts dipped, with investors
tempering their views for interest rates in 2013 and beyond.
 Brazil is among a group of powerhouse emerging markets that
have begun increasing interest rates to fight rising prices,
even as many developed economies continue to struggle.
 Chile's central bank this month raised interest rates by 50
basis points to 4.50 percent to hold back the local effects of
rising commodity prices around the world. Policy-makers there
said they see inflation returning to normal, in meeting minutes
also released Thursday.
 But Brazil's economic outlook remains particularly
uncertain, with the central bank here noting imbalances between
supply and demand and still-expanding credit.
 As a result, said Silvio Campos Neto, an economist with
Tendencias consultancy in Sao Paulo, ""the bank prefers to go
slowly, so they can weigh the effects of changes from meeting
to meeting.""

 The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500

the Nasdaq this week surged to a 10-year high.
 With trading volume weak and economic data suggesting a
still unsteady path to recovery, it raises questions as to how
much longer the equity market can maintain the rally.
 ""There is a disconnect in the market right now -- we are

 U.S. crude oil futures hit a 31-month high settlement in a
volatile trading session that saw a weak dollar attract
investors seeking alternative assets. U.S. monetary policy has
encouraged investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets.
 U.S. crude for June delivery  settled up 10 cents at
$112.86 a barrel. In London, ICE Brent June crude  ended
at $125.02, off just 11 cents for the session.

think that the dollar's fall will be stemmed, creating
incentive to keep buying commodities,"" said Stephen Schork,

 The dollar was down 0.83 percent at 81.53 yen , while
the U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a basket of six currencies, fell
to its lowest since July 2008, and was last off 0.55 percent at

 The Fed's ultra-loose monetary policy has been a bane for
the dollar. But low U.S. interest rates have been a boon for
the euro, which is up nearly 11 percent this year.

first-time claims for unemployment benefits jumped to 429,000
last week, well above a Reuters consensus forecasts of 392,000,
may be a silver lining.
 ""At the moment, we regard the rise (in claims) as
technical,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist of
Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.
 ""We need to see initial unemployment claims fall sharply
below 400,000 in upcoming weeks to make sure the economy is not
slowing due to the latest headwind of higher gasoline prices.""
 Major world stock indexes had surged to near three-year

 There is bound to be a long gap between ending the Fed's
commitment to low rates for an extended period and the eventual
normalization of U.S. rates, which would improve the dollar's
yield advantage against the rest of the world, she said. 
 ""This is a story for 2012 at the earliest.""
 With few positives seen for the dollar, the euro is on

 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, slid to a three-year low of 72.871 and

 The dollar index has fallen around 3.5 percent this month,
bringing it closer to a record low of 70.698 hit in March 2008.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4819 . The euro hit
its highest since early December 2009 after breaching
resistance around $1.4850, the upper part of an uptrend channel
since mid-February.
 ""It's all one way across the board. Everyone seems to be
betting on a weaker dollar and it seems a pretty safe bet,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen. ""The market is taking on board the more dovish
element of the (Fed) statement and the fact there is no

 He added that it was ""not a bold forecast"" to expect the
euro to hit $1.50 in the next week or two.
 Euro technical resistance is seen at the Dec. 7, 2009 peak

$1.4930 up to $1.4950, where another options barrier was

 * March industry output surges, sets year-on-year record

 * Reuters poll points to another steep rate hike in May
(Adds Reuters poll, minister comments, peso close)
 By Brad Haynes
 SANTIAGO, April 28 (Reuters) - Chile's industrial output
surged in March and the central bank signaled it had room to
carry on raising interest rates to keep ahead of inflation.
 Chile's industrial production  expanded a
seasonally adjusted 2.4 percent in March compared with February
and posted the highest rise on record from a year earlier, the
government statistics agency INE said on Thursday.
 Minutes from the central bank's April 12 policy meeting,
also published on Thursday, showed its board saw inflation
normalizing but voted unanimously for a second straight
aggressive 50 basis-point rate hike this month. The bank has
said more rate hikes will follow.
 ""With today's data, I see another 50 basis-point increase
at the bank's May meeting,"" said Benjamin Sierra, an analyst
with Scotiabank in Santiago. ""In the minutes, they're saying
they want to keep ahead of the curve.""
 Chile has raised its benchmark interest rate 400 basis
points since June, to 4.5 percent, to contain price pressures
fueled by global commodity prices and robust growth. Inflation
expectations have breached the bank's annual target but eased
following more aggressive rate hikes in recent months.
 Meanwhile, the economy continues to rebound. Industrial
output soared 30.9 percent in March compared with the same
month last year, way above market expectations that accounted
for a low base of comparison after the February 2010
earthquake.
 ""All the board members agreed on the need to continue
withdrawing monetary stimulus,"" said the minutes of the bank's
April 12 meeting. ""Several board members said the benchmark
interest rate was still below its neutral level.""
 Emerging market peers from Thailand to Brazil are raising
interest rates to beat back mounting inflation expectations

 At a meeting last week, Brazil's central bank recognized
the inflation outlook there had worsened since March. But it
hiked rates by a lower-than-expected 25 basis points in a split
decision, according to meeting minutes released on Thursday.

 The central bank has sharply raised its inflation forecast
for 2011 to 4.3 percent, due to high global food and oil
prices. It said annual inflation would subside below 4.0
percent in early 2012. [ID:nN04237988]
 Chilean consumer prices rose in March at the fastest pace
in 18 months, though a central bank poll of traders this week
forecast monthly inflation easing to 0.4 percent in April.
[ID:nN08178268]
 The central bank minutes showed all the board members in
agreement that inflation readings were normalizing, but that
domestic demand, employment and economic activity continued to
grow vigorously.
 In a Reuters poll conducted on Thursday, 10 of 18 analysts
expected the bank to raise interest rates by 50 basis points
next month. Five expected the bank to opt for a more moderate
25 basis points, while two were undecided on the size of the
hike. Only one saw the rate unchanged.
 Some in the market are betting the bank will ease the pace
of hikes to help tame the peso , which is trading at
three-year highs after erasing the impact of a $12 billion
currency intervention launched in January.
 The peso gained 0.3 percent on Thursday to bid 460.7 per
dollar as the greenback extended losses globally after the U.S.
central bank emboldened bearish sentiment by signaling it would
retain an accommodative monetary policy. [ID:nN28243687]
 Widening interest rate differentials with slower-growing
developed economies have drawn a flood of hot money into many
emerging market economies, leading to export-damaging
appreciation of their currencies.
 Central Bank President Jose De Gregorio reiterated this
week, however, that unlike some Latin American nations, Chile
was not facing dollar inflows that merit capital controls. He
has repeatedly said the bank will prioritize its fight against
inflation over taming the peso. [ID:nN26270395]
 Finance Minister Felipe Larrain reiterated on Thursday that
he does not think imposing capital controls is the right way to
combat the peso's rally.
 Larrain also told reporters that the government had no
plans to revise its economic growth targets upward after the
surge in March industrial output.
 The central bank held the rate at a record low of 0.5
percent for almost a year from mid-2009 to help the economy
recover from the global financial crisis last February's
devastating quake. Chile's rates peaked at 8.25 percent in late
2008.

 By Chrystia Freeland
 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The American blogosphere lit
up this week with discussion of a report from the International
Monetary Fund that, by some measures, the Chinese economy will
be bigger than the U.S. economy by 2016.
 It makes a great headline, but that story was, of course,
old news: Given China's size, and the speed with which it is
growing, simple arithmetic tells you that its economy will one
day be bigger than that of the United States. The only question
is precisely when.
 The bigger surprise is the huge affection U.S. capitalists
have for Communist China.
 ""I would say that today when I go to China, I find more
people in government who are interested in learning about the
things that private equity can do to help an economy and help
companies than you often do in Washington,"" David Rubenstein,
co-founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group, one of
the world's largest private equity firms, said when I
interviewed him at a Thomson Reuters conference this week.
 ""Washington, for a number of reasons, is not as focused on
the joys of private equity,"" Mr. Rubenstein explained, with a
wry smile. ""So very often, you have to defend yourself when
you're talking to a member of Congress.""
 By contrast, Mr. Rubenstein said, he gets a warm reception
in the People's Republic: ""What they really think is that
private equity firms have shown in the West that they know how
to make companies more efficient, that they know how to make
workers more efficient and managers more efficient and how to
make companies more productive. And that's something they
want.""
 The ironic result, Mr. Rubenstein said, is this: ""I've
often thought that if Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon came back
from the dead, they wouldn't recognize their respective
capitals because one has become very capitalist and one is less
capitalist.""
 Mr. Rubenstein has a terrific turn of phrase, but the
content of his remarks is conventional wisdom among U.S.
businessmen today. In Mr. Rubenstein's world, it is a truth
universally acknowledged that China, with its censorship,
central plan and one-party state, is a better place to do
business than the United States.
 In fact, this has become such a familiar refrain that it is
easy to lose sight of what a radical assertion it is. We used
to think that capitalism and democracy went together: That was
the premise behind much of the U.S.-led global nation-building
effort of the past two decades. But it has now become
commonplace to hear the United States' most successful
businessmen assert that the world's great power that most
explicitly rejects democracy -- China -- is also the most
business-friendly.
 This embrace of Chinese communism by U.S. capitalists is a
very big deal. But it shouldn't be entirely surprising. The
best businessmen -- and Mr. Rubenstein is very, very good --
are pragmatists. Deng Xiaoping famously said it didn't matter
whether a cat was black or white so long as it caught mice.
Smart businessmen are likewise pretty indifferent to a regime's
ideology (and indeed its treatment of dissidents and
journalists and other such niceties) as long as their deals can
get done and their tax rates are lenient.
 Judged on those terms, so long as you have a skill or a
technology that the comrades have decided China needs, their
authoritarian system can be welcoming indeed, and free of many
of the delays and frustrations getting things done in a
democracy can entail.
 It is easy to equate that effectiveness of execution with
good government. But fans of authoritarian regimes, including
well-run ones like China, should never forget the agency
problem that is their big structural flaw: For their systems to
work, dictators need not only be smart; they must also act in
the interests of the state, not of themselves. But it doesn't
always work out that way.
 Autocrats have long liked to assert that l'etat, c'est moi
-- but often, even when dictators are clever and benign, there
is an insuperable divergence of interests. That is important to
remember when it comes to China. Indeed, George Soros, the
legendary fund manager, recently made the provocative argument
that one of China's most contentious policies -- its
undervalued currency -- is such a fraught issue because it is
wrapped up in the self-interest of its mandarins.
 Speaking at a conference a few weeks ago, Mr. Soros argued
that the undervalued currency was ""a form of transferring
purchasing power -- wealth -- from the citizens to the
government without imposing taxation. It was an involuntary
transfer without the negative effects of taxation, and this
made the central government very powerful, attracted the best
talents and held the best talents in the government or
associated with the government because it was also a way of
becoming wealthy.""
 The problem, Mr. Soros contended, was that today the
national interest would be served by allowing the currency to
appreciate -- but the officials whose job it is to make that
call are loath to give up the personal benefits of an
undervalued exchange rate. ""While the positive development
would be for a gradual relaxation"" of the exchange rate, he
said, ""there is great resistance somewhere in the government
mechanism to relax this system, which serves the interest of
those in power very well.""
 As we prepare for a world in which China is the largest
economy, we should be on the lookout for moments like this,
when the interests of the state and of its mandarins don't
coincide. And it might be worth remembering that democracy, for
all its quarrelsome inefficiencies, has the great virtue of
making the conflicts of interest between the state's servants
and the state itself transparent, and making it easy to kick
the bums out when those conflicts become acute.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar extended
losses on Thursday, sparking a surge in silver to record
prices, while Wall Street faltered on news of unexpectedly slow
U.S. economic growth.
 Spot silver  hit an all-time high of $49.51 an ounce
as the dollar's slide and yet another record in gold triggered
heavy speculative buying. For details see [ID:nWEN2159].
 Silver's record rise came after U.S. Commerce Department
data showed gross domestic product for the first quarter slowed
to a 1.8 percent annual pace, or two-tenths of a percent less
than markets had expected, a rate that turned oil prices lower.
[ID:nCAT005418]
 U.S. and German government debt rose after the GDP data,
which marked a sharp drop from the 3.1 percent rate in the
fourth quarter of 2010.
 Adding to the economic concerns, first-time claims for U.S.
jobless benefits jumped to 429,000 last week, well above a
392,000 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll.
 The dollar drifted lower a day after the U.S. Federal
Reserve emboldened bearish sentiment by signaling it would
retain its accommodative monetary policy. [ID:nN28243687]
 The ultra-loose policy has been a bane for the dollar. But
low U.S. interest rates have been a boon for the euro, which is
up nearly 11 percent this year.
 The Fed statement and a news conference by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke indicated authorities plan to ""monetize our debt, and
basically to devalue the dollar,"" said Robert Lutts, chief
investment officer of Cabot Money Management.
 ""The metal markets are recognizing that and it is being
priced in. What monetization means is that, down the road, we
will have more inflation,"" he said.
 The euro rose to $1.4813 , after hitting a 17-month
high of $1.4882 on trading platform EBS.
 The dollar was down 0.78 percent at 81.57 yen .
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a basket of six currencies,
fell to its lowest since July 2008. It recovered slightly but
was still down 0.52 percent.
 U.S. STOCKS TAKE DATA IN STRIDE
 On Wall Street, stocks held up relatively well, with the
Dow industrials up 0.3 percent and the benchmark S&P 500 index
up 0.1 percent. Investors said they needed to see more data
before calling an end to the rally in equities.
 The volatile weekly jobless claims may be a silver lining.
 ""At the moment, we regard the rise (in claims) as
technical,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist of
Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.
 ""We need to see initial unemployment claims fall sharply
below 400,000 in upcoming weeks to make sure the economy is not
slowing due to the latest headwind of higher gasoline prices.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 34.66
points, or 0.27 percent, at 12,725.62. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 0.95 point, or 0.07 percent, at
1,356.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 6.34
points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,863.54.
 Despite a listless market, the Nasdaq was still trading
near a 10-year closing high reached Wednesday. Both the Dow and
the S&P 500 hit fresh intraday highs on Thursday that were near
levels not seen since mid-2008.
 Major world stock indexes had surged to near three-year
highs on Wednesday after Fed policy-makers signaled low U.S.
interest rates will remain in place for some time.
 The MSCI index of world stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.7
percent.
 U.S. consumer spending did not slow as much as economists
had feared, leaving many hopeful of a re-acceleration in the
pace of growth in the second quarter.
 ""Investors are willing to look through the GDP data because
most of the weakness was beyond the consumer,"" said Jack Ablin,
chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
 Spot silver  was up 72 cents at $48.48 an ounce.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
8/32, to yield 3.33 percent.
 Brent crude futures  fell 53 cents to $124.60 a
barrel. U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 6 cents to
$112.70.
 Spot gold prices  rose $6.60 to $1,533.00.

 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a
three-year low against major currencies on Thursday on the
Federal Reserve's intention to keep interest rates near zero,
while softer-than-expected U.S. jobs and growth data
underscored the bearish sentiment.
 Ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has been a bane for the
dollar and a boon for the euro, which is up nearly 11 percent

 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would complete its
$600 billion bond-buying program in June, but Fed Chairman Ben

jobs market still in a ""very, very deep hole"".
 Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew less than
expected in the first quarter and initial weekly jobless claims
rose more than forecast.
 ""The reality is that low short-term U.S. rates for an
extended period are guaranteed, regardless of how the Fed's
language evolves this year, until the Fed starts intervening in
the markets differently,"" said Lena Komileva, global head of
G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 There is bound to be a long gap between ending the Fed's
commitment to low rates for an extended period and the eventual
normalization of U.S. rates, which would improve the dollar's
yield advantage against the rest of the world, she said.
 ""This is a story for 2012 at the earliest.""
 With few positives seen for the dollar, the euro is on
track toward $1.50, strategists said.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, slid to a three-year low of 72.871 and
was last at 73.106, down 0.56 percent on the day.
 The dollar index has slid around 3.5 percent this month,
bringing it closer to a record low of 70.698 hit in March
2008.
 The euro was last little changed at $1.4773. The euro hit
its highest since early December 2009 after breaching
resistance around $1.4850, the upper part of an uptrend channel
since mid-February.
 ""It's all one way across the board. Everyone seems to be
betting on a weaker dollar and it seems a pretty safe bet,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen. ""The market is taking on board the more dovish
element of the (Fed) statement and the fact there is no
indication of an early rate hike.""
 He added it was ""not a bold forecast"" to expect the euro to
hit $1.50 in the next week or two.
 Euro technical resistance is seen at the Dec. 7, 2009 peak
of $1.4905. Above $1.4900, traders reported more offers at
$1.4930 up to $1.4950, where another options barrier was
reported.
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.7 percent at 81.65
yen. The euro fell 0.6 percent at 120.71 yen.
 The Bank of Japan late Wednesday lowered its growth
outlook.
 Jens Nordvig and Ikeda Yunosuke, foreign exchange
strategists at Nomura Securities, said likely BoJ easing will
come when other global central banks are either in tightening
mode, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of
England, or starting to contemplate the exit, like the Fed.
 ""We have been in no rush to recommend USD/JPY longs lately,
but as we drift closer to 80, the upside trade is looking
increasingly attractive,"" they said. ""At the same time, we are
looking for direction from Toshin flows (slightly more positive
lately) and U.S. rates (negative in April so far), in order to
time any fresh short yen trades.""
 With U.S. interest rates expected to remain at record lows
for the foreseeable future, higher-yielding currencies are
expected to continue to outperform the dollar.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar scaled a fresh
post-float high of $1.0948, the free float began in December
1983, but was last little changed at $1.0868. Sterling hit a
17-month peak but was last little changed at $1.6629.

 By Maria Kiselyova and Anastasia Teterevleva
 MOSCOW, April 28 (Reuters) - Yandex, Russia's most popular
internet search engine, plans to raise up to $1 billion in an
initial public offering on Nasdaq, it said on Thursday.
 The company said a portion of the shares will be issued by
its parent company Yandex N.V. and a portion will be sold by
existing shareholders.
 The IPO, organised by Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and
Goldman Sachs, comes just six months after a $1 billion London
float by rival Russian internet investing company Mail.ru Group
.
 Yandex intends to use the IPO proceeds for investments in
technology infrastructure, particularly new servers and data
centers, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Thursday.
 The company, which generated 64 percent of all search
traffic in Russia in 2010, has yet to determine the number of
shares to be offered and the price range for the offering.
 Three financial market sources told Reuters earlier on
Thursday Yandex would begin pre-marketing the IPO early next
week.
 Yandex's biggest shareholders are Baring Vostok Private
Equity Funds with a 23.89 percent stake, and founders Arkady
Volozh and Ilya Segalovich, with stakes of 19.77 percent and
4.14 percent respectively, Roth Advisors with 6.42 percent, and
International Finance Corporation with a 6.12 percent stake.
 The company made a net profit of $134.3 million in 2010 on
revenue of $439.7 million, while operating costs and expenses
amounted to $270 million.
 Net income in the first-quarter of 2011 was $28.8 million,
it said, and in March its yandex.ru website attracted 38.3
million unique visits.

 * Could be part of an agreement to swap crude for products
 * United States moving to approve trade with opposition
 
 (Adds details, context)
 LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Trading house Vitol has shipped
at least one cargo of diesel to Libyan rebels in a move that
will ease fuel shortages in their war with government forces and
potentially unlock more Libyan oil for export to the West.
 With Libya producing only a fraction of its pre-war output
and with its refineries idle, the rebels have been looking to
clinch swap deals that involve selling oil and getting oil
products in exchange.
 A a top rebel oil official said on Sunday the rebels made
about $129 million from their only shipment of crude oil, which
is also believed to have been done by Vitol, but had to pay $75
million for a single cargo of gasoline.
 On Thursday, trade sources said a diesel cargo aboard the
tanker Delos was loaded in Malta, where Vitol has floating
storage capacity, and shipped across the Mediterranean Sea to
eastern Libya's port of Benghazi just over a week ago.
 Ship tracking data provided by Marine Traffic shows the
tanker reached Tobruk on April 17, and six days later, during
which time there is no satellite information available, sailed
from the port of Benghazi on April 23, heading back to Malta.
 ""The vessel loaded ship-to-ship out of Vitol's storage and
moved to Tobruk over a week ago,"" one source said.
 A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment on the delivery.
 Vitol fixed a gasoline cargo to Benghazi earlier this month
but it was not clear if it arrived.
 The Delos has a capacity of around 43,000 tonnes, just over
half the size of the crude oil cargo aboard the Equator, which
Vitol lifted from the rebel-held east Libyan port of Marsa el
Hariga three weeks ago.
 When it passed through Suez earlier this month, a canal
official said the tanker was carrying 80,000 tonnes, or the
equivalent of 550,000 barrels of oil.
 Trade in oil and products has ground to virtual standstill
as companies avoid dealing with Libya for fear of infringing
international sanctions.
 But the United States this week took steps to boost aid to
the Libyan opposition council and to approve oil exports made
under its auspices, creating a loophole in U.S. sanctions that
could mean millions of dollars in revenue for rebel coffers.
 Reuters reported last week supplies have already reached
west Libya which is under government control, as companies have
taken advantage of a loophole in United Nations sanctions to
deliver gasoline via Tunisia.
 Trade in Libya remains a costly and risky business.
 A tanker booked for Italian oil company Eni to carry crude
to Italy from Gaddafi-held territory in Libya was forced to
leave empty last week as government loyalists refused to allow
the cargo to be loaded, trade sources said.
 ""They didn't want the crude to go, because they wouldn't
have gotten any money for it,"" an industry source said on
Wednesday, adding, ""They could use it to refine into gasoline.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar extended
losses on Thursday, sparking a record surge in silver, while
Wall Street faltered on reports of disappointing data that
suggested slower U.S. economic growth than expected.
 Spot silver  jumped to an all-time high of $49.51 an
ounce as the dollar's further slide and a rally in gold
triggered heavy speculative buying. For details see:
[nWEN2159]
 Silver's record rise came after U.S. gross domestic
product for the first quarter slowed to a 1.8 percent annual
pace, or two-tenths of a percent more than expected, a rate
that turned oil prices lower. [ID:nCAT005418] [ID:nWEN2162]
 U.S. Treasuries prices rose and German government bond
futures extended gains to hit session highs after the Commerce
Department said the U.S. economy had slowed in the first
quarter to an annual growth rate of 1.8 percent -- a sharp
drop from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 Adding to the economic concerns, claims for jobless
benefits jumped to 429,000 last week -- well above the 392,000
in the Reuters consensus forecast.
 The dollar drifted lower a day after the U.S. central bank
emboldened bearish sentiment by signaling it would retain an
accommodative monetary policy. [ID:nN28243687]
 The ultra-loose monetary policy has been a bane for the
dollar. But low U.S. interest rates have been a boon for the
euro, which is up nearly 11 percent this year.
 ""The reality is that low short-term U.S. rates for an
extended period are guaranteed, regardless of how the Fed's
language evolves this year, until the Fed starts intervening
in the markets differently,"" said Lena Komileva, global head
of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 The euro rose to $1.4805 , after hitting a 17-month
high of $1.4882 on trading platform EBS.
 The dollar was down 0.78 percent at 81.57 yen .
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a basket of six currencies,
fell early Thursday to its lowest level since July 2008. At
midday in New York, it had recovered slightly, but was still
down 0.49 percent.
 U.S. STOCKS TAKE DATA IN STRIDE
 On Wall Street, stocks held up relatively well, with the
Dow industrials up 0.3 percent and the benchmark S&P 500 up
0.1 percent. Investors said they needed to see more data
before calling an end to the rally in equities.
 The volatile weekly jobless claims could have a silver
lining.
 ""At the moment, we regard the rise (in claims) as
technical,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist of
Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.
 ""We need to see initial unemployment claims fall sharply
below 400,000 in upcoming weeks to make sure the economy is
not slowing due to the latest headwind of higher gasoline
prices.""
 Shortly after midday, the Dow Jones industrial
average<.DJI> was up 43.44 points, or 0.34 percent, at
12,734.48. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.64
points, or 0.12 percent, at 1,357.30. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was down 4.80 points, or 0.17 percent, at
2,865.10.
 Although the Nasdaq was down slightly, it was still
trading near its 10-year closing high reached on Wednesday.
Earlier on Thursday, both the Dow and the S&P 500 hit fresh
intraday highs that were near levels not seen since mid-2008.
The Dow climbed as high as 12,737.73, while the S&P 500 rose
as high as 1,358.60.
 Major world stock indexes had surged to near three-year
highs on Wednesday after the policymakers at the Federal
Reserve signaled low interest rates will continue.
 On Thursday, the MSCI index of world stocks
<.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.69 percent at midday.
 Consumer spending did not slow as much as economists had
feared, leaving many hopeful of a re-acceleration in the pace
of growth in the second quarter.
 ""Investors are willing to look through the GDP data
because most of the weakness was beyond the consumer,"" said
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in
Chicago.
 Spot silver  was up $1.08 at $48.84 an ounce at
12:46 p.m. (1646 GMT).
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note , up
7/32 in price before the reports were released, posted a 12/32
gain afterwards, their yields easing to 3.32 percent from 3.36
percent on Wednesday.
 The Bund future  rose to 122.69 from 122.43 just
before release of the data. The cash 10-year Bund yield was
down four basis points at 3.292 percent .
 Brent crude futures  rose 18 cents to $125.31 a
barrel.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 4 cents to
$112.72.
 Spot gold prices  rose $7.10 to $1,533.50 an ounce
from $1,526.40 late Wednesday in New York.

 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a

Federal Reserve's intention to keep interest rates near zero,

 * Proponents say EU farm sector loses offset by export gains
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, April 28 (Reuters) - European farmers could lose
more than 3 billion euros in annual revenue by 2020 under any
free trade deal between the European Union and Latin America's
Mercosur region, a study for the EU's executive showed.
 The deepest loses would be felt by beef producers in
Ireland, Britain and France, hit by a predicted 200,000-tonne
annual increase in beef imports from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay, the study for the European Commission showed.
 Last year, the European Union and Mercosur relaunched talks
stalled since 2004 with the aim of creating the world's biggest
free-trade zone, with 750 million people and trade in goods and
services worth 84 billion euro ($124.6 billion) in 2010.
Negotiators remain hopeful of reaching an agreement later
this year. Any deal is likely to see Europe open its markets to
South American agricultural imports in return for greater access
to Mercosur's markets for services and goods such as cars.
 But the talks face strong opposition from EU governments
such as France and Ireland, where influential farming groups
have warned that an increase in cheaper food imports could put
many EU producers out of business.
 
 JOB LOSSES
 The study was produced for the Commission's agriculture
department by the EU's scientific research centre, the JRC, and
was presented to EU government trade officials in Brussels on
Thursday. It remains private but Reuters has seen a copy.
 It showed that up to 33,000 farm jobs could be lost in
Europe if the draft EU-Mercosur deal was approved.
 ""The overall impact of a possible EU-Mercosur free trade
agreement on the EU agricultural sector is negative, but the
intensity of the effects considerably varies across agricultural
products (and) regions,"" the study's authors said.
 By 2020, EU beef production would fall by over 150,000
tonnes a year, with producer prices for the meat falling by
nearly 8 percent, the study said.
 Ireland would see its annual farm revenues fall by more than
4 percent in 2020, due to the high share of beef production in
overall farm output, while farm income in Britain and France
would fall by 3 and 2 percent respectively, the study showed.
 EU cereals exports to the four Mercosur countries would
increase by about 1 million tonnes a year by 2020, while the
deal would have little impact on EU sugar production or prices,
the authors said.
 The Commission's trade department has said an EU-Mercosur
trade deal would deliver net economic benefits worth about 4.5
billion euros a year to both regions.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar descended to a
three-year low against major currencies on Thursday on the
Federal Reserve's intention to keep near-zero interest rates
and softer-than-expected U.S. jobs and economic growth data
underscored the bearish sentiment,
Ultra-loose monetary policy has been a bane for the dollar,
which fell to a three-year low against a basket of major
currencies. But, low U.S. rates have been a boon for the euro,
with that currency up nearly 11 percent this year.
 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would complete its
$600 billion bond-buying program in June but Chairman Ben
Bernanke signaled no rush to tighten monetary policy with the
jobs market still in a ""very, very deep hole"".
 Indeed, data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew less
than expected in the first quarter and initial weekly jobless
claims rose more than forecast. For details, double-click on,.

 ""The reality is that low short-term U.S. rates for an
extended period are guaranteed, regardless of how the Fed's
language evolves this year, until the Fed starts intervening in
the markets differently,"" said Lena Komileva, global head of
G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 There is bound to be a long gap between ending the Fed's
commitment to low rates for an extended period and the eventual
normalization of U.S. rates that can improve the dollar's yield
advantage against the rest of the world, she said.
 ""This is a story for 2012 at the earliest.""
 With few positives seen for the dollar, the euro is set to
attack $1.50, strategists said.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, slid to a three-year low of 72.871, and
last stood at 73.196, down 0.4 percent on the day.
 The dollar index has slid nearly 4 percent this month,
bringing it closer to a record low of 70.698 hit in March
2008.
 The dollar was down 1 percent at 81.42 yen, with options
expiries reported at 81.50 and 82.00 yen.
 The euro rose to $1.4790, up 0.1 percent. The euro hit a
17-month high of $1.4882 on trading platform EBS after
breaching resistance around $1.4850, the upper part of an
uptrend channel since mid-February.
 Trade calmed a little, however, as the euro stalled ahead
of resistance at $1.4900. Traders cited heavy offers from
$1.4880 up to $1.4900, as well as a reported options barrier at
$1.4900.
 ""It's all one way across the board, everyone seems to be
betting on a weaker dollar and it seems a pretty safe bet,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 ""The market is taking on board the more dovish element of
the statement and the fact there is no indication of an early
rate hike."" He added it was ""not a bold forecast"" to expect the
euro to hit $1.50 in the next week or two.
 Euro technical resistance is seen at the Dec. 7, 2009 peak
of $1.4905. Above $1.4900, traders reported more offers at
$1.4930 up to $1.4950, where another options barrier was
reported.
 Despite a 2 percent rise in the single currency so far this
week, one-month implied euro/dollar vols had pulled back to
around 10.6 percent on Thursday, after popping above 11.0
percent earlier in the week.
 One-month EUR/USD risk reversals were flat around 0.85 in
favor of euro puts, suggesting the premium to sell euros
remains relatively low even as investors brush off euro zone
debt problems and plough into the single currency.
 Many options analysts have been surprised that risk
reversals have seen a limited move even as spot euro/dollar
climbs higher, which suggests the risk of a sharp turnaround in
the euro remains limited at the moment.
 With U.S. interest rates expected to remain at record lows
for the foreseeable future, higher-yielding currencies are
expected to continue outperforming the dollar.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar scaled a fresh
29-year high of $1.0948 and was last up 0.2 percent at $1.0890,
while sterling hit a 17-month peak of $1.6747, and was last up
0.1 percent at $1.6648. (Additional reporting by Jessica

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2011 10:20AM ET</span>",Sanctions on small producer Syria may buoy oil," * EU sanctions could halt Syrian oil exports of 150,000 bpd
 * Oil futures may rally, physical market impact modest
 
 By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ikuko Kurahone
 LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - High world oil futures prices
could rise yet further if the European Union puts sanctions on
Syrian oil this week, although the country exports modest
amounts and the quality is low, analysts and traders said.
 ""The physical market impact is very small. But the current
futures market is bullish so even if 50,000 barrels per day
(bpd) go out, prices will go ballistic,"" an oil trader with a
major bank said on Thursday.
 The European Union will discuss in Brussels on Friday
possible sanctions against Syria's leadership over its crackdown
on protesters, EU diplomats have said.
 Any sanctions would probably begin with asset freezes and
travel bans on the leadership and it could take up to two weeks
before the measures formally pass into law. If measures are
taken against the leadership, state oil export monopoly Sytrol
is likely to be affected.
 Syrian security forces have shot dead at least 400 civilians
in their campaign to crush month-long pro-democracy protests,
Syrian human rights organisations have said.
 The United States is also considering sanctions against
Syrian government officials to increase pressure on President
Bashar al-Assad to end the crackdown.
 ""Pressure on Syrian elites keeps mounting... However, a
condemnation of Syrian actions by the U.N, Security Council has
so far been thwarted by Russia, China and Lebanon,"" said David
Wech from JBC Energy.
 Syrian crude oil output was around 400,000 bpd in 2010
compared with a peak of around 600,000 bpd in the 1990s. Today's
volumes are only a fraction of Libya's output of 1.6 million bpd
or around 2 percent of the global consumption, which has been
shut by sanctions and a civil war since March.
 
 RUSSIAN CRUDE TO GET SUPPORT
 A key difference with Libya is that Syria exports mainly
sour and heavy crude, which is harder to process than the sweet
and light Libyan oil that yields more light products such as
gasoline and gasoil.
 U.S. and Brent oil futures, as well as premiums on sweet
versus sour grades, have rallied since March after Libya stopped
exporting its predominantly sweet barrels.
 Brent oil futures traded above $125 a barrel on Thursday,
not far from their highest level since August 2008.
 ""This would mean that a possible shut-in would not be too
dramatic for the European crude market as it would be relatively
easy to find substitutes for Syrian Heavy, particularly as there
is plenty of sour crude available in the region, something that
cannot be said for light-sweet grades,"" Wech said.
 Syria's two key production streams are the sour and heavy
Souedie crude, which yields lower quality products, and the
sweet and lighter Syrian Light grade.
 More than half the output is processed at domestic
refineries, which can refine around 240,000 bpd, while some
150,000 bpd or around 6 tankers a month of mostly sour Souedie
is exported mainly to Italy, the Netherlands, France and Spain.
 An Italian refiner said interest in the Souedie grade was
low as the official selling price of minus $10.6 per barrel to
the benchmark dated Brent was still too high, given the poor
returns to be gained at present from refining heavy oil.
 ""This is a minor problem for the market since you don't have
the physical tightness even despite Libya. But the very bullish
futures market has long been ignoring fundamentals,"" said a
trader at a trading firm in the Mediterranean.
 The trader said Syrian exports would halt very quickly if
sanctions were imposed on the country as international banks
would quickly stop accepting payments, as they did with Libya.
 ""Although the impact on the physical market will be limited,
some similar grades might benefit -- primarily (Russia's) Urals,
(Iraq's) Kirkuk and Iranian Heavy,"" he said.

 LONDON/NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar
extended losses on Thursday and Wall Street stocks opened
slightly loweron news that U.S. first quarter economic growth
braked sharply while new weekly claims for jobless benefits

 Incumbent: Athanasios Orphanides
 Date of Birth: March 22, 1962
 Term: Five year appointment by the President of the
Republic. Eligible for reappointment. Appointed on May 3, 2007,
he has been a member of the Governing Council of the ECB since
Jan. 1, 2008, when Cyprus was admitted into the euro zone.
 
 Key Facts:
 -- As a voting member of the European Central Bank's
Governing Council, Orphanides is considered a pragmatist on
monetary policy issues, viewed as dovish in downturns, and
hawkish in upturns.
 -- Appointed member of the steering committee of the
European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), Europe's new financial
watchdog, in January 2011.
 -- Orphanides is an effective and sharp communicator who
never shies away from expressing his views, including to his
superiors while he was working at the Fed in the United States.
 -- A fluent English speaker, he chooses his words in public
carefully, almost never speaks off the cuff and keeps a low
public profile, sticking largely to set speeches which he
prepares with the diligence of an academic.
 -- Supported ECB's controversial purchase of government
bonds, and has advocated keeping the option open as a means to
calm markets.
 -- Orphanides left his Washington-based job as Senior
Adviser in the Division of Monetary Affairs at the Board of
Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve to take up the Cypriot
central bank post in 2007.
 -- Earlier, he had served as Economist (1990-1996), Senior
Economist (1996-2003) and Adviser (2003-2006) at the Federal
Reserve. Highly regarded in economist and academic circles,
Orphanides had written numerous papers before his Cyprus
appointment on inflation targeting, expectations and inflation
forecasting.
 -- At home, his relations with the government are
occasionally viewed as strained. He had publicly disagreed with
an idea floated by Cyprus's Communist-led government in 2008 to
sell off gold reserves, for which the Central Bank of Cyprus is
responsible. He also publicly advocated a re-think of the wage
indexation system, arguing it could stoke second round effects -
at odds with the government, which wants the system preserved.
 He has called for structural reforms to Cyprus's economy,
including pension reform, arguing that present structural
problems could cause deeper reforms in future if postponed.
 -- Comes from a working-class background. Both of his
parents were active in the left wing labour movement. After
graduating with Economics and Mathematics Degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he took his PhD in
Economics at the MIT, where he studied under Stanley Fischer and
Nobel-prize winning economist Robert M. Solow. While in the
United States, Orphanides taught undergraduate and graduate
courses in macroeconomics and monetary economics at Georgetown
University and Johns Hopkins University. 
 -- He also served as a Fellow of the Centre for Financial
Studies in Frankfurt, a Research Fellow of the Centre for
Economic Policy Research in London, and an International
Research Fellow of the Kiel Institute for World Economics.

 Key Facts:
 -- Charilaos Stavrakis represents Cyprus in the Eurogroup,
the grouping of 16 EU states sharing the euro. Rarely speaks
publicly about euro zone issues, preferring to focus on Cyprus.
 -- Stavrakis's selection was a bipartisan appointment by the
Communist-led government and a calming message to markets
possibly nervous about a left-wing party taking power for the
first time. As a former deputy CEO of Bank of Cyprus 
, Stavrakis commanded respect and had good contacts in
the island's financial sector.
 -- A key part of Stavrakis's role is selling Cyprus abroad;
he has spearheaded a drive to coax investments from the Gulf and
has worked extensively to secure a network of treaties for the
avoidance of double taxation with mainly eastern European
countries and Russia, an important business partner.
 -- At home, his primary challenge over the past two years
has been wrestling down growing deficits, triggered by fiscal
expansion, to stave off Cyprus's first recession in 30 years.
Deficits grew in 2009 and 2010, placing Cyprus in an EU deficit
procedure.
 -- His attempts to raise corporate tax in mid-2010 failed to
gain approval from parliament. Seen as a cautious consensus
builder, Stavrakis has been juggling demands to contain costs
and initiate pension reform with the government's broader aim of
a ""fairer society"" and keeping powerful labour unions happy.
 -- He read economics at Cambridge University, graduating
with a double-first class honours. He holds an MBA from Harvard
University's Graduate School of Business Administration. He is
fluent in English.

 Key Facts:
 -- The European Union's first and only Communist head of

moderate by some of his own partners. Two years into his
presidency, a junior coalition partner, the socialist Edek

 -- Christofias's government is comprised of Communist AKEL,
the party he lead before becoming president, and the Democratic

talks.
 -- Under his tenure, the island has forged stronger

Critics accuse him of failing to heed signs that Cyprus would
experience its first recession in 30 years, and had appeared
indecisive in tackling deteriorating public finances.
 -- Educated in the Soviet Union, Christofias was awarded a

 -- After graduation and returning to Cyprus from Moscow,
Christofias took up positions in Communist AKEL, working his way
up from the youth wing of the organization to Secretary-General
in 1988. He stepped down in 2009, a year after becoming
president. Communist in structure, AKEL says it espouses free
market economics, though any talk about privatizing state
enterprises under Christofias's watch is ruled out.

 * Armed guards outside banks for reopening
 * Cocoa exports expected next week
 * Militia leader Ibrahim Coulibaly killed

(Adds details on cocoa)
 By Loucoumane Coulibaly and Ange Aboa
 ABIDJAN, April 28 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's banks began
reopening on Thursday after a 10-week shut-down that strangled
the local economy, with cash-strapped Ivorians forming long
queues to withdraw money and receive delayed salary payments.
 The restart of the banking system is for many locals the
clearest sign yet of a return to normality in the West African
state after a four-month power struggle that brought the world's
top cocoa grower to the brink of a new civil war.
 It comes after Alassane Ouattara's government said it was
making 177 billion CFA francs ($395 million) available to pay
two months of salary arrears to public sector workers, a cash
lifeline officials hope will filter down to local businesses.
 The restart of the banking sector could also pave the way
for a revival of cocoa trade, the country's main economic engine
stalled for months by the conflict but now seen resuming exports
in a matter of days.
 Banking officials said there were some shortages of cash for
over-the-counter transactions but clients said cash machines
appeared to be well-stocked. Armed soldiers were posted outside
many of the newly opened banks.
 ""I have been here since 6:30 this morning to get my two
months of salary,"" 32-year-old civil servant Adelaide Gbocho
said outside a bank in Abidjan's Plateau business district.
 ""Things are tight at home. The children need to eat.""
 Ex-president Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to step down after a
disputed Nov. 28 election triggered Western financial and trade
sanctions, prompting international banks to close their local
branches despite threats by Gbagbo to nationalise them.
 Gbagbo lost the election, according to U.N.-certified
results, but he said they were rigged and refused to quit.
 Local units of banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Citibank
announced in mid-February they were suspending operations. Some
top executives fled the country.
 Souleymane Diarrassouba, vice president of the bankers'
association, said that no official withdrawal limits had been
imposed but banks would independently establish how much cash
clients could take out at a time to prevent stocks running out.
 Inter-bank transfers and the clearing system would not be up
and running until next week and some branches that were looted
would remain closed, he added. ""We will start where we can and
then gradually extend it across the whole country,"" he said.
 
 COCOA TRADE STIRS
 Ivory Coast's cocoa farmers said they expected the reopening
of the country's banks to kickstart trade and lift prices deeply
depressed by the effects of the conflict.
 ""The banks reopened this morning in Daloa. This is a good
sign for the future, even if the buyers and exporters have not
immediately restarted,"" said Attoungbre Kouame, a cocoa farmer
in the key growing region northwest of Abidjan.
 Exports from the country -- which produces about a third of
the global supply of the main ingredient in chocolate -- could
restart by the end of next week, exporters said, after being
virtually halted since late January.
 The arrest of Gbagbo in a French and U.N.-backed raid on his
residence by pro-Ouattara forces brought the prospect of peace
closer, but the new president has had to tackle pro-Gbagbo
militia holding out in parts of Abidjan as well as divisions
within his own ranks.
 The in-fighting reached a peak on Wednesday with the killing
of Ibrahim Coulibaly, who was known as ""IB"" and had led the
initial attacks on Gbagbo's forces in Abidjan before he clashed
with Ouattara's military supporters in a resurgence of a
long-time rivalries between former rebels who backed Ouattara.
 ""The death of IB will boost the standing of his long time
rival (Prime Minister) Guillaume Soro who has become one of the
most important political players in the country,"" said Joseph
Lake, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.
 Ouattara told French newspaper La Croix in an interview
released on Wednesday that close to 3,000 people were killed in
the conflict, nearly double previous official tolls.
 Gbagbo, his wife Simone and dozens of close associates are
under house arrest at various locations around the country.
 Ouattara's government said on Wednesday Gbagbo would face
charges of human rights abuses. French radio RFI quoted
prosecutors as saying the charges would be linked to violence
after the disputed election, in which dozens of opposition
protesters were killed in clashes with his security forces.

 * Belarus awaits $3 billion Russian loan
 * Currency crisis takes toll on growth, jobs
(Adds comments by economy minister, stats office head)
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, April 28 (Reuters) - Belarus has allowed banks and
companies to resume using a free-floating rouble  exchange
rate, sources said on Thursday, as officials warned a deepening
currency crisis was lowering growth and putting jobs at risk.
 The rouble traded at 4,700-5,300 per dollar on the interbank
market, market sources said, after the central bank dropped its
informal exchange rate guidance.
 The central bank last week recommended local banks quote the
rouble at a rate no weaker than 4,500-4,600 per dollar, leading
them to stop trading. The official rate is 3,033 roubles per
dollar.
 ""Last night the central bank said it was dropping the
(exchange rate) guidance,"" one source said.
 The Belarussian central bank stopped supporting the rouble
through interventions in March after losing a quarter of its
reserves this year due to a large trade deficit.
 It has since tried to create a dual exchange rate system
with the official rate used for mandatory export revenue sales
and retail cash transactions, while the free-floating rate is
utilised by banks and some businesses on the interbank market.
 Analysts say the official rate is likely to be devalued
after Belarus secures $3 billion in loans from Russia, which
would allow the central bank to regain some control over the
market.
 Belarussian officials have said they expected a loan deal in
May, but Moscow says it is still waiting for detailed economic
policy proposals.
 
 WORKERS ON LEAVE
 As talks go on, the currency crisis takes its toll on
Belarus' centralised economy. Economy Minister Nikolai Snopkov
said on Thursday the government could cut its 2011 economic
growth forecast from the earlier 11-13 percent.
 ""The outlook is likely to be lower,"" Snopkov was quoted by
state news agency BelTA as saying.
 ""If we cut domestic demand -- and we are saying that we will
have to cut domestic demand to combat the crisis -- this will
certainly affect the gross domestic product.""
 Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since
1994, has largely kept in place the Soviet economic system based
on centralised planning, near-full employment and heavy
subsidies on items such as utilities.
 However, Vladimir Zinovsky, the head of state statistics
office, said on Thursday that Belarussian companies, unable to
purchase foreign currency to pay for imported raw materials and
parts, were sending workers on temporary leave.
 ""About 600,000 workers in the real sector had to stop work
following decisions by management,"" he said.
 The nation of 10 million has a workforce of about 4.7
million.

 By Christopher Le Coq
 BRUSSELS, April 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission would
file a case against China at the World Trade Organization over
export credits if these could be shown to be unfair state aid,
the EU's trade chief said.
 EU businesses and officials have complained that Chinese
low-cost export credit amounts to unfair competition and EU

back firms that could justify their cases.
 ""The Commission is ready to support EU companies in seeking
legal solutions to the problem, including recourse to the WTO

asked industry for information that could allow a challenge to
China over unreasonably cheap export credit.
 And in February, a European Commission report circulated to
EU governments cited evidence that China's main telecoms
producers Huawei and ZTE receive cheap state loans, giving them
an unfair advantage over EU rivals.
 De Gucht said China was not following international
standards in the field of export credits, but that it had not
yet been shown if Beijing was breaking the rules of the WTO, of
which China has been a member since 2001.
 There was a number of cases in which EU export credit
agencies were unable to match the credit terms offered through
official Chinese support, he said in his parliamentary reply,
submitted on Wednesday.
 ""There is evidence to suggest that this has led to a loss of
business for European companies in a number of important
sectors, including Information and Communication Technology,"" he
added.
 The European Commission raised the issue of unfair state aid
to Chinese firms directly with Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Qishan
in December and in other negotiations, the Commissioner said.

 * Dealers expect EUR/PLN could be pushed to at least 3.90
 * Sale of Poland's No. 2 mobile operator to close in H1
 
 By Marcin Goettig and Adrian Krajewski
 WARSAW, April 28 (Reuters) - The sale of Poland's No. 2
mobile operator Polkomtel could trigger a surge in the zloty as
the winning bidder converts part of an expected $6.5 billion of
purchase funds into the local currency.
 Markets anticipate that a large inflow of foreign currency
from the Polkomtel transaction -- the biggest for years in the
European telecoms sector -- will push the zloty through a key
resistance level and lift Polish bonds as well as shares of the
firm's current owners.
 ""I think the potential impact on the zloty will take place
one or two weeks ahead of the announcement of the deal,"" said
Karol Zaluski, head of FX trading at ING Bank Slaski.
 ""There may be an impact from the real flow of funds through
the market. There may also be a psychological impact -- some
players not involved in the transaction may open their positions
ahead of the expected announcement of the deal.""
 Potential buyers have until May 6 to file binding bids for
Polkomtel, 76 percent of which is owned by four state-controlled
firms -- utility PGE, copper miner KGHM, refiner PKN Orlen and
coal trader Weglokoks.
 Four out of five reported bidders are foreign private equity
funds or telecoms companies that would probably need to exchange
euros or dollars into zlotys. The sole Polish contender, media
tycoon Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, is also likely to need some foreign
financing.
 ""I would expect 1-2 billion euros to go through the spot
market as a result of this transaction,"" a Warsaw-based currency
dealer said. ""This could easily push the zloty to 3.90 against
the euro.""
 The rest of the Polkomtel transaction is expected to be
carried out through FX swaps or other financial instruments
which would not directly impact the spot market.
 Average daily turnover on the zloty spot market was $1.4
billion in April 2010, according to data from the Bank for
International Settlements.
 The zloty hit a two-month high of 3.9260 versus the euro on
Wednesday, buoyed by a Finance Ministry plan to regularly sell
part of the euro funds Poland receives from the European Union
on the spot market.
 But contagion risks from a potential escalation of the euro
zone crisis and large unexplained outflows in Poland's balance
of payments data could mean the zloty struggles to break below a
rate of 3.85 per euro, dealers and analysts said.
 ""Fundamentals could be a bit better. We have large errors
and omissions in the balance of payments, which is negative,""
said a Warsaw-based FX dealer. ""If Greece defaults then Spain
and Italy could be affected, and that could sour market
sentiment.""
 
 WINDFALLS
 Polkomtel is expected to fetch as much as 18 billion zlotys
($6.7 billion), some three-quarters of which will end up in the
pockets of its Polish owners.
 As all four are state-controlled, a large chunk of that
income is likely to be transferred to the state in the form of
interim dividends and taxes. Interim dividends will also benefit
other shareholders of the companies, which are Warsaw-listed.
 ""We already see a positive impact on the shares of KGHM, PKN
and PGE, but it should become more visible after the deal is
completed,"" said Wojciech Wosko, a trader at DM BZ WBK.
 Shares in KGHM have risen by 13 percent since the start of
the year, with PKN shares gaining 23.3 percent and PGE 2.2
percent compared with an overall 6.3 percent increase in
Warsaw's WIG 20 benchmark index.
 Refiner PKN's expected 2.9 billion zloty earnings from the
sale are likely to exceed its 2010 net profit of 2.4 billion
zlotys, while utility PGE is expected to net 2.3 billion zlotys
compared with its 2010 final profit of 3 billion zlotys.
 KGHM could book up to 3.2 billion zlotys on its stake,
almost 40 percent of the 8.4 billion zloty net profit the miner
is targeting for 2011, analysts say.
 A big windfall for the government from Polkomtel could also
lift Polish bonds by reducing the likely supply of new debt.
 According to rough calculations, some 4 billion zlotys from
the sale could find their way into state coffers, helping cover
a budget gap and lowering Poland's borrowing requirements in
2011 -- currently seen at 154 billion zlotys -- and 2012.
 Any revenues from the sale of Polkomtel would come on top of
those from the government's privatisation programme for 2011,
which is expected to raise 15 billion zlotys ($5.4 billion) and
may also attract foreign interest.
 ""The execution of the privatisation plan will be key for
bond issues,"" BZ WBK chief economist Maciej Reluga said. ""If the
plan is fully realised then additional profits for the Treasury
from the sale can further lower borrowing needs.""

 By Yayat Supriatna	
 JAKARTA, April 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia will export a third
more rubber this year to China, which will become the top buyer
from the world's second-largest producer, as demand from Chinese
tyre makers rises, taking the place of the drop in Japan after
the earthquake, the Indonesian Rubber Association said on
Thursday.	
 China will replace the United States in 2011 as Indonesia's
biggest rubber export market, with up to 800,000 tonnes heading
to the world's second-largest economy, Asril Sutan Amir,
chairman at the association, known as Gapkindo, told Reuters.	
 ""Indonesia's rubber export to China may reach (from) 600,000
tonnes (in 2010) to 800,000 tonnes in 2011 because of export
shifting from Japan after the earthquake and tsunami,"" said
Amir, who was speaking ahead of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's
visit to Indonesia this week.	
 ""Our (rubber) export to China is increasing significantly
in 2011,"" he added. ""It is obvious that China is now the biggest
market for Indonesian rubber.""	
 Late last month, Gapkindo told Reuters that the Japanese
earthquake and tsunami in March, which triggered a nuclear
crisis, would have little impact on Indonesian rubber.
[ID:nL3E7EN07W]	
 Japan accounts for around 7 percent of global demand for
natural rubber. [ID:nL3E7EF1DQ] 
 ""In several years to come, the export volume may reach 1
million tonnes,"" he added. ""That's because China now is the
biggest tyre maker in the world.""	
 
 Global demand for rubber, both natural and synthetic, is
forecast to rise to 26.1 million tonnes in 2011 from 24.4
million tonnes in 2010, the International Rubber Study Group
said in March. [ID:nL3E7EB118] 
 Dealers say this was in part due to a recovery in the
automotive sector, though that had not factored in the plight of
the Japanese automakers. 
 The U.S. auto industry snapped a four-year sales decline in
2010, including three consecutive months of sales above the 12
million-unit annual rate.	
 Indonesia will produce an estimated 2.972 million tonnes of
rubber this year, versus 2.736 million tonnes last year, Amir
told reporters earlier this month. [ID:nL3E7FF1LS] 
 Indonesian rubber exports will be 2.45 million tonnes this
year, up from 2.352 million tonnes in 2010, he added.	
 Wen is visiting Malaysia and Indonesia this week to seal a
series of agreements covering everything from banking and energy
to palm oil and infrastructure. [ID:nL3E7FL0GC] 
 Amir said there would be several Chinese rubber and tyre
industry figures among the Chinese business delegation
accompanying Wen.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2011 08:12AM ET</span>","ECB to hold fire in May, next hike seen in July -poll"," * ECB to raise rates by 25 bps in July
 * Rates seen at 1.75 percent by end-2011
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
not raise interest rates again until July as it follows a steady
path of policy tightening to rein in inflation while still
supporting growth, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
 The poll of 76 economists, taken over the past week, found
none of them expect a rate hike when the Governing Council meets
on May 5 and only 17 of them predict a rise from the current
1.25 percent before the next quarter.
 Over half, 44 of 74 analysts, said the ECB would next move
in July, raising its key rate by another 25 basis points. That
compares with 30 of 62 economists in an April 7 Reuters poll who
saw the next rate rise in July.
 Euribor futures -- which show market expectations for
interbank rates -- indicate that the next rate hike is priced in
for some point between June and September.
 The ECB was the first of the big four central banks to raise
rates when it lifted its benchmark rate by 25 basis points from
a record low this month. The poll forecasts the bank will
continue to gradually tighten policy with similar hikes each
quarter through to the middle of next year.
 ""The ECB feels it was justified in a steady series of
increases in 2005/06 and does not seem set to be deflected this
time,"" said Philip Shaw at Investec.
 ""However, unless we are underestimating the momentum of the
euro area economy, we tend to the view that there will be a
pause in the tightening cycle at some stage, possibly next
year,"" he said.
 The poll predicted interest rates would end the year at 1.75
percent, in line with overall expectations in financial markets.
Rates are set to end 2012 at 2.5 percent, unchanged from a
Reuters poll taken earlier this month.
 The euro zone economy grew 0.3 percent in the final three
months of last year, and is expected to have grown 0.5 percent
in the first quarter of 2011, but recent data suggests a strong
Germany is masking a still struggling periphery.
 ""We still believe that the sovereign debt crisis and the
strength of the euro will be factors that should contain ECB
aggressiveness this year,"" said Elwin de Groot at Rabobank.
 Portugal was forced to follow Greece and Ireland earlier
this month and seek an international bailout, ending months of
resistance to foreign aid that led to a credit rating downgrade
and a sharp rise in borrowing costs.
 Borrowing costs are on the rise again for all three bailout
recipients, putting further pressure on them to cut spending, on
growing fears that Greece will have to restructure its debt.
 
 INFLATION RISKS
 Inflation in the 17-nation bloc was running at 2.7 percent
in March, above the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling for the
fourth month, and is not seen falling below 2 percent until the
second quarter of next year.
 Governing Council member Athanasios Orphanides said on
Wednesday that further interest rate rises may be warranted if
the inflation outlook deteriorates further this year.
 His colleague, Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, said on Tuesday
that euro zone rates are unusually accommodative and people
should expect cheap money to come to an end.
 ""The majority of ECB speakers have been stressing the
accommodative stance of policy and the upside risks to
inflation, implying that rate hikes will continue,"" said Ken
Wattret at BNP Paribas.
 As part of its loose monetary policy the ECB has been
meeting banks' demand for cash in full since the financial
crisis intensified in late 2008. The periphery's mounting debt
problems prevented the bank from switching its three-month
lending operations back to competitive auctions, as it had been
expected to late last year.
 Economists were split as to whether the ECB would move to
variable rate tenders at its refinancing auctions to improve the
effectiveness of this month's rate hike.
 Thirty two of 58 said that it would, with virtually all of
them plumping for the second half of this year.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar plumbed a three-year
low against a currency basket on Thursday, while the euro was
set to attack a key psychological level of $1.50, as the view
that U.S. interest rates would stay low spurred more dollar
selling.
 The dollar dropped across the board, with the Australian
dollar charging through previous highs to a 29-year peak above
$1.0900 and looking poised to break $1.10 while both the euro
and sterling vaulted to 17-month highs.
 Traders and analysts said Asian central banks diversifying
dollar proceeds into euros and other currencies was a major
factor in the dollar's falls after earlier talk of dollar-buying
intervention by several Asian central banks.
 Trade calmed a little, however, as the euro stalled ahead of
resistance at $1.4900. Traders cited heavy offers from $1.4880
up to $1.4900, as well as a reported options barrier at $1.4900.
 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would complete its
$600 billion bond-buying programme in June but Chairman Ben
Bernanke signalled no rush to tighten monetary policy with the
jobs market still in a ""very, very deep hole"".
 ""It's all one way across the board, everyone seems to be
betting on a weaker dollar and it seems a pretty safe bet,"" said
Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""The market is taking on board the more dovish element of
the statement and the fact there is no indication of an early
rate hike."" He added it was ""not a bold forecast"" to expect the
euro to hit $1.50 in the next week or two. 
 The euro hit a 17-month high of $1.4882 on trading platform
EBS after breaching resistance around $1.4850, the upper part of
an uptrend channel since mid-February.
 It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.4805, with technical
resistance seen at the Dec. 7 peak of $1.4905. Above $1.4900,
traders reported more offers at $1.4930 up to $1.4950, where
another options barrier was reported.
 ""The euro is going up because it is the prime reserve
alternative to the dollar,"" said Neil Mellor, currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 Subdued implied volatility in the euro suggested the euro's
latest rise could continue in the near term.
 Despite a 2 percent rise in the single currency so far this
week, one-month implied euro/dollar vols had pulled back to
around 10.6 percent on Thursday, after popping above 11.0
percent earlier in the week.
 One-month EUR/USD risk reversals were flat around 0.85 in
favour of euro puts, suggesting the premium to sell euros
remains relatively low even as investors brush off euro zone
debt problems and plough into the single currency.
 Many options analysts have been surprised that risk
reversals have seen a limited move even as spot euro/dollar
climbs higher, which suggests the risk of a sharp turnaround in
the euro remains limited at the moment.
 Some in the market say a consolidation in spot euro/dollar
would be required for risk reversals to start moving lower,
while a rise to $1.50 may also push them down.
 
 LOOSE U.S. POLICY
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, slid to a three-year low of 72.871, and
last stood at 73.188, down 0.5 percent on the day.
 A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed most U.S. primary dealers
expect the Fed to keep interest rates near zero until the end of
2011. By contrast the European Central Bank has already raised
and the Bank of England are seen likely to raise interest rates
later this year.
 The dollar index has slid nearly 4 percent this month,
bringing it closer to a record low of 70.698 hit in March 2008.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar scaled a fresh 29-year
high of $1.0948 and was last up 0.6 percent at $1.0932, while
sterling hit a 17-month peak of $1.6747, and was last up 0.35
percent at $1.6684. 
 The dollar was down 0.6 percent at 81.74 yen, with options
expiries reported at 81.50 and 82.00 yen.

 By Stephen Jewkes
 MILAN, April 28 (Reuters) - Italy's No. 3 oil refiner Saras
said on Thursday its first-quarter results would be unaffected
by Libyan turmoil but warned its full-year results could suffer
if the conflict was drawn out.
 Saras is normally a big buyer of Libyan crude, with some 35
percent to 40 percent of supplies coming from the North African
country.
 ""Our results in the first three months will not be affected
since we have adequate stocks of Libyan crude,"" Managing
Director Dario Scaffardi said on the sidelines of the group's
shareholders meeting.
 Full-year results could be hurt by events in Libya depending
on the duration and intensity of the crisis, he said. Rebels
have been fighting to oust leader Muammar Gaddafi since
mid-February.
 Scaffardi said Saras will probably have to replace Libyan
crude with other alternatives starting in the second quarter. He
added that he was not aware of any significant damage to Libyan
export terminals.
 In another sign of the impact of fighting in Libya, Italian
oil and gas group Eni said on Wednesday it expected Libyan
turmoil to cut its full-year production after a drop of nearly 9
percent in the first quarter. Eni is the biggest foreign
operator in Libya.
 Because of its high quality Libyan crude is not easy to
replace. Saudi Arabia oil is not an alternative.
 Saras is looking to Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and countries in
West Africa such as Gabon and Nigeria to replace lost volumes in
Libya, Scaffardi said.
 Saras has maintenance at its Sarroch refinery in Sardinia
planned for April and early May.
 Asked about joint ventures with oil companies, Scaffardi
said there were contacts on possible commercial agreements but
added there was nothing concrete at the moment.
 At 1025 GMT, Saras shares were down 0.71 percent at 1.668
euros while the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index was down 0.1
percent.

 * Armed guards outside banks for reopening
 
 By Loucoumane Coulibaly and Ange Aboa
 ABIDJAN, April 28 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's banks began
reopening on Thursday after a 10-week shut-down that strangled
the local economy, with cash-strapped Ivorians forming long
queues to withdraw money and receive delayed salary payments.
 The restart of the banking system is for many locals the
clearest sign yet of a return to normality in the West African
state after a four-month power struggle that brought the world's
top cocoa grower to the brink of a new civil war.
 It comes after Alassane Ouattara's government said it was
making 177 billion CFA francs ($395 million) available to pay
two months of salary arrears to public sector workers, a cash
lifeline officials hope will filter quickly down to local
businesses.
 Banking officials said there were still some shortages of
cash for over-the-counter transactions but clients said cash
machines appeared to be well-stocked.
 ""I have been here since 6.30 this morning to get my two
months of salary,"" 32-year-old civil servant Adelaide Gbocho
said outside a bank in Abidjan's Plateau business district.
 ""Things are tight at home. The children need to eat.""
 Ex-president Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to step down after a
disputed Nov. 28 election triggered Western financial and trade
sanctions, prompting international banks to close their local
branches despite threats by Gbagbo to nationalise them.
 Gbagbo was judged to have lost the election according to
U.N.-certified results, but he alleged they were rigged and
refused to quit.
 Local units of banks BNP Paribas , Societe Generale
, Citibank  all announced in mid-February that
they were suspending operations. Some top executives fled the
country with their families.
 The April 11 arrest of Gbagbo in a French-backed raid on his
residence by pro-Ouattara forces brought the prospect of peace
closer, but pro-Gbagbo militias have been involved in sporadic
battles around Abidjan. Armed soldiers were posted outside many
of the newly opened banks.
 ""The cash machines are working. I've seen several people
withdrawing cash, I am waiting my turn,"" said 41-year-old
Silvere Konin outside the Ivorian Banque de l'Habitat.
 Ouattara told French newspaper La Croix in an interview
released on Wednesday that close to 3,000 people were killed in
the conflict, nearly double previous official tolls.
 Ouattara said he aimed to form a unity government including
members of Gbagbo's FPI party by the end of May. He hoped to be
inaugurated on May 21 and said several heads of state had been
invited, alongside Pope Benedict.
 Gbagbo, his wife Simone and dozens of close associates are
under house arrest at various locations around the country.
 Ouattara's government said on Wednesday Gbagbo would face
charges of human rights abuses. French radio RFI quoted
prosecutors as saying the charges would be linked to violence
after the disputed election, in which dozens of opposition
protesters were killed in clashes with his security forces.

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to three-year
lows on Thursday and stocks firmed worldwide ahead of crucial
U.S. GDP data, with investors betting ultra-loose American
policy would continue to drive money into riskier assets.
 The Federal Reserve said it would complete its $600 billion
bond-buying programme in June but Chairman Ben Bernanke
signalled it was in no rush to tighten monetary policy with the
jobs market still in a ""very, very deep hole"".
 The Bank of Japan also maintained its rock-bottom policy
stance, moves that are likely to see both the dollar and yen
used as funding currencies to buy higher-yielding assets, such
as commodities and equities.
 ""With the prospect of ultra easy monetary policy continuing
for the foreseeable future in the world's largest economy,
traders are feeling more confident about holding the bullish
view and risk appetite is expected to be high,"" said Jonathan
Sudaria, a dealer at Capital Spreads in London.
 European shares gained 0.2 percent, with Deutsche Bank up
4.5 percent after it beat forecasts with a quarterly net profit
at a near-record level.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
were up 0.7 percent by 1045 GMT, Japan's Nikkei average rose
1.6 percent and U.S. stock futures suggested Wall Street's rally
has further to run.
 ""The markets will be reassured, though the punch bowl is
being replaced by a smaller punch bowl,"" Justin Urquhart
Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management, said of the
Fed's statement. ""But with today's GDP figures expected to be
weaker, there will be a level of nervousness.""
 U.S. GDP data at 1230 GMT are expected to show growth slowed
to a 2 percent annualised rate or less in the first quarter,
from 3.1 in the last three months of 2010.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices edged up in Europe supported by
some expectations that U.S. growth will fall short of even that
forecast, traders said.
 Elsewhere in the debt markets, Greek government bond yields
gyrated but were expected to move higher as investors become
increasingly convinced a debt restructuring is looming. Two-year
yields fluctuated between 24 and 27.1 percent, having shot up 2
percentage points on Wednesday.
 ""There's no real turnaround in the sentiment ... If you're
talking about restructuring you really don't want to be there,""
one trader said.
 
 DOLLAR UNDER THE COSH
 With the Fed's stance jarring with central banks in Europe,
Asia and Latin America already raising interest rates, the
dollar index, which tracks its performance against a basket of
major currencies, fell to as low as 72.871 -- a level not seen
since July 2008.
 It last stood at 73.13, down 0.5 percent on the day.
 A Reuters poll showed most U.S. primary dealers expect the
Fed to keep rates near zero through the end of 2011.
 Dealers said several central banks in Asia were spotted
buying the greenback to check sharp gains in their currencies.
 The euro rose to a 17-month high of $1.4882 before easing a
little, while the Australian dollar charted a new 29-year high
near $1.0948.
 ""It's obviously pretty much open water here until $1.50,""
Rob Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore, said of the
euro, adding that the Aussie dollar could try for $1.10. 
 In commodities markets, dollar weakness helped propel U.S.
crude to a 2-1/2 year peak of $113.70 a barrel before it
subsided to $112.41, down 0.3 percent on the day, as doubts
about the strength of U.S. GDP took hold.
 Spot gold ascended to a lifetime high of $1,534.30 an ounce,
breaking records for the second session running. It traded at
$1,530.65 at 1045 GMT, up from $1,526.40 late in New York on
Wednesday.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a three-year
low against a basket of currencies on Thursday, with the euro
looking set to attack $1.50 after the Federal Reserve signalled
U.S. interest rates would stay very low for a prolonged period.
 The dollar dropped across the board, with the Australian
dollar bulldozing through previous highs to a 29-year peak above
$1.0900 and looking poised to break $1.10 while both the euro
and sterling vaulted to 17-month highs.
 The euro stalled ahead of $1.4900, however, and traders said
it was likely to face stiff resistance on the approach to $1.50,
citing heavy offers from $1.4880 up to $1.4900, as well as
resistance from a reported options barrier at $1.4900.
 Traders said Asian central bank diversification of dollar
holdings into euros and other currencies was also a major factor
in the dollar's falls.
 Fed chairman Ben Bernanke spoke of a ""relatively slow
recovery"" and a labour market in a ""very, very deep hole"" as the
Fed trimmed its 2011 growth forecast and repeated it plans to
keep rates very low ""for an extended period"".
 ""It's all one way across the board, everyone seems to be
betting on a weaker dollar and it seems a pretty safe bet,"" said
Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""The market is taking on board the more dovish element of
the statement and the fact there is no indication of an early
rate hike.""
 He said it was ""not a bold forecast"" to expect the euro to
hit $1.50 in the next week or two. Investors are looking at
buying on any dips but those dips are ""becoming few and far
between"".
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, slid to a three-year low of 72.871, and
last stood at 73.062, down 0.6 percent on the day.
 The dollar index has slid nearly 4 percent this month,
bringing it closer to a record low of 70.698 hit in March 2008
and leaving it on track for the biggest monthly decline since
Sept. 2010.
 The euro hit a 17-month high of $1.4882 on trading platform
EBS, gaining steam after triggering stop-loss bids around that
level and after breaching resistance around $1.4850, the upper
part of a uptrend channel that had been in place since
mid-February.
 It was last up 0.4 percent at $1.4840, with technical
resistance seen at the Dec. 7 peak of $1.4905. Above $1.4900,
traders reported more offers at $1.4930 up to $1.4950, where
another options barrier was reported.
 
 LOOSE U.S. POLICY
 A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed most U.S. primary dealers
expect the Fed to keep interest rates near zero until the end of
2011. By contrast the European Central Bank has already raised
and the Bank of England are seen likely to raise interest rates
later this year.
 The Australian dollar scaled a fresh 29-year high near
$1.0948 and was last up 0.6 percent at $1.0932.
 Sterling also hit a 17-month peak of $1.6747, and last up
0.35 percent at $1.6684. Possible upside targets include the
November 2009 high at $1.6879 and then the August 2009 peak of
$1.7044.
 ""It's clear that the dollar selling has been given a green
light and we have the Asian central banks intervening... So that
suggests further upside for the euro and Aussie,"" said Rob Ryan,
FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.
 The dollar was down 0.7 percent at 81.66 yen, though traders
reported bids around 81.50 yen, while the euro was down 0.2
percent at 121.21 yen. 
 The yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan kept
monetary policy steady on Thursday, as widely expected.
In a surprise move, Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura
proposed expanding the BOJ's pool of funds for asset buying and
market operations to 45 trillion yen, but the proposal was
rejected.

 SYDNEY, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar skidded to
three-year lows on Thursday, pushing U.S. crude oil to a 2-1/2
year high, while Asian stocks rose as investors bet that the
easy U.S. monetary policy will continue to drive money to
riskier assets.	
 The Bank of Japan (BOJ) also maintained its ultra-loose
monetary policy, in moves that are likely to see investors
continue using both the dollar and yen as funding currencies to
buy higher-yielding assets, commodities and equities.	
 ""With the prospect of ultra easy monetary policy continuing
for the foreseeable future in the world's largest economy,
traders are feeling more confident about holding the bullish
view and risk appetite is expected to be high,"" said Jonathan
Sudaria, a night dealer at Capital Spreads in London.	
 
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.6 percent, while
stocks elsewhere in Asia gained 0.6 percent,
having earlier added more than 1 percent to reach a three-year
peak.	
 Japanese markets will be shut on Friday and will reopen on
Monday, ahead of more holidays next week.	
 Earnings from the likes of Honda Motor were due
after the market close.	
 ""If earnings continue to impress the market, the Nikkei may
rise further,"" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer at
Myojo Asset Management.	
 Another indication of the hefty demand for higher-yielding
assets and exposure to fast-growing Asian markets was the
response to Indonesia's $2.5 billion medium-term note offering
this week, which was nearly 3 times oversubscribed, with half
the issue snapped up by U.S. investors.	
 European stock index futures rose in early trade, pointing
to a higher open, while gains in U.S. stock index futures 
indicated the rally on Wall Street may not be over yet.	
 Deutsche Bank  will be in focus after the German
bank posted an 18 percent rise in quarterly net profit.

 DOLLAR HAMMERED	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, fell to as low as 72.871
-- a level not seen since July 2008. It last stood at 72.993.	
 Dealers said several central banks in Asia were spotted
buying the greenback to check sharp gains in their currencies.	
 The euro rose to a 16-month high of $1.4881 , further
spurred by stop-loss buying after a breach of option barriers
around $1.4800, while the Australian dollar touched a post-float
high of $1.0948 .	
 In the commodities market, U.S. crude  scaled a 2-1/2
year peak of $113.70 a barrel, and gold futures  raced to
a record high at $1,534 an ounce. Copper gained more
than 1 percent to around $9,440 a tonne.	
 U.S. Treasury yields were a touch lower, having risen on
Wednesday as the market made room for an upcoming seven-year
supply. The two-year yield slipped 1.2 basis points
to 0.6368 percent.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar sank to a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Thursday and
was at risk of a drop to $1.50 versus the euro, with
momentum-driven investors piling on in anticipation U.S.
interest rates will be low for a long time.	
 The dollar slid across the board, with the Australian dollar
bulldozing previous highs to a 29-year peak above $1.0900. Both
the euro and sterling scaled 17-month highs and the Singapore
dollar hit yet another record high.	
 Various market players including Asian investors and model
funds, sold the dollar anew, said a Tokyo-based trader.	
 Analysts said more dollar weakness was likely after the
Federal Reserve said overnight that it would end its bond-buying
programme in June as planned and appeared in no rush to tighten
monetary policy further.	
 ""We're looking for reasons why it shouldn't continue but the
over-riding big picture is that it should continue,"" said Rob
Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.	
 ""It's clear that the dollar selling has been given a green
light and we have the Asian central banks intervening... So that
suggests further upside for the euro and Aussie,"" Ryan said.	
 Traders cited talk of dollar-buying intervention by a few
Asian central banks on Thursday. Traders and analysts say such
central banks often later sell some of the dollars purchased
through intervention to buy other major currencies, to help keep
their currency holdings diversified. [ID:nL3E7FS09Z] 
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, slid to a three-year low of 72.871, and
last stood at 72.972 , down 0.7 percent on the day.	
 The dollar index has slid nearly 4 percent this month, on
track for the biggest monthly decline since Sept. 2010 and
bringing it closer to a record low of 70.698 hit in March 2008.	
 The euro hit a 17-month high of $1.4882 on trading platform

bids around that level and after breaching resistance around
$1.4850, the upper part of a uptrend channel that had been in
place since mid-February. 
 ""It's obviously pretty much open water here until $1.50,""
said Ryan at BNP Paribas. Ryan added that the Australian dollar
could try for $1.10.	
 The euro last stood at $1.4858 , up 0.5 percent from
late U.S. trading on Wednesday.	
 Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp in Tokyo, said the euro could soon rise above its November
2009 high of $1.5145. 
 ""The euro will probably rise to around $1.52 next week,"" Uno
said, adding that U.S. may be slipping into stagflation, which
makes U.S. policy manoeuvres more difficult.

 NO TRACTION FROM BERNANKE 
 The dollar gained no traction from a news conference by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday where he
forecast weaker U.S. growth in the first three months of 2011,
though he attributed it to transitory factors. It was the first
regularly scheduled briefing by a Fed chief in the central
bank's 97-year history. [ID:nN26291565]	
 ""The reason for the dollar's broad weakness is that market
players think it makes sense to use the dollar to fund
investment in various assets, since U.S. interest rates are
likely to stay low for a while,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in Tokyo. 
 A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed that most U.S. primary
dealers expect the Fed to keep interest rates near zero through
the end of 2011. By contrast both the European Central
Bank and the Bank of England are seen likely to raise interest
rates later this year. 
 Sterling was also on a tear, hitting a 17-month peak of
$1.6747 , and last up 0.5 percent at $1.6714. Possible
upside targets include the November 2009 high at $1.6879 and
then the August 2009 peak of $1.7044. 
 The Australian dollar scaled a fresh 29-year high
near $1.0948 and was last up 0.6 percent at $1.0927.	
 The yen showed muted reaction after the Bank of Japan kept
monetary policy steady on Thursday, as widely expected. 
In a surprise move, Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura
proposed expanding the BOJ's pool of funds for asset buying and
market operations by 5 trillion yen ($61 billion), to 45
trillion yen, but the proposal was rejected by a vote of one to
eight. [ID:nL3E7FR5BU]	
The yen took the news in stride, however. The dollar was last
down 0.5 percent at 81.75 yen , little changed compared to
just before the BOJ's announcement, and not far from a one-month
low of 81.27 yen hit on Wednesday.	
 The yen had been sold earlier this month as traders think
quake-stricken Japan is even less likely than the United States
to tighten its monetary policy for the foreseeable future.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, April 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped to
three-year lows on Thursday, U.S. crude hit a 2-1/2 year high
and Asian stocks rose after the U.S. central bank signalled it
was in no rush to scale back support for the economy, keeping
intact demand for riskier assets.	
 The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is also expected to maintain its
ultra loose monetary policy later in the day and indicate its
readiness to ease further if damage from last month's earthquake
proves bigger than expected.

[ID:nL3E7FR5E4]	
 With the two major central banks keeping interest rates near
zero, investors are set to continue using the dollar and yen as
funding currencies to buy higher-yielding assets, commodities
and equities.	
 The U.S. Federal Reserve essentially gave a ""green light"" to
continue selling the U.S. dollar, as mounting risk appetite
continues to utilise ultra-accommodative U.S. monetary policy to
speculate in higher-yielding assets overseas, said Michael
Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon.	
 ""Despite increasing geopolitical risks and rising credit
default spreads in peripheral Europe, the trend remains your
friend in a weaker greenback,"" he wrote in a client note.	
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.8 percent, while
stocks elsewhere in Asia put on 0.75 percent,
nearing a three-year peak set a day earlier.	
 These gains followed a rally on Wall Street, where the U.S.
tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped to a 10-year high and the S&P
500 index rose to three-year highs.	
 Trading volume in Japan, however, is expected to be thin as
the Golden Week holidays loom and as investors awaited earnings
from the likes of Panasonic Corp and Honda Motor
<7267.t> due after the market close.	
 Japanese markets will be shut on Friday and will reopen on
Monday, ahead of more holidays next week.	
 ""Investors want to see more earnings that are scheduled for
after the market closes. The market may stay strong all day, but
trading may be subdued,"" said Yumi Nishimura, a senior market
analyst at Daiwa Securities.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, fell to as low as 73.091
-- a level not seen since July 2008. 
 The euro rose to a 16-month high of $1.4837 , further
spurred by stop-loss buying after a breach of option barriers
around $1.4800, while the Australian dollar touched a post-float
high of $1.0917 .	
 In the commodities market, U.S. crude  rose to a 2-1/2
year high of $113.70 a barrel, and gold raced to a record

 (Recasts, updates prices, adds detail)
 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro and most other major currencies on Wednesday after the
Federal Reserve said it will end its bond-buying program in
June as planned and appeared in no rush to tighten monetary
policy further.
 The dollar was already at a three-year low against major
currencies on Wednesday and gained no traction from a press
conference by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke where he
forecast weaker U.S. growth in the first three months of 2011,
though he attributed it to transitory factors. It was the first
regularly scheduled news briefing by a Fed chief in the central
bank's 97-year history.
 ""The communique from the FOMC was little changed and he
really just reiterated that"" in his press conference, said
Gareth Sylvester, senior currency strategist at San
Francisco-based Klarity FX. ""It's status quo""
 The Fed's easy money policy has contributed to the slide in
the U.S. dollar, with higher interest rates in Europe and some
other developed countries attracting funds into other
currencies.
 Low U.S. interest rates, combined with slow economic growth
and a large federal budget deficit, have resulted in the dollar
losing around 10 percent of its value against a broad measure
of major currencies since its January peak. Credit rater
Standard & Poor's changed its outlook on the AAA U.S. sovereign
debt rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" last week.
 The dollar <.DXY> skidded to a three-year low of 73.284 as
measured by the InterContinental Exchange's dollar index
<.DXY>, down around 10 percent from its peak in January, and
many traders expect the index to fall to the all-time low, hit
in July 2008, of 70.698. It last traded down 0.7 percent at
73.301.
 The euro was up 1.0 percent at $1.4785  after
reaching $1.4791, its highest since December 2009. Traders said
Asian and Middle East sovereign accounts were looking to buy
the euro on every dip.
 ""Rate differentials are working firmly against the dollar,
we are in a 'risk-on' environment and general dollar sentiment
is overwhelmingly bearish,"" said Greg Anderson, G10 strategist
at CitiFX in New York. ""The Fed would have to turn
substantially hawkish for the dollar to reverse course.""
 The Fed also said it expects full-year U.S. gross domestic
product growth to range between 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent,
compared to an earlier 3.4-3.9 percent forecast. See

 Yield differentials, however, favored the dollar over the
yen, with Japan's central bank expected to keep interest rates
low, perhaps longer than the Fed. The yen was one of the few
currencies against which the dollar managed to gain, climbing
0.7 percent at 82.03 yen .
 The yen came under pressure on Wednesday after S&P
downgraded its ratings outlook on Japan's sovereign debt. It
warned the huge cost of last month's devastating earthquake
would hurt already weak public finances unless the government
raised taxes. The euro jumped 1.6 percent to 121.30 yen
. 
Sterling also remained at its highest since December 2009
against the greenback after an in-line reading of first-quarter
UK growth, with investors who had sold the pound on
anticipation of a softer figure being forced to buy it back.
[ID:nLDE73Q0SJ]
 The pound  last traded at $1.6629, up 0.9 percent.
Earlier in the global day, data showed the UK economy expanded
0.5 percent in January-March from the previous quarter.
 The Swiss franc scaled its strongest point on record
against the dollar  while the Australian dollar shot up
to another post-float high . The aussie was floated in
December 1983.
 Australian first-quarter core inflation data revived
expectations for higher Australian interest rates.

 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slid to a
three-year low against major currencies and global stocks edged
higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled it would
retain extensive support for the U.S. economy.
 Wall Street rebounded a bit and oil prices nudged up after
the Fed said in a statement it believed the recovery was
proceeding at a moderate pace, with little risk of inflationary
pressure. For details see: [ID:nN26291565]
 But the dollar later pared gains against the yen and slid
to a fresh three-year low against six major currencies after
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke gave little indication the U.S.
central bank is close to tightening monetary policy.

 Bernanke spoke at the first regularly scheduled news
briefing by a Fed chief. He said a strong dollar was in the
U.S. interest and the Fed could best ensure a strong currency
by creating conditions for solid growth.
 The dollar, which has been under persistent pressure in
recent months, fell to its lowest since 2008 against a basket
of six currencies. The dollar index <.DXY> fell as low as
73.445, not far from an all-time low hit in July 2008.
 Investors gave Bernanke high marks. ""He struck the right
balance between education, straightforwardness and the
limitations of making policy in an uncertain world, said David
Joy, chief market strategist at Columbia Management in Boston.
 ""He even closed with a note of optimism,"" Joy said.
 Bernanke's comments came after the policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee said that it intends to end its $600
billion bond-buying program in June as scheduled and suggested
it would not let its balance sheet run down immediately.
 The language, along with a continued showing of solid
corporate earnings, helped bolster Wall Street's gains.
 ""The tweaks in the QE2 language strongly suggest they are
going to continue not only with QE2 but reinvesting mortgage
cash flows,"" said Max Bublitz, chief investment strategist at
SCM Advisors in San Francisco.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 65.88
points, or 0.52 percent, at 12,661.25. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 4.58 points, or 0.34 percent, at
1,351.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 14.51
points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,862.05.
 The price of U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds fell to session
lows, losing nearly 1 point, after the Federal Reserve lifted
its inflation forecasts. [ID:nNYE003011]
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 37/32

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2011 03:44PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Doha Round's 'unbridgeable' gap," April 26 (Reuters) - A disagreement between the United
States and major emerging economies like China, India and
Brazil over how deeply to cut manufactured goods tariffs
threatens to finally kill 10-year-old world trade talks.
 Following the release of new negotiating documents last
week, countries are expected to air concerns over the state of
the Doha round in meetings on Thursday and Friday at the World
Trade Organization in Geneva.
 Here is a primer on where things stand in the so-called
NAMA (non-agricultural market access) portion of the Doha
round, which covers about two-thirds of world trade:
 TWO FORMULAS FOR MOST TARIFF CUTS
 * The 153 WTO members have already essentially agreed on
two formulas for cutting tariffs on most manufactured goods.
 * One would apply for developed countries like the United
States, Japan and the European Union and the other for major
developing countries like China, Brazil and India.
 * Around 120 of the WTO's poorest members would not have to
cut their tariffs at all.
 * The formulas are based on what are known as ""bound""
tariffs, the maximum rates at which individual countries have
agreed to cap their tariffs under WTO rules.
 * Bound tariffs in developing countries are often higher
than actual ""applied"" tariffs.
 * According to World Trade Organization data, Brazil has an
average bound tariff rate of 30.8 percent on manufactured goods
versus an applied rate of 14.1 percent.
 * India's average bound rate is 34.7 percent and its
applied rate is 10.1 percent.
 * China, which was required to make significant market
openings when it joined the WTO in 2001, has an average bound
rate of 9.1 percent and an applied rate of 8.7 percent.
 * The same WTO data shows the United States has average
bound and applied tariff rates of about 3.3 percent, Japan
average bound and applied rates of about 2.5 percent and the EU
average bound and applied rates of about 4.0 percent.
 * The Washington-based National Association of
Manufacturers estimates the developing country formula would
not cut bound tariffs for China, Brazil and India to below
currently applied level for a number of years, and even then
would only result in small cuts in applied rates.
 * The developed country formula would significantly cut
remaining U.S. tariffs, including peak tariffs of more than 15
percent on goods like textiles and trucks, giving U.S.
negotiators little negotiating leverage in future rounds to
bring down developing country tariffs, U.S. officials say.
 ""UNBRIDGEABLE"" SECTORAL DIVIDE
 * Washington, unhappy with market openings created by the
formula cuts, has pressed major developing countries to
participate in ""sectoral"" talks to cut tariffs more
aggressively in areas like chemicals, industrial machinery and
electronics.
 * Countries agreed in 2005 to sectoral negotiations on a
voluntary basis. However, the United States has insisted
sectorals are essential for a deal.
 * China has informed the United States that it will only
participate in sectorals if joined by India and Brazil, but
those countries are reluctant to take part fearing more
competition from China if they open their markets.
 * China and the United States also disagree about how to
manage tariff cuts within the sectorals.
 * The United States backs an approach that divides cuts
into three different ""product baskets"": one where countries cut
tariffs to zero, a second where countries cut tariffs more than
the formulas require and a third where countries could use
""NAMA flexibilities"" to shield certain products.
 * China has proposed a four-basket approach: one where only
developed countries would cut tariffs to zero, a second where
countries would make greater-than-formula cuts, a third where
developing countries would make formula cuts and developed
countries go to zero and a fourth where developing countries
could use flexibilities to shield products.
 * In March, the United States described its differences
with China on the sectorals as ""a major gap.""
 * Echoing that assessment, World Trade Organization
Director General Pascal Lamy last week described the fight over
NAMA sectorals as ""not bridgeable today.""
 * ""One side considers tariff cuts achieved through the
formula as being insufficient to meets its expectations for the
level of ambition of the Doha Round on industrial tariffs ...
The other side considers that the formula delivers a
significant level of ambition,"" Lamy said.
 * Other differences remain in the Doha negotiations, but
none are as severe as the sectoral divide, he said.

 * EU, IMF officials currently in Lisbon

(Recasts with European Commission spokesman)
 LISBON, April 27 (Reuters) - The European Commission poured
cold water on Wednesday on a media report that EU and IMF terms
for a bailout of Portugal would be ready and submitted to the
caretaker government by the end of the week.
 Portugal's Expresso weekly, which did not cite any sources,
reported on its website that a mission of officials from the
European Union and International Monetary Fund visiting Lisbon
had ""practically finished"" work on the package and wanted the
government and opposition parties to approve the terms by May 4.
 ""This is simply not true. Discussions are still going on and
nothing is concluded until everything is wrapped up,"" said
European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj. He did not provide
any estimates on when a deal may be ready.
 An IMF spokeswoman said she would not comment on
speculation. Portuguese government officials had no immediate
comment either.
 Portugal this month became the third euro zone country to
seek foreign aid, following Greece and Ireland, after the
minority government collapsed in March, sending the heavily
indebted country's borrowing costs soaring.
 Officials from the European Commission, the European Central
Bank and IMF arrived in Lisbon earlier this month to go over
Portugal's accounts and establish terms for a loan that is
expected to reach 80 billion euros.
 The terms could include austerity measures like those seen
in Greece and Ireland, where taxes have been raised and public
sector salaries cut. Reforms of Portugal's labour market may
also be included to boost competitiveness.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned last month after the
opposition rejected austerity measures proposed by his minority
Socialist government. His caretaker government will remain in
power until an early election called for June 5.
 Socrates is leading the talks with the bailout team and also
coordinating efforts to obtain approval for the aid package from
other parties, particularly the main opposition Social
Democrats.
 Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos has said he
hopes the European Union will approve the loan by mid-May.

 (Adds detail, quotes)
 By Emma Farge
 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - A tanker booked for Italian oil
company Eni to carry crude to Italy from Gaddafi-held territory
in Libya never arrived in port and left empty last week, trade
sources said on Wednesday.
 The shipment, the first from west Libya in weeks, was seen
as a test case for other shipments from the conflict-torn
country.
 ""It was cancelled before it got into the port,"" said a trade
source, without giving a reason.
 Eni declined to comment but previously said it was planning
to ship oil sourced from its own fields to Venice, Italy.
 Live ship tracking data on AIS showed the Malta-flagged
tanker 'Aqua' got within a few kilometres of the Libyan port of
Mellitah before turning away between April 20 and 21.
 On Wednesday the data showed it was in the Sea of Marmara
and bound for a Turkish port.
 A shipping source said the booking from Mellitah to Venice
probably cost over $500,000, including a risk premium to venture
into Libyan waters. It was not clear whether Eni was responsible
for the shipping fee.
 Two trade sources said the tanker, known as an Aframax, did
not load its intended 600,000 barrel cargo, because it was
blocked by Libya's National Oil Company (NOC).
 ""They didn't want the crude to go, because they wouldn't
have gotten any money for it,"" said an industry source, adding,
""They could use it to refine into gasoline.""
 Libya is one of Africa's top oil exporters but still does
not have the refining capacity to meet its domestic gasoline
requirements, even in peacetime.
 Eni was one of the top producers in Libya before the civil
war began, with a nearly 10 percent share of the country's total
output of 1.6 million barrels per day.
 Its assets in west Libya include the Wafa and Elephant
fields and the Bouri offshore terminal, from which an Eni cargo
was shipped in mid-March, according to trade and shipping
sources.

 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was at a
three-year low against major currencies and world equity
markets edged slightly higher on Wednesday after the Federal
Reserve signaled it would maintain its extensive support for
the U.S. economy.
 Wall Street rebounded slightly and oil prices nudged up
after the Fed indicated in a statement that it believed the
economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace, with
little risk an inflationary psychology would take hold. For
details see: [ID:nN26291565]
 The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said as
expected after a two-day meeting that it intends to complete
its $600 billion bond-buying program in June as scheduled.
 ""We did not expect any material surprises in the FOMC
statement and there was none. It remains quite dovish,"" said
Bret Barker, a portfolio manager at TCW in Los Angeles.
 ""It could be argued they slightly downgraded growth and
maintained the view that inflation is 'transitory.' It was very
boilerplate,"" Barker said.
 Following the FOMC statement investors now await remarks by
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke who speak starting at 2:15 p.m. (1815
GMT) at his first-ever news conference on monetary policy.
 Bernanke will likely hammer home the case for a patient
approach to withdrawing the Fed's extensive support for the
U.S. economy
 The dollar fell against the euro after bouncing around a
bit before the single European currency ultimately extended
gains to trade at 1.4700, up about 0.4 percent on the day.

before the announcement, but remained up 1.1 percent on the

 Crude oil prices rose, lifted by a sharp drawdown in U.S.

data showed domestic gasoline stockpiles fell 2.51 million
barrels last week to the lowest level since August 2009.

 It was the 10th drawdown in a row, much deeper than the 1.1

 ""Crude futures headed back higher, after the initial
knee-jerk selling on the EIA stock build, as traders reacted to
the drawdowns in product stocks, chiefly gasoline,"" said Gene

 The difference between interest rates set by the Fed and
other major central banks, which have been raising rates, is
underpinning the dollar's weakness.
 While the Fed continues to print money, the European
Central Bank raised rates for the first time in two years this
month and is poised for a repeat dose before too long.

 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it will
end its bond-buying program in June as planned and appeared in
no rush to tighten monetary policy further.
 The dollar fell to a three-year low against major
currencies on Wednesday ahead of the announcement and remained
pressured. For more see [ID:nW1E7FI013] and [ID:nN26291565].
 The spotlight now shifts to the 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT) news
conference by Chairman Ben Bernanke, the first regularly
scheduled news briefing by a Fed chief in the central bank's
97-year history.
 The Fed's super-loose interest rate policy is a source of
severe trouble for the dollar, which has lost 10 percent of its
value against a broad measure of major currencies since its
January peak.
 Low rates have combined with slow growth and an alarming
budget shortfall, which led Standard & Poor's to change to
""negative"" from ""stable"" its outlook on the United States'
prized AAA rating last week.
 ""Bit of dollar selling on the announcement as expected but
respecting the day's ranges"","" said John McCarthy, director of
currency trading at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Nothing
too much has changed. Still waiting for Mr Bernanke's Q&A.""
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.4695  after
reaching $1.4713, its highest since December 2009. The euro was
at $1.4665 prior to the Fed announcement.
 Traders said Asian and Middle East sovereign accounts were
looking to buy the euro on every dip.
 Market participants say a sustained break on the euro could
open the way to the psychologically key $1.50 mark.
 The dollar <.DXY> skidded to a three-year low of 73.493
against a currency basket earlier in the day, down around 10
percent from its peak in January, and many traders expect the
index to fall to the all-time low, hit in July 2008, of 70.698.
It last traded down 0.2 percent at 73.713.
 ""There is really nothing working in favor of the dollar
right now,"" said Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New
York. ""Rate differentials are working firmly against the
dollar, we are in a risk-on environment and general dollar
sentiment is overwhelmingly bearish,"" he said. ""The Fed would
have to turn substantially hawkish for the dollar to reverse
course.""
 ""Really the only positive for the dollar right now is the
large level of shorts in the market,"" he said.
 Yield differentials, however, favored the dollar over the
yen, with Japan's central bank expected to keep interest rates
low, perhaps longer than the Fed. The yen was one of the few
currencies against which the dollar managed to gain, surging
1.1 percent at 82.43 yen .
 The yen came under pressure after S&P downgraded its
ratings outlook on Japan's sovereign debt. It warned the huge
cost of last month's devastating earthquake would hurt already

traders fear they will not be paid.
 Libya was a net importer of food before heavy fighting
between rebels and leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces interrupted
supply chains.
 This week the World Food Programme (WFP) said, ""A recent
inter-agency mission found that food stocks in the eastern parts
of the country are not being replenished at normal rates and the
current stocks are enough for up to two months only.""
 ""If the import capacity is not restored quickly, this could
lead to a massive food availability problem for the entire
population of eastern Libya,"" the U.N. agency warned.
 European dealers said transactions with east Libya were not
feasible for most private grain trade houses.
 ""I am not accepting the risk of local delivery to Libya and
selling to the rebels. Which court would you go to if you were
not paid? It is an unknown factor,"" one European trader said.
 Another said rebels had little expertise in food logistics.
 ""The rebels could get flour by paying in advance, which they
are not willing to do,"" the second trader said. ""They could also
charter ships themselves, buy the wheat at origin and ship it
themselves. They do not seem to be doing this either.""
 Analysts said the rebels still lack relationships with
financial institutions.
 ""It is rather difficult to extend credit to someone who is
not fully plugged into the international financial system or
into singular national financial systems,"" said J. Peter Pham,
Africa director with U.S. think-tank the Atlantic Council.
 ""Until those very basic fundamentals are addressed, there is
going to be hesitancy on the part of the trading community to do
business with them.""
 Meanwhile, stores and supermarkets in Benghazi remain
well-stocked with food items such as bread, cheese and milk, but
storeowners and residents say prices of some items have gone up
sharply since the uprising began.
 ""These are the hardest days we've had so far, because we
cannot get the goods we want when we want them,"" Saleh Awad, a
grocery store owner in Benghazi, told Reuters.
 
 SHIPPING DISRUPTED
 The WFP has urged commercial shipping lines to resume
operations to eastern ports of Benghazi and Tobruk to facilitate
humanitarian imports and commercial imports of basic items.
 ""The sooner the free flow of goods is resumed, the sooner
the food security of that country will be improved,"" a WFP
spokesman said on Wednesday.
 Traders said it was difficult to ship anything by sea into
Libya at the moment.
""Libya is seeking to buy soft wheat,"" said a trader used to
dealing with the country. ""We did not resume exports to this
country, because it's almost impossible to find ships and
insurance for this destination.""
 Another trader said, ""Even if things are quiet when the
contracts are signed, artillery shells could be coming down in
the ports when the vessel actually arrives in two weeks time.""
 Shipping sources also have said a U.N. arms embargo on
Gaddafi enforced by NATO at sea is disrupting other shipping
activity. Libyan coast guard and port officials said it was
strangling vital seaborne trade.
 ""As in any armed conflict there will always be a risk if one
gets in the way of the fighting parties,"" said Jakob Larsen,
maritime security officer with BIMCO, the world's largest
private shipowners' association.
 ""Until now all we have received is directions on how to help
the navies achieve their objectives, but we have not seen any
measures to make it more transparent to the shipping industry
what is actually going on,"" he added.
 Traders said food imports in Gaddafi-controlled west Libya
were affected by trade sanctions on the government.
 Large purchases of flour for west Libya have been made in
recent weeks for shipment to Tunisia and truck transport to
Libya, European grain traders said.
 ""Libyan flour mills seem to be out of operation, and so the
state-owned Libyan importing companies in Tripoli are buying
finished flour ready for baking on the international market,"" a
trader said.
 ""There are problems on the payment front as no grain trading
houses want to have the word 'Libya' on the documents. Letters
of credit for the sales are being opened by banks outside Libya,
notably in Tunisia.""
The WFP said on Tuesday a second chartered aid ship had
reached the besieged western city of Misrata. It has also set up
a humanitarian corridor into the west for civilians in cities
including Tripoli.

 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
three-year low and world equity markets slipped slightly on
Wednesday before a Federal Reserve decision that is expected to
reaffirm its easy monetary policy.
 The dollar <.DXY> skidded to 73.493 on the Intercontinental
Exchange's dollar index, driven by widening interest rate
differentials between the U.S. and other major central banks.
For details see: [ID:nN27130671]
 The dollar index is almost 10 percent below its peak in
January and many traders expect it eventually to revisit an
all-time low of 70.698 hit in 2008.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.12 percent at 73.929.
 The Fed is set to confirm it will complete its $600 billion
bond-buying program and renew its commitment to rock-bottom
borrowing costs for ""an extended period"" in its statement on
Wednesday [ID:nN26273939].
 In addition, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold the
first-ever regularly scheduled news conference by a U.S.
central bank chief at around 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT).
 ""It's clear Fed monetary policy is the reason for dollar
weakness. If we don't get any hint that the Fed will normalise,
the dollar will continue to stay under selling pressure,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 While the Fed continues to print money, the European
Central Bank raised rates for the first time in two years this
month and is poised for a repeat dose before too long.
 The euro  was down 0.01 percent at $1.4641 after
breaking above $1.47 for the first time since December 2009.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 13/32 in price to yield 3.36 percent.
 The U.S. government reported orders for durable goods
increased 2.5 percent in March, greater than the 2.0 percent
rise expected in a Reuters poll of economists.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a three-year
low against major currencies on Wednesday and is likely on path to
reach its lowest level on record given expectations that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will significantly lag other major central banks
in raising interest rates.
 Moderate position squaring was noted, with the spotlight
squarely on the Fed's 12:30 p.m. (16:30 GMT) policy statement and
a news conference by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at 2:15 p.m. (1615
GMT). It will be the first regularly scheduled news briefing by a
Fed chief in the U.S. central bank's 97-year history.
 Bernanke will likely use his news conference on monetary
policy to hammer home the case for a patient approach to
withdrawing the central bank's extensive support for the U.S.
economy.
 The Fed's ultra-loose policy stands in stark contrast to the
European Central Bank, which last month raised rates for the first
time since July 2008 and appears on path to continue on a
tightening.
 This policy divergence is the primary reason for the euro's
9.6 percent gain in 2011.
 ""There is really nothing working in favor of the dollar right
now,"" said Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 ""Rate differentials are working firmly against the dollar, we
are in a risk-on environment and general dollar sentiment is
overwhelmingly bearish,"" he said. ""The Fed would have to turn
substantially hawkish for the dollar to reverse course.""
 ""Really the only positive for the dollar right now is the
large level of shorts in the market,"" he said.
 The dollar skidded to a three-year low of 73.493 against a
currency basket, down close to 10 percent from its peak in
January, and many traders expect the index to eventually reach its
all-time low, hit in 2008, of 70.698. It last traded at 73.736,
down 0.1 percent.
 ""It's clear Fed monetary policy is the reason for dollar
weakness. If we don't get any hint that the Fed will normalize,
the dollar will continue to stay under selling pressure,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4654 after reaching $1.4713,
its highest since Dec. 2009. Traders said Asian and Middle East
sovereign accounts were looking to buy the euro on every dip.
Offers for the euro are said to be around $1.4750, with stops
cited below $1.4620.
 Technical analysts say the euro faced immediate resistance
around $1.4720, a level hit when it briefly spiked up in late
2008, and $1.4775, the top of a weekly trendline channel drawn
from lows hit in February and April.
 Market participants say a sustained break above this level
would open the way to the psychologically key $1.50.
 Sterling, meanwhile, neared a 17-month highs against the
greenback after an in-line reading of first quarter UK growth,
with investors who had sold the pound on anticipation of a softer
figure being forced to buy it back..
 The pound neared a 17-month high of $1.6582 after data showed
the UK economy expanded 0.5 percent in January-March from the
previous quarter. It last traded at $1.6562, up 0.6 percent.
 The Swiss franc scaled its strongest point on record at
0.8669, while the Australian dollar shot up to a 29-year high of
$1.0853.
 The yen came under pressure after S&P downgraded its ratings
outlook on Japan's sovereign debt. It warned the huge cost of last
month's devastating earthquake would hurt already weak public
finances unless the government raised taxes.
 The yen was one of the few currencies against which the dollar
managed to gain, rising 1 percent on the day to 82.28 yen. The
euro also rose 1.1 percent on the day to around 120.70 yen, its
highest in nearly two weeks.

 LONDON/NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell
to a three year low against major currencies on Wednesday

 * HIB promises several billion dollars investment
 * Private ownership remains mystery
 
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, April 27 (Reuters) - A mysterious newcomer to
Ukraine's lucrative grain market, Hlib Investbud (HIB), said on
Wednesday it planned to export at least 1.5 million tonnes of
grain this season and could double that amount in 2011/2012.
 HIB emerged last summer from the restructuring of Ukraine's
main grain company, which was fully state-owned. It is now owned
49 percent by the state and 51 percent by private investors who
have never been identified.
 The company has moved into the lucrative export market as
well as making grain purchases for a state-run intervention fund
that is responsible for ensuring domestic food price stability.
 Last year, a severe drought threw the Black Sea grain market
into turmoil. Russia banned all grain exports, and Ukraine --
previously the world's largest barley exporter and one of the
top five for wheat and maize -- in October imposed export
quotas.
 HIB, which had not exported before the quotas, won more than
20 percent of the total quota volume of 4.2 million tonnes.
 This prompted exporters and traders to accuse the government
of favouritism for a firm that is only partly state-owned.
 HIB General Director Robert Brovdi said in an interview the
procedure for allocating the quotas was fair and transparent.
 ""More that 50 companies received quotas. All who had an
interest, who possessed volumes of grain, all of them received
quotas,"" Brovdi said.
 ""The problem is that they (traders) assumed they would
export more, similar to the amounts that they had done in
previous periods.""
 
 FUTURE EXPORTS
 Ukraine harvested 39 million tonnes of grain in 2010, and
its exports are forecast at 11 million tonnes in the July-June
2010/11 season. Brovdi said HIB could account for up to 15
percent of that volume.
 ""We are talking about the export of 1.5 million tonnes of
grain this season, and we want to approach 2 million,"" Brovdi
said.
 He said a higher grain harvest this year could allow HIB to
increase exports to about 3 million tonnes in 2011/12 and that
the company had already bought grain on a forward basis for
future exports.
 Ukraine expects the harvest this year to amount to at least
43 million tonnes, and analysts say exports could jump to 22-23
million in 2011/12.
 ""We are seeking to double exports next season. Our programme
of forward purchases, preparation for spot deals, a wide
geography of silos and a significant amount of investment money
allow us to form a plan for several million tonnes of exports,""
Brovdi said.
 Ukraine's billion-dollar grain sector is, with steel and
chemicals, one of its biggest export earners, but it remains a
murky area of the economy.
 The cash-strapped Kiev government, with its eye on the huge
export potential, continuously seeks to tighten its control over
the sector while seeking to hold down local bread prices and
prevent any local unrest.
 Traders and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) have expressed concerns about a draft law
that would establish a state-run grain export monopoly, which
could damage the confidence of foreign investors who have
already poured millions of dollars to build Ukrainian grain
infrastructure.
 Foreign-owned exporters, traders and other interested
parties have criticised HIB for keeping its full ownership
secret.
 Andre Kuusvek, the EBRD director in Ukraine, said in late
March at an Internet conference, ""We also are concerned about
the lack of transparency in the structure of share-holders of
the company HIB.""
 Brovdi said the private owners of 51 percent would invest
'several billion dollars' in the Ukrainian agricultural sector
under the current two-year investment programme.
 But he declined to name them.
 ""As it stands today, it is not in my competence (to reveal
the names), according to an nondisclosure agreement,"" he said.
 ""This is a commercial investment project ... We are in
permanent dialogue with potential investors in a bid to increase
investments,"" Brovdi said.

 * Year net profit reached 54.8 billion roubles
 * Says pursuing strategic acquisitions

 By Katya Golubkova and Oksana Kobzeva
 MOSCOW, April 27 (Reuters) - VTB, Russia's second-biggest
bank, plans more acquisitions to help strengthen its market
position and aims for a record net profit in 2011 after a strong
fourth-quarter performance.
 ""I am confident we will reach the target of 80 billion
roubles ($2.89 billion) net profit in 2011. It is a forecast for
organic growth alone,"" VTB Chief Financial Officer Herbert Moos,
told journalists.
 VTB posted fourth quarter results of 16 billion roubles on
Wednesday, its all-time high in a single quarter, or 54.8
billion roubles net profit for 2010.
 State-owned VTB was in the red for all four quarters in
2009, hit by the global financial crisis. The bank has got back
into the black on the back of loan portfolio growth and lower
bad debt provisions.
 ""The bank has managed to increase net profit thanks to a
rise in net interest margin (NIM) and a rapid decrease in
provision charges,"" said Rustam Botashev, an analyst with
UniCredit Securities.
 ""I think the lender will earn more in 2011, the loan
portfolio will grow and provision charges may be reduced
further.""
 State-owned VTB reported under international standards for
the first time since it floated 10 percent of state-owned shares
in February. The bank said provisions for bad debts fell sharply
to 51.6 billion roubles, almost three times less than in 2009.
 Its non-performing loan ratio decreased to 8.6 percent of
total gross loans from 9.8 percent. Net interest margin, which
shows the bank's efficiency in its core business, rose to 5.1
percent last year from 4.6 percent in 2009.
 Moos said on Wednesday this year's net interest margin might
be ""a little below"" 5 percent, without elaborating.
 Rival Sberbank, which has a market capitalisation of more
than twice VTB's, sees its net interest margin at 6.1-6.3
percent in 2011.

 ACQUISITION PLANS
 VTB, which has recently bought stakes in Bank of Moscow and
TransCreditBank (TCB), said the acquisition of 43.2 percent
stake in TCB last year helped it to increase total gross loans
by 20.2 percent to 3.06 trillion roubles. 
 Moos said VTB expected to increase its corporate loan book
by 15 percent this year, with the retail loan portfolio rising
by more than 20 percent, including TCB. 
 Chief Executive Andrei Kostin, pledged to pursue strategic
acquisitions.
 ""We are also pursuing strategic acquisitions that will
enable us to ... further strengthen market position across core
businesses,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday.
 Moos said VTB is going to include Bank of Moscow's profit in
VTB's next quarter earnings report, after it bought a stake of a
little less than 50 percent stake early in February.
 ""(In the long term) we see ourselves as holding a 100
percent stake,"" he said, adding the bank will not buy additional
Bank of Moscow shares this year.
 Analysts said they are waiting for more clarity on VTB's
acquisition plans.
""The results are close to the market's expectations but TCB
consolidation improved loan portfolio's growth and its quality,""
said Olga Belenkaya, an analyst with Sovlink.
 ""Now the market is waiting for clarity on how mergers and
acquisitions will affect VTB's growth prospects,"" said Andrei
Klapko, an analyst with Gazprombank.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against most
currencies on Wednesday and looked set to stay under pressure on
expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will reaffirm its
ultra-loose monetary policy for the coming months.
 Sterling neared 17-month highs against the greenback after
an in-line reading of first quarter UK growth, with investors
who had sold the pound on anticipation of a softer figure being
forced to buy it back. [ID:nLDE73Q0SJ].
 But they extended bearish bets against the dollar, keeping
the euro  near a 16-month high of $1.4715 while the Swiss
franc scaled its strongest point on record at 0.8669 .
 Analysts say the current dollar-selling momentum may take
the euro towards $1.50 as investors focus on policy divergences
between central banks on a tightening path and those keeping
rates low.
 Monetary policy will take centre-stage ahead of a rate
announcement by the Fed later in the day. The U.S. central bank
is widely expected to keep rates near zero and signal that it is
in no hurry to scale back its massive support for the economy.
 Given that the European Central Bank has started to raise
rates, and others like the Australian central bank are in the
midst of a tightening cycle, analysts said the Fed's stance will
keep the dollar weak as investors choose higher-yielding
currencies.
 ""It's clear Fed monetary policy is the reason for dollar
weakness. If we don't get any hint that the Fed will normalise,
the dollar will continue to stay under selling pressure,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4672. Traders said Asian
and Middle East sovereign accounts were looking to buy the euro
on every dip. Offers for the euro  are said to be around
$1.4750, with system stops cited below $1.4620.
 Technical analysts say the euro faced immediate resistance
around $1.4720, a level hit when it briefly spiked up in late
2008, and $1.4775, the top of a weekly trendline channel drawn
from lows hit in February and April. 
 Market participants say a sustained break above this level
would open the way to the psychologically key $1.50.
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia on Wednesday revised its
forecasts for the U.S. dollar lower. The bank now expects the
euro to rise to $1.50 by end-September, having earlier forecast
the euro to fall to $1.42.
 ""We now believe the USD won't recover until the Fed formally
changes their monetary policy guidance from an easing bias to a
tightening bias,"" said chief strategist Richard Grace.
 
 YEN ALSO FALLS
 The dollar <.DXY> skidded to a three-year low of 73.493
against a currency basket, down close to 10 percent from its
peak in January, and many traders expect the index to eventually
reach its all-time low, hit in 2008, of 70.698.
 The greenback hovered around 0.8760 Swiss francs ,
having fallen as low as 0.8669 in Asian trade, while the
Australian dollar shot up to a 29-year high of $1.0853. 
 The pound  also rose more than a full U.S. cent to
$1.6582 after data showed the UK economy expanded 0.5 percent in
January-March from the previous quarter.
 The yen was one of the few currencies against which the
dollar managed to gain, rising 1 percent on the day to 82.36 yen
. It tripped past some light stops above 82 yen on steady
buying from real money accounts and model funds.
 The euro also rose more than 1 percent on the day to around
120.70 yen , its highest in nearly two weeks.
 The yen came under pressure after S&P downgraded its ratings
outlook on Japan's sovereign debt. It warned the huge cost of
last month's devastating earthquake would hurt already weak
public finances unless the government raised taxes.

 * Affected metals include tin, tungsten, tantulum, gold
 
 By Kezio-Musoke David 
 KIGALI, April 27 (Reuters) - Rwanda has banned the sale of
minerals from areas where there is fighting in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), in compliance with a U.S. law requiring
minerals to be certified conflict-free, its mines minister said.
 Global Witness, an international research organisation, has
in the past accused Kigali of offering a channel for exports of
minerals that are used to fund conflicts in eastern DRC. 
 The affected minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and
gold, which are largely destined for the global electronics
industry for use in mobile phones, laptops and other products.
 Global Witness said Rwanda was the second biggest export
destination for Congolese tin ore and appeared content to let
its territory be used as an exit route and laundering zone for
conflict minerals. Officials in Kigali reject these allegations.
 The minister, Christophe Bazivamo, said the country was now
carrying out rigorous due diligence on tin ore originating in
conflict areas and would not allow those referred to as conflict
minerals to pass through.
 ""From March this year every mineral export will be sealed.
We have placed instructions with our immigration department not
to allow any uncertified minerals and also to carry out rigorous
due diligence on any ores entering Rwanda from conflict areas,""
he said.
 This complied with the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, which requires
public companies in America to disclose steps they have taken to
eliminate so-called conflict minerals from their supply chains. 
 Tin is used as a solder in circuit boards, tantalum goes
into capacitors -- small components used to store electricity --
and tungsten is used in the vibrating function of mobile phones.
Gold is used by the electronics industry as a coating for wires.
 Export volumes of tin ore increased by 115.01 percent in
January-March 2011 compared with the same period last year
earning the country at least $21.5 million in export revenues,
Rwanda's ministry of finance said. 
 Rwanda earned a total of $35.3 million from exports of tin,
tantalum and tungsten in the first quarter of this year, the
ministry added.

 * Analyst says rail infrastructure must be improved
 * Iron miner IRC wants third Sino-Russian rail crossing
 
 By Alfred Kueppers
 MOSCOW, April 27 (Reuters) - Russian metals firms seeking to
increase exports to China and other Asian buyers face an uphill
struggle as they grapple with infrastructure constraints on
Soviet-era rail lines in Siberia and the Far East.
 Russia's two main rail lines in the region, the
Trans-Siberian and the Baikal Amur Mainline (BAM) are becoming
overburdened as freight shipments increase. 
 The problem could worsen as Russia boosts shipments of
copper, iron ore and coal to China, its largest trading partner
and the world's second largest economy.
 ""You have no sophisticated road links between Russia and
China, that means you have to use the railway and you have to
improve the railway quality,"" said Maria Leenen, chief executive
of Hamburg-based SCI Verkehr international rail consultancy.
 ""There is no real alternative.""
 While the RZhD state rail monopoly has mooted a series of
ambitious plans to overhaul the rail network in Russia's vast
interior, including the $16 billion construction of a second
track for the 4,324 km BAM, Leenen said the immediate priority
should be improving existing assets.
 ""They have very old locomotives, and they are really not
reliable any more,"" she said.
 RZhD plans to spend more than 112 billion roubles ($3.74
billion) on 1,250 new locomotives between 2011-13, but Leenen
said actual purchases often fall short of the initial goals.
 Rail lines were seriously overstretched in the 2009-10
winter, when extreme temperatures and unloading problems at
ports delayed shipments of coal and other products by several
weeks.
 Capacity on the lines will need to increase after more
Russian metals firms bring export-oriented mines and smelters on
line in the Far East, where executives are lobbying the
government to develop transport infrastructure.
 ""In the coming decades the main sources of global demand for
key industrial resources will be the countries of east Asia,
starting with China, Japan, Korean and then India,"" Oleg
Deripaska, chief executive of aluminium producer RUSAL said
earlier this month.
 ""Business forms the demand, and it is the task of the
government to guarantee growth opportunities. For example, we
need acceptable transport and logistics infrastructure.""
 
 PROJECT PLANS
 Increasing the number of rail borders with China is another
way to relieve congestion on Russia's railways.
 Hong Kong-listed iron miner IRC, developing several mines in
the Amur Region bordering China, wants to build a bridge across
the Amur River that will allow it to ship iron ore concentrate
to Chinese steel mills about 500 km distant.
 The new bridge will be the only freight crossing for about
3,000 km. IRC currently ships iron ore concentrate via the two
existing crossings at Grodekovo and Zabaikalsk.
 IRC estimates that this new route will allow it to reduce
its per tonne iron ore shipping costs delivered at frontier
(DAF) by $6 per tonne to $12 per tonne.
 Company Chairman Jay Hambro is optimistic that the project
will proceed, thanks in part to high level backing on both
sides, but a lengthy approval process means that construction is
unlikely to start for at least another 12-18 months.
 ""The important thing to remember is that you have an
opportunity that is there,"" Hambro told Reuters. ""The
possibility for the bridge construction is incredibly exciting.""
 IRC hopes the bridge will go into operation by 2015, and
Hambro said other miners, including Mechel are in talks to join
the project.
 The mining and power conglomerate is developing the Elga
coking coal mine in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) as well as a
315 km railway to transport output to the BAM. The project's
total cost is $2.8 billion.
 Mechel declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
 RUSAL, Metalloinvest and Evraz are also planning major new
projects in Siberia and the Far East. See FACTBOX
 
 FEEDING THE DRAGON
 Despite current obstacles, the potential for increased rail
traffic between resource-rich Russia and raw materials-poor
China is huge.
 Annual turnover rose 50 percent in 2010 to reach $59
billion, according to Russian customs data.
 Though energy imports are likely to account for the bulk of
increases in 2011 thanks to the new ESPO oil pipeline, analysts
also expect Chinese purchases of metals, iron ore and coal to
increase more as its economy grows.
 ""They are short of those raw materials like copper
concentrate and iron ore, so they are always going to be
requiring those,"" John Johnson, chief executive for consultancy
CRU's China operations, told an industry conference in February.
 CRU said iron ore exports from the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) exceeded $3 billion in 2010, up from
$500 million in 2007. Chinese purchases of CIS copper
concentrate approached $1 billion last year, from well below the
$500 million level four years ago.
 It also said Chinese steel demand could exceed 1 billion
tonnes by 2020, while analysts at Bateman Beijing Axis note that
China imported 70 percent of the iron ore it used to smelt its
2009 output of 568 million tonnes.

 (Adds comment, details)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Wednesday and looked set to remain pressed due to expectations
the Federal Reserve will stick with its ultra-loose monetary
policy and point to continued low interest rates.
 Sterling shot up to session highs against most major
currencies after a reading of first quarter UK growth was in
line with expectations but wrongfooted some investors who had
sold the pound on anticipation of a softer figure.
 Broad dollar weakness pushed the euro to a 16-month high of
$1.4715 while the Swiss franc scaled its strongest on record,
and analysts see the possibility for the current dollar-selling
momentum to take the euro up towards the $1.50 level.
 The Australian dollar raced to a 29-year high after consumer
price data suggested Australian rates will continue to rise,
highlighting the policy divergence between central banks which
are on a tightening path and those keeping rates low.
 Monetary policy was a key focus in the market ahead of a
rate announcement by the Fed later in the day, expected to keep
rates near zero and signal that it is in no hurry to scale back
its massive support for the economy.
 Given that central banks in Australia and the euro zone,
among others, have started to raise rates, analysts said that
the Fed's stance will keep the dollar weak as investors dump the
U.S. currency for higher-yielding ones.
 ""It's clear Fed monetary policy is the reason for dollar
weakness. If we don't get any hint that the Fed will normalise,
the dollar will continue to stay under selling pressure,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 In early European trade, the euro traded slightly higher on
the day at $1.4662.
 The pound rose more than a full U.S. cent to $1.6582 after
data showed the UK economy expanded 0.5 percent in January-March
from the previous quarter.
 While the figure was in line with consensus expectations and
signalled the Bank of England will keep interest rates low for
months to come, traders said the pound jumped after the market
had sold the currency heading into the data.
 ""Markets had been expecting something even worse, following
reports that the Chancellor George Osborne had described
economic conditions as 'difficult' following his advance viewing
of the data,"" said Rob Carnell, economist at ING.
 
 EURO RESISTANCE?
 Technical analysts say the euro faced immediate resistance
around $1.4720, a level the euro hit when it briefly spiked up
in late 2008, and $1.4775, the top of a weekly trendline channel
drawn from lows hit in February and April.
 Market participants say a sustained break above this level
would open the way to the psychologically key $1.50.
 But Karpowitz at Commerzbank said overstretched long
positions in the euro meant ""the air was getting thinner"" as the
euro extends its climb. This suggested that any correction could
come hard and fast, he added.
 The dollar skidded to a three-year low of 73.493 against a
currency basket, down close to 10 percent from its peak in
January, and many traders expect the index to eventually descend
to an all-time low hit in 2008 of 70.698.
 It hovered around 0.8750 Swiss franc, having fallen as low
as 0.8669 franc in Asian trade, while the Australian dollar shot
up as high as $1.0853.
 The yen was one of the few currencies against which the
dollar managed to gain, rising 0.8 percent on the day to 82.12
yen.
 The yen slipped after S&P downgraded its ratings outlook on
Japan's sovereign debt, but selling was light as investors are
already aware of the economic hardship the country must endure
as it recovers from last month's earthquake.

 * Says deficit cuts rewarded with ""favourable"" bond yields
 
(Adds quotes, background)
 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Data on British economic output
shows manufacturing growth is holding up, but the government
might need to take extra steps to boost still sluggish bank
lending, Business Secretary Vince Cable said.
 The Office for National Statistics said earlier on Wednesday
that Britain's economy expanded by 0.5 percent between January
and March, in line with forecasts, after contracting by the same
amount in the final three months of 2010.
 That meant the economy has stagnated since September.
 ""If you drill beneath the overall growth figures this
morning, you'll see that manufacturing growth is being
sustained, which is exactly how it should be,"" Cable told a
parliamentary committee.
 Services and manufacturing were both robust over the latest
quarter, expanding by 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
The coalition government's growth strategy was ""clearly
visible"" in recent statistics, he said. The government was being
rewarded for its efforts to cut Britain's big budget deficit
with ""favourable bond yields"".
 But access to finance was one of the ""most difficult""
constraints on growth, he said. Bank of England figures last
week showing negative lending to small businesses were ""clearly
very disappointing indeed,"" Cable said.
 Despite government attempts to stimulate lending, ""in terms
of access to finance there is still a serious problem,"" he said.
 The government finalised a deal with banks in February to
curb bonuses and boost lending to businesses.
 The deal, known as ""Project Merlin"", would see Britain's top
banks lend about 190 billion pounds ($313 billion) gross to
businesses this year, up from about 179 billion previously.
 Asked why banks were not lending to small businesses, Cable
said the banks would say they were giving priority to
strengthening their balance sheets and ""that is taking
precedence over the credit demands of the real economy.""
 He said there was a shortage of demand for credit, although
he said a lot of demand was discouraged by people being put off
from applying for loans.
 ""We have put in place a series of measures to try to counter
this. If they don't work we'll have to look at others,"" he said.

 By Gus Trompiz and Dominique Vidalon
 PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - French cablemaker Nexans said
robust volumes in its main businesses boosted sales and
profitability in the first quarter, despite rising commodity
costs and softer activity in the Middle East.
 Nexans, which reiterated targets for full-year operating
margin and sales on Wednesday, cited better profitability in the
first quarter, including improved margins in industry cables and
building.
 The company, which lost the bid battle earlier this year for
Dutch cablemaker Draka to Italian rival Prysmian, also said it
was still looking for acquisitions in the energy sector.
 First-quarter sales came to 1.75 billion euros ($2.57
billion). At constant non-ferrous metal prices, sales reached
1.129 billion euros, corresponding to underlying growth of 13
percent at constant exchange rates and scope.
 Nexans reiterated it expected underlying sales to rise more
than 5 percent this year and its operating margin to rise to 5.5
percent of sales from 4.8 percent last year.
 Chief financial officer Frederic Michelland said on a
conference call that a recovery in activities like building
would boost margins over the course of the year.
 ""There will be a ramp-up of the operating margin that will
occur from one quarter to the next,"" he said.
 Quarterly sales were boosted by a favourable comparison base
with last year when the company felt the effects of a global
economic downturn, said Michelland, estimating the base effect
accounted for about half of first-quarter growth.
 Shares in Nexans were slightly higher in morning trade in
Paris, in line with the Stoxx 600 Europe industrial goods index
, having climbed 5 percent on Tuesday on anticipation the group
would post strong first-quarter sales.
 The market consensus had called for 12.8 percent in
underlying quarterly growth, according to a Paris-based analyst.
 
 COMMODITY COSTS
 The French group said quarterly sales benefited from strong
demand for industry cables, including in the automotive and
aeronautics sectors, and a pick-up in the building sector.
 One weak spot was activity in the Middle East, where Nexans
reported in its land high-voltage business a delay in the
starting of contracts in Gulf countries and a halt to contract
execution in Libya.
 ""At group level, political events in that area have weighed
down organic growth by about 200 basis points,"" Nexans said in
its first-quarter statement.
 The company, one of the world's biggest private buyers of
copper, said it expected raw material costs to continue to rise.
 Higher copper prices coupled with strong sales growth led to
a rise in net debt to 307 million euros at the end of March,
versus 144 million on Dec. 31, although Michelland said this
represented a seasonal effect.
 Nexans generally passes on copper and aluminium costs in its
contracts with clients, but is less able to do this for
plastics.
 High crude prices meant the cost of oil-derived products
like plastics were a concern for the group, Michelland said.

 By Christina Fincher and Sven Egenter
 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Britain's economy made only a
sluggish start to 2011 as it crawled back from a slump at the
end of last year, snuffing out chances of a Bank of England rate
rise next week and hampering the government's austerity drive.
 Prime Minister David Cameron took some heart from healthy
growth in key sectors such as manufacturing, though opposition
politicians and businesses warned that spending cuts, tax rises
and high inflation would hit consumers. [ID:nLDE73Q150]
 Overall output expanded 0.5 percent in the first three
months of the year after declining by the same amount at the end
of 2010 as construction posted its biggest drop since the height
of Britain's worst recession since World War Two.
 After a solid recovery for most of the past year, Britain's
economy has effectively flatlined since September and is now
trailing well behind its developed world peers.
 ""Underlying activity in the economy remains pretty much
stagnant,"" said Capital Economics economist Vicky Redwood. ""The
economy did nothing more than reverse Q4's snow-related dip.""

 Wednesday's figures set the stage for a tough 2011 as the
government starts in earnest with a four-year programme of
public spending cuts.
 The recovery in the first quarter was weaker than either the
Bank of England or the Office for Budget Responsibility had
pencilled in and raises the risk that government tax revenues
will fall short of target.
 Most BoE policymakers want to see a sustainable recovery
before tightening monetary policy, meaning interest rates are
likely to stay at record lows at least until July despite
inflation running at twice the bank's 2 percent target.
 A Reuters poll of 62 economists taken before the GDP data
and published on Wednesday gave just a 30 percent chance the
bank would act on rates before the middle of the year, down from
45 percent in a poll taken last month. [ID:nLDE73Q0Q5]
 
 RELIEF RALLY
 Investors had already braced for a weak growth number
following dismal data on construction and consumer spending in
recent weeks.
 Sterling rallied on relief that the biggest drag to growth
had come from volatile sectors including utilities as well as
construction, and London's benchmark stock index pushed into
positive territory. [ID:nLDE73Q0X6]
""Once erratic swings in construction are stripped out, the
economy has shown underlying growth in the last two quarters,""
said Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi.
 ""This is not so bad given the heavy headwinds from fiscal
tightening and high inflation.""
 Key sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and
services grew at a healthy pace, recording progress of 1.1 and
0.9 percent respectively. Business services and finance expanded
by 1.0 percent, its best reading since 2007.
 Construction fell 4.7 percent, its biggest fall since the
height of Britain's recession in the first quarter of 2009. But
the extent of the decline, not corroborated by survey evidence,
aroused suspicions that revisions were on the cards.
 
 OUTLOOK STILL MURKY
 The government welcomed the economy's return to growth and
said the recovery was always going to be choppy. But opposition
Labour's finance spokesman Ed Balls said the government's
spending cuts were choking off the rebound.
 Business Secretary Vince Cable blamed banks' reluctance to
lend for holding up the recovery and said fresh measures may be
needed. Figures last week showing negative lending to small
enterprises were ""clearly very disappointing indeed,"" he added.
[ID:nLDE73Q0YV]
 After snow disruption at the end of 2010, effects of a late
Easter and one-off public holiday for the Royal Wedding will
continue to cloud the view of policymakers.
 One economist said there could be a decent bounce in the
second quarter. ""The details of the data suggest there should be
a significant bounce in GDP growth in Q2 to between 0.75 and 1
percent,"" said Brian Hilliard at Societe Generale.
 But evidence from the corporate sector suggested
cash-strapped Britons are becoming more price conscious.
 Discount fashion retailer Primark said on Wednesday that its
women's spring and summer ranges were selling well, with the
British High Street in better shape over the last two months,
but that it would also cut margins to absorb spiralling costs.
[ID:nLDE73P1O4]
 And as Premier Foods, the maker of Hovis bread and Bisto
gravy, cautioned that confidence remained at a ""pretty low

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2011 04:36AM ET</span>",UK economy makes feeble recovery in first quarter," LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Britain's economy recovered
only modestly at the start of the year, hindered by a sharp drop

will keep rates at record lows for some months.
 Britain's economy expanded by 0.5 percent between January
and March, in line with forecasts, after contracting by the same

 That means Britain's economy has barely grown since

drop since the first quarter of 2009 when Britain was deep in
recession.
 Services and manufacturing both posted solid growth over the
quarter, expanding by 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
 However, the recovery overall looks set to be too weak to
convince the majority of Bank of England policymakers to raise
interest rates, despite inflation running at twice the cen tral

 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar plumbed a
three-year low against other major currencies on Wednesday
before a Federal Reserve decision which is expected to reaffirm
its ultra-easy policy, while world stocks crept higher.
 The dollar skidded to 73.493 against a currency basket,
driven by widening interest rate differentials, before
recovering slightly.
 The index is now close to 10 percent below its peak in
January and many traders expect it eventually to revisit an
all-time low of 70.698 hit in 2008.
 The Fed is set to confirm it will complete its $600 billion
bond-buying programme and renew its commitment to rock-bottom
borrowing costs for ""an extended period"".
 Interest is particularly intense because Ben Bernanke will
hold the first-ever regularly scheduled news conference by a
U.S. central bank chief at around 1815 GMT.
 ""It's clear Fed monetary policy is the reason for dollar
weakness. If we don't get any hint that the Fed will normalise,
the dollar will continue to stay under selling pressure,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 While the Fed continues to print money, the European Central
Bank raised rates for the first time in two years this month and
is poised for a repeat dose before too long.
 The euro flew to a high of $1.4715 after breaking above
$1.47 for the first time since December 2009. It was last at
$1.4670, having traded below $1.29 at the start of the year.
 Within the euro zone, there was no let up for the bonds of
the bloc's high debtors as speculation that Greece will have to
restructure ran unchecked.
 Greek government bond yields surged to fresh euro-era record
peaks, with 10-year borrowing costs nearing an eye-watering 16
percent, while Portuguese 10-year yields edged up to a new high
of 10.18 percent as the country's caretaker government
negotiates on the terms of a bailout.
 
 WORLD STOCKS FIRM
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.5
percent at 1,152 points by 1100 GMT, gaining ground for the
fifth session as investors focused on strong results from
bellwethers such as Ericsson and Renault.
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly firmer start on
Wall Street, following solid company earnings on Tuesday, and
world stocks as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
were up 0.25 percent at 352.87.
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.4 percent but it could face
downward pressure after ratings agency Standard & Poor's revised
its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt to negative, a move which
caused the yen to slip.
 Aside from the ECB, Asian and Latin American central banks
have also been tightening monetary policy for some time.
 The split in monetary policy has helped revive the ""carry
trade"", in which investors borrow in a low-yielding currency to
invest in higher-yielding assets or currencies.
 Investors have been snapping up the high-yielding Australian
dollar -- against which the greenback hit a 29-year low on
Wednesday following a big jump in Australian inflation -- while
China let the yuan rise to a post-2005 revaluation high,
triggering gains in emerging Asian currencies.
 On the other hand, prospects of a near-term Bank of England
rate rise receded further after a reading of first quarter UK
growth only just reversed the previous quarter's fall.
 Sterling rose, nevertheless. Traders said the market had
positioned for a weaker reading which drove investors to quickly
cut short positions after the fact.
 
 SILVER LINING
 Silver, the superstar commodity of the year, steadied from a
three percent fall on Tuesday, its biggest one-day loss in six
weeks, which followed Monday's rally to near record levels.
 Spot silver was flat at $45.25 an ounce and is on track for
a 21 percent gain this month and a 47-percent rise this year,
making it the top performing precious metal.
 Spot gold steadied at $1,505.50 by 1100 GMT, well below
Monday's record high at $1,518.10. Brent crude for June rose 36
cents to $124.50 a barrel.
 ""Oil will continue to trade in this range till the outcome
of the Fed meeting is known at least,"" said Serene Lim, an
analyst at ANZ.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Wednesday and looked set to remain pressed due to expectations
the Federal Reserve will stick with its ultra-loose monetary
policy and point to continued low interest rates.
 Broad dollar weakness pushed the euro to a 16-month high of
$1.4715 while the Swiss franc scaled its strongest on record,
and analysts see the possibility for the current dollar-selling
momentum to take the euro up towards the $1.50 level.
 The yen slipped after S&P downgraded its ratings outlook on
Japan's sovereign debt, but overall selling was light as
investors are already aware of the economic hardship the country
must endure as it recovers from the recent earthquake and
tsunami.
 The Australian dollar raced to a 29-year high after consumer
price data suggested Australian rates will continue to rise,
highlighting the policy divergence between central banks which
are on a tightening path and those keeping rates low.
 Monetary policy was a key focus in the market ahead of a
rate announcement by the Fed later in the day, expected to keep
rates near zero and signal that it is in no hurry to scale back
its massive support for the economy.
 Given that central banks in Australia and the euro zone,
among others, have started to raise rates, analysts said that
the Fed's stance will keep the dollar weak as investors dump the
U.S. currency for higher-yielding ones.
 ""It's clear Fed monetary policy is the reason for dollar
weakness. If we don't get any hint that the Fed will normalise,
the dollar will continue to stay under selling pressure,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 In early European trade, the euro traded slightly higher on
the day at $1.4662.
 Technical analysts say the euro faced immediate resistance
around $1.4720, a level the euro hit when it briefly spiked up
in late 2008. A sustained break above this level would open the
way to the psychologically key $1.50, they say.
 The dollar skidded to a three-year low of 73.493 against a
currency basket, down close to 10 percent from its peak in
January, and many traders expect the index to eventually descend
to an all-time low hit in 2008 of 70.698.
 It hovered around 0.8750 Swiss franc, having fallen as low
as 0.8669 franc in Asian trade, while the Australian dollar shot
up as high as $1.0853.
 
 JAPAN WORRIES 
 The yen was one of the few currencies against which the
dollar managed to gain, edging up 0.3 percent on the day to
81.75 yen.
 The yen also slipped against the euro and the Australian
dollar after Standard and Poor's cut Japan's sovereign rating
outlook to negative from stable, warning that the cost to
recovery from last month's earthquake will exacerbate already
weak public finances.
 But the yen is also hovering within reach of a record high
around 77 per dollar hit in March, and market participants say
its relative resilience to the S&P move suggests the Japanese
currency may gain further versus the dollar.
 ""Today's price action of JPY (after the S&P announcement)
already goes to prove that impact on FX should also be limited,""
JPMorgan analysts said in a note.
 ""Given the weak USD and relatively better performance of
JPY, we continue to expect USD/JPY to break 80 again in the
coming weeks.""

 By Hideyuki Sano and Masayuki Kitano	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - The dollar fell
broadly on Wednesday, marking a fresh nadir against the Swiss
franc and a 29-year trough against the Australian dollar as
investors expect no surprises from the U.S. Federal Reserve's
policy meeting later in the day while the Japanese yen was
dented after Standard and Poor's cut its rating outlook on
Japan.	
 Many traders expect the dollar's index against a basket of
currencies to eventually descend to an all-time low hit
in 2008 of 70.698 after it marked a new three-year low on
Wednesday, pummelled by wide-spread expectations that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will not rush to tighten policy even after the
likely termination of its asset purchase programme in June.	
 ""In addition to the fact that U.S. rate hike
expectations are receding, the market is also looking at U.S.
debt problems as its debt ceiling is expected to be hit next
month. It's becoming hard to justify dollar buying not just from
a monetary policy perspective but also from a fiscal policy
perspective,"" said Koichi Yoshikawa, head of forex trading at
BNP Paribas in Tokyo.	
 The dollar index last stood at 73.580, after having fallen
as low as 73.493 at one point, down close to 10 percent from its
peak in January.	
 The euro flew to a high of $1.4715 after breaking
above $1.47 for the first time since December 2009. It was last
at $1.4685. The dollar slumped to an all-time low around 0.8669
Swiss francs .	
 The Japanese yen dipped from a one-month high after S&P cut
the outlook on its Japan rating to negative from stable, citing
rising costs from disaster relief efforts, although traders
think the impact will be limited.	
 ""Honestly I don't see a huge impact, because mechanically
when we look at how changes in Japanese sovereign credit impact
the market, there tends to be less pass-through to foreign
exchange than is the case for other countries because the bulk
of Japanese government securities are held by domestic banks,""
said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in Singapore.
    ""These types of announcements don't necessarily trigger a
lot of selling by foreigners (of Japanese government debt) which
might weigh on the currency,"" Elmer said.	
 Currency speculators are already short on the yen, with the
latest U.S. derivatives data showing speculators' yen net short
positions were at a one-year high of 52,983 contracts last week,
prompting some traders to warn of more upside risk for the yen.	
 ""They sold the yen on the view that monetary policy bias in
Japan is heading in the opposite direction. But they are
starting to realise the Fed's exit strategy from its easy policy
doesn't necessarily mean tightening and it is more likely to be
something of a wait-and-see, and the two-year U.S. yield seems
to be peaking,"" said Hideki Amikura, forex manager at Nomura
Trust Bank.	
 Although the yen fell briefly to 81.78 yen per dollar
, many traders expect the impact of the rating firm's move
to be short-lived as a similar step by Moody's in February had
no lasting impact. Earlier, the yen rose to a one month-high of
81.27 per dollar on the back of a fall in the two-year U.S.
Treasury yield to one-month lows ahead of the Fed's policy
announcement.
    The Fed is expected to say it is in no hurry to scale back
its massive support for economic recovery, in contrast to the
European Central Bank, which hiked rates last month and looked
poised to deliver more due to the threat of rising inflation.

 This means the dollar, like the Japanese yen, will remain a
funding currency of choice in popular carry trades that have
boosted higher-yielding currencies like the euro and Aussie
dollar.	
 The Fed post-statement is expected at 1630 GMT on Wednesday,
and Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold the first-ever regularly
scheduled news conference by the Fed chief at 1815 GMT.	
 The dollar's latest fall came even as yield spread between
two-year U.S. and German bonds have held mostly steady in the
past couple of weeks. The currency market took little notice of
skyrocketing Greek bond yields as talk of potential debt
restructuring swirls, which in turn pushed up Spain's short-term
borrowing costs. [ID:nLDE73P0VQ]	
 Nor the comment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner on Tuesday that a strong dollar will always be in U.S.
interests largely fell on deaf ears.	
 With the greenback already under so much pressure, some
traders said the dollar could see a short squeeze if the Fed did
not sound as dovish as what markets are braced for in the near
term. A sharp fall in silver this week served as a reminder on
the possibility of such a setback.	
 But many traders say the dollar's downtrend looks set to
stay.	
 ""There will be some adjustments for sure but I cannot see a
sustainable rise in the dollar at this moment,"" said BNP's
Yoshikawa.	
 The high-flying Aussie dollar reached a 29-year
high of $1.0853 after Australian consumer prices jumped by the
most in almost five years last quarter and key measures of
underlying inflation also rose faster than expected, reviving
the risk of a hike in interest rates. [ID:nL3E7FR003]

(Adds Moody's comment)	
 By Leika Kihara	
 TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - Standard and Poor's threatened
to cut Japan's sovereign credit rating again, warning the huge
cost of last month's devastating earthquake will hurt already
weak public finances unless bickering politicians can agree to
raise taxes.	
 It affirmed its long-term sovereign credit rating on Japan
at AA minus -- the lowest among the major agencies -- but
downgraded the outlook to negative from stable.	
 The change comes three months after S&P had cut Japan's
sovereign credit rating -- the first reduction since 2002 --
saying the government had no plan to deal with its mounting debt
while adding the administration's loss of an upper house
majority had compounded the problem.	
 Public debt, already twice the size of the $5 trillion
economy, is set to swell as the country faces reconstruction
costs following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that could
reach 50 trillion yen ($613 billion), S&P said.	
 ""If there are no revenue enhancing measures such as tax
increases, we expect the central and local governments to bear
most of this cost,"" the agency said.	
 However, the country's deepest crisis since World War Two
has not healed rifts between the government and the opposition,
whose majority in the upper house stands in the way of fiscal
reform.	
 In addition, Prime Minister Naoto Kan's deep unpopularity
means that even within his party, he has little room for
manoeuvre to shore up the country's public finances.	
 ""This will put more pressure on the Japanese government to
do something about revenue enhancement,"" Takuji Okubo, chief
economist at Societe Generale, said.	
 
 Still, Okubo said the S&P action could help the government's
case for fiscal reform, which centres on raising the 5 percent
consumption tax -- something acknowledged by Japan's finance
minister.	
 ""Fiscal reform is something we cannot avoid,"" the minister,
Yoshihiko Noda, said. ""The government at present is doing its
utmost for disaster relief and reconstruction. It is important
to pursue fiscal reform at the same time. We will try to gain
trust in Japan's economy and public finances in and outside
Japan.""	
 
 BUDGET DEFICIT SWELLING	
 Japanese sovereign credit default swaps were 1 basis point
wider at 77 basis points after the S&P announcement, but they
remain well off post-quake peaks near 120 basis points and a few
basis points tighter than just before the disaster.	
 The yen dipped shortly after the announcement with the
dollar climbing to an intraday high of 81.781 yen , but
analysts said the S&P move was unlikely to have much impact.	
 ""The impact on the forex market is likely to be temporary,""
said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Barclays
Capital in Tokyo.	
 Moody's Investors Service, which cut its outlook on Japan's
rating to negative from stable in February because of concerns
about the government's fiscal deficit, said on Wednesday it was
maintaining the outlook at watching developments.	
 ""We are interested in the bottom line, that's the rating
bottom line -- the government fiscal deficit and government
debt,"" said Tom Byrne, senior vice-president, in an interview.
[ID:nL3E7FR1XW]	
 Japan is not alone among industrialised countries in
confronting a swollen budget deficit.	
 Just last week S&P slapped a negative outlook on the
top-level AAA credit rating of the United States, where
lawmakers are also squabbling over how to deal with a massive
fiscal deficit. [ID:nN18195555]	
 The European Union is facing a critical test as the region
deals with its worst debt crisis since the single euro currency
was launched.	
 Japan's government has estimated that the cost of the damage
from the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami on March 11 could
reach just above $300 billion. A nuclear power crisis resulting
from the tsunami has further damaged the economy.	
 However, S&P projected reconstruction costs at between 20
trillion yen and 50 trillion yen ($245 billion to $613 billion).	
 It said if government revenues are not boosted, these costs
would add 2 percent of gross domestic product to the general
government fiscal deficit this year and 1 percent next year.
Deficits would remain above 8 percent through 2014, it said.	
 ""Much will depend on Japan's political leadership and its
ability to forge a political consensus on how to offset fiscal
measures in the future,"" S&P said.	
 Japan is expected to pass an initial 4 trillion yen ($49
billion) extra budget for disaster relief in early May that
won't entail fresh borrowing, but that is just a down payment on
the expected cost of rebuilding in Japan's devastated northeast.	
 ""Given the huge damage from the earthquake, everyone knows
that government spending will be massive,"" said Junko Nishioka,
chief economist at RBS Securities Tokyo.	
 ""We are not expecting big new government bond issuance for
the coming second supplementary budget but political deadlock is
likely to heighten the negative risk for sovereign debt.""	
 
 ECONOMY SUFFERS	
 The Bank of Japan, which reviews policy on Thursday, relaxed
its already super-loose policy just days after the disaster and
has added its voice to those calling for a more credible plan by
the government to fix the country's finances. [ID:nL3E7FR0BA]	
 Japan's reliance on domestic investors, who hold about 95
percent of the government's debt, shields it from the sort of
turmoil that has rattled high-debt euro zone countries and
explains the subdued market response to the S&P news.	
 But mounting welfare costs and shrinking savings as a result
of a rapidly ageing population raise questions of the
longer-term sustainability of Japan's debt burden.	
 ""One day there will be a more serious reaction to a more
serious warning -- but this doesn't look like that day,"" said
Rob Ryan, foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in
Singapore.	
 ""I think this was something that was inevitable after the
triple disasters.""	
 In a sign of the economic impact of the quake, tsunami and
nuclear power crisis, data on Wednesday showed retail sales fell
in March at the fastest annual pace since 1998. [ID:nL3E7FQ08E]	
 The figures provided the first clear measure of how private
consumption -- which makes up more than half of the economy --
has reacted to the disaster.	
 It also highlighted the need for the government to quickly
resolve the nuclear crisis, ensure power supply and help
manufacturers restore damaged supply chains so they can produce
more goods, economists said.	
 S&P said the downgrade of the ratings outlook
meant that a cut in the actual rating could follow over the next
two years if there is no fiscal consolidation.	
 AA minus is S&P's fourth-highest rating and puts Japan on a
par with S&P's rating for Saudi Arabia and one level below of
Spain.	
 Moody's warned in February it might cut its Aa2 rating --
its third highest -- if government policies fall short of
comprehensive tax reform.	
 Fitch Ratings has an AA rating -- the company's third
highest -- with a stable outlook.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar plumbed a
near 3-year low against other major currencies on Wednesday
before a Federal Reserve decision that is expected to reinforce
an ultra-easy policy stance and drive more capital to buoyant
emerging Asian stock markets. 
 While Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is expected to paint a
cautious picture on the economy's outlook, his Asian
counterparts by contrast are still tightening monetary policy
and using currency appreciation to check price pressures.
[ID:nN1941922]	
 That has given new legs to the ""carry trade"", in which
investors borrow in a low-yielding currency to invest in
higher-yielding assets or currencies. Investors have been
snapping up high-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar
and South Korean shares , while showing heavy
interest in an upcoming dollar bond from emerging market
favourite, Indonesia.	
 Market players also added to bearish dollar bets, especially
against the euro and the Swiss Franc , on
expectations the Fed will cling to a near-zero interest rate
policy even as it lets a $600 billion bond purchase program wind
down in June. [ID:nN1941922]	
 ""Focus will be on the inaugural press conference
and whether Bernanke is shifting along the dove-hawk scale,""
said Michael Sneyd, analyst at Societe Generale. 
 ""Attention will also be on comments for how the Fed may
respond to U.S. fiscal tightening. All-in-all, the meeting is
likely to give the green light for risk appetite and for dollar
bears to continue to be bearish.""	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, hit the lowest since
August 2008 at 73.483, before cutting some losses in Asian
trading. 
 
 
 FLOWS PICK UP	
 Asian shares rose, taking a leaf from the robust
gains posted by U.S. indices overnight that were driven by
better than expected performances from U.S. corporate
heavyweights.	
 South Korea's benchmark KOSPI index rose to a record
high for the third consecutive session before giving back some
gains as investors took some profits on automaker shares, while
Hong Kong shares rose, boosted by a broad rally in
financials.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose to its highest level since January 2008,
and was up 0.6 percent on the day. 
 Japan's Nikkei was up 1.3 percent, supported by
rebounding shares of large exporters, though could face downward
pressure after ratings agency Standard & Poor's revised its
outlook on Japan's sovereign debt to negative after the
country's triple disaster of big quake, tsunami and nuclear
crisis. [ID:nTKV006458]	
 Offshore flows into non-developed Asian markets have picked
up after a January slump, with both emerging markets equity and
bond fund groups extending their longest inflow streaks since
mid-January, according to fund tracker EPFR Global.	
 China let the yuan rise to a post-2005
revaluation high, triggering broader gains in emerging Asian
currencies. 
 Helping the case of carry trades, the Australian dollar shot
to a new 29-year peak above the $1.08 per U.S. dollar after
higher-than-expected first quarter inflation suggested the
Reserve Bank of Australia will eventually have to resume
tightening. [ID:nL3E7FR003] . 
 
 SILVER PULLBACK	
 The dollar's woes have been further compounded by a recent
drop in U.S. Treasury yields as rate traders bet that any Fed
tightening would be a slow and gradual process. 
 In Asian time, U.S. 10-year note yields hovered
just above a one-month low at 3.33 percent before the Fed
decision. Ten-year yields are down by about 30 basis points
since this month's highs.	
 In commodity markets, spot silver paused
near the $46 per ounce level after falling by nearly 5 percent
overnight.	
 High volatility and the expiry of U.S. silver options added
to the intensity of the decline of the precious metal which
nearly doubled in value between the January lows and Monday's
peak.	
 Despite the sharp pullback in silver which rippled over into
other commodities, U.S. crude  held above the $124 per
barrel line, rising from recent lows, as Libya's civil war and
violence-tinged unrest Syria and Yemen helped limit bearish
sentiment on a price slide.[ID:nLDE73P0O7] [ID:nLDE73P0KX]

 NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - World stocks surged toward
three-year highs on Tuesday and the U.S. dollar eased against
the euro as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep
its easy monetary policy in place at its meeting this week.
 Stocks rallied, with Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the
Dow Jones industrial average setting new highs for 2011, helped

 The euro advanced to a 16-month high against the dollar
with little in the way of its advance as long as the Fed still

 Investors and traders anticipate no surprises from Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke's news conference at 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT)
on Wednesday after the U.S. central bank releases its latest
policy statement and economic forecasts at 12:30 p.m. (1630
GMT).
 The briefing with reporters, at the end of a two-day
meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee,
will be the first in the Fed's 97-year history.
 Markets were buoyed by a view that, even as the Fed nears
the end of its second phase of bond buying -- a program known
as quantitative easing, or QE2 -- it will hold on to its
portfolio and its current level of monetary accommodation for
some time.
 ""There will probably not be a QE3, but they will probably
not withdraw QE2 either. They are going to leave their balance
sheet at this level for some time,"" said Constance Hunter,
chief economist of Aladdin Capital Holdings in Stamford,
Connecticut.

as much as 0.67 percent, climbing to a fresh 2011 peak of

 U.S. Treasury prices rose on expectations the Fed will keep
its near-zero interest rate policy even as it likely signals an

buttressed the bond market, pushing yields to fresh one-month

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
15/32 in price to yield 3.31 percent.

will tighten, as it is doubtful that he himself knows,"" said
Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown

 The Fed is expected to say it will complete its $600
billion bond-buying program, which is scheduled to end in June.

 If the Fed were to surprise the market and turn more
hawkish, it would pose a risk to the sizable amount of dollar
shorts in the currency market, analysts said.
 The InterContinental Exchange's U.S. dollar index <.DXY>,

 The Dow hit an intraday high at 12,613.16, while the S&P
500 reached an intraday high at 1,349.55.

 North Sea Brent ended up in volatile trading, while U.S.
crude closed pennies lower as oil investors also watched for
any signal of a change in U.S. monetary policy after the FOMC
meeting.
 Brent crude for June  gained 48 cents to settle at
$124.14 a barrel, having bounced off a $122.78 low.
 U.S. crude  for June settled 7 cents lower at
$112.21.
 Silver posted its largest one-day fall in six weeks after
having hit fresh 31-year highs in the previous session, while
gold came under pressure from investor uncertainty over the
likely course of U.S. monetary policy. [ID:nL3E7FQ06U]

(Updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro advanced to a
16-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, seemingly with
little resistance ahead, as investors bet the U.S. Federal
Reserve will lag other major central banks in raising interest
rates.
 The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making
arm, started its two-day meeting on Tuesday.
 The post-meeting news conference by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Wednesday -- the first regularly scheduled news
briefing by a Fed chief in the U.S. central bank's 97-year
history -- will be closely watched to see how the Fed plans to
exit from its ultra-loose policy.
 ""We still feel that the market is too optimistic of U.S.
growth and how soon the Fed may be required to act,"" said Bill
Chepolis, portfolio manager at DWS Investments, Deutsche Bank's
retail asset management business, in New York, who oversees
roughly $10 billion in assets.
 The European Central Bank last month raised rates for the
first time since July 2008. While some believe this may prompt
the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner, financial markets
are still in a ""carry trade"" environment, he said.
 The carry trade involves financing at low rates and
investing the proceeds in higher-yielding assets.
 This means that they still feel U.S. sectors such as
investment grade corporate bonds and high-yield credit, and
some structured asset classes offer value relative to
Treasuries.
 The euro  was last trading up 0.4 percent at $1.4638
after earlier touching a 16-month high.
 The break to a new high opens up a test toward $1.48, and
the euro could then test $1.50 in the coming weeks if Bernanke
indicates that the Fed's accommodative policy may continue for
the foreseeable future, a forex technical analyst said.
 The Fed is far more reluctant to tighten policy than the
ECB, a divergence largely driving the euro's 9.4 percent gain
in 2011.
 ""The euro bloc seems committed to making things work for
the union so we are slightly positive on those bonds especially
shorter maturity,"" Chepolis said.
 The Fed is expected to say it will stick to its plan to
complete a $600 billion bond-buying program in June. For
details, see [ID:nN1941922]
 If, however, the Fed surprises the market and turns more
hawkish it will pose a risk to the sizable amount of dollar

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2011 03:52PM ET</span>",Russia's Lisin says indifferent to strong rouble," By Gleb Bryanski
 COPENHAGEN, April 26 (Reuters) - Russia's richest man,
metals tycoon Vladimir Lisin, said on Tuesday that his business
empire was indifferent to he strengthening rouble and expressed
hope a grain export ban will be lifted soon.
 Some of Russia's most prominent business leaders raised
concern over the strong rouble at a recent meeting with Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, saying it was hurting producers and
calling for a cap.
 But Lisin, owner of Russia's fourth-largest steelmaker
Novolipetsk Steel , or NLMK, said their worries were
exaggerated.
 ""I do not believe it is a topic worth discussion now. The
strengthening of the rouble is a natural consequence of the
weaker dollar and the rise in the price of oil,"" Lisin told
reporters in Copenhagen, where he accompanied Putin.
 Lisin said that for businesses which were both exporting
and importing, the strong rouble was neutral.
 The rouble hit 2-1/2 year highs to the dollar on Tuesday
after Russian policymakers, including Putin, said controlling
inflation was a top priority.
 Lisin, who in 2010 invested 1.8 billion roubles ($64.77
million) in a new grain terminal on the Black Sea with storage
capacity of 102,000 tonnes, expressed concern with the grain
export ban which was imposed amid a devastating drought last
year and is set to be extended this year.
 ""The terminals will stand idle for now. We will have to
wait until the ban is lifted,"" Lisin said.
 Lisin said that NLMK will take a wait and see approach to
further European expansion after consolidating its ownership of
Swiss-based Duferco. He said the goal of the expansion was to
be closer to markets.
 NLMK said last week it would take full control of Duferco
for about $600 million. In Denmark, NLMK controls DanSteel.
 Lisin also said the Russian government could compensate for
an expected cut in the social tax by reducing expenditures.
 ""A cut in budget spending will compensate for a cut in
taxes on businesses. This is the sure way,"" he said.
 The government raised the social tax levied on employers
this year to plug the growing pension fund deficit, but with
parliamentary and presidential elections approaching, officials
have been talking increasingly about easing the tax burden.
 Putin is trying to balance various interests ahead of the
March 2012 vote in which he may seek a return to the
presidency.

 * Italian refiner was major trading partner with Libya
 
 (Updates with Saras statement, adds link to U.N. list, adds
links to graphic on Libya's oil and gas industry, oil factbox)
 By Jessica Donati and Emma Farge
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Libya imported gasoline from
Italian refiner Saras in early April, taking advantage of a
loophole in United Nations sanctions that permits purchases by
companies not on a U.N. list of banned entities.
 Three shipping sources with direct knowledge of the
transaction said the cargo was delivered via ship-to-ship
transfer in Tunisia before sailing to Libya.
 Saras initially declined to comment but late on Tuesday
issued a statement saying it had always acted in full compliance
with all applicable restrictive measures concerning Libya.
 Italian-flagged tanker Valle di Navarra arrived at the
Tunisian port of La Skhira on April 3 and then transferred its
cargo onto the Libyan vessel Anwaar Libya for shipment to
Gaddafi-controlled western Libya, the shipping sources said.
 The shipment is legal under U.N. sanctions against Muammar
Gaddafi's government because Libya's General National Maritime
Transport Company (GNMTC) which owns the Anwaar Libya, is not on
a U.N. blacklist.
 In its Tuesday statement, Saras denied having sold or
delivered gasoline to GNMTC.
 GNMTC is thought to be controlled by Muammar Gaddafi's son
Hannibal, who is on the U.N. blacklist of individuals subject to
travel bans and asset freezes. Doing business with GNMTC is
legal as long as there is no evidence that Hannibal Gaddafi will
directly benefit from the transaction.
 The United States, the United Nations and European Union
imposed sanctions on the Libyan government and selected Libyan
companies in late February and in March.
 Libyan efforts to import fuel were among subjects expected
to be raised in Washington on Tuesday when UK Defence Secretary
Liam Fox met his U.S. counterpart, Robert Gates.
 
 TUNISIA TRANSFER
 Reuters reported on April 20 that Gaddafi's government is
circumventing international sanctions to import gasoline to
western Libya by using intermediaries to transfer fuels between
ships in Tunisia.
 The Valle di Navarra's owner, Navigazione Montanari SPA,
said the tanker had been chartered by Saras for the voyage from
Italy to Tunisia.
 ""We can confirm the Valle di Navarra left Sarroch with a
40,000 tonne cargo and delivered it to La Skhira on April 3,""
said a source with the owner, who asked not to be named.
 Ship tracking data provided by AIS Marine Traffic showed the
ship sailed towards Tunisia at the end of March, and sailed away
from Tunisia on April 4, after a five-day interlude in which
there is no satellite tracking available.
 Saras is Italy's third-largest refiner with a 300,0000
barrel-per-day Sarroch unit on the Mediterranean island of
Sardinia. The ship returned to Sarroch on April 16, the tracking
data shows.
 Before U.N. sanctions banned transactions with Libya's
state-owned National Oil Company (NOC), the Italian refiner
regularly traded with NOC and sourced about 40 percent of its
crude supplies from the country. NOC is included in the ban.
 It is not illegal for Libya to export or import oil or
gasoline, but it is illegal to trade with NOC, making it hard
for the government to obtain vital gasoline supplies for the
country's motorists and to fuel the war against rebels.
 The gasoline delivery to Tunisia's La Skhira was one of
several ship-to-ship gasoline transfers scheduled to take place
this month, adding up to 120,000 tonnes of fuel so far in April.

 By Barbara Lewis
 MEKNES, Morocco, April 26 (Reuters) - The Moroccan
government has wrapped up its soft wheat imports a month ahead
of schedule and will rely on a local cereals harvest it expects
to rise by 18 percent, its top farming official said on Tuesday.
 Speaking on the sidelines of a farming conference in the
central city of Meknes, Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhennouch
also told Reuters the agriculture-reliant economy ""could add a
few points of extra growth"", after the announcement of a cereals
harvest forecast of 8.8 million tonnes this year.
 ""It's a very good year. We have had good weather
conditions,"" said Akhennouch, who declined to give a breakdown
per cereal variety for the harvest forecast.
 The forecast exceeds the 7.46 million tonnes of cereals
harvested last year and is also above the current budget's crop
forecast. 
 But since the majority of wheat-planted areas are small
properties owned by farmers who use the harvest for their own
subsistence, only 1.8 million tonnes of last year's harvest went
to the market, according to official statistics.
 Morocco ended up importing 5.36 million tonnes of cereals in
the ten months to end-March, which is 76 percent above the same
period in 2010. Morocco's grain import season starts in June of
each year and ends in May the following year. 
 Asked about a compensation system for soft wheat importers,
Akhennouch said: ""The import season is over. We're going to turn
to our own production.""
 The state grains agency ONICL has extended until end-April a
compensation system for importers of soft milling wheat to keep
supplies stable after a surge in grain prices. 
 The government, which subsidises flour, introduced the
system in January to give importers compensation if prices of
imported milling soft wheat exceed 2,600 dirhams ($334.6) per
tonne. 
 Morocco's soft milling wheat imports jumped to 3.02 million
tonnes in the ten months to end-March from 1.07 million tonnes a
year earlier.
 French suppliers accounted for 1.86 million tonnes of
ONICL's soft wheat buys with U.S. origins coming a distant
second with 0.37 million tonnes. 
 
 GROWTH IMPACT
 In remarks the official MAP news agency carried earlier on
Tuesday, Akhennouch said the 8.8 million tonnes forecast for the
cereals harvest this year was valid ""as of today"" unless
""exceptional"" developments occur. 
 Cereal farmers are hoping for dry weather in the weeks that
precede the start of the harvest in June.
 The 2011 budget, predicting an economic growth of 5 percent,
was based on a cereals harvest of 7 million tonnes.
 At 8.8 million tonnes, the harvest forecast is good news for
an economy where agriculture is the biggest employer.
 ""(The harvest forecast) could add a few points of extra
growth,"" Akhennouch said.
 A finance ministry official estimated at 0.5 percent the
extra GDP growth to be gained from the differential between
Akhennouch's department harvest forecast and the crop forecast
used as a basis for the 2011 budget.
 The state's High Planning Commission (HCP) last month said
Morocco's economy would grow by 4.6 percent in 2011 based on
what it described then as a ""realistic"" forecast of a cereals
harvest of 7 million tonnes.
 A harvest of 9 million tonnes will be needed to enable the
North African country to post economic growth of 5.1 percent, it
added. HCP estimated the $90 billion economy to have gained 3.3
percent in 2010 versus 4.9 percent in 2009.

 * Dollar near three-year low on trade-weighted basis
 * Dollar seen weighed down by accommodative Fed policy
(Updates prices, adds quotes)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro vaulted to a
16-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, with no respite in
sight seen for the greenback as long as the U.S. Federal
Reserve continues to lag other major central banks in raising
interest rates.
 The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy making
arm, starts its two-day meeting on Tuesday.
 The post-meeting news conference by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Wednesday -- the first regularly scheduled news
briefing by a Fed chief in the U.S. central bank's 97-year
history -- will be closely watched to see how the Fed plans to
exit from its ultra-loose policy.
 ""We still feel that the market is too optimistic of U.S.
growth and how soon the Fed may be required to act,"" said Bill
Chepolis, portfolio manager at DWS Investments, Deutsche Bank's
retail asset management business, in New York.
 The European Central Bank last month raised rates for the
first time since July 2008. While some believe this may prompt
the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner, financial markets
are still in a ""carry trade"" environment, he said.
 The carry trade involves financing at low rates and
investing the proceeds in higher-yielding assets.
 Chepolis, who oversees roughly $10 billion in assets, said
this means that they still feel U.S. sectors such as investment
grade corporate bonds and high-yield credit, and some
structured asset classes offer value relative to Treasuries.
 The euro was last up 0.3 percent at $1.4624, having earlier
touched a 16-month high of $1.4653.
 The break to a new high opens up a test toward historical
congestion at $1.48, and the euro could test $1.50 in the
coming weeks if Bernanke indicates that the Fed's accommodative
policy may continue for the foreseeable future, a forex
technical analyst said.
 The Fed is far more reluctant to tighten policy than the
ECB, a divergence largely behind the euro's 9.3 percent gain in
2011.
 ""The euro bloc seems committed to making things work for
the union so we are slightly positive on those bonds especially
shorter maturity,"" Chepolis said.
 The Fed is expected to say it will stick to its plan to
complete a $600 billion bond-buying program in June.
 ""We also continue to like credit as we view Fed policy to
be supportive of the stock market and private sector balance
sheets,"" he said.
 If, however, the Fed surprises the market and turns more
hawkish it will pose a risk to the sizable amount of dollar
shorts in the currency market.
 ""Bernanke is likely to acknowledge that dollar policy is
set by the Treasury, but the Fed takes it into account in terms
of its impact on inflation and growth and that it is part of
the transmission mechanism of monetary policy,"" said Marc
Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York.
 ""Investors are unlikely to learn from Bernanke when the Fed
will tighten as it is doubtful that he himself knows,"" he
added.
 The euro got a boost from investor relief at the sale of
close to 2 billion euros of short-term debt by Spain, wiping
away earlier losses after comments by European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet.
 The dollar index, which measures the currency's value
against six major currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 73.900.
 Traders say it could test a three-year low of 73.735 hit
last week. A break of that could open the way for a test of the
record low of 70.698 touched mid-July 2008, according to
Reuters data.
 Against the yen the dollar slipped to a four-week low of
81.56 yen, before recovering to trade at 81.90, down 0.1
percent.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.4 percent at $1.0770, very
close to its 29-year high of $1.0777 struck on Monday. It had
earlier fallen as commodities prices edged down.

 * Backed by policymakers' focus on controlling inflation
 * EconMin forecasts more appreciation

(Adds new peak, Klepach, analyst comments, closing prices)
 MOSCOW, April 26 (Reuters) - The rouble hit 2-1/2 year highs
to the dollar on Tuesday after Russian policymakers said
controlling inflation was a top priority, pointing to the
prospect of higher domestic interest rates as the U.S. currency
came under broad pressure.
 The Economy Ministry forecast up to 16 percent in further
rouble gains this year if oil prices stay around current high
levels, giving the market a further boost. [ID:nLDE73P0VE]
 The rouble firmed as far as 27.77 per dollar, its strongest
since December 2008, before trimming the day's gains to 6
kopecks to close at 27.79 . The move came as the
dollar was battered on global FX markets, sinking to its weakest
versus the euro in 16 months .
 Against the single currency, the rouble was broadly steady
at 40.65 . Versus the central bank's euro-dollar
basket it ended the day 2 kopecks stronger at 33.59 .
 A round of comments on inflation late on Monday suggested
Russian officials are shrugging off oligarchs' complaints about
the strength of the rouble, and are more focused on fighting
inflation -- cited by voters as a key concern ahead of elections
in late 2011-early 2012.
 ""It is becoming clear that not only is inflation the greater
priority but that a stronger rouble is one of the mechanisms
that will be used to try and contain inflation,"" Chris Weafer,
strategist at Uralsib, said in a research note.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the exchange rate should
be predictable and well-founded, but agreed with Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin that fighting inflation was a priority.
 ""What comes first, what comes second: what is the horse and
what is the cart? The horse -- the thing that will get us out --
is of course fighting inflation. And then comes everything
else,"" Putin said.
 The central bank said it would consider raising interest
rates at Friday's meeting and first deputy chairman Alexei
Ulyukayev also said that further increases in reserve
requirements were on the cards. [ID:nLDE73O0H4]
 Although oligarchs' complaints about the strength of the
rouble -- which is up around 9 percent versus the dollar since
the strat of 2011 -- may prompt the central bank to delay any
further steps towards greater currency flexibility, analysts do
not expect it to reverse the steps already taken.
 Oil prices -- a key source of revenues for world's top
producer and thus a major driver of Russian markets -- recovered
from earlier losses, giving further support to the rouble. [O/R]
 Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach on Tuesday forecast
that the rouble could firm as far as 24 per dollar by the end of
the year if oil prices hold at highs of $115-120 a barrel.
 However, he cautioned that this could erase Russia's current
account surplus and weigh on its manufacturers.

 * Belarus counts on $3 billion Russian loan
 * Russia says more forex flexibility is needed

(Adds details, background)
 MINSK, April 26 (Reuters) - Belarus has scrapped plans for
an extra trading session for its rouble, effectively abandoning
efforts to run multiple exchange rates as it waits for Russian
aid to stabilise the currency.
 The former Soviet republic lost a quarter of its foreign
currency reserves this year trying to plug its large trade
deficit and has pinned its hope on a $3 billion loan from Moscow
-- which analysts say is likely to come with strings attached.
 Tuesday's decision follows a de facto bar on the currency's
free float on the interbank market and appears to contradict
Russian advice on allowing more exchange rate flexibility.
 ""Currently there is no need to introduce an additional
session,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 Belarus introduced restrictions on foreign currency trading
in March after trying for a few months to support the rouble,
under pressure due to a large foreign trade deficit.
 
 POLICY U-TURN
 Last week, Belarus allowed banks to trade the rouble freely
on the interbank market where the exchange rate quickly plunged
to around 5,000 roubles per dollar compared with the official
rate of 3,048 per dollar.
 But two days later, according to market sources, the central
bank recommended banks should trade the rouble at a rate no
lower than 4,500-4,600 per dollar. Banks responded by refusing
to trade at all.
 Analysts say Belarus wants to support the rouble with
Russian money to avoid significant devaluation that would
visibly diminish the average Belarussian's wage which President
Alexander Lukashenko has promised to bring to $1,000 by 2015.
 However, prices are rising, both because importers are
buying foreign currency at ""black market"" rates and because the
government is dropping pricing regulations in an attempt to get
away from the inefficient central planning system.
 Consumer prices in Belarus were up 8.7 percent as of April
19 from December 31, 2010, beating the full-year inflation
forecast of 8.5 percent. Economy Minister Nikolai Snopkov on
Tuesday declined to provide a fresh outlook.
 ""We are working on it,"" he told reporters. ""We don't want to
make another mistake.""
 
 LONG TALKS WITH MOSCOW
 More than a month after announcing a request for Russian
loans, Belarussian Finance Minister Andrei Kharkovets said on
Tuesday he expected a deal within a week.
 ""Basically, we've agreed on a list of the steps that will be
implemented by the Belarussian side within the macroeconomic
stabilisation programme,"" he told reporters.
 However, Russia has indicated it wanted to see exchange rate
liberalisation first.
 On Monday, Russia's First Deputy Central Bank Chairman
Alexei Ulyukayev said ""a greater flexibility in forex policy""
was needed in Belarus and a decision on the loan was yet to be
made.
 Analysts say Moscow could press Minsk into selling its key
assets to Russian firms, along with other concessions.
 On Tuesday, Belarussian Communications Minister Nikolai
Pantelei said efforts to sell Belarus' stake in the country's
largest mobile operator, a joint venture with Russia's MTS, have
been unsuccessful so far.
 Belarus has offered MTS the government's 51 percent stake
for $1 billion but the company says the price is too high.
 ""The Russian partner has yet to figure out its position,""
Pantelei said.

 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Britain's economy still faces
difficulties but government policy is on the right track,
finance minister George Osborne said on Tuesday, a day before
the release of first-quarter GDP data.
 ""Clearly it is still difficult,"" Osborne told ministers at a
cabinet meeting earlier on Tuesday, a spokesman for Prime
Minister David Cameron told reporters at a regular briefing.
 Osborne has 24 hours advance access to key economic data
such as the preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP due to be

 Economists polled by Reuters have steadily downgraded their
expectations for the number, which is expected to show quarterly
growth of just 0.5 percent, after a 0.5 percent contraction in
the last three months of 2010.
 Opposition politicians have criticised Britain's governing
coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats for pressing
ahead with a rapid programme of public spending cuts at a time
when private sector demand is not secure.
 Osborne told ministers that he still believed the
government's economic policy was on the right track, Cameron's
spokesman said.

Somewhere Else - a reference to a habit of trying to be in two
places at once that encapsulates both his abilities and his
ambition.
 At international summits, according to one European
policymaker, he's known as 'Where's Mario' because ""whenever you
need him he has disappeared"" to talk to some other official or
on his cellphone.
 Soon, the 63-year old central banker and president of the
Financial Stability Board might be more readily tracked down in
the European Central Bank tower in Frankfurt.
 Tuesday's declaration of support from French President
Nicolas Sarkozy leaves Draghi looking an overwhelming favourite
to take over at the ECB when current President Jean-Claude
Trichet steps down in October.
 If he succeeds, it will be the culmination of a long career
in which he has established a position as the most respected
Italian in international economic and political circles, belying
his country's poor reputation for financial management.
 ""Of the possible candidates, he is the one who is most like
Trichet in the sense of having the capability to reach consensus
within the (ECB) Governing Council,"" said Unicredit analyst
Marco Valli. 
 A track record of monetary prudence since joining the ECB's
ratesetting body in 2006 suggests the euro zone's other
heavyweight, Germany, will follow France's lead and offer the
vote of confidence that would all but guarantee Draghi gets the
job.
 ""I don't think the easy conclusion that the ECB is going to
be less focused on price stability, on low inflation is
correct,"" said Societe Generale economist Klaus Baader. ""Draghi
has turned out lately to be one of the more hawkish members of
the Governing Council.""
 He was a lynchpin of the Italian Treasury in the early 1990s
when Italy was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism, devalued its currency and faced the real possibility
that it would be unable to join the European monetary union.
 ""When we were on the brink of a debt default in September
1992, I remember saying 'It feels like we're falling from a very
high skyscraper,'"" recalls Francesco Giavazzi, a fellow Italian
economics professor, who has often worked with Draghi since they
studied together at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
the 1970s. 
 ""He answered: 'Well maybe we'll find a net under us before
we hit the ground.'
 ""He was sure our deficit- and debt-cutting programme would
satisfy the markets, and in the end he was right."" 
 
 SUPER MARIO
 A former economics professor who has taught at Harvard and
worked at the World Bank and with investment bank Goldman Sachs,
Draghi is also at the centre of efforts to overhaul the global
banking system as head of the Financial Stability Board.
 The FSB is currently tasked with driving financial market
regulators to coordinate and prevent banks and other financial
institutions from needing taxpayer-funded bailouts as Bear
Stearns, AIG, Lloyds TSB and a host of others did in 2008. 
 As an economics professor, Draghi advised more than one of
Italy's revolving-door governments in the early 1980s, before
going to Washington for six years as an executive director at
the World Bank. On his return in 1990, he worked briefly at the
Bank of Italy as advisor to Governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi before
heading back to the Treasury in the key post of director
general, a job he kept for 10 years. 
 In this period he overhauled the Treasury's internal
structures, rewrote Italian takeover rules, and spearheaded one
of the largest privatisation drives ever undertaken in Europe.
 He was central to Italy's bid to join the first wave of euro
currency participants, helped draft the Maastricht Treaty which
set the ground rules of the new currency, and headed the
committee which prepares the agenda for monthly meetings of
economy and finance ministers. Such was his frenetic activity at
the Treasury that the Italian media dubbed him ""SuperMario"".
 ""Draghi is exceptionally smart, he's incredibly focused when
he makes a commitment and, contrary to his cold public image, he
is also very good with people and has a lively sense of humour,""
says a central bank colleague.
 A fluent English speaker, Draghi also wins wide praise among
the 60-odd central bankers, Treasury officials and regulators
from the 20 countries on the FSB.
 ""He has the ability to address problems analytically, to
look at the problems rather than the people around the problems
which many policymakers do not have,"" Giavazzi says. ""The fact
he has both policymaking and market experience is also unusual.
There are not many policymakers who have direct experience of
how a trading desk works."" 
 Such qualities may help Draghi if he follows Trichet.
 Even if he did not get the ECB post, his role at the FSB
would keep him busy. Besides the politically fraught task of
establishing a list of the world's banks genuinely considered
too big to fail, the FSB has the daunting job of driving
unprecedented reforms through an extremely divergent group of
countries in the G20.
 Draghi is not universally loved. Italian Economy Minister
Giulio Tremonti, who often takes a dismissive view of unelected
officials in positions of power, is one of the central banker's
most outspoken critics. Tremonti blames the financial crisis at
least in part on the technocrats Draghi oversees. Politicians,
and not officials, should be the ones rewriting the rules
governing global finance, Tremonti has said. 
 However, after years of sniping he surprised commentators
last year by finally praising the FSB's work, signalling that he
was ready to back his central bank chief as the ECB race
intensified.
 After four years as a Goldman Sachs vice-president from
2002-5, Draghi returned to Italy to take over the top job at the
Bank of Italy from Antonio Fazio, who had been forced out by a
corruption scandal. His international standing and open,
outward-looking approach were refreshing after Fazio's
parochialism and closed management style which had sapped the
morale of staff at the central bank.
 ""The Bank of Italy's prestige was in tatters after Fazio and
I thought it would take a generation to restore it, but then
this guy arrives with his smiling face and turned everything
around in a few months,"" says one senior Bank of Italy official.
 
 WELL CONNECTED 
 The son of a bank executive, Draghi had a comfortable
upbringing in Rome before both his parents died prematurely,
leaving him orphaned in his mid-teens along with his younger
brother and sister. The children were brought up by an aunt and
Draghi was taken under the wing of Federico Caffe, a prominent
Italian economist and university professor. 
 A scholarship student at the MIT in the early 1970s, he
studied under Nobel prize winner Franco Modigliani and Stanley
Fischer, now Israel's central bank governor. He also forged
friendships with Larry Summers, who went on to be U.S. Treasury
Secretary, and the celebrated German economist Rudy Dornbusch,
who died in 2002.
 His summit colleagues who wonder where he is say it often
turns out to be current U.S. Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner
on the other end of Draghi's cellphone.
 Married with two children and a grandfather, Draghi has a
reserved family life and is seldom seen on Rome's social scene
among the other political and business elite. Nonetheless, he is
a fastidious dresser: he buys all his shirts from the same
tailor and, no matter how cold the weather, is never seen in
public with a coat over his impeccable, black, tailor-made
suits. 
 In his dress sense, if nothing else, he is very Italian.

 By Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Britain's manufacturers made a
lacklustre start to the second quarter of 2011, with orders
unexpectedly weakening in April, a survey showed on Tuesday,
suggesting the recovery of the UK economy remains fragile.
 The figures come a day before a preliminary estimate of
gross domestic product in the first three months of this year,
expected to show the economy expanded by only 0.5 percent after
a 0.5 percent decline at the end of 2010.
 The Confederation of British Industry said its Industrial
Trends manufacturing orders balance fell to -11 in April -- its
lowest since January -- down from a three-year high of +5 set
last month.
 Economists had expected a smaller decline to +3, and June
gilt futures briefly edged up to a session high after the data.
 ""While still decent compared to long-term norms, the April
CBI industrial survey adds to recent mounting signs that the
hitherto buoyant manufacturing sector may be gradually coming
off the boil,"" said IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer.
 The survey also adds to the Bank of England's dilemma about
how to curb inflation while the economy was still shaky.
 In a sign that price pressures are continuing to build in
the economy, both the monthly and quarterly price expectations
balances in the CBI survey rose to +36 in April -- their highest
since January 1990.
 Manufacturing has been the bright spot in Britain's
recovery, but other surveys also show that the sector may be
running out of steam.
 Nonetheless, the CBI said April's reading was consistent
with a continued recovery in the sector, noting its quarterly
survey, published at the same time, was strong.
 That showed the order book balance for the past three months
rose to +20 from +18 in the January survey, its highest level
since April 1995. And output expectations for the next three
months were their strongest since April 1997.

(Recasts with more detail, economist and Greek comment)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro zone's overall
budget gap fell last year but deficits in Greece and Portugal
were higher than expected, underlining the challenges presented
by their austerity programmes.
 The 17-member euro zone is struggling to restore confidence
in its public finances and tackle a debt crisis that has forced
Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek emergency funding from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 The European Union's statistics office said the budget gap
in the euro zone in 2010 was 6.0 percent of gross domestic
product, down from 6.3 percent in 2009. Public debt, however,
rose to 85.1 percent, from 79.3 percent in 2009.
 The data from Eurostat showed that all euro zone countries
except Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Austria improved their
budget balance last year, even though debt rose in all euro zone
countries except Estonia.
 ""Collectively, the state of the public finances in the euro
zone is not as bad as in the UK, the US or Japan. The problem,
of course, is the huge divergence at national level,"" said Ken
Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas.
 Greece and Portugal were the biggest disappointments, with
their budget shortfalls higher than government estimates.
 Eurostat said Greece cut its budget gap to 10.5 percent of
GDP from 15.4 percent in 2009. The European Commission and
Athens had estimated the deficit at 9.6 percent. 
 Greek public debt rocketed to 142.8 percent of GDP, from
127.1 percent in 2009.
 The Greek finance ministry said the higher deficit was a
result of a deeper-than-expected recession and that Greece would
do everything to meet targets under its EU/IMF programme.
 ""The fact that the Greek deficit ratio for 2010 is now also
in double-digit territory should further fuel the debate about
Greek sovereign debt restructuring,"" said Ralph Solveen,
economist at Commerzbank. 
 Some German officials have said that a restructuring of the
Greek debt could be supported by Berlin, although the official
German government position is that there are no such plans.
 ""Today's figures show that a sustained stabilisation of
Greek government finances is still a very long way off,"" Solveen
said. 
 ""While last year, Greece managed to lower its deficit ratio
by just under 5 percentage points compared to 2009, many
observers doubt that such progress will be repeated in the years
ahead,"" he said.
 Eurostat said that Portugal's budget deficit was 9.1 percent
of GDP last year, rather than the 8.6 percent forecast by the
government. The final 2010 budget balance is also well above the
initial Portuguese target of 7.3 percent of GDP.
 ""Today's figures have reduced the chances for Portugal to in
fact limit its 2011 deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP,"" Solveen
said.
 ""Further austerity measures and tax hikes will be necessary
- something the IMF and the EU will likely also demand in turn
for their financial support,"" he said.
 Ireland saw its budget deficit more than double to 32.4
percent of GDP last year, from 14.3 percent in 2009, and its
debt jumped to 96.2 percent from 65.6 percent as the country had
to borrow to bail out its banking sector.

 * Bilateral trade still stuck around $1.5 bln
 * India seeking to export electricity, fuel

 By Augustine Anthony	
 ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Reuters) - Top trade officials from
Pakistan and India will open two days of talks on Wednesday to
push commercial ties, as the nuclear-armed rivals seek to build
on goodwill from last month's successful bout of ""cricket
diplomacy"".	
 While no major breakthrough seems likely, on the table would
be an Indian offer to export electricity and possibly sell
petroleum products to Pakistan, which is faced with an acute
energy crisis, officials say. 
 ""There will not be any dramatic changes, of course, but it
can help put things on the right track for further progress,"" a
Pakistani official familiar with trade negotiations with India,
said of the trade talks, their first in nearly three-and-a-half
years.	
 ""There is nothing specific on the agenda.""	
 

Trade talks are part of a 7-year-old peace process the two sides
agreed to resume in February, after the 2008 attacks on Mumbai
by Pakistan-based militants killed at least 166 people and
stalled the talks.	
 ""There will not be any substantive gains but any positive
development will help to improve the environment, and that is
essential to take up contentious issues like Kashmir,"" said
Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst.	
 After the last round of trade talks held in August 2007,
the two sides added some 136 items to their trade basket --
which now contains 1,946 goods -- before the Mumbai attacks put
the process on hold.	
 At that meeting, the two sides set a target of $10 billion
by 2010. Today, even that seems unlikely, and pledges to open
banks on both sides of the border remain only on paper.

 CRICKET DIPLOMACY 
 But a visit in March by Pakistan's Prime Minister Yusuf Raza
Gilani to India at the invitation of his Indian counterpart
Manmohan Singh to watch a cricket World Cup semi-final between
their teams raised hopes for further improvement in their ties.	
 After the Singh-Gilani meeting, dubbed ""cricket diplomacy"",
field hockey officials of the two countries are attempting to
renew ties and there is talk of more cricket matches.	
 ""We are optimistic. We are meeting after three, four years,
and hope to make progress on decisions made in the last
meeting,"" said a senior Commerce Ministry official involved in
the negotiations. ""We will push for a decision on opening bank
branches in each other countries.""	
 Pakistan would also likely discuss European Union plans to
temporarily waive duties on some Pakistani imports to help it
recover from last summer's floods, which have been frustrated by
opposition from India and other members of the World Trade
Organisation.	
 
 TRADE VS POLITICS	
 Trade ties between Pakistan and India were severed after the
1965 conflict, the second of the three full-scale wars fought
since their independence from the British colonial rule in 1947.	
 Commercial relations have since recovered, albeit slowly.
Political differences are the major hurdles. 
 India granted a Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) status to
Pakistan in 1996, but awaits a similar gesture by Islamabad,
which has linked progress on trade to progress on political
disputes, notably Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan region they
both rule in part but claim in full.	
 Pakistani officials also question the utility of MFN status,
given the balance of trade which remains heavily tilted in
India's favour, citing ""non-trade barriers"" such as quality
standards and customs procedure against Pakistani exports.	
 Indian exports to Pakistan stood at $1.2 billion while
Pakistan exports totaled about $270 million in the 2009/10
(July-June) fiscal year.	
 Unregulated and illegal trade, often routed through Dubai
and Singapore, is estimated at between $2 billion and $2.5
billion, officials say.

 * Italian refiner was major trading partner with Libya
 
 (Refiles to change byline.)
 By Jessica Donati and Emma Farge
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Libya imported gasoline from
Italian refiner Saras in early April, taking advantage of a
loophole in United Nations sanctions that permits purchases by
companies not on a U.N. list of banned entities.
 Three shipping sources with direct knowledge of the
transaction said the cargo was delivered via ship-to-ship
transfer in Tunisia before sailing to Libya.
 Italian-flagged tanker Valle di Navarra arrived at the
Tunisian port of La Skhira on April 3 and then transferred its
cargo onto the Libyan vessel Anwaar Libya for shipment to
Gaddafi-controlled western Libya, the shipping sources said.
 Saras declined to comment. 
 The shipment is legal under U.N. sanctions against Gaddafi's
government because the buyer, Libya's General National Maritime
Transport Company (GNMTC) which owns the Anwaar Libya, is not on
a U.N. blacklist.
 GNMTC is thought to be controlled by Muammar Gaddafi's son
Hannibal, who is on the U.N. blacklist of individuals subject to
travel bans and asset freezes. Doing business with GNMTC is
legal as long as there is no evidence that Hannibal Gaddafi will
directly benefit from the transaction.
 The United States, the United Nations and European Union
imposed sanctions on the Libyan government and selected Libyan
companies in late February and in March.
 Libyan efforts to import fuel may be raised at a meeting in
Washington on Tuesday when UK Defence Secretary Liam Fox meets
his U.S. counterpart, Robert Gates.
 
 TUNISIA TRANSFER
 Reuters revealed on April 20 that Gaddafi's government is
circumventing international sanctions to import gasoline to
western Libya by using intermediaries to transfer fuels between
ships in Tunisia.
 The Valle di Navarra's owner, Navigazione Montanari SPA,
said the tanker had been chartered by Saras for the voyage from
Italy to Tunisia.
 ""We can confirm the Valle di Navarra left Sarroch with a
40,000 tonne cargo and delivered it to La Skhira on April 3,""
said a source with the owner, who asked not to be named.
 Ship tracking data provided by AIS Marine Traffic showed the
Saras ship sailed towards Tunisia at the end of March, and
sailed away from Tunisia on April 4, after a five-day interlude
in which there is no satellite tracking available.
 Saras is Italy's third-largest refiner with a 300,0000
barrel-per-day Sarroch unit on the Mediterranean island of
Sardinia. The ship returned to Sarroch on 16 April, the tracking
data shows.
 Before U.N. sanctions banned transactions with Libya's
state-owned National Oil Company (NOC), the Italian refiner
regularly traded with NOC and sourced about 40 percent of its
crude supplies from the country. NOC is included in the ban.
 It is not illegal for Libya to export or import oil or
gasoline, but it is illegal to trade with NOC, making it
difficult for the government to obtain vital gasoline supplies
to fuel the war against rebels.
 The gasoline delivery to Tunisia's La Skhira was one of
several ship-to-ship gasoline transfers scheduled to take place
this month, adding up to 120,000 tonnes of fuel so far in April.

(Adds details, fresh quote)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 16-month high
against the dollar on Tuesday, helped by demand from sovereign
investors, with expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will
keep policy accommodative likely to see it gain more.
 The euro also got a boost from a good response to a sale of
short-term debt by Spain. That helped wipe away losses made
earlier in the day after some investors used comments from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on the need
for a strong dollar as an excuse to cut long euro positions.
 Many traders said the dollar would remain under pressure
from the perception the U.S. central bank is far more reluctant
to tighten its policy any time soon -- compared to an ECB that
has already begun to raise interest rates
 ""Any rise in the dollar is a good opportunity to sell it
since it should remain weak unless the Fed signals it wants to
tighten monetary policy,"" said Adam Myers, senior forex
strategist at Credit Agricole. 
 ""We do not see (Fed chief) Bernanke doing that tomorrow.""
 The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.4645, having hit a
16-month high of $1.4653. It bounced from a session low of
around $1.4494 on steady buying by Middle East investors and
Asian central banks, traders said. Sizeable options expiry at
$1.4600 on Tuesday could influence trade, some dealers said.
 The euro has gained 9.5 percent this year and the pull back
earlier in the session was seen as a temporary corrective move.
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
speculators' long positions in the currency were still near a
three-year high on the Chicago futures exchange.
 The euro zone's problems with sovereign debt are a key risk
factor but analysts said in a market where higher yields were
driving trade, the euro could be in a position to test the $1.50
mark in the coming weeks.
 Spain sold three- and six-month Treasury bills on Tuesday,
drawing solid interest from investors, but the cost of borrowing
jumped by around half a percentage point.. 
 The sale came after euro zone peripheral debt was pressured
across the board last week due to growing talk that Greece would
restructure its public debt. 
 ""Investors are right now concentrating on the Spanish
bid-to-cover ratios, but the yields are also rising,"" said
Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS. ""As the euro eyes the
$1.50 mark, we will tend to be cautious.""
 
 FOMC MAY NOT HELP DOLLAR
 Some market players said the euro's drop earlier and the
dollar's brief rise were mainly due to investors trimming their
positions ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting that starts
on Tuesday.
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 73.827, very close to a three-year low of 73.735
hit last week.
 The Fed is expected to say on Wednesday it will stick to its
plan to complete a $600 billion bond-buying programme in June, a
factor that has been at the heart of the dollar's recent
fragility.
 The post-meeting news conference by Chairman Ben Bernanke on
Wednesday will be the first regularly scheduled briefing by a
Fed chief in the bank's 97-year history. 
 Traders expect Bernanke to avoid dropping any hints of an
immediate plan to tighten policy and Citi said in a note that
those looking for a Fed-driven interruption in the dollar's
downtrend may be disappointed.
 ""The Fed is unlikely to directly oppose dollar weakening;
Fed hawkishness cannot be relied upon to support (the) dollar
since global yields have tended to at least keep pace with
higher U.S rates during periods of rising risk appetite. The
dollar is still not the currency of choice,"" it said.
 It added that risks stemming from short dollar positioning
were overstated.
 Against the yen the dollar slipped to a four-week low of
81.56 yen, before recovering to trade at 81.75 yen in European
trade.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent to $1.0754 very
close to its 29-year high of $1.0777 struck on Monday. It had
earlier fallen as commodities edged lower.

 By Yoo Choonsik	
 SEOUL, April 26 - South Koreans expect inflation to remain
at the top end of the central bank's target over the next year,
indicating it has failed to dampen concerns over rising prices,
as authorities looked set to take action to curb the rising won
currency and a surge in foreign debt.	
 Consumers' inflation expectations -- the median inflation
forecast for the next year -- rose to 4.0 percent in April, a
22-month high, from 3.8 percent in a March survey, the central
bank said on Tuesday.	
 The top end of the central bank's inflation target is 4
percent.	
 ""These indicators ... back the consensus view that more
interest rates may be needed to contain inflation expectations,""
said Kim Jin-seong, an economist at Hanwha Securities. 
 The central bank left interest rates unchanged at its April
meeting despite clear signs of unease among its members over
mounting inflation, which raced to a 29-month high of 4.7
percent in March.	
 Minutes of its March meeting, also released on Tuesday,
showed policymakers believed that delaying a rate hike ""would be
a very dangerous policy decision"".	
 At that meeting, the policy board voted 4-1 to raise rates
by a quarter point to 3.0 percent. One policymaker
who was not identified in the documents warned the annual
inflation rate ""could soon rise above 5 percent.""	
 While some traders maintain the central bank has been
sending confusing signals about its intentions, other market
watchers believe Seoul recently opted for a more direct tactic
to contain price pressures, grudgingly allowing the won to rise
to curb imported inflation.	
 But authorities now appear to be readying to apply the
brakes on the won, fearful that speculation on further won gains
is creating a potentially destabilising surge in short-term
foreign debt.	
 Banks have been borrowing to fund forward foreign exchange
deals with local exporters.	
 Two sources with direct knowledge of the plans told Reuters
that South Korea will likely trim the ceilings on banks' foreign
exchange derivatives positions by at least one-fifth after an
inspection of banks is concluded next week. [ID:nL3E7FQ0UO]	
 ""Once the government were to change them, the ceilings will
likely be (reduced to) 200 percent and 40 percent as widely
expected in the markets,"" said one source, compared with 250
percent of equity set for foreign bank branches and 50 percent
for domestic banks.	
 The won suffered its worst daily loss on Tuesday in
two weeks after the moves were mooted.	
 The won has jumped around 5 percent against the dollar in
less than a month to hit a 31-month high last week but has since
then retreated slightly, partly on talk of massive dollar-buying
intervention aimed at stopping the surge.	
 South Korea is inspecting currency derivative trades by four
banks -- including two foreign bank branches -- and looks close
to trimming by at least one-fifth the maximum amount of
derivatives each bank can carry.	
 
 CONSUMER SENTIMENT IMPROVES	
 Despite the growing worries that high inflation will persist
well into next year, other data on Tuesday showed consumers may
be more resilient than first thought.	
 The central bank's consumer sentiment index, which measures
how South Koreans assess the economic outlook and their future
living standards, rose to 100 in April after hitting 98 in
March, when the reading was at its lowest since April 2009.	
 The index reversed a four-month falling streak since hitting
110 in November last year. A reading above 100 means those
consumers who were optimistic about the future economy and
living standards outnumber the pessimists.
 Analysts said the survey results underscored the market's
view that the Bank of Korea would deliver a fifth interest rate
increase as early as next month, despite its reluctance to back
a rise in April.	
 South Korea has Also frozen public utility charges,
pressured refiners to cut fuel prices and removed tariffs on
some meat imports to contain inflation. 
 The consensus view among economists is for another rate
raise in May or June and one more later in the year, taking the
benchmark rate to 3.5 percent.

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro jumped on Tuesday
ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting expected to give no hint
of looming policy tightening while silver tumbled after soaring
to near record highs, dragging gold and oil with it.
 The euro rose to a 16-month high against an under-pressure
dollar, climbing around half a percent to $1.4653, with
expectations the Fed will keep policy loose likely to see it
hover near recent peaks.
 A solid Spanish debt auction also lent support.
 ""Any rise in the dollar is a good opportunity to sell it
since it should remain weak unless the Fed signals it wants to
tighten monetary policy,"" said Adam Myers, senior forex
strategist at Credit Agricole. ""We do not see Bernanke doing
that tomorrow.""
 Investors are transfixed by the Fed's meeting, which kicks
off later on Tuesday, particularly since after its decision on
Wednesday Ben Bernanke will give the first scheduled news
briefing by a Fed chief in the bank's 97-year history.
 While the Fed is still in the process of buying bonds with
newly-printed money, the European Central Bank raised rates from
a record low to 1.25 percent earlier this month and is expected
to repeat the move before long.
 The euro got a further leg up after Spain saw strong demand
at auctions of short-term Treasury bills, although it came at a
cost of higher yields.
 Peripheral euro zone bonds have been rattled by escalating
speculation that Greece will have to restructure its debt,
although Europe's single currency -- driven by interest rate
differentials -- has proved largely immune to the troubles.
 The premium investors demand to hold Greek government bonds
rather than benchmark German Bunds rose to a new euro-era high as
investors continued to price in a restructuring of its debt.
 Greek credit default swaps also rose sharply to 1,340 bps,
up 37 bps from Monday's New York closing level.
 ""Spain should be treated differently to the other three
peripherals (Greece, Ireland and Portugal),"" said Nick
Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital Markets.
 ""But the market is still very nervous about Greece so it's
still very difficult to see any significant decline in yields
there any time soon.""
 After a four-day Easter break, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of
top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,145. Traders said
risk appetite was shrivelling ahead of the Fed meeting and gains
were capped by mining companies hit by the sharply lower metals
prices.
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a small rise -- of a similar
magnitude to Europe's -- on Wall Street.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
edged up 0.1 percent to 350.35.
 
 SILVER RIPPLES
 With most investors reluctant to move boldly ahead of the
U.S. central bank's pronouncement, the big market move came in
precious metals.
 Spot silver shed nearly 5 percent to $44.61 an ounce at one
point, having rocketed to $49.31 an ounce late in New York on
Monday, within touching distance of the $49.48 record hit in
January 1980.
 The drop in silver, although it later found a footing,
helped curb gold and oil.
 U.S. crude futures were trading 0.2 percent lower at $112.04
a barrel, with upside capped by the fall in silver and by a
remark from Saudi Arabia that the world's top oil exporter was
concerned about the economic impact of expensive oil.
 Gold dropped to $1503.90 after a seven-day record-setting
rally that pushed prices to $1,518.10 on Monday.
 ""The rally has been strong, it's not surprising to see
profit-taking ahead of the FOMC meeting,"" said Peter Fertig, a
consultant at Quantitative Commodity Research.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro recovered against the
dollar on Tuesday, helped by demand from sovereign investors,
with expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep policy
accommodative likely to see it hover near its recent peaks.
 Some investors had earlier used comments from European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on the need for a
strong dollar as an excuse to cut long euro positions.
 But many traders said the dollar would remain under pressure
from the perception the U.S. central bank is far more reluctant
to tighten its policy any time soon -- compared to an ECB that
has already begun to raise interest rates
 ""Any rise in the dollar is a good opportunity to sell it
since it should remain weak unless the Fed signals it wants to
tighten monetary policy,"" said Adam Myers, senior forex
strategist at Credit Agricole. 
 ""We do not see (Fed chief) Bernanke doing that tomorrow.""
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4595, not far from a
16-month high of $1.4649 hit last week. It gained from a session
low of around $1.4494 on steady buying by Middle East investors
and Asian central banks, traders said.
 The euro has support at $1.4486, a weekly high hit earlier
in April, but more significant support levels are further away.
One such support lies at $1.4403, the 50 percent retracement of
the euro's rally to $1.4969 from $1.4156.
 The euro has been rising this year and was seen due for a
pull-back. Data from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators' long positions in the currency were still
near a three-year high on the Chicago futures exchange.
 Indeed, some market players said the euro's drop earlier and
the dollar's rise was mainly due to investors trimming their
positions ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting that starts
on Tuesday.
 ""Basically, today's price action is just a matter of people
squaring up ahead of the FOMC,"" said Mirza Baig, senior currency
strategist with Deutsche Bank in Singapore.
 The euro zone's problems with sovereign debt are also a key
risk factor. Spain will sell three- and six-month Treasury bills
on Tuesday and investors will watch for signs of weakness after
peripheral debt came under pressure across the board last week
on growing talk that Greece would restructure its public debt.
 The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies to
73.945, off a three-year low of 73.735 hit last week.
 
 FOMC MAY NOT HELP DOLLAR
 The Fed is expected to say on Wednesday it will stick to its
plan to complete a $600 billion bond-buying programme in June,
factor that has been at the heart of the dollar's recent
fragility.
 The post-meeting news conference by Chairman Ben Bernanke on
Wednesday will be the first regularly scheduled briefing by a
Fed chief in the bank's 97-year history. 
 Traders expect Bernanke to avoid dropping any hints of an
immediate plan to tighten the bank's policy and Citi said in a
note that those looking for a Fed-driven interruption in the
dollar's downtrend may be disappointed.
 ""The Fed is unlikely to directly oppose dollar weakening;
Fed hawkishness cannot be relied upon to support (the) dollar
since global yields have tended to at least keep pace with
higher U.S interest rates during periods of rising risk
appetite. The dollar is still not the currency of choice,"" it
said.
 It added that risks stemming from short dollar positioning
were overstated.
 Against the yen the dollar slipped to a four-week low of
81.56 yen, before recovering to trade at 81.77 yen in European
trade.
 The Australian dollar was down 0.1 percent to $1.0712 as
commodities faltered, with spot silver tumbling by more than 4
percent at one point after having risen to within a whisker of a
1980 record high the previous day.

high

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 26 (Reuters) - Silver tumbled on Tuesday
and Asian shares pulled back from recent three-year highs in a
bout of profit-taking before the Federal Reserve meeting this
week where investors are seeking clues on when it plans to begin
exiting its ultra-easy monetary policy. 
 The drop in silver, triggered by an options expiry later in
the day, spread to the gold and oil markets with U.S. crude
futures dropping more than a $1 after Saudi Aramco's chief
executive said the kingdom was not comfortable with current oil
prices. [ID:nL3E7FQ09J]	
 ""There is some risk reduction because the market wants to
watch if Bernanke will say anything about a change of stance,""
said Tetsu Emori, a Tokyo-based commodities fund manager at
Astmax Investments.	
 ""Any change of stance is highly unlikely."" 
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold the first news
conference ever by a Fed chief after the two-day policy
committee meeting ends on Wednesday.	
 The euro also slipped after European Central Bank
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said that a strong dollar is in the
interest of the United States, though the prospects of widening
interest rate differentials between the Fed and the ECB may
check losses for the single currency.[ID:nEBE7DA00T]	
 Equity markets across the region were in the red with
Japan's Nikkei ending down more than 1 percent. Shares
outside Japan , which last week hit their highest
level since early 2008, were down about 0.8 percent.	
 European shares were set to start weaker, tracking falls on
Wall Street and in Asia, with key indices set to open 0.3-0.5
percent lower. [ID:nLDE73K1C7]

 Credit markets, too, reflected the overall cautious
sentiment with credit spreads widening slightly as the broader
market was wary of a heavy pipeline after a recent flood of
issuances.	
 Issuance of dollar-, euro- and yen-denominated bonds from
Asia ex-Japan have already exceeded $30 billion year-to-date,
clearly ahead of the pace set in 2010, which saw record issuance
of more than $83 billion.	
 
 AND THE WINNER THIS MONTH IS..	
 South Korea's KOSPI dipped 0.4 percent after hitting
yet another record high earlier, though it is set to outperform
regional indices in a big way this month.	
 The KOSPI's near 5 percent rise in April has been led by
automakers and chipmakers with the former benefiting from the
production hit suffered by Japanese competitors in the wake of
last month's earthquake and tsunami and the latter getting a
boost from strong earnings by Intel and Apple.	
 While the broader market appeared overbought on some
technical indicators, automakers offered attractive valuations,
with Hyundai Motor shares trading at 10 times its 12-month
forward price earnings multiples, compared with Toyota's
around 21, according to Starmine data. 
 
 EXTENDED PAUSE	
 In currency markets, the greenback came under a bit of
selling pressure versus the yen in early trade but losses
were limited on expected dollar demand from Japanese asset
management firms as a number of investment trusts, or toushin,
are due to be launched on Tuesday. 
 Trade was volatile as investors were reluctant to
make big bets before the April 26-27 Federal Open Market
Committee meeting while rate markets reflected that any
tightening measure was going to be a long slow grind.

 In fed fund futures markets <0#FF:>, the contract expiring
in December 2011 has fully priced in a target interest rate of
0.25 percent, the top end of the central bank's current rate
range of zero to 0.25 percent but the January 2012 contract only
implied a slim 6 percent chance of another hike to 0.5 percent.	
 Such bets on a glacially slow increase in rates have kept
traders interested in buying U.S. Treasuries, pushing the
10-year U.S. yield down more than 20 basis points from this
month's highs of 3.36 percent, despite a recent warning of a
ratings cut by ratings agency Standard & Poor's.

 TOKYO, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Tuesday after European Central Bank Governor
Jean-Claude Trichet said he shares the view that a strong dollar is in the interest of United
States, a comment taken by some market players as showing frustration over the dollar's
relentless fall and also an attempt to talk up the currency.
 Trichet also told two Finnish newspapers he does not see any significant second-round
inflation, prompting traders to dump euro long positions against the dollar, although many
traders think the dollar will remain under pressure from a perception that the U.S. central bank
is far more reluctant to tighten its policy any time soon. [ID:nEBE7DA00T]
 ""I don't take it lightly that Trichet is talking about the dollar rather than the euro.
European policymakers became alarmed when the euro rose above $1.45 in 2007 and they started to
rein in the dollar's fall,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ, adding that the world's policy-makers are increasingly worried about the dollar's fall.
 ""In the Group of Seven (G7) statement right after the dollar index hit a record low in March
2008, the G7 said it was concerned about currency moves. The U.S doesn't necessarily want to
cheapen the dollar against the euro and the yen. Its target is China. So I wouldn't be surprised
if there were international moves (to stem the dollar's fall),"" he added.
 The euro  fell 0.3 percent to $1.4532, slipping further from a 16-month high of
$1.4649 hit last week. The euro has support at $1.4486, a weekly high hit earlier in April, but
more significant support levels are further away. One such support lies at $1.4403, the 50
percent retracement of the euro's rally to $1.4969 from $1.4156.
 The euro has been rising this year and was seen due for a pull-back.
 Data from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed speculators' long positions in

to investors trimming their positions ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting

 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies to 74.190 <.DXY>, pulling
away from a three-year low of 73.735 hit last week, and also rose against some emerging Asian
currencies. The dollar climbed 0.3 percent versus the Indonesian rupiah to 8,650 , on
track for its biggest one-day percentage rise since late November. [ID:nL3E7FQ05J]
 The dollar gained ground against the Australian dollar, which fell 0.3 percent to $1.0691
 as commodities faltered, with spot silver tumbling by more than 4 percent at one point
 after having risen to within a whisker of a 1980 record high the previous day. [GOL/] 
 ""Basically, today's price action is just a matter of people squaring up ahead of the FOMC,""
said Mirza Baig, senior currency strategist with Deutsche Bank in Singapore, adding that
Trichet's earlier comments regarding the risks of second-round inflation did not seem
particularly new.
 ""I think it's basically just confirming what he said before, that you can't take a
tightening cycle from the ECB for granted. They will sort of tighten according to how data is
coming out,"" Baig said.
 Despite the dollar's gain on Tuesday, many market players think the U.S. currency will
remain fragile given the perception that the Federal Reserve will be in no rush to unwind its
easy monetary policy.
 The Fed is expected to say it will stick to its plan to complete a $600 billion bond-buying

surprising, which will give the market a fresh impetus to sell the dollar,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank. 
 Against the yen the dollar slipped to a four-week low of 81.56 yen . The yen had been
sold earlier this month as traders think quake-stricken Japan is even less likely than the
United States to tighten its monetary policy for the foreseeable future. It was the only major
currency on which speculators held a short position against the dollar last week, based on CFTC
data.
 After trimming some of its losses against the yen, the dollar stood at 81.69 yen ,
down 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro retreated on
Tuesday, though losses are seen as limited, while Asian shares
pulled back from recent three-year peaks before this week's
Federal Reserve meeting where investors will hunt for clues on
when it plans to exit ultra-easy monetary policy.	
 Commodity prices too succumbed to a bout of
profit-taking after silver fell more than 1 percent when
it failed to break key technical resistance levels. Analysts
said the sell-off spilled over into other commodities including
oil, despite violent protests in Syria. 
 The single currency took a knocking after European
Central Bank Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said he shares the
view that a strong dollar is in the interest of United States,
though the prospects of widening interest rate differentials
between the Fed and the ECB may check losses.[ID:nEBE7DA00T]	
 ""I don't take it lightly that Trichet is talking about the
dollar rather than the euro. European policymakers became
alarmed when the euro rose above $1.45 in 2007 and they started
to rein in the dollar's fall,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior
analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding that
policymakers globally are increasingly worried about the
dollar's fall. 
 Equity markets across the region were largely subdued with
Japan's Nikkei down about one percent. Shares outside
Japan , which last month hit their highest level
since early 2008, were down about 0.5.	
 
 
 Credit markets too reflected the overall cautious sentiment
with credit spreads widening slightly as the broader market was
wary of a heavy pipeline after a recent flood of issuances.	
 Issuance of dollar-, euro- and yen-denominated bonds from
Asia ex-Japan have already exceeded $30 billion year-to-date,
clearly ahead of the pace set in 2010, which saw record issuance
of more than $83 billion.	
 
 AND THE WINNER THIS MONTH IS..	
 South Korea's KOSPI dipped slightly after hitting
yet another record high earlier, though it is set to outperform
regional indices in a big way this month.	
 The KOSPI's more than 5 percent rise in April has been led
by automakers and chipmakers with the former benefiting from the
production hit suffered by Japanese competitors in the wake of
last month's earthquake and tsunami and the latter getting a
boost from strong earnings by Intel and Apple.	
 That has attracted chunky offshore flows. Foreign investors
were buyers of a net 124.2 billion won ($114.9 million) worth of
stocks on Monday, purchasing for a fourth straight session.

 EXTENDED PAUSE	
 In currency markets, the greenback came under a bit of
selling pressure versus the yen in early trade but losses
were limited on expected dollar demand from Japanese asset
management firms as a number of investment trusts, or toushin,
are due to be launched on Tuesday. 
 Trade was volatile as investors were reluctant to
make big bets before the April 26-27 Federal Open Market
Committee meeting while rate markets reflected that any
tightening measure was going to be a long slow grind.

 In fed fund futures markets <0#FF:>, the contract expiring
in December 2011 has fully priced in a target interest rate of
0.25 percent, the top end of the central bank's current rate
range of zero to 0.25 percent but the January 2012 contract only
implied a slim 6 percent chance of another hike to 0.5 percent.	
 Such bets of a slow increases in rates have kept traders
interested in buying U.S. Treasuries, pushing the 10-year U.S.
yield down more than 20 basis points from this month's highs of
3.36 percent, despite a recent outlook downgrade by ratings
agency Standard & Poor's.	
 Silver, which has nearly doubled from the January lows, fell
after the CME raised COMEX 5000 Silver <0#SI:> maintenance
margins for speculators by nearly 10 percent.[ID:nL3E7FP2EW]

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - A selloff in silver sparked
by its failure to breach a 30-year record high contributed to
an easing in oil prices on Monday, while Wall Street faltered
on discouraging corporate earnings forecasts.
 Trading in many markets was thin, with investors uncertain
whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal a change in its
easy monetary policy after a two-day meeting of U.S.
policymakers that concludes on Wednesday.
 The euro rose against the dollar in a volatile but illiquid
session. Traders fear the dollar could test an all-time low
against a basket of currencies this week if the Fed keeps
monetary policy loose. For details, see [ID:nN25207393]
 The euro  was up 0.13 percent at $1.4574.
 Commodities slipped after establishing multiyear records or
new all-time peaks.
 Silver surged as much as 8 percent before sharply pulling
back when the metal failed to pierce the all-time high from
1980 and unleashed a wave of technical selling amid record
volume in futures contracts. [ID:nL3E7FP00P]
 Oil prices fell after U.S. crude touched its highest level
since September 2008, with investors taking profits on the
selloff in silver. [ID:nL3E7FP099]
 Oil and other commodities rose earlier in the session on
inflation fears and as markets eyed continued unrest in Libya,
the Middle East and Nigeria.
 ""Silver's selloff spilled over to crude markets and traders
took profits,"" said Dan Flynn, an analyst at PFGBest Research
in Chicago.
 Brent crude for June delivery  fell 33 cents to
settle at $123.66 a barrel.
 U.S. crude  for June dipped 1 cent to settle at
$112.28, retreating from an early $113.48 peak, the highest
intraday price since September 2008.
 Spot silver  fell from a session high of $49.31 an
ounce but later edged higher.
 U.S. silver futures  had jumped to a intraday high of
$49.82, short of the record $50.35 hit in January 1980.
 Spot gold  rose to a record high of $1,518.10 an
ounce and fell in tandem with silver to $1,510.60 an ounce.

 Copper prices closed with steep losses as the near-term
U.S., UK and Chinese economic outlooks offer little incentive
to push industrial metals beyond their current lofty levels.

 U.S. stocks fell on signs that higher raw material costs
were constraining some corporate outlooks, including
Kimberly-Clark Corp . [ID:nN25209104]
 The company cut the low end of its full-year outlook,
saying the cost of pulp and other goods were rising more than
twice as much as it had expected. [ID:nN25143359]

points, or 0.21 percent, at 12,479.88. The Standard & Poor's

1,335.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 5.72 points,
or 0.20 percent, to 2,825.88.
 A more tempered view of economic growth was taking hold
across many markets, with higher U.S. gasoline prices seen as a
damper for consumer spending.
 ""(There's a) fundamental bias that the data is indeed
slowing and higher gas prices will take their toll on the
consumer,"" said David Ader, senior government bond strategist
at CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Connecticut.
 U.S. government debt prices rose, helped by the view that
even as the Fed approaches the end of its bond-buying program,
it will hold onto its portfolio -- and thus its current level
of monetary accommodation -- for some time. [ID:nN25417701]
 The U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was up
8/32 in price to yield 3.36 percent.
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.04 percent at 74.023.
Against the Japanese yen, the greenback  was down 0.13
percent at 81.72.
 If the Fed turns more hawkish, it poses a risk to the
sizable amount of dollar shorts in the market.
 Currency speculators pared bets against the dollar for a
fourth straight week, according to data from the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission released on Friday, but were still
net short to the total of $24.36 billion. [ID:nN25194222].

 * Effect more than Kyoto greenhouse cuts
 * Masks rising emissions in consumer nations
 
 By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
 OSLO, April 25 (Reuters) - The shift in manufacturing to
emerging nations is doing more to curb rich countries'
greenhouse gas emissions than measures they are taking to meet
the U.N. pact to fight climate change, a study showed.
 Rich nations benefit from U.N. rules which record greenhouse
gases -- mainly from burning fossil fuels -- as those coming
from each country's territory. Emissions to make a car in South
Korea, for instance, remain South Korean even if the car is
exported to the United States.
 So the transfer of the manufacture of goods such as
televisions, fridges, steel or clothing to nations such as China
or India has masked rising emissions since 1990 in developed
nations where many of the products are consumed, the study said.
 ""If you look at territorial emissions you are only looking
at half the picture,"" Glen Peters, lead author at the Center for
International Climate and Environmental Research -- Oslo, told
Reuters of the study published late on Monday.
 The report, by experts in the United States, Germany and
Norway, said the hidden net emissions' transfers via trade from
emerging nations to rich countries surged to 1.6 billion tonnes
of carbon dioxide in 2008 from 400 million in 1990.
 Recent levels far exceed curbs by developed countries of
about 700 million tonnes a year under the United Nations' Kyoto
Protocol, the main pact for curbing global warming until 2012.
 Kyoto obliges almost 40 industrialised nations to cut their
territorial emissions by at least 5.2 percent below 1990 levels
from 2008 to 2012 as a tiny step to avert more droughts, floods,
heatwaves and rising sea levels.
 
 STABLE OR CUT
 ""Developed countries with emission commitments under Kyoto
have reported stabilised emissions from a territorial
perspective since 1990,"" Peters said. ""But when you include
imports, emissions are increasing.""
 ""And the opposite happens in emerging countries. China's
consumption has increased quite a lot but their territorial
emissions are increasing far less,"" he said. Emerging nations
have no obligations to cut emissions by 2012 under Kyoto.
 Based on territorial emissions, China was the top emitter in
2008 ahead of the United States, India, Russia and Japan, it
said. Including consumption, the United States was top ahead of
China, India, Japan and Russia.
 The scientists, writing in the U.S. journal Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, urged a shift in U.N.
accounting to reflect consumption, or the ""carbon footprint"" of
each nation, rather than production.
 ""We suggest that countries monitor emission transfers via
international trade, in addition to territorial emissions,"" they
wrote.
 Overall, by U.N. accounting measures, world carbon dioxide
emissions leapt to 30.3 billion tonnes in 2008 from 21.9 billion
in 1990. Emissions by developed nations largely stabilised
during the period while those of poor nations doubled.
 Overall, emissions from the production of exported goods and
services accounted for 26 percent of world emissions of carbon
dioxide in 2008, it said.
 That is more than emissions caused by tropical deforestation
-- a major theme in world talks on a new deal to succeed Kyoto
while the impact of trade is largely overlooked, Peters said.

(Updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Monday in a volatile but illiquid session with
investors reluctant to make large bets in case the U.S. Federal
Reserve shows no sign this week of changing its easy monetary
policy.
 With many markets closed for the Easter holiday and no
major U.S. economic reports on the calendar, the Fed's meeting
on Tuesday and Wednesday will be the key event risk this week
as traders try to gauge the direction of U.S. policy.
 Market participants will look to the post-meeting news
conference by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday -- the
first regularly scheduled news briefing by a Fed chief in the
U.S. central bank's 97-year history -- to see how the Fed plans
to exit from its ultra-loose policy.
 If the Fed surprises the market and turns more hawkish it
will pose a risk to the sizable amount of dollar shorts in the
market.
 Currency speculators pared bets against the U.S. dollar for
a fourth straight week, according to data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission released Friday, but were still net
short to the total of $24.36 billion. For details, see
[ID:nN25194222]
 ""The united currency is unlikely to move very far in either
direction until the chairman of the Federal Reserve has
completed his first-ever press briefing"" after the rate
announcement by the policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee, said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst, FX
Solutions, LLC in Saddle River, New Jersey. ""The questions
surrounding the twin topics of quantitative easing and rate
policy should be enough to keep traders on the sidelines until
then.""
 The dollar index, which measures the currency's value
against six major currencies, was little changed at 74.024
<.DXY>. However, many traders say it could test a three-year
low of 73.735 hit last week. A break of that level could open
the way for a test of the record low of 70.698 touched mid-July
2008, according to Reuters data.
 If Bernanke indicates that the Fed's accommodative policy
may continue for the foreseeable future, the dollar will likely
see selling pushing the euro/dollar toward the $1.5000
psychological barrier, strategists said.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ""The bond and currency market reaction is still an unknown
and a significant risk,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The Fed is expected to confirm its $600 billion asset
purchase program, known as QE2, will end as scheduled in June.
 The program is a bane for the dollar since it is tantamount
to printing money, so an indication that it may end earlier
would be positive for the beaten-down currency. The euro is up
nearly 9 percent against the dollar this year.
 Once QE2 ends there will be some upward pressure on yields.
With U.S. monetary policy still notably weak, an extended
dollar rally is not likely, Sutton said.
 ""This is the medium-term risk; the near-term risk lies in
the wording of the statement, any shift in tone, the press
conference itself and the FOMC's updated set of forecasts,"" she
said.
 The euro  was last at $1.4576 up 0.1 percent on the
day.
 The Australian dollar touched its highest level since the
currency was floated in December 1983, before falling to tradeat $1.0721 , down 0.2 percent on the day.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to about 81.70
yen . Dollar/yen has weakened from roughly 85.50 since
early April with recent support seen just below 82, Scotia's
Sutton said.

 A surprise outcome from the FOMC could prompt a flush-out
of dollar shorts, but even a ""hawkish"" surprise from the Fed
may not disrupt recent moves in the foreign exchange market,
according to Todd Elmer, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 ""As it is difficult for reserves managers to accelerate
sales in an environment in which USD is under pressure, they
may use any rally as an opportunity to sell more dollars,"" he
said. ""Similarly, corporates who need to sell USD and are
under-hedged may take action on a dollar rally given that it
looks as if the broad dollar downtrend remains in place.""
 These factors should mitigate USD-upside even if there is a
correction in investor positioning, he said.

yen, the dollar ticked up 0.1 percent to about 81.89 yen,
helped by expectations of Japanese investor buying, including
by asset management firms which tend to launch new investment
trusts at the end of the month. Dollar/yen has weakened

 By Julie Haviv
 New York, April 25 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher
against the euro on Monday but will likely test an all-time low
this week if the U.S. Federal Reserve shows no sign of changing
its easy monetary policy.
 With many markets closed for Easter and no major U.S.
economic reports on the calendar, the April 26-27 Federal Open
Market Committee meeting will be the key risk this week as
traders try to gauge the direction of U.S. policy.
 Market participants will look to the post-meeting news
conference by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday -- the
first regularly scheduled news briefing by a Fed chief in the
U.S. central bank's 97-year history -- to see how the Fed plans
to exit from its ultra-loose policy.
 If the Fed surprises the market and turns more hawkish it
poses a risk to the sizable amount of dollar shorts in the
market.
 Currency speculators pared bets against the U.S. dollar for
a fourth straight week, according to data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission released Friday. For details click
on.
 A surprise outcome from the FOMC could prompt a flush-out
of dollar shorts, but even a ""hawkish"" surprise from the Fed
may not disrupt recent moves in the foreign exchange market,
according to Todd Elmer, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 ""As it is difficult for reserves managers to accelerate
sales in an environment in which USD is under pressure, they
may use any rally as an opportunity to sell more dollars,"" he
said. ""Similarly, corporates who need to sell USD and are
under-hedged may take action on a dollar rally given that it
looks as if the broad dollar downtrend remains in place.""
 These factors should mitigate USD-upside even if there is a
correction in investor positioning, he said.
 The dollar index, which measures the currency's value
against six major currencies, traded up 0.1 percent at 74.096.
However, many traders say it could test a three-year low of
73.735 hit last week. A break of that could open the way for a
test of the record low of 70.698 hit in 2008.
 If Bernanke indicates that the Fed's accommodative policy
may continue for the foreseeable future, the dollar will likely
see selling pushing the EUR/USD towards the key $1.5000 figure,
strategists said.
 ""The bond and currency market reaction is still an unknown
and a significant risk,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The Fed is expected to confirm its $600 billion asset
purchase program known as QE2 will end as scheduled in June.
The program is a bane for the dollar since it is tantamount to
printing money, so an indication that it may end earlier would
be positive for the beaten-down currency. The euro is up nearly
9 percent against the dollar this year.
 Once QE2 ends there will be some upward pressure on yields.
With U.S. monetary policy still notably weak, an extended
dollar rally is not likely, Sutton said.
 ""This is the medium-term risk; the near-term risk lies in
the wording of the statement, any shift in tone, the press
conference itself and the FOMC's updated set of forecasts,"" she
said.
 The euro hit New York session lows against the dollar,
with traders attributing the greenback's strength to a slide in
commodity prices. The euro hit $1.4539 on electronic trading
platform EBS, the lowest level in the New York session, and it
was last at $1.4562, down 0.1 percent on the day.
 U.S. crude futures were down 0.4 percent at $111.81 per
barrel while spot gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,505.32 per
ounce.
 That fall in crude futures pushed the Australian dollar
down from a fresh 29-year high of $1.0777 set earlier in the
session. It last traded at $1.0706.
 Against the yen, the dollar ticked up 0.1 percent to about
81.94 yen, helped by expectations of Japanese investor buying,
including by asset management firms which tend to launch new
investment trusts at the end of the month.
 USDJPY has weakened from roughly 85.50 since early April
with recent support seen just below 82, Scotia's Sutton said.

 MOSCOW, April 25 (Reuters) - Russia risks a possible drop in
crude oil exports, a key source of the country's budget
revenues, due to bureaucratic obstacles over pipeline access,
industry sources told Reuters on Monday.
 The Energy Ministry sets an export schedule every quarter
that fixes volume quotas for each company to ship oil via
Russia's oil pipeline network, which is run by state monopoly
Transneft. Companies may sell part or all of their quotas on to
others.
 The sources said, however, that the ministry may bar oil
producers from selling on their access to Transneft pipelines
following a decree, signed on March 31.
 ""The registering process for selling the access rights (to
Transneft's pipeline) will be halted after April 29,"" an
industry source said.
 A spokesman for the Energy Ministry declined immediate
comment.
 The decree gives top priority for pipeline access to Russian
refineries, followed by oil-trading exchanges and domestic
suppliers.
 Traders said the decree does not clearly define how
companies may trade their pipeline access rights. The resulting
bureaucratic deadlock may lead to ""thousands of tonnes in
losses"" in export volumes, they said.
 Russia delivers abroad around 5 million barrels of oil per
day, slightly less than a fifth of total exports from OPEC.

International Airport rose by 5.8 percent year-on-year in March,
Dubai Airports said on Monday, but traffic on Middle Eastern and
African routes dropped due to regional unrest.
 In March, 4.2 million passengers passed through the world's
fourth busiest airport for international passenger traffic,
Dubai Airports said in a statement.
 The number was up 5.8 percent compared to 3.97 million

 Passenger numbers on Middle Eastern routes dropped
23,240, while African routes saw a decline of 24,402 passengers
as traffic was affected by political unrest in these regions,
Dubai Airports said.
 Turmoil across the Arab world has toppled leaders in Egypt

 * Discontent remains high; risk of copycat strikes
(Recasts, adds quotes)	
 By Michael Martina	
 SHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - Truck drivers returned to
work on Monday after Shanghai took steps to a defuse a strike at
China's busiest container port, leaving some drivers demanding
more and setting an example of militancy that may embolden other
restive workers. 
 The strike, which began on Wednesday and disrupted shipments
at the port, was a brief but telling symptom of the pressures
over rising inflation that are making the government jittery.	
 ""The resolution to this matter is not good enough -- not
everyone is satisfied,"" said a driver surnamed Fan, 28, from the
landlocked and poor central province of Henan.	
 Over the weekend, the city government cut fees to cool anger
over high fuel prices among the independent contractors who haul
goods to and from the city's string of ports. Many drivers
working as company employees on fixed wages did not join the
protest.	
 The drivers have complained about high operating costs,
citing fuel-price increases, low salaries, and irregular fees
and fines imposed by authorities. Some said logistics companies
were colluding to charge them higher fees. 
 By Monday morning, it appeared that the Shanghai
government's push to douse the discontent was working. Roads
leading to the city's docks were busy with traffic.	
 But several drivers said despite their success in cutting
fees, making a decent living from the fiercely competitive
trucking sector would remain tough.	
 ""The government's response has been fairly reasonable, but
this is largely a problem with the market. With so many drivers
out there competition is tough, and it won't be so easy to fix,""
said Li Wenbing, a 31-year-old truck driver from Henan province,
home to many of the aggrieved drivers.	
 ""The government's new regulation won't have much impact on
my wages. At least after four days parked here I am well
rested.""	
 
 RISK OF COPYCAT STRIKES	
 Large numbers of police officers continued to line streets
around the Baoshan port area, and officials had set up a half
dozen outdoor stands where drivers could register any
complaints.	
 Truckers are only one of many groups in China unhappy about
rising costs. Taxi drivers frequently strike over government
rules and fuel costs.	
 While no other groups have publicly said they follow the
truck drivers' example, the country has a recent history of
copycat strikes. 
 Work stoppages at foreign automakers in southern China last
summer yielded sharp wage increases for workers, inspiring a
wave of labour disputes that disrupted the operations of many
foreign manufactureres and raised questions about the region's
future as a low-cost manufacturing base.	
 None of the truckers interviewed by Reuters said they
planned to go back on strike, and some said they had little
choice but to continue working. 
 ""Ninety-five percent of the drivers you see here come from
farms and have borrowed money from family or the government to
buy their trucks,"" said Fan. ""If you don't drive, you can't
repay your loans.""	
 China said in early April it would raise retail gasoline and
diesel prices by 5-5.5 percent to record highs.[ID:nSGE736009]	
 The Party leadership is especially jumpy about threats to
its control following online calls for ""Jasmine Revolution""
protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the
Arab world, and has detained dozens of dissidents.	
 But the Chinese government has also said it wants to channel
more wealth to workers and farmers, and narrow an income gap
that has fed public ire.	
 When workers at Japanese-owned vehicle parts suppliers
struck in southern China last year, officials encouraged the
companies to offer wage rises and other gains.

metal prices
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - The dollar won a reprieve on
Monday after last week's steep slide but traders said it could
head for a test of its all-time low against a basket of
currencies if the U.S. Federal Reserve takes a cautious stance
towards tightening later in the week.
 In thin trade due to Easter holidays in Australia and much
of Europe, Japanese importer bids for dollars were enough to
boost the U.S. currency against the yen and help it to erase
earlier losses against other currencies.
 Still, the combination of upbeat global growth, signs of
weaker U.S. growth and the spectre of dovish Fed policy is
expected to support fund flows to higher-yielding currencies
such as the euro and the Australian dollar from the U.S.
currency, traders said.
 ""I doubt there's much dollar carry-trade out there but when
market players are eager to take risk, they tend to look to
interest rate gaps on speculation that the dollar could be used
as a funding currency,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, the head of
foreign exchange at State Street Capital Markets.
 With dollar interest rates seen taking a pivotal role in the
market, players are looking to a news conference by Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Wednesday after the central bank's two-day policy
meeting -- the first regularly scheduled news briefing by a Fed
chief in the central bank's 97-year history -- to see how the
Fed plans to seek an exit from its easy monetary policy.
 ""It's all up the Fed and Bernanke's stance at his news
conference. The dollar could fall further depending on U.S.
interest rates,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 In Asian trade, the Australian dollar rose to a fresh
29-year high of $1.0777 , as the prices of gold and
commodities continue to rise, before slipping back to $1.0735.
 Gold hit a lifetime high  while silver surged 4
percent on the U.S. futures market.
 The euro/dollar  rate gave up early gains to stand
flat at $1.4568, but it remained near a 16-month high of $1.4649
hit last week.
 Against the yen, the dollar ticked up 0.4 percent to about
82.20 yen , helped by expectations of Japanese investor
buying, including by asset management firms which tend to launch
new investment trusts at the end of the month.
 U.S. POLICY
 Traders also said dollar selling by Japanese exporters had
been limited since last month's earthquake as supply chain
disruptions were making it difficult to export their products.
 Japanese automakers said on Monday their production in March
fell more than 50 percent from a year earlier, with Toyota Motor
<7203.T>, the world's largest carmaker, reporting a 62.7 percent
drop in output. [ID:nL3E7FP06P]
 The dollar index, which measures the currency's value
against six major currencies, rose slightly to 74.07 <.DXY>, but
many trader says it could test a three-year low of 73.735 hit
last week. A break of that could open the way for a test of the
record low of 70.698 hit in 2008.
 The dollar has been falling due to perceptions that the
United States is set to maintain an easy monetary policy even as
most other major global economies, with the exception of
disaster-stricken Japan, look to tighter monetary policy to rein
in inflation.
 Some analysts say worries about rising U.S. debt and
political bickering in Washington over how to tackle the U.S.
budget deficit are also undermining the dollar, making it easier
for speculators to sell the currency, although there is no
evidence that foreign investors are dumping their U.S. assets.
 As speculators have already piled up short dollar
positions, some market players think the dollar could see a
rebound soon.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission
showed that speculators remained overwhelmingly bearish on the
dollar, even after trimming their huge long positions in the
euro and the Australian dollar in the week to April 19.
 Still, many traders think that, for the dollar to rise, it
will need a clear signal from the Fed that the central bank will
be on course to raise rates -- a scenario many traders are
sceptical about.
 The Fed is widely expected to stick to completing its $600
billion asset purchase programme in June but many market players
think a backdrop of softer-than-expected economic data, weak
housing markets and possible government austerity measures to
tackle the budget deficit all make it more likely the Fed will
keep its support for the recovery in place for some time.
 Many analysts believe the U.S. central bank will hold the
size of its balance sheet steady by reinvesting maturing assets
after June to avoid a passive tightening -- an issue that will
likely be discussed at the April 26-27 meeting.

 SHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - Trucks laden with cargo
containers on Monday appeared to operate as usual on roads
leading to ports in China's coastal commercial hub, Shanghai,
where officials sought to defuse lingering anger among truck
drivers who went on strike last week over rising costs.	
 The drivers' strike disrupted shipments at China's busiest
port and brought shivers of unrest about rising costs and fees
to Shanghai, which has sought to remake itself as a symbol of
outward-looking prosperity.	
 Over the weekend, the Shanghai government cut fees in a bid
to defuse anger over high fuel prices among the independent
contractors who haul goods to and from the city's string of

 The strike, which began on Wednesday, was a brief but

over inflation, which in March hit 5.4 percent from a year
earlier, magnifying the ruling Communist Party's jitters about
protests erupting over prices, taxes and fees.	
 By Monday morning, it appeared that the Shanghai
government's push to douse the discontent was working. Roads
leading to the city's docks were busy with traffic.	
 But several drivers said that despite their success in

China said in early April it would raise retail gasoline and
diesel prices by 5-5.5 percent to record highs.[ID:nSGE736009]	
 The Party leadership is especially jumpy about threats to
its control following online calls for ""Jasmine Revolution""
protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the
Arab world, and has detained dozens of dissidents.	
 But the Chinese government has also said it wants to channel
more wealth to workers and farmers, and narrow an income gap
that has fed public ire.	
 When workers at Japanese-owned vehicle parts suppliers
struck in southern China last year, officials encouraged the
companies to offer wage rises and other gains.

surplus is likely to narrow further to about $140 billion, or 2
percent of the gross domestic product, due to surging global
commodity prices, a government think-tank said on Monday.	
 If the forecast is accurate, it would mean China's trade
surplus as a share of GDP will fall further from last year's 3.1
percent. That could mitigate international pressure for China to
let the yuan rise faster to improve its balance of payments.	
 In a report, the Development Research Centre said China's
total imports could grow about 25 percent this year, outpacing
export growth, which may slow to 20 percent from last year's 31
percent.	
 It said the slowdown in exports was partly due to a high
comparative base from a year ago.	
 The projection is in line with a forecast made by the
commerce ministry, which said on Friday that China's imports are
likely to grow at a faster clip than exports this year, leading
to a further improvement in the trade balance. [ID:nL3E7FM057] 
 China's gaping trade surplus has been a lightning rod in its
relations with the United States. Some U.S. lawmakers say the
trade surplus is exacerbated by an undervalued yuan
that is managed by Beijing, providing a competitive advantage
for Chinese exporters. 
 China has said it intends eventually to allow market forces
to set the value of the yuan but wants to do so gradually in
order not to disrupt its export sector. Lately, Beijing has also
said it recognises the need to balance its trade more toward
domestic consumption.	
 Rising global commodity prices and solid domestic economic
growth helped China record a rare trade deficit in the first
quarter.	
 The think-tank said China's economy, the world's
second-largest, is expected to grow about 9 percent this year,
slowing from last year's 10.3 percent.	
 It said the building of government-subsidised homes could
moderate the impact from the clampdown on the property sector.
That should help property investment grow more than 20 percent
this year, but still down from last year's 33 percent.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2011 11:44PM ET</span>",China may start new funds to manage FX reserves -media," BEIJING, April 25 (Reuters) - China's central bank is
considering setting up new investment funds to diversify
holdings in the country's swelling foreign exchange reserves,
the world's largest stockpile, local media reported on Monday.	
 The proposed funds include one or more to invest a part of
China's foreign reserves in energy and precious metal markets
and another that could intervene in foreign exchange markets,
the New Century Weekly said, citing sources close to the central
bank.	
 China's foreign exchange reserves surged to $3.05 trillion
in the first quarter, heightening long-standing worries about
how China can effectively manage the holdings and not become
overly exposed to the U.S. dollar.	
 The report left many questions unanswered, including the
size of any such fund and the timing of their possible launch.
It also did not say why new funds were needed when China already
has a sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corp (CIC), 
 CIC was established in 2007 and was entirely funded from
foreign exchange reserves. 
 The $300 billion fund falls under the finance ministry,
while the bulk of China's foreign exchange reserves are managed
by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, an arm of the
People's Bank of China, and operates with a conservative
investment mandate. 
 The report said the central bank was considering a fund that
could intervene in the foreign exchange market in an effort to
stabilize exchange rates on behalf of the central bank.	
 ""The central bank is also considering setting up a fund that
will directly buy foreign exchange in the market so that the
central bank does not create base money,"" the magazine said,
citing a source close to the central bank. 
 It did not elaborate on the plans, but said the central bank
aimed to transfer some reserves off the central bank's balance
sheet to the new ""intervention fund"". 
 To prevent the yuan from rising too fast and too
far, China's central bank has been an avid buyer of dollars
generated by China's exports. These huge and regular
purchases are a crucial driver of the build-up in China's
reserves and in turn have skewed the central bank's balance
sheet. 
 To diversify investment of the reserves, Chinese officials
and economists have urged the government to buy more of other
currencies such as the euro and the yen , as well
as commodities including oil  and gold .

(Update prices)	
 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hit a
fresh 29-year high and South Korea's benchmark share index
touched another record intraday high on Monday, suggesting
investors were still eager to embrace risk and higher-yielding
assets. 
 Commodities pushed higher with spot gold hitting a record
high of $1,517.71 an ounce and U.S. silver futures
 scaling a 31-year peak. 
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies to 74.086 , but remained within sight of a
trough of 73.735 struck last week, its lowest since August 2008.	
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 82.22
yen, supported by dollar-buying by Japanese importers and as
traders took aim at stop-loss dollar buying orders said to be
lurking near 82.50 yen.	
 ""The market is thin today because London is closed today,
and people are basically just trying to trigger stops,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank, referring to Easter Monday holidays
across much of Europe.	
 Markets are looking to a news conference by Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday after the bank's two-day
policy meeting to see how the central bank plans to exit from
its super-easy monetary policy.	
 Traders are also nervously watching Greece after newspaper
reports that it is considering extending maturities on its
sovereign debt as one option for a possible restructuring.	
 Most Asian stock markets were sluggish as they reopened
after the long Easter weekend, but South Korea's benchmark stock
index clawed above a peak scaled last week and hit another
record intraday high. The benchmark index was last up 0.9
percent at 2,217.59 .	
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average dipped 0.1 poercent
, but gains in shippers helped temper losses.	
 Japan's Nikkei business daily reported at the weekend that
earnings sharply rebounded at three major marine transport
companies in the year that ended on March 31. 
 Mitsui OSK Lines rose 2 percent, Nippon Yusen
gained 1.3 percent and Kawasaki Kisen added
0.7 percent. 
 ""The shippers' gains are straightforward. The expectations
for good results reflect strong demand in the global economy and
they suffered relatively little damage from the March
earthquake,"" said Naoki Fujiwara, a fund manager at Shinkin
Asset Management.	
 The Australian dollar, which tends to attract buying when
the global economy is doing well and commodity prices rise,
touched a 29-year high of $1.0777 . It later trimmed its
gains to stand at $1.0735, little changed on the day.	
 U.S. crude futures oil rose as violence in Syria and Yemen
escalated over the weekend, stirring fears of supply disruptions
from the Middle East and North Africa.	
 NYMEX crude for June delivery  edged up 30 cents a
barrel to $112.59.	
 U.S. 10-year Treasuries were little changed in price to
yield 3.396 percent , down about 1 basis point from
late U.S. trade on Thursday. The U.S. Treasury market was closed
on Friday for a U.S. holiday.	
 Stock markets in Australia and Hong Kong were closed on
Monday for a holiday.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2011 09:36PM ET</span>","FOREX-Dollar vulnerable, Aussie hits new 29-year high"," By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - The dollar was vulnerable on
Monday, hitting a fresh 29-year low against the Australian
dollar under the weight of its low interest rates, although
dealers said trading is thin due to Easter and the dollar's
direction ultimately hinges on the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy
meeting later in the week.
 Market players are looking to a news conference by Chairman
Ben Bernanke planned on Wednesday after the central bank's
two-day policy meeting -- the first regularly scheduled news
briefing by a Fed chief in the central bank's 97-year history --
to see how the Fed plans to seek an exit from its easy monetary
policy.
 ""It's all up the Fed and Bernanke's stance at his news
conference. The dollar could fall further depending on U.S.
interest rates,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 In early Asian trade, the Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent
to $1.0777 , a fresh 29-year high as the prices of gold
and commodities continue to rise, although trade is thin as the
Sydney market is on holiday. Many European markets, too, will be
shut on Monday.
 Euro/dollar  rose 0.15 percent to $1.4585, edging
close to its 16-month high of $1.4649 hit last week.
 Against the yen, the dollar ticked up 0.2 percent to around
82.00 yen , helped by expectations of Japanese investor
buying, including by asset management firms which tend to launch
new investment trusts at the end of the month.
 But offers from real money investors are seen around 82.20
yen, said a trader at a Japanese brokerage, while selling by
Japanese exporters near the end of month is likely to keep
dollar gains in check, although the amount may be smaller than
usual due to uncertainty over supply chain problems after the
earthquake.
 U.S. POLICY
 The dollar index, which measures the currency's value
against six major currencies, stood at 73.982 <.DXY>, not far
from a three-year low of 73.735 hit last week. A break of that
could open the way for a test of the record low of 70.698 hit in
2008.
 The dollar has been falling due to perceptions that the
United States is set to maintain an easy monetary policy even as
most other major global economies, with the exception of
disaster-stricken Japan, look to tighter monetary policy to rein
in inflation.
 Some market players say worries about rising U.S. debt and
political bickering in Washington over how to tackle the U.S.
budget deficit are also undermining the dollar, making it easier
for speculators to go short in the U.S. currency.
 Some analysts think the dollar could rebound as speculators
have already piled up short dollar positions. Data from the U.S.
Commodity and Futures Trading Commission showed speculators
remained overwhelmingly bearish on the dollar, even after
trimming their huge long positions in the euro and the
Australian dollar in the week to April 19.
 Still, many traders think that, for the dollar to rise, it
will need a clear signal from the Fed that the central bank will
be on course to raise rates -- a scenario many traders are
sceptical about.
 The Fed is widely expected to stick to completing its $600
billion asset purchase programme in June but many market players
think a backdrop of softer-than-expected economic data, weak
housing markets and possible government austerity measures to
tackle the budget deficit all make it more likely the Fed will
keep its support for the recovery in place for some time.
 Many analysts believe the U.S. central bank will hold the
size of its balance sheet steady by reinvesting maturing assets
after June to avoid a passive tightening -- an issue that will
likely be discussed at the April 26-27 meeting.

city of Shanghai is cutting some fees to defuse striking truck
drivers' anger over high fuel prices, an official spokesman said
after days of sometimes violent confrontation disrupted the
world's busiest port.	
 But it was not immediately clear whether the steps would end
the protests that galvanized hundreds of striking truck drivers
and brought flashes of unrest over inflation to China's biggest
commercial hub.	
 The promised steps include ""lowering standard fees and
removing non-standard fees"", an unidentified spokesman for the
Shanghai city government said, according to a brief report from
China's official Xinhua news agency issued early on Saturday.	
 It did not give other details of the steps.	
 
 The city spokesman said ""all ports in Shanghai were
operating normally"", according to the Xinhua report.	
 Up to now, Shanghai officials have not commented publicly
about the strike, a boldly public demonstration of anger over
rising consumer prices and fuel price increases in China.	
 The government is struggling to contain inflation, which hit
5.4 percent in March, magnifying the ruling Communist Party's
long-standing jitters about the potential for public resentment
over prices, taxes and fees to escalate into protest.
[ID:nL3E7FF0AC]	
 The Party leadership is especially jumpy about threats to
social stability following online calls for ""Jasmine Revolution""
protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the
Arab world, and has detained dozens of dissidents. 
 On Friday, a crowd of about 600 people milled about outside
an office of a logistics company near the Baoshan Port, one of
the city's string of ports. Some threw rocks at trucks whose
drivers had not joined the strike, breaking the windows of at
least one truck.	
 Many of the strikers are independent contractors who haul
goods to and from the port, and they have demanded that the
government do something about rising fuel costs and what some
called high fees charged by transport firms.	
 The Xinhua report about the Shanghai government's steps was
in English, and China's tightly controlled state media has
otherwise made scant mention of the unrest.

 * Concerns remain over banks, security outside port
 
 By Ange Aboa
 ABIDJAN, April 22 (Reuters) - The port of Abidjan is
undamaged and open for business after Ivory Coast's
post-election conflict, but trade volumes will not pick up until
security and financing improve, the head of the port told
Reuters.
 Sie Hien, managing director of the port, said on Friday that
the first cocoa shipments had left with a few containers of
beans but the majority of the 17 ships that had docked so far
were oil tankers or bulk carriers.
 Abidjan port was caught up in the power struggle in the
world's top cocoa producer, affected by European trade sanctions
that were part of efforts to force incumbent Laurent Gbagbo to
cede power to Alassane Ouattara, who won a November election.
 The sanctions were lifted earlier this month when Ouattara
finally took power after heavy fighting led to Gbagbo's arrest.
 ""Abidjan port is ready, in all departments. We have the
quays, we have the people ... but we need freight. If there is
freight, there will be ships and if there are ships the work
will begin,"" Hien told Reuters on Friday.
 ""This assumes security beyond the port as freight must come
down through the country to Abidjan. That will take time, but I
have faith because, as you can see, there are already some
cotton trucks that have arrived,"" he added.
 Abidjan exports about half of Ivory Coast's cocoa crop of
1.2 million tonnes a year.
 It is also a major container hub for the country and its
neighbours and had targeted 800,000-900,000 annual container
shipments by 2012, up from around 600,000 in 2008.
 Cocoa warehouses in the port area were open on Friday to
help air some of the 450,000-500,000 tonnes of beans that have
been trapped there since the crisis began.
 Two ships were at the docks, with one unloading rice and the
another clinker for the making of cement.
 Businesses in Abidjan are hesitantly starting to return to
work, but parts of the city remain awash with gunmen, and
sporadic fighting still breaks out. Security problems continue
to plague other parts of the country, especially the west.
 Hien said he had called a meeting on Friday with all firms
involved in the port to reassure them of their security there.
 ""The cocoa sector has other blockages, especially linked to
the opening of the banks,"" Hien said.
 Most of Ivory Coast's banks closed during the crisis amid
security concerns and after the West African BCEAO central bank
shut down its local offices.
 BCEAO officials were in Abidjan this week to assess the
damage from the crisis, and Ouattara's government hopes banks
will be able to re-open next week.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2011 05:00AM ET</span>","China must rein in FX reserves, but no sharp yuan rise -official"," BEIJING, April 22 (Reuters) - China must take steps to rein
in foreign exchange reserves to help curb inflation, including
by making the yuan more flexible and gradually opening its
capital account, a senior foreign exchange official said in
published remarks.	
 But Guan Tao, head of the international payment department
at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, cautioned
against any sharp currency rises.	
 ""If we cannot slow the rise in foreign exchange reserves,
our work to control consumer prices and property prices will be
greatly undermined,"" Guan wrote in the latest edition of China
Finance.	
 ""Even if the property prices can be curbed, we cannot stop
liquidity from shifting to other markets, brewing other forms of
asset bubbles,"" he added.	
 China's foreign exchange reserves swelled by nearly $200
billion in the first quarter to more than $3 trillion,
indicating hefty capital inflows given that China had a $1.02
billion trade deficit during the first three
months.[ID:nL3E7FE19O]	
 The persistent increase in the foreign exchange reserves has
been fuelling inflationary pressures in China, Guan said.	
 The rapid reserve build-up means the People's Bank of China
keeps pumping out large amounts of yuan liquidity into the
economy -- the root course of domestic inflation -- as the
central bank has to buy most incoming dollars to slow the yuan's
gains.	
 Guan said that Beijing's bid to boost the yuan's
international status by expanding the currency's use in trade
may lead to more money inflows at the initial stage.	
 China is pressing ahead with attempts to reduce its reliance
on dollars in international trade. 
 But the yuan is used more often to pay for China's imports
than its exports, so the central bank ends up accumulating even
more foreign reserves -- mostly dollars -- because few trade
partners now have enough yuan on hand to pay for Chinese goods.	
 This factor added roughly $40 billion to foreign exchange
purchases in the first quarter, according to estimates by Mark
Williams, China economist at Capital Economics.	
 Since October, China's central bank has raised benchmark
interest rates four times and tightened lenders' reserve
requirements seven times as it seeks to rein in loan growth and
keep a lid on inflation. [ID:nL3E7FJ139]	
 Greater yuan flexibility will help rebalance the economy
and curb bets on one-way yuan appreciation, Guan said. But he
saw no basis for any sharp yuan appreciation, given that China's
current account surplus has been narrowing.	
 ""The yuan is getting closer to its equilibrium level as
China's current account surplus is falling and capital outflows
are rising,"" Guan said.	
 The yuan has gained 25 percent against the dollar
since the 2.1 percent landmark revaluation in July 2005. Chinese
officials have repeatedly ruled out another one-off revaluation
despite foreign pressures.	
 Guan also repeated the official stance that Beijing would
gradually open its capital account and expand more channels to
facilitate capital outflows.

 * Gap between parallel rouble rates had widened
 * Expects $3 billion Russian loan in May
 * May start selling off state assets
 
(Adds details, background)
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, April 22 (Reuters) - Belarus' currency crisis
deepened on Friday as interbank foreign exchange trading ground
to a halt, participants said, following a policy U-turn on
valuations from the central bank.
 The bank, battling to restore confidence in the country's
depreciating rouble, said on Tuesday it would allow the currency
to float on the interbank market, taking a step towards a
full-scale devaluation.
 But after the currency immediately fell to 5,000 per dollar
in trading, the central bank on Friday informally recommended
that banks transact at a valuation closer to the official rate
of 3,044.
 ""The central bank has strongly recommended banks to work
within the 4,500-4,600 corridor,"" one source said.
 ""There is no trading,"" said another.
 The central bank, which operates separate exchange rates for
banks and corporations on the one hand and individuals on the
other, declined to comment on Friday's interbank trading.
 The move effectively reversed Tuesday's decision to allow a
free-floating rate on the interbank market.
 ""The central bank must have been terrified that the rate had
become uncontrollable,"" said one market player who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
 
 PANIC BUYING
 Facing a large current account deficit, Belarus has lost a
quarter of its foreign currency reserves this year trying to
support the rouble before resorting to trading restrictions in
March.
 Belarussian exporters must sell 30 percent of their export
revenue to the central bank at the official rate which also
serves as an indicator for high-street cash points.
 But since the official rate is unattractive, many businesses
are holding on to their currency reserves and turning off the
flow of dollars into the retail points.
 The currency crisis and the operation of a two-tier exchange
rate system which has spawned a currency black market and led to
panic buying of consumer goods, represent a setback for
President Alexander Lukashenko.
 He promised a steady improvement in living standards prior
to his re-election last December.
 Some Belarussians are now posting themselves money transfers
to Russia, then driving across the border to pick them up in
Russian roubles and sell them at a profit back home on the black
market.
 Ordinary Belarussians are having to wait for hours in lines
to cash points to snap up whatever currency is sold by others.
 ""Scuffles are taking place at exchange points ... as
citizens argue about queue order,"" Interfax news agency quoted
senior Interior Ministry official Viktor Senko as saying.
 
 AWAITING RUSSIAN AID
 The central bank has said it will unify rates and do away
with different tiers once the free-floating exchange rate
becomes ""balanced"". Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Rumas told
Reuters this week he saw 3,800-4,100 roubles per dollar as a
fair exchange rate.
 Analysts say the authorities are waiting for a $3 billion
loan that Belarus has requested from Russia and which will allow
the central bank to regain control of the market.
 ""We are expecting some foreign borrowing and talks with
Russia, in particular, are going on,"" Anatoly Moroz, the head of
currency control department at the central bank was quoted by
state news agency BelTA as saying on Friday.
 ""In May, this issue (of a loan) will be resolved,"" he said.
 Russia, however, has said it wants to see a more detailed
economic stabilisation plan. Analysts say another option for
Belarus is to sell some state assets.
 ""We also expect to see news about a possible privatisation
of state assets intensifying in coming weeks as this remains one
of the few real options for refilling the reserves that the
authorities have at their disposal,"" VTB Capital said in a note.
 A devaluation would be a setback for Lukashenko who promised
to double the average monthly wage to $1,000 by 2015 as he
campaigned for a fourth term in office last year.

 * Hungary urges China to cooperate on a bond issue 
 * Says proceeds will not be used for its debt financing	
 * Bond issue could finance development projects in Hungary	
 * Details of bond unclear amid strict China capital controls
(Adds background, detail)	
 BUDAPEST, April 22 (Reuters) - Hungary is interested in
issuing a China-linked bond and has held talks with financial
officials in China and Hong Kong, a news website quoted its
development minister as saying.	
 The issue would have to be made on the open market to avoid
sending a misleading message to investors about Hungary's fiscal
plans, website Portfolio.hu quoted Development Minister Tamas
Fellegi as saying late on Thursday.	
 Fellegi said he had discussed the issue with banking leaders
in Hong Kong as well as in Beijing, adding that the proceeds
from such a debt issue would be used to finance development
projects in Hungary, not to help roll over Hungary's debt, the
website said, citing national news agency MTI.	
 ""We have not come here to convince the Chinese of debt
financing, because we do not need that,"" said Fellegi, who is on
an official visit in China.	
 ""But what we do use for debt financing, and is thus missing
from the development budget, that could be replenished from
here, too.""	
 He said such an issue would be organised by a leading
Chinese bank, but gave no further details.	
 It was not immediately clear how the bond would be
structured.	
 China's strict capital controls include rules that have
restricted onshore bond issuance by non-Chinese borrowers to two
supranational institutions, the Asian Development Bank and the
International Finance Corp. Moreover, those entities have been
required to use the proceeds within China.	
 Officials and scholars have given no indication that they
are considering relaxing those rules.	
 However, China has increasingly been encouraing the yuan's
use on a regional and global basis for trade purposes and has
been promoting the development of an offshore yuan market in
Hong Kong, which has seen a flurry of companies issuing
yuan-denominated bonds.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2011 03:16AM ET</span>",Q+A-What is behind the Shanghai truckers strike?," SHANGHAI, April 22 (Reuters) - A strike by Shanghai truckers
over rising fuel prices continued into a third day on Friday,
threatening operations at one of the world's largest ports. 
 Here are some questions and answers about the dispute:

 WHY ARE THE TRUCK DRIVERS STRIKING?	
 The drivers have complained about high operating costs,
citing fuel-price increases, low salaries, and irregular fees
and fines imposed by authorities.	
 Some said transport companies were passing on higher costs
to drivers and that logistics companies were colluding to charge
higher fees.	
 China said in early April it would increase retail gasoline
and diesel prices by 5-5.5 percent to record
highs.[ID:nSGE736009]	
 China's inflation rate rose to 5.4 percent in March,
prompting officials to renew vows to use all available means to
contain price rises.	
 China was hit by a wave of strikes in the first half of
2010, most of which ended with substantial wage increases for
workers.

 HOW IS THE STRIKE AFFECTING EXPORTS AND PORT OPERATIONS?	
 The stoppage appears to be slowing some exports from the
port, which handle mostly container traffic that generally
carries textiles, machinery and manufactured goods. Some
outbound ships have been forced to leave port with loads under
capacity, according to a manager at a logistics company.	
 Inbound ships have continued to unload cargo normally,
though some buyers might pay higher storage fees if containers
cannot leave the port facilities on trucks.	
 Duncan Innes-Ker, China analyst at the Economist
Intelligence Unit, said the impact on foreign investors should
be limited because the strikes are coinciding with a low season
for exporters.	
 ""If it had happened three months later, then I think people
would be a lot more worried because the smallest disruption at
that time could have ripple effects throughout the supply
chain,"" he said.	
 Copper imports also have been affected, but not severely.
The Shanghai Port handles the largest amount of refined copper
imports in China and much of the shipments land at the
Waigaojiao terminal.	
 Analysts said the supplies of copper and other metals are
likely to outlast any disruptions caused by the strike.

 WHAT HAS BEEN THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE? 
 China's officials and state media have been silent on the
protest, underscoring the sensitivity of unrest for the ruling
Communist Party, which normally stamps out anything it perceives
as a threat to stability.	
 The Communist Party is acutely aware of the potential
inflation has to cause labour unrest around the country.
Analysts say the government may grant one or two concessions to
the truckers, reducing toll fees or putting pressure on
logistics companies to reduce fees.	
 Inflation was one of the causes for the 1989 pro-democracy
protests centred around Tiananmen Square that were bloodily
suppressed by government troops.	
 In recent months, China has been battling inflation, one of
the core concerns of workers who feel wages are not keeping pace
with prices. The central bank has reached for a variety of
monetary tools to contain price rises, including raising
interest rates and banks' required reserve ratios.	
 But price pressures driven by soaring global commodity
prices and abundant liquidity continue to plague the Chinese
economy.

 COULD THE UNREST SPREAD?	
 The chances of widespread protests are slim, but Chinese
policy-makers are always jumpy about even remote risks of
protests that could challenge the government.	
 Liu Kaiming, executive director of the Institute of
Contemporary Observation, a privately funded group in Shenzhen
that focuses on labour issues, said the strikes could spread to
taxi drivers, noting that the last time taxi drivers went on
strike was due to high oil prices.	
 ""The recent fuel price hikes might have been the straw that
broke the camel's back,"" Liu said.	
 Independent unions are illegal in China and some experts say
truck drivers and other workers do not have a channel to fight
for their interests on fuel-price increases, low salaries, or
irregular fees and fines imposed by authorities.	
 On Thursday, the Shanghai Municipal Transport and Port
Authority said it would cut tolls and contract fees for taxi
drivers starting May 1, a move that may have been intended to
prevent strikes from spreading to cabbies.	
 The announcement on the agency's website (http://www.jt.sh.cn)
said it would save 350 yuan a month for each taxi driver.

 * Plans to lower holdings of Japan stocks
 * Plans to bolster foreign bond portfolio, though depends on
mkt moves
(Adds detail, background)	
 By Antoni Slodkowski and Mari Terawaki	
 TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - Japan's Daido Life Insurance
plans to boost its holdings of yen bonds, particularly 20-year
debt, this financial year and to cut its exposure to risk by
lightening Japanese stocks, a top executive said on Friday.	
 ""We're planning to continue to invest mostly in long term
bonds,"" Takashi Ikawa, general manager of Daido Life Insurance
Co's investment planning department, told Reuters in an
interview.	
 ""I don't know by how much at this stage, but in principle we
want to lower our holdings of domestic stocks, selling at a good
price when possible."" 
 Japan's top nine life insurers manage some $1.9 trillion in
total assets -- bigger than the size of Brazil's economy -- and
their investment moves are followed closely by both domestic and
overseas market players.	
 Daido Life, a unit of T&D Holdings , also said it
plans to further invest in foreign bonds, including both
currency-hedged and unhedged bonds, as well as those held via
mutual funds, depending on market moves. It added 50 billion yen
($610 million) of foreign debt in the last fiscal year to March
2011.	
 The insurer sold 70 billion yen of Japan stocks last year,
with shares currently accounting for roughly 6.7 percent of its
assets.	
 Japanese insurers have been reducing holdings of Japanese
shares for many years ahead of the introduction this financial
year of new government regulations that raise the risk weighting
on stocks and other risky assets that insurers hold. 
 Daido plans to keep its holdings of foreign equities as well
as alternative investments such as hedge fund and private equity
investments steady.	
 
 BOOSTING YEN DEBT	
 Daido is Japan's ninth-largest life insurer with domestic
bonds accounting for roughly half of its total assets of 5.285
trillion yen as of December 2010. It bought 190 billion yen of
Japanese government bonds (JGBs) last year and plans to boost
those holdings further in 2011/12.	
 Daido expects interest rates in Japan to edge up to 1.3
percent from the current 1.2 percent. Ikawa added that problems
related to Japan's mountain of public debt, further strained by
reconstruction after the March 11 quake may push rates slightly
higher, but that this would likely be limited by the Bank of
Japan's easy monetary policy.	
 ""We are completely in the dark when it comes to the impact
of the power shortages (following the quake) on the economy,""
said Ikawa, adding that this would be a severe problem for Japan
this business year.	
 ""The economy's slump will depend on the situation with the
power cuts.""	
 
 FOREIGN EXPOSURE	
 The Osaka-based insurer plans to increase investment in
foreign bonds, including both currency-hedged and unhedged bonds
and those held via mutual funds.	
 Daido mostly invests in U.S. Treasuries and European debt,
with similar exposure to both markets. Among European bonds, its
investments are concentrated on those issued by the core euro
zone countries such as Germany, Ikawa said.	
 Daido predicts the euro will trade between 105 yen and 135
yen in the business year to 2011/12.	
 ""In the euro zone there's talk of more interest hikes, so
the economy looks strong there, but at the same time we still
have inflation worries,"" said Ikawa.	
 He added that problems related to sovereign debt in the euro
zone's peripheral countries have dampened any optimism on the
European economy.	
 ""We're going to be very careful and buy foreign bonds only
when we think the time is right,"" Ikawa said, adding Daido may
also increase its holdings of foreign stocks when it thinks
market conditions are favourable.	
 It added 30 billion yen of foreign stocks last business
year, investing mostly in equity markets in developed economies.	
 Daido Life's foreign currency exposure stood at around 3.8
percent of its total assets at the end of March, Iwaka said.	
 Daido declined to say whether it holds bonds or shares of
Tokyo Electric Power Co , the operator of a crippled
nuclear power plant in Fukushima.	
 Tokyo Electric shares have tumbled 81 percent since the
quake and tsunami triggered a nuclear crisis.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Michiko Iwasaki	
 TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - Japan Post Insurance plans to
trim its investment in Japanese government bonds in the current
financial year as it seeks higher returns by buying more
corporate and regional bonds, a senior company official said on
Friday.	
 State-owned Japan Post's insurance arm holds 95.75
trillion yen ($1.16 trillion) in assets under management, bigger
than Australia's economy, which is the world's 13th largest.	
 The insurer, also known as Kampo Insurance, expects JGB
yields to stay low due to concerns over the outlook for the
economy, despite mounting speculation over potential increases
in bond issuance to fund a budget for rebuilding the northern
part of Japan after the March 11 earthquake.	
 ""We'll focus our investments on buying the superlong sectors
of JGBs. On top of that, we want to invest in regional and
corporate bonds to seek higher returns,"" Mitsuya Watanabe,
general manager at the insurer's investment planning section,
told Reuters in an interview.	
 Japan Post plans to invest a total of 7.1 trillion yen
($86.75 billion) in the financial year that began on April 1,
little changed from the previous year, Watanabe said.	
 Of the total, 5.3 trillion yen will go into JGBs in 2011/12,
down 500 billion yen from last year, while it plans to raise its
investment in municipal and corporate bonds by 500 billion yen
to 1.8 trillion yen, Watanabe said.	
 The insurer forecast the yield on key 10 year JGBs
would range between around 1.0 and 1.5 percent.
It was about 1.210 percent on Friday.	
 ""It looks like (the government) will take account of fiscal
discipline when crafting budgets, so I believe JGB yields are
unlikely to jump,"" Watanabe said.	
 ""We ... have to see details on the second extra budget, such
as its timing and size. Still, I believe the issuer, the
Ministry of Finance, will communicate with the market closely,
so I don't think we'll see a major mismatch of supply and demand
balance in the market.""	
 Watanabe said expectations of more JGB issuance would help
limit falls in government bond yields.

 As JGB yields are expected to be stuck at low levels, the
insurer wants to allocate as much as possible to municipal and
corporate bonds, and is especially keen on investing in the
10-year sector.	
 Watanabe said, however, that it would be tough to achieve
higher returns as credit spreads on corporate and municipal
bonds are expected to be tight this year despite recent rises in
corporate bond spreads.	
 Domestic credit spreads have been widening since March,
largely due to turmoil at Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO)
after last's month earthquake and tsunami which crippled its
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing the world's worst
nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.	
 Japan Post Insurance declined to comment on TEPCO, saying
that it does not comment on individual companies. 
 Japan Post Insurance started investing in risk assets in the
previous financial year by increasing its exposure to foreign
bonds and domestic equities, Watanabe said.	
 ""We'll continue our effort to invest in stocks and foreign
bonds this year by taking into account market conditions and our
capacity to take risks.""	
 Japan Post Insurance plans to invest about 50 billion yen in
foreign bonds in 2011/12, little changed from the year before.	
 As of February, the insurer's holdings of foreign bonds had
risen to 715.4 billion yen, only about 0.7 percent of its total
assets, from 658.1 billion yen at the end of March 2010.	
 The insurer holds dollar-, euro- and sterling-denominated
foreign paper.	
 It expects the dollar to move in a range of 75 to 95 yen and
the euro to shift between 105 and 130 yen.	
 Watanabe said the firm will seek investment opportunities in
domestic stocks after raising these holdings by about 40 percent
to 241 billion yen at the end of February.	
 Kampo's investment strategy in JGBs and foreign bonds has
not been affected by a series of actions from rating companies,
Watanabe said.	
 But the insurer will closely watch Japan's fiscal situation
to see whether suitable disciplinary measures are in place, he
said.	
 On Monday, Standard & Poor's slapped a negative outlook on
the United States' top-notch AAA rating.	
 S&P cut Japan's rating by a notch to AA minus (AA-), three
levels below the top grade at AAA, in late January for the first
time since 2002.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday,
undermined by the spectre of low U.S. interest rates and the
crushing weight of the U.S. budget deficit, with some players
looking for it to test an all-time low when players return from
the Easter holidays.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> slipped to a three-year low
of 73.735 on Thursday, having slipped below its 2009 trough of
74.170. It last stood at 74.061 on Friday, about 4.7 percent
above its record low of 70.698 marked in March 2008.
 Trade was thin as many markets were shut for Easter. But
some participants said the greenback's downtrend looked set to
resume once players come back from the holidays.
 ""The market was generally positive on risk, with VIX (market
volatility index) falling to a new low since the Lehman shock,
so that's helping to push down the dollar,"" said Koji Fukaya,
chief strategist at Credit Suisse.
 Some market players also said there is a perception that
U.S. economic recovery could sputter if the White House and
Congress agree to reduce the deficit with significant spending
cuts or tax hikes, which would likely force the Federal Reserve
to hold interest rates at record lows even as other central
banks raise them.
 The dollar's slide accelerated days after Standard & Poor's
slapped a negative outlook on the United States' top AAA credit
rating earlier this week. The agency said a downgrade was
possible if authorities can't slash the massive U.S. budget
deficit within two years.
 ""Although the market's initial reaction to the S&P
announcement was muted, its impact is filtering through slowly,""
said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. 
 ""The biggest reason behind the dollar's fall is waning
investor confidence in U.S. assets. The market is waking up to
the fact that fiscal problems are not limited to euro zone
periphery countries.""
 The euro fetched $1.4575 , after hitting a 16-month
high of $1.4649 on Thursday.
 Putting a brake on the euro's rally for now were option
barriers at $1.4650. Comments from European Central Bank
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet that this month's rate increase
would not necessarily be the first in a series and that there
were no significant signs of second-round inflationary effects
also prompted profit-taking in the currency. [ID:nLDE73K14I]
 While the euro and other risk currencies are riding high,
some investors are starting to worry about a potential setback
and trying to protect their long positions by selling put
options, said a trader at a European bank.
 ""They hold long positions in cash, but they are also selling
options to guard against black swan events,"" the trader said.
Such flows are helping to push up euro/dollar implied
volatilities in recent days, with one-month volatility 
rising to around 11 percent from around 9 percent in early
April.
 Dollar/yen  traded at 81.84 yen, near a three-week low
of 81.61 yen hit on Thursday.
 It has broken below key support around 82.00 yen, a 38.2
percent retracement of its rise from a record low hit in
mid-March of 76.25 yen to a six-month high of 85.53 yen in early
April.
 Its next major support level is seen around 80.90 yen, a 50
percent retracement of the same rally.
 ""When it comes to the dollar/yen, I see limited downside
risks. Clearly there's stronger fear about intervention after
the earthquake than before. Even though it's not clear whether
Japan and G7 will intervene again, the fact that they carried
out joint intervention last month means a lot,"" said Teppei Ino,
currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The dollar also fell to a record low of 0.8782 Swiss franc
on Thursday before settling down at around 0.8862 franc 
on Friday.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2011 02:04AM ET</span>",Nippon Life: May increase unhedged foreign bonds holdings," By Hideyuki Sano and Takeshi Yoshiike	
 TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - Japan's top life insurer, Nippon
Life, may increase its foreign bond investment without currency
hedging if the yen rises to high levels, while it may reduce its
hedged foreign bond holdings because hedging costs are rising, a
senior executive said.	
 Nippon Life, with total assets of 49 trillion yen ($599
billion), also said it plans to allocate about 70 to 80 percent
of new money for the financial year that began on April 1, which
is expected to be around 1 trillion yen, to Japanese bonds.	
 The company, also known as Nissay, plans to increase its
buying of emerging-market equities, bucking a trend among most
Japanese life insurers to shun risky assets.	
 Nissay expects the global economy to recover moderately this
financial year but it believes the recovery will be patchy given
limited improvement in the U.S. job market, a possible slowdown
in emerging economies and fiscal tightening in Europe. The
company thus thinks the yen could see periods of strengthening
despite expectations of low interest rates in Japan.	
 ""We expect the yen to be boxed in a range but there will be
ups and downs and we expect there could be time when we buy
foreign bonds,"" said Yosuke Matsunaga, general manager of the
firm's finance and investment planning department, told
reporters on Thursday. His comments were embargoed until Friday.	
 ""We would like to increase our holdings of unhedged foreign
bonds if we can buy them at attractive exchange rates,"" he said.	
 While the company did not say at what level it would be
ready to buy dollars, it said it expected the U.S. currency to
be somewhere in the region of 75 to 95 yen at the end of the
current business year, compared with 83.15 yen in March. It
expects the euro to stand somewhere between 105 and 125 yen.	
 At the end of last business year, Nissay held about 2.39
trillion yen of unhedged foreign bonds. It bought a net 390
billion yen of unhedged foreign bonds in the year ended last
month, the company said.	
 It held 4.88 trillion yen of hedged foreign bonds, having
increased these holdings by 900 billion yen in the last
financial year. Investors can hedge their currency exposure to
foreign bonds by selling foreign currency in forward contracts.	
 Matsunaga said the company may reduce its hedged foreign
bond holdings as the cost of hedging -- which is determined by
interest rate gaps between two currencies -- is rising. 
 Expectations of credit tightening by the European Central
Bank, and to a lesser extent by the U.S. Federal Reserve, have
been boosting short-term interest rates in the euro and the
dollar in recent months, making currency hedging more costly for
Japanese investors.	
 ""We are looking at the cost of hedging, so on the whole,
we'll be looking to cut hedged bonds,"" Matsunaga said, adding
that the company has no specific target.	
 Nissay also plans to increase its yen bond holdings by
around 700-800 billion yen, after having increased them by 1.16
trillion yen in 2010/11, it also said.	
 It expects the 10-year Japanese government bond yield
to stay capped initially as the Japanese economy
is likely to be shackled by the damage from the earthquake and
power supply problems.	
 But the yield could gradually rise later in the year on
recovery in the economy as well as worries about Japan's
deteriorating fiscal health as the country needs to pay for
reconstruction after the disaster.	
 Nissay sees the 10-year yield moving between 1.0 and 1.5
percent in the year to March, compared with around 1.2 percent
on Friday.	
 The life insurer is more positive about stocks than many of
its competitors, which want to reduce holdings of shares to
reduce risk. It said it plans to increase its investment in
emerging-economy shares and maintain its holdings of Japanese
stocks.	
 ""Dividend income from Japanese stocks is not bad compared
with domestic bond yields,"" said Matsunaga.	
 Nissay also said it has no plans to reduce its exposure to
Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the crippled
Fukushima nuclear power plant.	
 TEPCO shares have fallen about 80 percent since the
quake. Nissay holds about 4 percent of the power company's total
shares and also holds TEPCO bonds.	
 ""Our yen bond investment is a long-term investment. we will
not act hastily even though we pay close attention to market
conditions,"" Matsunaga said.

 SHANGHAI, April 22 (Reuters) - Striking truck drivers
gathered for a third day on Friday in Shanghai's main harbour
district amid heavy police presence and signs the action has
already started to curb exports from the country's busiest
container port.	
 A crowd of up to 600 people milled about outside an office
of a logistics company near the Baoshan Port, one of Shanghai's
ports. Some threw rocks at trucks whose drivers had not joined
in the strikes, breaking the windows of at least one truck.	
 The strikers, many of them independent contractors who carry
goods to and from the port, had stopped work on Wednesday
demanding the government do something about high fuel costs and
what some called high fees charged by logistics firms, said the
drivers, who clashed with police officers on Thursday.	
 As many as 50 police officers were dispatched to the area on
Friday, and at least two people were arrested after throwing
rocks at trucks.	
 The strikes and protests, if they continue, could become a
worry for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which fears public
discontent that could erode its authority and alarm investors.	
 The crowd thinned out after a policeman said authorities
plan to meet with the representatives of the truck drivers on
Monday for talks aimed at ending the strike.	
 ""Please disperse and go back,"" he said with a loudspeaker,
telling truckers who had gathered near a road junction. ""We are
already talking to your representatives. There will be an answer
for you on Monday.""	
 Earlier, workers had told Reuters they planned to continue
the job action.	
 ""We are continuing our strike,"" said a 38-year-old truck
driver surnamed Liu. ""There has been no response from the
government or anybody else. There's nothing we can do.""	
 One driver, 31, who declined to give his name, said his
transport company was passing on more and more costs to drivers,
including for fuel, because it was making losses.	
 ""The market is just a mess now,"" he said.	
 Another driver surnamed Liu, 28, said his main problem
besides rising fuel prices was that police had started fining
drivers for all sorts of infraction without warning -- for not
meeting environmental standards, for instance.	
 He asserted that logistics companies were colluding to
charge them higher fees.	
 The strike comes against a backdrop of rising consumer
prices and fuel price increases. China's inflation rate hit 5.4
percent in March, prompting officials to renew vows to use all
available means to contain price rises. [ID:nL3E7FF0AC] 
 China's tightly-controlled state media has made no mention
of the unrest, and nor has the city's government, which is
working hard to turn glamorous Shanghai into a global financial
hub to compete with Hong Kong or London.	
 
 EXPORTS DELAYED	
 An official reached by telephone at Shanghai International
Port (Group) Co Ltd, which runs the Shanghai port, told Reuters
that the strike ""has not affected operations"", though would not
comment further.	
 But one executive said the action was already starting to
affect the port's operations, at least for exports.	
 ""The strike has delayed exports and many ships cannot take
on a full load before leaving,"" said Wei Yujun, assistant to the
general manager at China Star Distribution Center (Shanghai) Co.	
 ""For example, if one ship carries 5,000 containers en route
to Hong Kong and the U.S., now they can only carry 1,000 or
2,000 containers,"" Wei added. 
 Shanghai overtook Singapore in 2010 to become the world's
busiest container port. The Shanghai port handled 29.05 million
20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, in 2010 -- 500,000 TEUs more
than Singapore [ID: nTOE70700A].
    Shanghai's cargo throughput rose to about 650 million tonnes
in 2010, remaining the world's largest, up from 590 million
tonnes in 2009.
    The unrest is occurring near at least two of the port's five
major working zones -- Waigaoqiao, a massive free-trade zone and
bonded storage warehouse, and Yangshan, a deep water port.
    China said in early April it would increase retail gasoline
and diesel prices by 5-5.5 percent to record highs.
[ID:nSGE736009]. 
 Last May, a burst of labour disputes disrupted production
for many foreign automakers including Toyota and Honda, which
laid bare the rising demands of China's 150 million migrant
workers and raised questions about the region's future as a
low-cost manufacturing base.	
 ""The most fundamental issue from the strikes last year still
has not been resolved, and that is that workers still need their
rights,"" Li Qiang, Executive Director of China Labor Watch, told
Reuters from New York.  	
 ""In China, workers aren't permitted to have independent

imports
 * Firmer yuan put some strains on Chinese export orders
(Adds details, background)	
 BEIJING, April 22 (Reuters) - China's imports are likely to
grow at a faster clip than exports in 2011, leading to further
improvements in the country's trade balance, the Ministry of
Commerce said on Friday.	
 The projection of stronger imports follows from the
government's supportive policies and rising global commodities
prices, the ministry said in a report on trade outlook on its
website (www.mofcom.gov.cn).	
 ""Import growth is likely to continue to outstrip export
growth due to a combination of factors -- stronger domestic
demand, policies on expanding imports and rising global
commodity prices,"" the ministry said.	
 ""Export orders are increasing in line with the sustained
recovery of the world economy and improvements in the external
market, but the picture for exports looks complex,"" the report
said.	
 Some of the improvement in the overall balance will come
about simply from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in global
markets, which makes the imported value of dollar-denominated
commodities greater. The flip side of that is the difficulty
faced by Chinese exporters from a rising yuan that makes Chinese
goods less competitive globally.	
 Chinese exporters, particularly smaller exporters, are also
struggling to cope with rising raw materials and labour costs.	
 The central bank's repeated rises in interest rates and bank
reserve requirements have increased funding costs and led to a
strain on capital for some exporters, the commerce ministry
said.	
 ""In addition, the renminbi (yuan) is facing relatively big
pressures to appreciate, which have affected company orders to
some extent,"" it added.	
 The ministry did not give exact forecasts on exports and
imports for 2011.	
 China's trade surplus is on track to narrow for the third
straight year from last year's $183 billion.	
 China recorded a $1.02 billion trade deficit in the first
quarter -- its first quarterly trade deficit since 2004 -- due
to domestic economic strength and rising global commodity
prices.	
 China, under pressure from the United States and others to
let its yuan currency rise more quickly as a way to cut its big
trade surplus, is trying to imbalance its economy toward
domestic consumption, cutting reliance on exports and giving the
world a lift through surging demand for imports.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki	
 TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - Sentiment towards Japanese
stocks among retail investors fell to its lowest level for five
months in April as growing uncertainty on the country's economic
outlook following a devastating earthquake and tsunami weighed
on share prices, a monthly Reuters survey showed.	
 Japanese stocks were undermined on growing views that the
economic damage from the country's March 11 quake is likely to
be worse than previously expected as power shortages curtail
factory production and disrupt supply chains.	
 The poll also showed that investors were increasingly
critical of the administration of Prime Minister Naoto Kan and
its handling of the disaster, including the crisis at Tokyo
Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.	
 Investor sentiment was hurt as Japan raised the severity of
the nuclear crisis to a level 7, putting it on par with the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.	
 ""I feel it will take more time for Japan to recover from the
earthquake. The delay in resolving the nuclear crisis will also
hurt the country's strength,"" said a pensioner in his 60s.	
 Still, there were views that Japanese share prices will
regain strength due to demand linked to rebuilding the northern
part of the country in the quake's aftermath.	
 ""Share prices could weaken further due to concerns over the
disaster, but if we take account of reconstruction-related
demand then the current level of share prices is extremely
cheap,"" said an investor in his 40s.	
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those who
are bullish, declined 14 points to minus 44 in April -- the
lowest reading since November when the index fell to 60.	
 Still, it was well above the all-time low of minus 74 hit in
March 2009, in the wake of the subprime loan crisis.	
 The survey of 452 investors was taken between April 11 and
14, with the benchmark Nikkei average closing at
9,653.92 on the final day of the survey. That was up nearly 5
percent from 9,206.75 when the previous poll ended on March 18.

 A total of 83.4 percent of respondents said they disapproved
or strongly disapproved of the administration's response to the
crisis.	
 ""It's already one month but the government still hasn't
revealed a long-term road map for recovery. It also appears that
the pace of resolving the nuclear crisis looks very slow,"" said
a businessman in his 30s. 
 ""The government's response to the victims of the quake and
tsunami also looks very insufficient,"" he said.	
 Uncertainty over the outlook for the economy has increased
after the earthquake, but most investors said they are not
planning to change their investment strategies in the current
financial year to March 2012.	
 Fifty-four percent of respondents said they would keep their
investment strategies unchanged. About 23 percent of investors
said they would invest less than the previous year, while 22
percent responded that they would invest more in 2011/12.	
 The monthly poll, which is conducted anonymously, aims to
capture the views of readers of an online magazine aimed at
users of the Reuters Japan website http://www.reuters.co.jp

 * Euro rally stalled by option barriers, ECB comments
 * Yen near 3-week high, but intervention worries keep it in
check
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday,
undermined by the spectre of low U.S. interest rates and the
crushing weight of the U.S. budget deficit, with some players
looking for it to test an all time low when players return from
Easter holidays.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> slipped to a three-year low
of 73.735 on Thursday, having slipped below its 2009 trough of
74.170 on Thursday. It last stood at 74.077, about 4.7 percent
above its record low of 70.698 marked in March 2008.
 Trade was thin as many markets were shut for Easter. But
some participants said the greenback's downtrend looked set to
resume once players come back from holidays.
 ""The market was generally positive on risk, with VIX (market
volatility index) falling to a new low since the Lehman shock,
so that's helping to push down the dollar,"" said Koji Fukaya,
chief strategist at Credit Suisse.
 Some market players said there is a perception that a
fragile U.S. economic recovery could sputter if the White House
and Congress agree to reduce the deficit with significant
spending cuts or tax hikes, which would likely force the Federal
Reserve to hold interest rates at record lows even as other
central banks raise them.
 The dollar's slide accelerated days after Standard & Poor's
slapped a negative outlook on the United States' top AAA credit
rating earlier this week. The agency said a downgrade was
possible if authorities can't slash the massive U.S. budget
deficit within two years.
 ""Although the market's initial reaction to the S&P
announcement was muted, its impact is filtering through slowly,""
said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. 
 ""The biggest reason behind the dollar's fall is waning
investor confidence in U.S. assets. The market is waking up to
the fact that fiscal problems are not limited to euro zone
periphery countries.""
 The euro fetched $1.4560 , after hitting a 16-month
high of $1.4649 on Thursday even as yields on Portuguese and
Irish bonds soared.
 Putting a brake on the euro's rally for now were option
barriers at $1.4650. Comments from the European Central Bank
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet that this month's rate increase
would not necessarily be the first in a series and that there
were no significant signs of second-round inflationary effects
also prompted profit-taking in the currency. [nLDE73K14I]
 Dollar/yen  traded at 81.90 yen in early Friday trade,
having broken below key support around 82.00 yen, a 38.2 percent
retracement of its rise from a record low hit in mid-March of
76.25 yen to a six-month high of 85.53 yen in early April.
 Its next major support is seen at around 80.90 yen, a 50
percent retracement of the same rally.
 ""When it comes to the dollar/yen, I see limited downside
risks. Clearly there's stronger fear about intervention after
the earthquake than before. Even though it's not clear whether
Japan and G7 will intervene again but the fact that they carried
out joint intervention last month means a lot,"" said Teppei Ino,
currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The dollar also fell to a record low of 0.8782 Swiss franc
on Thursday. It last stood at 0.8869 franc .

 By Ronald Popeski	
 SINGAPORE, April 22 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered around
three-year lows on Friday and looked set to come under further
pressure next week, while a stronger yen weighed on Tokyo stocks
in holiday-thinned Good Friday trade.	
 Gold hit a fresh all-time high of $1,509 an ounce,
extending its record-breaking rally to a sixth session, as the
weaker dollar prodded investors towards assets less reliant on
the U.S. economy.	
 The dollar index was steady at 73.99 against a basket
of major currencies after slipping to its lowest since mid-2008
on Thursday, weighed down by expectations that the Federal
Reserve will keep interest rates at record lows for some time to
come and by bitter divisions in Washington over how to slash the
gaping budget deficit.	
 Analysts said it could extend recent losses next week, with
all eyes now on its record low of 70.698 struck in March 2008.	
 ""The biggest reason behind the fall is waning investor
confidence in U.S. assets. The market is waking up to the fact
that fiscal problems are not limited to euro periphery
countries,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp in Japan. ID:nL23389078]	
 Trade was expected to remain thin into early next week with
most markets around the world closed from Friday through Easter
Monday.	
 Japan's Nikkei-225 share average ended down 0.04
percent but pared initial losses after news that Renesas
Electronics , a major chip supplier to the auto
industry, would resume operations at an earthquake-hit factory
earlier than expected	
 Tokyo stocks had slipped in early trade as dollar weakness
boosted the value of the yen.	
 In Seoul, one of the other few Asian markets open on Friday,
the Korea composite Stock Price Index edged down 0.03
percent, while Shanghai fell 0.7 percent, shrugging off
gains in U.S. markets overnight.	
 Wall Street posted its first positive week in three as
healthy earnings news boosted the Dow Jones industrial average
by 0.42 percent, though gains were offset by the fact that
180 S&P names were due to report financial results next week.

 
 DOLLAR WOES	
 Adding to pressure on the dollar, data overnight showed the
U.S. economy was struggling to regain momentum.	
 Factory activity in U.S. Middle Atlantic states slowed
sharply in April, new jobless claims fell less than expected and
other reports showed steep declines in home prices in February.
[ID:nN21185697]	
 Data next week is expected to show U.S. growth slowed
significantly in the first quarter.	
 China's yuan hit another record high, trading at
6.5096 to the dollar in early afternoon as the central bank
fixed its mid-point at an all-time high.	
 Like many other Asian governments this year, Beijing appears
to have decided to allow more gains in its currency to help tame
imported inflation.	
 But analysts discounted any notion that the People's Bank of
China would oversee a one-off currency revaluation as it did in
July 2005, a move that could hurt exporters and place huge
pressure on the government.	
 Oil prices also remained high, with the weaker dollar
attracting more buying. U.S. Crude oil futures ended higher for
the third straight day on Thursday and Brent crude stood at just
over $124 a barrel.

 * Ex-USTR says Doha round doomed, urges salvage operation
 * Lamy says ""fundamental"" differences divide members
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - World Trade Organization
members face a somber Easter on Sunday because of a fight over
manufacturing trade between the United States and major
emerging economies like China, India and Brazil that could
finally kill 10-year-old world trade talks.
 WTO Director General Pascal Lamy, in a note accompanying
new WTO negotiating documents on Thursday, said differences
between countries over how much to cut manufactured goods
tariffs were ""unbridgeable.""
 That posed a ""serious risk"" to the rest of wide-ranging
negotiations that also cover agriculture, services and a number
of regulatory issues such as fish subsidies, anti-dumping rules
and non-tariff barriers, Lamy said.
 Members, including the United States, now face the tough
choice of whether to cling to long-held positions or to modify
their demands in the hope of striking a deal.
 But President Barack Obama's administration risks Congress
rejecting any agreement that does not create big new export
opportunities for U.S. farmers, manufacturers and service
companies.
 The Doha round was launched in 2001 in the capital of Qatar
with the goal of helping poor countries prosper through greater
access to markets in rich countries.
 Lamy's grim warning that the talks were on the brink of
failure came one day after a former top U.S. trade official
said the Doha round was ""doomed.""
 ""For years, the threat of being blamed for the Doha Round's
collapse has made it too risky for governments to suggest that
the talks are dead,"" former U.S. Trade Representative Susan
Schwab wrote in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs.
 ""But the pretense that the deal will somehow come together
at long last is now a greater threat to the multilateral
trading system than acknowledging the truth.""
 SALVAGE OPERATION
 Countries are expected to start thrashing over the question
of what to do next when the WTO's main negotiating forum
gathers next Friday in Geneva.
 Schwab argued that countries should try to salvage what
they can from the Doha round to bring the talks to a close in
2011, and then move onto new initiatives focused on reducing
barriers to trade in areas like healthcare, pharmaceuticals and
medical equipment or standardizing rules for e-commerce.
 She suggested harvesting a ""trade facilitation"" agreement
from the Doha talks which the Washington-based Peterson
Institute for International Economics has estimated could boost
global gross domestic product by more than $100 billion by
reducing the costs of moving goods across borders.
 Portions of the agricultural negotiations covering proposed
agreements on export credits, food aid, state-trading firms,
and the elimination of export subsidies could also possibly be
saved, Schwab said.
 Certain environmental agreements might also be within
reach, such as ""cutting subsidies to industrial fishing fleets
guilty of overfishing the world's oceans and ... ending tariff
and nontariff barriers to 'green' technologies in major
producing and consuming countries,"" she said.
 That would require giving up hope for a broader agreement
covering all of those elements as well as new market-openings
in agriculture, manufactured goods and services.
 But repeated effort has shown the differences in the market
access talks are too difficult to overcome, Schwab said.
 ""FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWS""
 Lamy said he concluded talks on manufactured goods were
unbridgeable after consulting with seven WTO members:
Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Japan and
the United States.
 Countries have already agreed most manufactured goods
tariffs would be cut by two formulas, one for developing
countries like China, India and Brazil and the other for
developed countries such as the United States, EU and Japan.
 Washington complains its formula would require it to
further cut its already low tariffs on most goods and
dramatically reduce ""peak"" tariffs on sensitive items like
textiles and trucks, while the developing country formula would
allow China, India and Brazil to keep much higher duties.
 To level the playing field, the United States wants those
countries to sign up for additional ""sectoral"" pacts covering
goods like chemicals, industrial machinery and electronics
where participants would reduce tariffs more aggressively.
 But China, India and Brazil are resisting U.S. terms,
creating the impasse. Members simply have ""fundamentally
different views"" in the manufactured goods talks, Lamy said.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar tumbled to
a three-year low against major currencies on Thursday and gold
prices surged to a record high as investors flocked to
investments that are less reliant on the U.S. economy.
 Strong U.S. and European corporate earnings propelled
world stocks to a 33-month high. Many U.S. companies have huge
chunks of business outside the country, where demand and
investments are growing, providing a cushion as the U.S.
economy shows signs of slowing again due to weak job growth
and rising oil prices.
 The dollar's decline accelerated this week after a warning
by Standard & Poor's on the United States' massive debt load
and as the economy showed signs of slowing. Equities markets,
however, were largely unaffected by S&P's warning.
 The dollar has already been hurt by the Federal Reserve's
near-zero interest-rate policy and overseas central banks'
diversification from the U.S. currency, despite the festering
fiscal problem in Europe. For details, see [ID:nLDE73K1LC]
 S&P said on Monday it might take away the United States'
coveted AAA credit rating within two years if Washington fails
to achieve a plan to slash its $14 trillion debt load.
 ""All these factors are just dollar negative,"" said Jessica
Hoversen, currency and bond analyst at MF Global in New York.
""Barring something happens in Europe, the dollar will probably
continue to turn lower.""
 But in noting Wall Street's resilience, she added, ""Stocks
are not backed by the credibility of the dollar and so many
U.S. companies are multi-national.""
 Emboldened investors are now piling back into riskier
assets, though some analysts advised caution as worries about
the euro zone's debt crisis and problems in the supply chain
following the Japanese earthquake stayed in the background.
 Expectations that the U.S. central bank will keep interest
rates at near zero for the foreseeable future, even as other
major central banks raise rates or are about to tighten, have
pressured the dollar in recent weeks.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.4 percent at 74.092
after falling to 73.735, its lowest level since August 2008.
Light holiday trading volume magnified foreign central banks'
gradual reduction of the U.S. dollar from their reserves.
 Technical charts suggested the U.S. dollar index could
move toward a record low of 70.698 hit in 2008. [FRX]
 U.S. financial markets will be closed Friday for Good
Friday, while British markets will be closed both Friday and
Monday for the long Easter weekend.
 STOCKS AND GOLD ADVANCE
 The weak greenback and inflation concerns raised the
appeal of gold. Spot gold  hit a record high at
$1,508.75 before paring gains, while spot silver  soared
to a 31-year high at $46.68 an ounce. [GOL/]
 ""People want hard assets and that's what people are
comfortable with,"" said Randy Billhardt, head of institutional
sales and trading at MLV & Co. in New York.
 Investors snapped up stocks as strong earnings
overshadowed weaker-than-expected economic data from Germany
and the United States.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose for
a third straight day. It was up 0.8 percent, touching a high
of 350.83, a level last seen in July 2008.
 Wall Street posted its first positive week in three, as
blowout results from Apple and strong results from a number of
industrial companies kept sentiment on the bullish side.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 52.45

The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> gained 1.3

 ""It's two steps forward, one step back. I don't see
anything in them that's concerning for the general direction

at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
 Thursday's U.S. economic reports supported the Treasury
bond market, reinforcing expectations that the Fed, which
holds a policy meeting next week, will pledge to keep interest
rates low well into next year.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 4/32 in price to yield 3.39 percent, down 0.01 percentage
point from late on Wednesday. [US/]
 The weaker outlook also reduced investors' expectations on
U.S. inflation. The five-year breakeven rate, which is the
yield gap between five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities and regular five-year government debt, fell to 2.31
percent, down 0.03 percentage point from late Wednesday.

 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled for a
third straight day on Thursday as record low interest rates and
the crushing weight of the U.S. budget deficit pushed it closer
to an all-time trough against major currencies.
 The dollar's slide accelerated days after Standard & Poor's
slapped a negative outlook on the United States' top AAA credit
rating. The agency said a downgrade was possible if authorities
can't slash the massive U.S. budget deficit within two years.
 Investors -- from fund managers to foreign central banks
that hold trillions of dollars in assets -- reacted by opting
for anything but the dollar.
 ""The combination of loose monetary policy and chaos on the
fiscal front has people very worried,"" said Boris Schlossberg,
head of research at GFT Forex in New York. ""That fear is being
reflected in the dollar.""
 Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of top bond
manager PIMCO, which has $1.2 trillion under management, said:
""Absent problems elsewhere in the world, history and economics
suggest that America's current fiscal and monetary policy
stance will put continued pressures on the dollar.""
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback against six
advanced country currencies, fell to 73.735, its lowest level
since August 2008. Analysts said that sets up a possible run
toward its record low of 70.698 touched in March 2008.

 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly for
a third straight day on Thursday as record low interest rates
and the crushing weight of the U.S. budget deficit pushed it
closer to an all-time trough against major currencies.
 The dollar's slide accelerated days after Standard & Poor's
slapped a negative outlook on the United States' top AAA credit
rating. The agency said a downgrade was possible if authorities
can't slash the massive U.S. budget deficit within two years.
 That prompted investors, from fund managers to foreign
central banks that hold trillions of dollars in assets, to opt
for anything but the U.S. currency.
 ""The combination of loose monetary policy and chaos on the
fiscal front has people very worried,"" said Boris Schlossberg,
head of research at GFT Forex in New York. ""That fear is being
reflected in the dollar.""
 Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of PIMCO,
with $1.2 trillion in assets under management, said, ""Absent
problems elsewhere in the world, history and economics suggest
that America's current fiscal and monetary policy stance will
put continued pressures on the dollar.""
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback against six
advanced country currencies, fell to 73.735, its lowest level
since August 2008. Analysts said that sets up a possible run
toward its record low of 70.698 touched in March 2008.
 The euro soared to a 16-month high above $1.46 before
easing to $1.4550, while the dollar fell 0.8 percent to 81.82
yen. The Australian dollar rose above $1.07, its highest in

 Talk that China may invest in Spain had investors shrugging

 The United States has historically insisted that a strong
dollar was in the country's interest. Market analysts, though,
say dollar weakness may be good news now insofar as it helps
revive exports and encourages debt reduction and saving.
 Last year, President Obama pledged to double export growth
by 2015, a policy that would benefit from a weaker dollar.
 ""I don't think the U.S. is actively seeking a weaker
dollar, but they're not unhappy with it either,"" Brown Brothers
Harriman strategist Win Thin told Reuters Insider. ""At the

the 30-year Treasury bond yield remained historically low at
4.47 percent. Debt-strapped euro zone countries such as Greece
have to pay nearly four times that just to borrow money for
five years.
 Where things go from here may depend on Asian central
banks. Since Monday, the euro has vaulted from $1.4155, and
analysts said few in the market were brave enough to counter
insatiable euro demand from Asian sovereigns.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar tumbled for
the third straight day on Thursday, as super-low interest rates
and the crushing weight of a massive budget deficit pushed the
greenback closer to an all-time low.
 The dollar's slide accelerated days after Standard & Poor's
sparked fears of a downgrade to AAA-rated U.S. debt by labeling
its outlook 'negative,' while investors from central banks to
fund managers opted for anything but the U.S. currency.
 Traders fretting over the Federal Reserve's controversial
zero-interest-rate policy found more to worry about with a
renewed run in weak economic data on jobs and regional
manufacturing and jobs.
 As long as the economy remains sluggish, it will be
difficult for the Fed to raise rates or for Washington to get
serious about dealing with the burgeoning national debt.
 ""If you look at all these big picture things, there's no
reason to buy dollars right now,"" said Ronald Simpson, director
of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a
basket of currencies, fell 0.6 percent to 73.952, having
slipped to 73.735, the lowest since August 2008.
 The chart outlook for the greenback looked dire after it
tumbled through a 74.17 trough hit in November 2009, a move
that may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in
March 2008.
 Expectations the Fed will keep benchmark U.S. interest
rates near zero for the foreseeable future even as other major
central banks have begun raising rates or are about to tighten
have pressured the dollar in recent weeks.
 Adding to the dollar's woes was a threat by Standard &
Poor's on Monday to cut the United States' prized AAA credit
rating.
 ""In the ugly dog currency competition the dollar is looking
like the really ugly dog. The euro zone at least looks to be
doing something about their debt problems,"" said a London-based
head of FX sales.
 The euro climbed to a 16-month high against the dollar near
$1.4650, partly helped by M&A-related demand and an increase in
risk appetite. The euro last traded at $1.4585, up 0.4
percent.
 Analysts said the euro looked on course for a move towards
$1.50 if the current momentum continues despite the possibility
of a Greek debt restructuring.
 ASIAN CENTRAL BANKS
 The euro has vaulted from $1.4155 hit on Monday and
analysts said that few in the market were brave enough to
counter insatiable euro demand from Asian sovereigns, which
have been seen swooping in to buy the currency whenever it
sells off.
 Asian authorities have increasingly had to intervene to buy
dollars to limit gains in their currencies and then recycle
dollar proceeds into the euro, Australian dollar and other
currencies.
 This has helped the euro to brush off ongoing worries about
the euro zone crisis, underscored this week by speculation that
Greece may have to restructure its debt.
 Support from China has also helped investors shrug off the
euro zone's debt woes. A senior Chinese official said on
Thursday Beijing stands ready to commit more money to help
stabilize the euro zone by buying more bonds after investing
billions of euros in the debt of Portugal and Greece.
 The Australian dollar soared to a post-float high against
the U.S. currency while the Canadian currency pushed up to its
strongest since late 2007, though traders warned the moves
could reverse as investors take profit on short dollar
positions before the long Easter weekend.
 Broad dollar weakness pushed the Swiss franc to an all-time
high of 0.8782.
 Against the yen, the dollar lost 0.8 percent to 81.80 yen,
hitting a session low after an index of business conditions in
the U.S. mid-Atlantic region came in well below expectations
and at its lowest since November 2010.

 By Sarah McFarlane
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Belgian shipper Safmarine is
loading its first Ivory Coast cocoa exports since the end of the
country's export ban, the company's head of commodity sales said
on Thursday.
 The 27,000 tonne Maersk vessel 'Norfolk' is being loaded by
Safmarine in Abidjan with cargo including cocoa, said
Safmarine's Didier Willemse.
 ""A few thousand tonnes of cocoa are being loaded. The cocoa
is destined for Northern European locations including Antwerp

 The world's top grower of cocoa is slowly recovering from a
violent post-election power struggle, which ended last week with
the arrest of former President Laurent Gbagbo.
 Earlier this week shippers said Ivory Coast cocoa exports
would reach normal volumes by the end of April at the earliest,
as authorities iron out new tax and customs procedures, banks
reopen and security improves.
 ""There are still a lot of local uncertainties, but at least
she's loading,"" Willemse said, adding 'Norfolk' was the first
ship Safmarine has loaded with Ivory Coast cocoa on since the
crisis.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2011 12:12PM ET</span>","INTERVIEW-Rabobank eyes Turkey, looking at bank license"," By Sara Webb
 UTRECHT, Netherlands, April 21 (Reuters) - Dutch lender
Rabobank is keen to apply for a banking license in Turkey
because of the potential for financing the agriculture and food
sector, its chief financial officer said on Thursday.
 Rabobank, a cooperative bank which is one of the top global
players in the wholesale agri and food business, wants to expand
in countries with a large agricultural sector, CFO Bert Bruggink
told Reuters in an interview.
 ""China, India, Turkey and Poland are very important
economies from that perspective,"" he said.
 Bruggink said Rabobank preferred to grow by expanding its
own business rather than through acquisitions, but did not rule
out making small acquisitions which could serve as ""stepping
stones"" for growth in such countries.
 Rabobank earlier this month got approval to open a branch
and establish a banking presence in India, allowing it to accept
deposits.
 It tried to buy a Turkish bank several years ago, but the
deal fell through, Bruggink said, adding ""we have no banking
license ... we are looking at applying.""
 Turkey, with a young, increasingly wealthy population of 74
million, is one of the emerging world's most attractive and most
highly capitalised banking sectors. Turkish media last month
reported that Rabobank was in talks with Turkey's banking
watchdog.
 Rabobank was one of the few Dutch lenders to come through
the global financial crisis unscathed, whereas its rivals, ABN
AMRO and ING, required billions of euros of state funds.
 ABN AMRO was nationalised, and will be sold most likely
through an initial public offering, while ING is in the final
stages of paying back the state.
 Bruggink said he expects to see consolidation in the Dutch
financial sector, including in asset management and private
banking, in the next five years, driven by the introduction of
new capital requirements and the aftermath of the financial
crisis.
 ""The landscape will change quite a bit,"" he said.
 Rabobank increased its own market share in areas such as
deposits as a result of the crisis.
 Today, Rabobank has a domestic market share of about one
third for investment banking, about 30 percent of the mortgage
business, about 40 percent of the savings sector, about 40
percent of private banking, and 85 percent of agricultural
business, he said.
 The bank made a record first-quarter net profit, Bruggink
said, adding that ""2011 so far looks very good,"" prompting the
bank to raise its profit forecast for the full year.
 Unlisted Rabobank publishes its full-year financial results
but not its quarterly figures. He did not provide further
details. 
 Rabobank reported record net profit for 2010 of 2.772
billion euros, up 26 percent from the previous year, and in
March had said that it expected 2011 to be ""challenging"".

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar tumbled to a
three-year low against major currencies on Thursday and gold
prices surged to a new high as investors flocked to investments
that are less reliant on the U.S. economy.
 The erosion of the dollar accelerated this week on signs of
a slowing U.S. economy and Standard & Poor's warning on Monday
that it might take away the United States' coveted AAA credit
rating within two years if Washington fails to achieve a plan
to slash its $14 trillion debt load.
 The dollar has already been bogged down by the Federal
Reserve's near-zero interest rate policy and overseas central
banks' ongoing diversification from the U.S. currency, despite
the festering fiscal problem in Europe.
 ""All these factors are just dollar negative,"" said Jessica
Hoversen, currency and bond analyst at MF Global in New York.
""Barring something happens in Europe, the dollar will probably
continue to turn lower.""
 Upbeat U.S. and European corporate earnings propelled world
stocks to a 33-month high. Although the U.S. economy is showing
signs of slowing again due to weak job growth and rising oil
prices, many U.S. companies have a huge chunk of business
outside the country.
 ""Stocks are not backed by the credibility of the dollar and
so many U.S. companies are multi-national,"" Hoversen said.
 Emboldened investors are now piling back into riskier
assets, though some analysts advised caution as worries about
the euro zone debt crisis and problems in the supply chain
following the Japanese earthquake stayed in the background.
 Expectations the U.S. central bank will keep interest rates
at near zero for the foreseeable future, even as other major
central banks raise rates or are about to tighten, have
pressured the dollar in recent weeks.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down by 0.3 percent to 74.147
after falling to 73.735, its lowest level since August 2008.
Light holiday trading volume magnified foreign central banks'
gradual reduction of the U.S. dollar from their reserves.
 Technical charts suggested the index could move towards a

 The weak greenback and inflation concerns raised the appeal

31-year high at $46.24 an ounce. [GOL/]
 ""People want hard assets and that's what people are

rates low well.

 * Emerging debt crises show possible upside of restructuring

 * Voluntary rollover akin to Vienna Initiative possible 

By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - As speculation about a Greek
restructuring intensifies, investors could do worse than to look
at how emerging economies have faced down debt crises.
 With some 300 billion euros ($428.3 billion) in outstanding
public debt, a Greek workout would be unprecedented. But past
credit crises suggest that restructuring, in tandem with
sufficiently rigorous fiscal reform, could draw a decisive line
under Greece's economic woes.
 Still, successful emerging-market restructurings may not be
easily replicated in Greece.
 ""One lesson from emerging markets is that if debt
restructuring is unavoidable, it's better to do it sooner than
later,"" said Athanasios Vamvakidis, European Head G10 FX
Strategy at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
 ""But in the case of significant contagion risks and large
contingent liabilities from the financial sector, it may be
better to wait,"" he added.

 Euro debt woes package: http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p
 Graphic on bank exposure: http://r.reuters.com/vyj98r
 Euro crisis timeline: http://link.reuters.com/xur78r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 A year after securing a 110 billion-euro bailout from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its European partners,
Greece remains mired in recession and is missing fiscal targets
set for its rescue.
 Investors rule out an outright default but many think Greece
should seek to renegotiate debt that is expected to hit 160
percent of gross domestic product next year. 
 
 BRADY CRUNCH
 Wide-ranging voluntary restructuring programmes such as the
Brady Plan could ostensibly be a template for a solution for
Greece and other indebted euro zone members such as Portugal.
 Launched in 1989 to help mostly Latin American countries
break out of a vicious circle of crippling debt costs and severe
contraction, the Brady Plan allowed creditors to swap defaulted
bank loans for a choice of new bonds, usually collateralised by
U.S. Treasury bonds.
 In the Greek case, the EU could offer to exchange sovereign
bonds for new debt issued by its collective bailout vehicle --
the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) or from mid-2013,
the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
 Even if the terms entice enough creditors, the restructuring
may not be sufficient to help drive a Greek recovery.
 Over half the 17 debtor countries that took part in the Brady
programme between 1989 and 1997 are now investment grade but
most of these are major commodity exporters that took at least a
decade before attaining that credit status.
 Greece's diverse investor base poses another hurdle.
 ""Greek debt is spread amongst a high number of investors
compared with emerging markets where you could negotiate with
the largest holders,"" said Kommer van Tright, portfolio manager
at Dutch firm Robeco.
 Ironically, the presence of the EU as a backstop offers
creditors little incentive to take part in a restructuring.
 ""An incentive to take part in the Brady Plan was that it
regularised payments on debt that many developing economies had
simply stopped servicing,"" said Phil Poole, HSBC Global Asset
Management's global head of macro and investment strategy.
 
 VIENNA CALLING
 Should enough creditors be persuaded to take part in a
restructuring, the EU would also have to avoid fanning market
fears over debt issued by peripheral euro zone countries, already
heightened after EU-led bailouts for Ireland and Portugal.
 Emerging markets have long laboured under the shadow of
contagion risk: Mexico's declaration in 1982 that it could no
longer service its foreign loans triggered a wider debt crisis
for Latin America while the collapse of the Thai baht in 1997
sent Asia into a tailspin. 
 But the size of Greek debt together with the country's
inclusion in the euro zone imply contagion from a Greek credit
event would surpass anything previously seen.
 Any restructuring that includes a ""haircut"" or forced losses
on the principal would hit bondholders that include European
banks and pension funds as well as the European Central Bank.
 Euro zone banks hold around 154 billion euros of Greek debt,
according to data from Bank for International Settlements.
 If restructuring is initiated, the EU would have to provide
some form of guarantee on euro zone bank deposits to prevent the
run on banks seen in Argentina in 2001 when its attempt to
exchange distressed debt ended in the largest ever sovereign
default at over $90 billion.
 Even if policymakers are willing to pay the price, Greece's
inclusion in the single currency imply a debt workout would not
have the same impact on growth as it has for emerging economies.
""In emerging economies, restructuring took place with
exchange rate collapse and this helped the countries regain
competitiveness. Devaluation is not an option for Greece,"" said
Vamvakidis, who worked at the IMF from 1997 to 2010.
 For the moment, a solution to the Greek quandary could come
from the emerging economies within Europe itself.
 At the height of the global financial crisis, EU
policymakers moved to dissuade Western European banks from a
large-scale and uncoordinated pull-out from eastern Europe under
the so-called Vienna Initiative.
 ""What cannot be excluded...is a 'voluntary' roll-over of
outstanding Greek debt...in line with the 'Vienna Initiative',
said Deutsche Bank in a note.

 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar tumbled for
the third straight day on Thursday, as investors dumped the
greenback and left little standing in the way of an all-time
low against a broad measure of currencies.
 The dollar was taking a hit from all directions as
investors fretted over ultra-low U.S. interest rates, the
threat of a credit rating downgrade, and the competition of the
euro as an alternative reserve currency.
 ""If you look at all these big picture things, there's no
reason to buy dollars right now,"" said Ronald Simpson, director
of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a
basket of currencies, fell 0.4 percent to 74.086 <.DXY>, having
slipped to 73.735, the lowest since August 2008.
 The chart outlook for the greenback looked dire after it
tumbled through a 74.17 trough hit in November 2009, a move
that may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in
2008.
 ""In the ugly dog currency competition the dollar is looking
like the really ugly dog. The euro zone at least looks to be
doing something about their debt problems,"" said a London-based
head of FX sales.
 Expectations the Federal Reserve will keep U.S. interest
rates at near zero for the foreseeable future, even as other
major central banks have begun raising rates or are about to
tighten have pressured in the dollar in recent weeks.
 Adding to the dollar's woes were a threat by Standard &
Poor's on Monday to cut the United States' prized triple-A
credit rating.
 The euro climbed to a 16-month high against the dollar near
1.4650, partly helped by M&A-related demand and an increase in
risk appetite. The euro last traded at $1.4543 , up 0.2
percent.
 Analysts said the euro looked on course for a move towards
$1.50 if the current momentum continues despite the possibility
of a Greek debt restructuring.
 The single currency has vaulted from $1.4155 hit on Monday,
and analysts said that few in the market were brave enough to
counter insatiable euro demand from Asian sovereigns, which
have been seen swooping in to buy the currency whenever it
sells off.
 Market participants say central banks have recycling dollar
proceeds into the euro, Aussie and other currencies.
 Asian authorities have increasingly had to intervene to buy
dollars to limit the gains in their currencies and then shift
them into other currencies and assets.
 This has helped the euro to brush off ongoing worries about
the euro zone crisis, underscored this week by speculation that
Greece may have to restructure its debt.
 The Australian dollar soared to a 29-year high while the
Canadian currency pushed up to its strongest since late 2007,
though traders warned the moves could reverse as investors take
profit on short dollar positions before the long Easter
weekend.
 Broad dollar weakness pushed the Swiss franc  to an
all-time high.

*Progress on non-tariff barriers, exemptions
*Members to meet on April 29

(Updates with quotes, background)
 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, April 21 (Reuters) - The disagreements keeping
trading nations from a deal to promote global free trade remain
""unbridgeable today"", World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Pascal Lamy said on Thursday.
 Lamy's statement came as the WTO published hundreds of pages
of legal texts outlining the state of play in the Doha round of
world trade talks that began a decade ago. The move was an
abortive attempt to restart the process.
 Doha is now at ""serious risk of failure"", Lamy said,
repeating a warning he has given many times in recent months.
 Lamy said the documents ""will leave no-one in any doubt
about the value of what is on the table"" -- a reference to the
belief liberalising trade can promote economic growth for all
countries.
 Members should ""use the coming weeks to talk to each other
and build bridges,"" he said.
 But he warned: ""I believe we are confronted with a clear
political gap which, as things stand .... is not bridgeable
today"".
 As expected, the continuing and widely flagged stalemate
centres on differences over tariffs on industrial goods -- a key
part of the non-agricultural goods or ""NAMA"" section of the
discussions, whose aim is to nurture trade by reducing tariffs,
subsidies, quotas and other barriers to it.
 Some countries, among them the United States, want to see
much bigger concessions on industrial tariffs by developing
countries like China, Brazil and India than they are willing to
concede, arguing in many areas they no longer need special
treatment. 
 The United States is on the other side of the debate in
agriculture, where others believe the world's largest importer
of goods should do more to open its large market for farm
produce.
 Washington has been defending its position in recent weeks
but had little to say on Thursday.
 ""We remain committed to finding a productive path forward in
the Doha negotiations, and believe that these new documents will
help members look at the complete picture of where things
stand,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk in a statement.
 Lamy had hoped by forcing through the publication of
Thursday's state-of-play documents and legal texts he would
kickstart progress on the talks, stalled on the same issues
since the last push for progress in 2008. 
 He has been acknowledging for weeks now a deal this year is
now unlikely.
 Free trade is widely seen by economists as a force for good
that promotes economic growth and pushes producers to focus on
their strongest suit -- favouring even the weakest as a result.
 But this is a view contested strongly by some organisations,
which mistrust the motives of the big private corporations whose
lobbying for market access sits behind the political progress.
 ""The Doha round, and the corporate globalisation model of
the WTO itself, offers no solution to the global employment,
food, and financial crises,"" said a statement from the ""Our
World Is Not For Sale"" network, a collection of
anti-globalisation groups.
 ""In fact, the rules embodied within the WTO itself actually
help set the stage for these types of crises"".

 DEAL WITHOUT NAMA?
 Pushing into the void where the Doha agreement could be are
an increasing number of bilateral trade agreements. Some see
these as the future of free trade, but others fear they could
hurt the weakest countries.
 Much progress has been made in some areas of the talks, and
some negotiators wonder whether these should be allowed to
progress without the stalled NAMA part.
 Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) is one such area, where
negotiators have hammered out plans to oil the wheels of customs
clearance, improve port efficiency and standardise regulations
for things like food hygiene regulations. 
 Blanket exemption from quotas and tariffs for the poorest
countries is another goal where there is broad agreement.
 The WTO's members are due to meet to discuss the next steps
for Doha on April 29.

 (Updates market action, changes dateline, previous London)
 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar tumbled to a
three-year low on Thursday against major currencies and gold
surged to a new high as investors piled into investments that
are less reliant on the U.S. economy.
 Upbeat U.S. and European corporate earnings propelled world
stocks to a 33-month high. Several U.S. bellwether stocks
jumped after strong earnings but many of those companies have
significant sales around the world.
 ""Strong earnings reports from a lot of companies have
driven risk appetite and we have seen huge moves in all dollar
crosses, but it would be surprising if we didn't see some
profit-taking,"" said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at
SEB in Stockholm.
 Investor focus has shifted to solid U.S. and European
corporate earnings and signs the global economy is chugging
along even as the Federal Reserve remains cautious about when
it will start to unwind its super-loose policy, offsetting
concerns over sovereign debt problems on both sides of the
Atlantic.
 This has emboldened investors to pile back into riskier
assets, though some analysts advised caution as worries about
the euro zone debt crisis and problems in the supply chain
following the Japanese earthquake stayed in the background.
 With little chance of Fed raising interest rates this year,
the dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.47 percent to 74.020 after
falling to 73.735, its lowest level since August 2008.
Technical charts suggested it could move towards a record low
of 70.698 hit earlier that year. [FRX]
 The weak greenback helped push spot gold  to another
record high at $1,508.75 an ounce. Spot silver  soared to
a 31-year high at $46.24 an ounce. [GOL/]
 The rally in precious metals was also seen in worldwide
stock markets.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5
percent to a high of 350.34, last seen in July 2008. The index
has risen around 6 percent so far this year.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.5 percent, while Wall Street stocks <.DJI> <.SPX>

 Asian stocks rose to their highest level since January 2008
with Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closing up 0.8 percent.
 Oil prices in London turned negative after a
weaker-than-expected reading on U.S. jobless claims stoked
worries over energy demand. ICE Brent June crude  had
risen above $124 a barrel earlier on the weakness in the dollar
and a drop in U.S. stockpiles. [O/R]

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2011 09:48AM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-BoE hawk Weale admits surprised by weak recovery," * Weale more surpised by weak recovery than inflation
 * BoE's May quarterly forecast key for his next rate vote
 * Data on wages, inflation expectations encouraging
 
 By Christina Fincher and Sven Egenter
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Britain's recovery in the first
quarter has been disappointing, Bank of England policymaker
Martin Weale said on Thursday, adding that the BoE's forecasts
in May could be crucial to his next vote on interest rates.
 Weale has voted for higher rates since January, and has been
in a minority of three on the nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee for the past three months.
 His comments in an interview with Reuters add to signs that
the momentum for tightening interest rates at the bank has
stalled after a very dovish set of minutes from April's policy
meeting on Wednesday.
 ""First quarter GDP is likely to be weaker than many people,
including myself, would have assumed,"" Weale said in the
interview at his office in the central bank.
 He said he would not be surprised if first-quarter GDP data
came in below 0.7 percent.
 A Reuters poll for quarterly GDP growth, due on April 27,
shows a median forecast of 0.6 percent, slightly down from the
0.7 percent predicted in a poll earlier this month.
[ID:nSLAEFE7SX]
 Overall, the recovery looked more fragile than past
rebounds, Weale said. ""It is likely to be a bumpy road.""
 ""On the basis of the numbers we have, it does look as though
the recovery has probably been weaker than one may have hoped
given the experience from previous recessions,"" he said.
 Weale said his voting decision next month would be guided by
the BoE's new growth and inflation forecasts. ""I want to wait to
see what the May forecasts look like before deciding what the
case (for tightening) looks like,"" he said.
 ""It's certainly true that the path of output has been weaker
than I had expected when I voted in January. The question is how
far something like that influences inflation prospects over the
sort of horizon that we're looking at.""
 Three months ago markets were pricing in as much as a 90
percent chance of a UK rate rise in May. Since then
disappointing output data and a surprise fall in UK inflation in
March have prompted a rethink and markets are currently not
fully pricing in a UK rate rise till November. 

 RECOVERY CONCERNS
 Weale said he had been more surprised by the weak output
data than the path of inflation in recent months, and said he
shared the view that recent data had highlighted the fragility
of the recovery.
 ""As far as I can tell weakness in construction seems to have
played a substantial role,"" he said. ""We had expected a bounce
back after December and the cold weather, and that's not the
pattern we're seeing.""
 Weale said a surprise fall in UK inflation last month to 4
percent was also a surprise, but cautioned against reading too
much into one month's figures.
 While rising price pressures remained a threat, Weale was
encouraged by the fall in inflation expectations shown by
Wednesday's Citi/YouGov survey, as well as the subdued nature of
recent wage deals.
 Britain's central bank has kept interest rates at a record
low of 0.5 percent since March 2009. But in recent months
divergences within the nine-member committee have increased.
 In April, arch-hawk Andrew Sentance called for a 50 basis
point rate hike, Martin Weale and Spencer Dale both called for a
25 basis point rise and arch-dove Adam Posen called for more
quantitative easing.
 However, Weale said divisions between policymakers were
often overplayed in the press. ""The sense I have is that views
among MPC are probably less far apart than the reporting of them
might suggest,"" he said.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Investors have a treat in store
in the coming week when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
'does a Trichet' and holds a press conference for the first time
following the bank's rate-setting meeting.
 It will be the highlight of a week -- shortened by holidays
in many places -- that also includes the first major auctions of
U.S. Treasuries since rating agency Standard & Poor's fired a
warning shot at Washington over the budget deficit.
 The three events -- rate meeting, press conference and
auctions -- all speak directly to one of the main issues hanging
over financial markets, which have entered a period of almost
daily swings into riskier assets and then out again:
 When is the Fed going to pull the plug on the extaordinary
loose monetary policy that has pumped up assets across the
board?
 Bernanke's press conference on Wednesday --- the first ever
regularly scheduled briefing by a Fed chief in the U.S. central
bank's 97-year history -- is an attempt by the Fed to
communicate clearly what is on its mind.
 ""Everyone is going to be looking at it,"" said Marc Ostwald,
strategist at Monument Securities.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has had
success communicating his bank's views via a post-meeting press
conference, with emphasis on so-called watchwords like ""strong
vigilance"" being used to gauge sentiment.
 Ostwald says investors will now be on alert for Bernanke
watchwords such as ""extended period"", to judge how long loose
monetary policy will run.
 The issue is crucial for investors of all stripes. World
equities, for example, hit a near 33-month high on Thursday
based in no small part on the availablity of cash engendered by
the Fed and others.
 The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, meets on Thursday with
monetary policy and the damage from Japan's triple disasters
still at issue.
 Economists at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development cut Japan's growth forecast to 0.8 percent from 1.7
percent because of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis.
 
 TREASURY TEST
 Investor focus is also likely to be on a series of U.S.
T-note auctions -- two-year, five-year and seven-year on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
 Such events usually go without a hitch and probably will
again. But they do come following S&P's change of its outlook
for U.S. government bonds to negative based on the country's
massive debt and deficit.
 While investors do not generally believe that S&P's move
will have any tangible effect, it has reminded them of the
argument that Washington's fiscal path is unsustainable.
 PIMCO, the world's largest bond fund, is already eschewing
U.S. government debt, while leading investor Jim Rogers says
Treasuries are a bubble.
 ""At some point along the line, people are going to realise
it's absurd to lend money to the United States government for 30
years in U.S. dollars at 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 percent interest,"" he
told Reuters Insider. ""The market is just going to give up.""
 He said the trigger could be when the Fed ends its
asset-buying quantative easing programme, scheduled for June.
 That said, a lot of the demand for shorter-term U.S. debt
such as that being auctioned in the next week does not come from
the mainstream investment community, but from governments and
government entities.
 Monument Securities reckons only 28 percent of shorter-term
U.S. government debt is in free float, meaning that its low
yields may be more a reflection of lack of supply than any
endorsement of U.S. economic sustainability.
 If this is the case, good auctions would not necessarily
imply broad investor approval of the U.S. fiscal performance.
 
 EARNING RESPECT
 The coming week will also bring more reports in what has
generally been a good corporate earnings season.
 Of the 100 S&P 500 companies that have reported
first-quarter earnings so far, 78 percent have either beaten or
met market expectations, data from Thomson Reuters StarMine
shows.
 In Europe, which started later, only 25 companies among the
those reporting for Q1 in the STOXX 600 have been heard from.
But 60 percent of them are above forecast.
 The week ahead brings the likes of Boeing, eBay,
Caterpillar, Microsoft and Dow Chemical
 With no sign of the euro zone debt crisis abating, European
earnings include some of the region's biggest banks, notably
Barclays, Santander, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, UBS and Creit
Suisse.

 By Fayen Wong
 SHANGHAI, April 21 (Reuters) - China's imports of many
commodities failed to rebound convincingly in March as strong
international prices deterred buyers and spurred local
production, while Beijing's aggressive monetary tightening cast
a pall over the outlook for the second quarter.
 Imports of copper and coal, which have feasted on strong
Chinese demand for the past two years, both fell by around 40
percent from a year ago. 
 Volumes were higher than in February, but that was a shorter
month with a week-long holiday.
 Imports of crude oil, iron ore, and nickel all rose slightly
from a year ago but the monthly tonnage was still far below
January's levels.
 Imports of refined copper, a bellwether of Chinese
manufacturing zeal, regained 21.5 percent from February but
still reached only 192,161 tonnes. 
 Any hope of Chinese demand reviving was badly dented by a
bulge in exports, surplus metal from China's own record
production of 470,000 tonnes during the month.
 The amount of refined copper leaving China in March totalled
36,768 tonnes, nearly as much as in the whole of 2010 -- but
valued at $355.5 million, up 17 percent.
 ""Copper's performance was quite poor and I think the
record-high domestic production played a big factor in limiting
imports,"" said Judy Zhu, a commodities analyst at Standard
Chartered Bank in Shanghai.
 ""Overall, we think the demand growth for commodities will
continue to slow on the back of the government's monetary
tightening measures,"" Zhu said.
 China, the world's largest consumer of coal, copper and iron
ore, has raised interest rates four times since October and
upped banks reserve requirements seven times to a record high of
20.5 percent in an all-out attempt to battle inflation.
 The Central Bank's moves have drained cash from the market
and sapped end-users' buying power, with smelters, steel
producers and trading houses struggling to secure loans and
smaller firms said to be experiencing cash-flow problems.
 The full impact of China's credit tightening may not have
fully flowed through its economy and the country's growth as
well as commodities demand may show a bigger slowdown in the
second quarter, some analysts have said.
 
 RARE EARTHS, NORTH KOREA
 China's apparent oil demand rose 10.9 percent in March from
a year earlier but fell 4.0 percent from February as refiners
produced less fuel and net imports fell.
 The data may add to a growing chorus of warnings that high
oil prices were beginning to hurt global demand, with the
International Energy Agency saying demand in top consumers China
and United States has already slowed.
 Coal imports in March rebounded to 9.05 million tonnes from
a 14-month slump of just 6.76 million tonnes in February, with
Indonesia, Mongolia and Vietnam the top three suppliers.
 Despite the rebound, the import volume was still near a low
posted in May 2009 and was substantially lower than the monthly
average of 13.7 million tonnes over the whole of 2010, adding to
analysts' concerns that China's demand for imported coal may
defy expectations and fall this year.
 ""Coal imports will be subdued this year. Although domestic
prices have increased, the gains still lag the increase in
international prices,"" said Helen Lau, an analyst with UOB-Kay
Hian in Hong Kong, who sees China's 2011 coal imports falling 25
percent this year to 120 million tonnes.
 High prices pushed Australia into fifth place among China's
coal suppliers in March, behind North Korea. Meanwhile Chinese
exports leapt to 2.6 million tonnes, largely thanks to a 1.4
million tonne sale to quake-hit Japan, more than double the
volume of trade a year previously.
 Exports of rare earth metals, a much smaller but lucrative
Chinese product, resumed in March after two months in the
doldrums, but remained a third lower than in March 2010. 
 Japan took 1,237 tonnes of the total 2,081 tonnes exported,
while the value of exports continued to soar, reaching $119,080
per tonne, up almost tenfold from a year earlier.
 China's iron ore imports rose one percent from a year
earlier to 59.5 million tonnes, but high stockpiles, uncertain
steel demand and monetary tightening all add to near-term
uncertainty.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a three-year low
against a basket of currencies on Thursday as strong corporate
earnings buoyed risk appetite in illiquid pre-Easter trade,
threatening to drive the greenback to historic lows.
 Ongoing expectations the Federal Reserve will keep U.S.
interest rates low battered the dollar to a 16-month low against
the euro around $1.4650, while traders said M&A-related demand
also pushed the single currency higher.
 Analysts said the euro looked on course for a move towards
$1.50 if the current momentum continues despite the lingering
possibility of a Greek debt restructuring, which would
exacerbate fiscal problems facing weak euro zone countries.
 At the same time, this week's threat by Standard & Poor's to
cut the United States' prized triple-A credit rating has knocked
dollar sentiment, reminding the market that the U.S. still has
massive debt problems.
 ""In the ugly dog currency competition the dollar is looking
like the really ugly dog. The euro zone at least looks to be
doing something about their debt problems,"" said a London-based
head of FX sales.
 The chart outlook for the greenback looked dire after it
tumbled through a 74.17 trough hit in November 2009, a move that
may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in 2008.
 The Australian dollar soared to a 29-year high while the
Canadian currency pushed up to its strongest since late 2007,
though traders warned the moves could reverse as investors take
profit on short dollar positions before the long Easter weekend.
 Signs of profit taking abounded in the European session,
with the Aussie stumbling ahead of options barriers at $1.0800
after surging as high as $1.0775.
 The euro was up 0.6 percent at $1.4605, with traders citing
bids from eastern European accounts above $1.46. Stops were
tripped on the way up after breaching an option barrier at
$1.4550 and the January 2010 high at $1.4583.
 The dollar index was at 73.874, having slipped to 73.735,
the lowest since August 2008 -- just before it surged during the
Lehman Brothers collapse -- as world stocks marched higher.
 ""Strong earnings reports from a lot of companies have driven
risk appetite and we have seen huge moves in all dollar crosses,
but it would be surprising if we didn't see some profit taking,""
said Richard Falkenhall, SEB currency strategist in Stockholm.
 Broad dollar weakness pushed the Swiss franc to an all-time
high, while gold prices also hit their strongest ever.
 
 EURO RESILIENT
 The euro looked poised for further gains, with the path
clearing for a run at the 2009 peak at $1.5145.
 It has vaulted from $1.4155 hit on Monday, and analysts said
that few in the market were brave enough to counter insatiable
euro demand from Asian sovereigns, which have been seen swooping
in to buy the currency whenever it sells off.
""People who have tried to sell euros so many times, they've
lost money trying to do so,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. 
 ""We're going to see them either stick to the sidelines from
now on, or next time we get an aggressive sell-off in
euro/dollar, they'll come in an buy on dips along with Asian
investor,"" he said adding that a climb to $1.50 in the next
month was possible.
 Market participants say central banks have recycling dollar
proceeds into the euro, Aussie and other currencies.
 Asian authorities have increasingly had to intervene to buy
dollars to limit the gains in their currencies and then shift
them into other currencies and assets.
 This has helped the euro to brush off ongoing worries about
the euro zone crisis, underscored this week by speculation that
Greece may have to restructure its debt.
 A German sentiment survey on Thursday was below forecast but
still suggested Europe's powerhouse is holding up well.
 The dollar lost 0.6 percent against the yen to 81.95 yen
, breaking support with a fall below 82.00 -- the intraday high
reached on March 18 when the G7 intervened to sell the yen.
 Trading activity may start to slow before the Easter
holidays, with European markets shut on Friday and Monday.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2011 07:44AM ET</span>",China says makes progress on use of copyrighted software," By Michael Martina	
 BEIJING, April 21 (Reuters) - China touted on Thursday
progress in its campaign to ensure government offices do not use
pirated software, but a senior official said that still less
than half was properly copyrighted, underscoring the challenge
ahead.	
 Two-fifths of central government offices were using legal
software and another two fifths were in the buying process, said
National Copyright Administration Vice Minister Yan Xiaohong.	
 Yan promised that all central government bodies would be
using registered copyrighted software by the end of May and that
by the end of October ""all local government offices at various
levels"" would be in compliance.	
 ""This is a very important for China to achieve
transformation of its economic development pattern and build an
innovative economy,"" Yan told a news conference.	
 China announced late last year that it would inspect
government computers to ensure they were not using pirated
software.	
 The United States and other Western countries have
repeatedly complained that China has not kept promises to stamp
out intellectual property theft.	
 Before President Hu Jintao's meeting with U.S. President
Barack Obama in January, mounting pressure had pushed China to
vow to crackdown on copyright piracy.	
 While China implemented a six-month campaign in November
aimed at counterfeit books, music, DVDs and software, all are
still openly available on Chinese streets.	
 U.S. officials said progress on illegal software had been
made during U.S.-China trade talks in December, but some experts
have argued it is difficult to rely on government claims that
computers are in line without verification.	
 Elliot Papageorgiou, an intellectual property rights lawyer
at Rouse Legal in Shanghai, said the government was unlikely to
allow verification systems to be built into software for

 The China Daily newspaper said on Thursday that the

other enterprises had ""fulfilled pledges to respect"" copyrighted

 Use of pirated software is also rampant in the private
sector and on personal computers. 
 Microsoft and other members of the Business
Software Alliance in the United States complained that nearly 80
percent of the software installed on personal computers in China
was pirated in 2009. [ID:nN14288545]	
 Despite its professed efforts, critics say China is
insincere in its attempts to curb violations and that it is
moving in slow motion to crackdown on vendors and producers of
infringing materials.	
 The International Intellectual Property Alliance, which
represents U.S. copyright industry groups, has estimated that
U.S. trade losses due to piracy in China surpassed $3.5 billion
in 2009. [ID:nTOE6AP06O]	
 China argues that it needs more time to perfect its system
of intellectual property protection, which cannot compare to the
West's 300-year tradition -- a concept that is wearing thin with
Western detractors.	
 ""China only began the process of IP protection since its
reform and opening up. To an individual, that may seem like a
long time, but from an historical development perspective 30
years is a rather short period,"" Yan said.

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Naoyuki Katayama	
 TOKYO, April 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance
plans to bolster its holdings of yen bonds this
financial year and keep risk asset holdings steady or trim them,
depending on market moves, a top executive said on Thursday.	
 Japan's second-largest life insurer, with total assets of
30.8 trillion yen ($373.5 billion), also said it plans to keep
holdings of hedged foreign bonds steady, but it may sell them
and shift back to yen bonds if overseas interest rates climb on
the back of a recovering economy in the year ending March 2012.	
 ""We're basically planning the same moves as last year --
we'll control the pace of adding yen bonds while observing
interest rate moves,"" Takashi Iida, manager of Dai-ichi Life's
investment planning department, told Reuters in an interview.	
 The insurer expects U.S. yields to gradually climb in line
with improvements in the U.S. economy, to around 4 percent next
March from about 3.3 percent now.	
 ""If foreign interest rates rise and Japanese rates stay
steady, obviously the returns on hedged bonds will decrease, so
we may consider selling foreign bonds and shift to yen bonds,""
Iida said.	
 Lower hedging costs, or a narrower spread between Japanese
and overseas short-term interest rates, encouraged top insurers
to move aggressively into hedged foreign bonds over the last two
years as an alternative to low-yielding JGBs.	
 Dai-ichi often tweaks its allocations between JGBs and
currency-hedged foreign bonds depending on market conditions,
Iida said. 
 He added the insurer wants to increase its holdings of
mostly superlong JGBs if yields rise, referring to 20- and
30-year debt.	
 Dai-ichi Life expects interest rates in Japan to edge up to
1.4 percent from the current 1.2 percent, with public finances,
further strained after the March 11 earthquake, pushing rates
higher.	
 But Iida added that the Bank of Japan will likely continue
its easy monetary policy, minimising the impact from strained
public finances on rates.	
 
 EURO RALLY BUMPY 
 Dai-ichi added that the euro's rally, boosted by
expectations of rate increases from the European Central Bank,
may not be smooth due to concerns over sovereign debt in the
euro zone's periphery countries. It predicts the euro zone will
hike rates steadily, once every few months.	
 It said that fiscal tightening in the euro zone may slow
growth. Dai-ichi expects the euro to trade between 110 and 130
yen in the year to March 2012. 
 The insurer also said the yen will probably weaken because
the Bank of Japan is expected to be the last major central bank
to look to exit its stimulative policies. 
 Dai-ichi Life sees the dollar trading between 80 and 95 yen
this financial year, Iida said, adding that the insurer's
forecast is for the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest rates
in the January-March quarter of 2012.	
 
 REDUCING RISK	
 Dai-ichi, which made its debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
last year following an $11 billion initial public offering,
would either keep steady or trim its holdings of Japanese stocks
and alternative investments, as it tries to further limit its
exposure to risky assets.	
 The company said it may either sell domestic stocks or hedge
via derivatives, depending which method is cheaper. Investments
in overseas equities will probably remain unchanged and there is
no plan to reduce these holdings.	
 Japanese insurers have been reducing Japanese shares for
many years ahead of the introduction this financial year of new
government regulations that raise the risk weighting on stocks
and other risky assets that insurers hold.	
 Dai-ichi declined to comment on both bonds and shares of
Tokyo Electric Power Co , the operator of a crippled
nuclear power plant in Fukushima.	
 It is one of the biggest shareholders of Tokyo Electric
shares, which have tumbled 80 percent since the quake and
tsunami triggered a nuclear crisis.	
 Dai-ichi's shares are 16.3 percent down from pre-quake
levels, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei index's fall of 7
percent.

 * Underlying consumer demand trend still weak - analysts
 * Figures not seen swaying Bank of England on interest rates

(Adds lending data, Sports Direct results, quote)
 By Fiona Shaikh and David Milliken
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - British retail sales rose
unexpectedly in March, helped by stronger food sales but doing
little to alter a picture of fragile consumer demand that is
deterring the Bank of England from raising interest rates.
 Other data showed the government borrowed slightly less in
the 2010/11 fiscal year than its fiscal watchdog had predicted
last month, but the finance ministry said this did not lessen
the need for it to press on with hefty public spending cuts.
 The Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes
including automotive fuel rose 0.2 percent last month,
confounding forecasts for a 0.5 percent fall, after February's
0.9 percent decline.
 Analysts had been braced for a weak number after a very poor
British Retail Consortium survey last week, and the pound hit a
fresh 16-month high versus the dollar and strengthened against
the euro after the data.
 But on the quarter, sales volumes were just 0.3 percent
higher, showing the sector poised to make only a modest
contribution to first-quarter GDP data due next week.
 ""These figures and those from the last couple of months are
not really showing the retail sector as being a picture of
health,"" said Victoria Cadman, economist at Investec.
 ""I suspect the Monetary Policy Committee will not see this
as a sign that consumer demand is gathering pace.""
 Year-on-year, retail sales were 1.3 percent higher.
Economists had forecast a month-on-month fall of 0.5 percent and
an annual rise of 0.9 percent.
 The ONS said the monthly increase was driven by the
strongest rise in food store sales since June. Sales at garden
centres and sports good stores were boosted by better weather
this March than last year. Non-store sales, which includes
internet retailing, also rose strongly. 
 Retailers have been complaining about tough conditions on
the High Street as consumers face rising prices, higher taxes
and muted wage growth. The biggest public spending cuts in a
generation also prompt worries about job security for many.
 British supermarket chain Tesco said this week it failed to
meet its UK profit expectations for the last year and expected
conditions to remain challenging. 
 Sportswear retailer Sports Direct, however, on Thursday
posted higher sales and profit, helped by growth in its core UK
business.
 
 PUBLIC BORROWING DOWN
 Britain is pressing on with spending cuts aimed at
eliminating the budget deficit over the next four years and
separate data showed the government's preferred measure of
public borrowing fell to 141.1 billion pounds ($232.1 billion)
compared to 145.9 billion predicted at last month's budget.
 ""As this week's action by S&P (on the United States) has
shown, concerns over deficits persist for even the largest
economies, and we need to stick to our plan to pay off the
nation's credit card,"" a Treasury spokesman said.
 The UK Debt Management Office said it would cut the amount
of bonds it will issue in 2011/12 by 1.5 billion pounds to 167.5
billion, due to the lower 2010/11 borrowing figures.
 Separate figures released by the Bank of England showed that
major UK lenders approved 44,000 mortgages for house purchase in
March, up from 43,000 in February.
 Despite the modest rise, approvals are still running at
around half their long-run levels. The net lending flow to UK
businesses fell by 0.4 billion pounds in February, versus a 2.7
billion pound decline in January.
 ""The housing market clearly is still very weak, which does
not bode well for house prices,"" said Howard Archer, economist
at IHS Global Insight.

 * Belarus maintains dual exchange rates
 
 MINSK, April 21 (Reuters) - Belarus said on Thursday it was
targeting a rouble exchange rate of 3,800-4,100 per dollar, much
stronger than rates of around 5,000 seen since the central bank
allowed the currency to float freely for trade between banks.
 The rouble has lost more than a third of its value against
the dollar on the interbank market since Belarus this week
dropped restrictions on the exchange rate used by banks and
companies, opening the door to a partial devaluation.
 ""Once we have a balanced exchange rate, we will work
according to our plan of unifying the exchange rate,"" Deputy
Prime Minister Sergei Rumas said on Thursday.
 ""In my opinion, this exchange rate is in the range of
3,800-4,100 per dollar. Today that fits in with the state of our
economy,"" Rumas told Reuters.
 Rumas called the current interbank rate -- around 5,000
roubles per dollar according to bankers -- ""unrealistic"".
 The central bank kept the official exchange rate, used for
mandatory export revenue sales and retail cashpoint operations,
at 3,055 roubles per dollar on Thursday. It has said it will
unify the two rates later.
 Analysts say the rouble's plunge reflected a surge in demand
from players who had been unable to buy dollars for weeks while
the rate was regulated. Belarus has lost a quarter of its
foreign currency reserves this year trying to support the
rouble.
 This week's developments have highlighted the currency
problems of the ex-Soviet republic and are a setback for
President Alexander Lukashenko, who is due to deliver his annual
state of the nation speech later on Thursday.
 Coming nine days after a bomb blast at a Minsk metro station
that killed 13 people, the rouble's fall has added to the misery
for Belarussian citizens promised better times ahead when
Lukashenko was re-elected for a fourth term last December.

 * Says Finland must have clear stance on Portugal by mid-May
 * Turnaround in Portuguese polls ahead of election
 By Terhi Kinnunen 
 HELSINKI, April 21 (Reuters) - Finland's finance minister,
set to lead the next government, said on Thursday he expected
Helsinki to play its part in a financial rescue for Portugal in
mid-May despite a Eurosceptical party's big election gains.
 Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen sought to reassure euro zone
partners and financial markets after a surge in support for the
True Finns party, likely to be in the new coalition, caused
jitters because of its opposition to paying for another bailout.
 ""The new, incoming government must have a clear stance on
the Portugal matter, as well as on the temporary and permanent
mechanisms,"" Katainen told reporters. His conservative National
Coalition party won the most votes in Sunday's general election.
 ""Before May 16, Finland has to have a stance,"" he said.
Asked whether he still supported giving financial aid to
Portugal, he said: ""Yes.""
 A Reuters poll of Finnish political scientists and market
analysts found they all expect the True Finns to join the next
government. A big majority expect Helsinki will ultimately back
the Portuguese bailout nevertheless.
 The European Commission's top economic official, Olli Rehn,
who is also Finnish, said Finland needed to agree on a stance on
assistance to Portugal by a May 16 euro zone finance ministers'
meeting to avoid pushing Lisbon towards a potential default.
 ""Democracy and election reulsts have to be respected,"" Rehn
told the daily Helsingin Sanomat in an interview. ""But in
parallel with that, the euro group must be able to make such
decisions that prevent Portugal from drifting into insolvency.""
 
 PORTUGUESE POLLS TURN
 Officials from the Commission, the European Central Bank and
the International Monetary Fund are in Lisbon working out
conditions for an economic assistance programme with the
caretaker Portuguese government.
 Portugal needs an EU decision in May because it faces a
major debt redemption in mid-June, days after a June 5 general
election which the latest opinion poll suggested could end in a
dead-heat requiring difficult coalition negotiations.
 Rehn indirectly dismissed the idea, raised by True Finns
leader Timo Soini and the second-placed Social Democratic Party,
that there could be an alternative rescue package involving
burden-sharing by private sector banks and investors.
 ""Support for Portugal requires the existing mechanism which
is able to go directly to the markets,"" he was quoted as saying.
""Using it requires unanimity.""
 In Portugal, a poll showed a dramatic turnaround in public
opinion since campaigning started for an early general election,
forced when the minority Socialist government lost a vote in
parliament last month on additional austerity measures.
 Caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates' Socialist Party
overtook the main opposition Social Democrats by a narrow margin
for the first time in the survey released on Thursday.
 With six weeks until polling day, the Socialists had 36.1
percent of voting intentions, 11.6 percentage points higher than
in the previous poll by Marktest pollsters last month, while the
Social Democrats fell around 12 points to 35.3 percent.
 Markets have been roiled this week by speculation that
Greece, the first country to receive an EU/IMF bailout last May,
may have to restructure its 325 billion euro debt, which is
equivalent to about a year and a half of economic output.
 Almost 85 percent of participants in a Reuters poll taken
this week said Greece will have to restructure its debt, despite
firm denials from Athens.
 Greek credit default swap (CDS) prices, a sort of insurance
against insolvency, showed a 70 percent probability of default
within five years, according to Reuters calculations from Markit
data.
 The Greek government, which hopes to tap expatriates later
this year by issuing so called ""diaspora bonds"", asked a public
prosecutor on Wednesday to investigate an email it said came
from a major investment bank that fuelled rumours by suggesting
a restructuring was imminent.
 ""Such rumours are obviously ridiculous,"" the finance
ministry said. Greek bank shares recovered by 1.5 percent on
Thursday after falling 4.58 percent on Wednesday.
 Ireland, the other euro zone country to have received a
bailout last year, said on Thursday it was unlikely to sell off
state assets this year after an official report recommended that
up to 5 billion euros in state property be sold.
 The government-funded report recommended on Wednesday the
sale of public stakes in national carrier Aer Lingus and parts
of energy utilities Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gais as
part of the bailout agreement.
 But Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin told
state broadcaster RTE: ""If you ask if anything will be sold this
year, it probably is unlikely.""
 The Irish government suffered a setback late on Wednesday
when holders of subordinated bonds in Allied Irish Banks
launched a legal challenge to its plans to slash the bonds'
value by about 80 percent.
 The appeal against a High Court order giving the right to
impose changes to the terms of 2.6 billion euros of AIB
subordinated bonds will be heard on May 9.

 By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Douwe Miedema 
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Britain is probing investment
banks over insurer Prudential Plc's failed $35.5 billion bid for
rival AIG's Asian business AIA last year, two people familiar
with the matter said.
 The probe, ordered by the Financial Services Authority,
would examine the ""circumstances surrounding the whole process,""
which left Prudential shouldering costs of 377 million pounds
($620.2 million), one of the sources said.
 ""It is happening. It is focused on the advisors and whether
they discharged their duties properly,"" the other person said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
 AIA's parent AIG walked away from the deal last June, after
Prudential tried to cut its bid price in a last-ditch attempt to
woo shareholders baulking at the massive expense and a $21
billion rights issue.
 Prudential Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam -- who had embarked
on the deal in his first year in the job -- managed to survive
the debacle, though there was pressure for him to go.
 The deal was also marred by a last-minute regulatory delay,
when the FSA worried the insurer's capital might not be
sufficient to withstand stress tests, and the complexity of a
deal that involved 22 jurisdictions.
 The FSA was now examining the failed deal, the sources said,
and the role of the three main advisors: Credit Suisse, JPMorgan
and HSBC.
 Prudential, the FSA, HSBC and Credit Suisse declined to
comment. JPMorgan could not immediately be reached.
 The probe is a so-called ""Section 166"" investigation, which
could lead to enforcement action by the FSA. In such an
investigation, the FSA orders a company to commission a report,
normally from a large law or accounting firm.
 The Financial Times said lawyers Clifford Chance had been

 TOKYO, April 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance
plans to bolster its holdings of yen bonds this

 Japan's second-largest life insurer, with total assets of

 * Euro/dollar above $1.46, poised to push towards $1.50
 * Risk of profit-taking seen before Easter holidays

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled to a
three-year low against a basket of currencies on Thursday as
strong corporate earnings buoyed risk appetite in illiquid
pre-Easter trade, threatening to drive it to historic lows.
 The euro jumped to 16-month highs and looked on course for a
move towards $1.50 if it holds onto these gains. Currencies like
the Australian and Canadian dollars also surged, though some
traders warned the moves could reverse as investors take profit
on short dollar positions before the long Easter weekend.
 The chart outlook for the greenback looked dire after it
tumbled through a 74.17 trough hit in November 2009, a move that
may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in 2008.
 A series of records have been broken, with gold vaulting to
all-time highs above $1,500 an ounce and the Aussie powering to
29-year peaks above $1.07, while the Singapore dollar, Swiss
franc hit all-time highs.
 However, there were signs of profit-taking, with the Aussie
stumbling ahead of options barriers at $1.0800 after surging as
high as $1.0775.
 ""Strong earnings reports from a lot of companies has driven
risk appetite and we have seen huge moves in all dollar crosses,
but it would be surprising if we didn't see some profit-taking,""
said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.
 The outlook was dim for the dollar, with this week's threat
by Standard & Poor's to cut the United States' prized AAA rating
reminding the market of the huge debt problems facing the
world's largest economy.
 ""We are seeing a switch in focus from European to U.S.
sovereign debt problems,"" Falkenhall said.
 The euro was up 0.8 percent at $1.4636 after jumping to a
16-month high of $1.4641 on EBS, triggering stops on the way up
after breaching an option barrier at $1.4550 and the January
2010 high at $1.4583.
 The single currency looked poised for further gains, with
the path clearing for a run at the 2009 peak at $1.5145.
 ""We could see some profit taking/position reduction
following these strong moves ahead of the Easter weekend. Bear
in mind that liquidity is drying up with much of Europe and
various Asian countries on public holidays from tomorrow,"" a
London-based trader said.
 The dollar index fell 0.7 percent from late New York trade
to 73.799, the lowest since August 2008 -- just before it surged
during the Lehman Brothers collapse as investors scrambled for
safe-havens.

 EURO RESILIENT
 The euro was buoyant, shrugging off ongoing worries about
the euro zone crisis, underscored this week by reports that
Greece may restructure its debt in coming months.
 A solid auction of Spanish debt the previous day helped
provide some reassurance that the problems plaguing Greece,
Ireland and Portugal would not spread to the country seen as the
next most vulnerable in the euro zone.
 Traders and analysts also cited central banks recycling
dollar proceeds into the euro, Aussie and other currencies.
 Asian authorities have increasingly had to intervene to buy
dollars to limit the gains in their currencies and then shifting
them into other currencies and assets. Traders said this was
creating a vicious circle that drags the dollar lower.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.5 percent at $1.0758 after
pushing to its highest since being floated in the early 1980s.
For the week, the Aussie was up 1.9 percent, making it the best
performer among G10 currencies.
 ""The AUD is burning, burning hot,"" said one trader at
another European bank in Singapore.
 The dollar dipped 0.5 percent against the yen to 82.05 yen,
having earlier broken chart support with a fall below 82.00 --
the intraday high reached on March 18 when the G7 intervened to
sell the yen.
 Trading activity may start to slow before the Easter
holidays, with European markets shut both Friday and Monday.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - World equities jumped to their
highest level in nearly 33 months on Thursday while the dollar
hit a three-year low as upbeat U.S. and European corporate
earnings spurred investors into higher-yielding assets.
 Gold surged to a lifetime high for a fifth straight session
on the sharply weaker dollar, with lingering tensions in the
oil-producing Middle East offering additional support.
 Investor focus has shifted to solid U.S. and European
corporate earnings and signs the global economy is chugging
along even as the Federal Reserve remains cautious about when it
will start to unwind its super-loose policy, offsetting concerns
over sovereign debt problems on both sides of the Atlantic.
 This has emboldened investors to pile back into riskier
assets, though some analysts advised caution as worries about
the euro zone debt crisis and problems in the supply chain
following the Japanese earthquake stayed in the background.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index advanced almost 0.7 percent
to a high of 350.34, last seen in July 2008. The index has risen
around 6 percent so far this year.
 ""After a slow start, earnings have improved quite rapidly
and results from companies such as Intel and Apple have
certainly boosted investor sentiment,"" said Keith Bowman, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
 ""There is some nervousness in the background, particularly
in relation to the situation in Japan and what that means for
the supply chain, but as of today the markets have concentrated
on good corporate results.""
 German business sentiment fell in April as expectated, the
closely-watched Ifo survey showed. The FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent at a one-week
high, with technology stocks leading gains after iPod maker
Apple smashed earnings forecasts.
 Asian stocks recovered sharply from a stumble earlier in the
week and rose to their highest level since January 2008 while
the emerging stocks index climbed 0.9 percent.
 The rally in equity markets cooled demand for safe-haven
government bonds, pushing U.S. and euro zone benchmark German
debt lower, though lingering concerns about the currency bloc's
sovereign debt crisis limited losses.

 GRIM DOLLAR OUTLOOK LIFTS GOLD 
 With little chance of the Fed raising interest rates any
time soon, the dollar index fell 0.85 percent to 73.737, its
lowest level since August 2008. Technical charts suggested it
could move towards a record low of 70.698 hit earlier that year.

 ""Strong earnings reports from a lot of companies have driven
risk appetite and we have seen huge moves in all dollar crosses,
but it would be surprising if we didn't see some profit-taking,""
said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.
 The sharply weakening U.S. dollar has suffered the most
against commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars, as well as emerging markets currencies such as
the Singapore dollar, as some policymakers in Asia allow more
currency strength to fight imported inflation.
 Brazil's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate on
Wednesday to 12 percent from 11.75 percent as it seeks to rein
in consumer prices.
 Spot gold hit a record high of $1507.19 an ounce and spot
silver soared to a 31-year high while the Australian dollar
powered to peaks above $1.07 -- a level not seen since the
currency became free-floating in the early 1980s.
 For the week, the Aussie was up 1.8 percent, making it the
best performer among G10 currencies.
 The euro pushed to 15-month peaks but has lagged the broader
move due to resurgent worries about the euro zone crisis.
Markets remain concerned that Greece is on the verge of
announcing a debt restructuring, despite repeated denials by

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 21, 2011 03:47AM ET</span>",Forex - Broadly weaker dollar falls to 17-day low against yen,
1513,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2011 03:44AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Next stop for high-flying Australian dollar: $1.10," By Krishna Kumar and Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, April 21 (Reuters) - Hot commodity prices that have
propelled the Australian dollar's meteoric rise could soon push
it to $1.10, its strongest since 1982 and a level that several
weeks ago was considered unthinkable, though its momentum may
slow considerably from there.	
 The Aussie, as it is called by dealers, has had a remarkable
10 percent climb against the U.S. dollar since mid March to a
post-floatation high of $1.0775, buoyed by relatively attractive
interest rates, high metals prices and a persistent trade
surplus. 
 It has posted an even steeper 16 percent rise versus the
yen, as carry trade strategies that finance purchases of
high-yielding currencies and assets with low interest rate
currencies come back in force.	
 The rapid rise above parity has seen the Aussie strengthen
by roughly 1.6 cents a week since late March and the run, which
has been driven by a variety of investors, may not be over yet.
At this rate, the Aussie will test $1.10 in the next few weeks.	
 ""If you think the global economy is going to continue to
gradually recover, then it would be dangerous to short the
Australian dollar, apart from a short-term trade,"" said Shane
Oliver, head of investment strategy at Australia's AMP Capital
Investors, which as A$98 billion in assets under management.

 Momentum funds, Japanese retail investors, corporate
accounts and even Asian central banks have been cited by dealers
as buyers of Aussie in the past several weeks, not really
fitting the pattern of a speculative-driven frenzy that can
launch a currency and then just as quickly cause it to tumble as
profits are taken and positions closed.	
 
 THE HIGHER IT RISES...	
 Technical analysts have had their work cut out for them
because of the Aussie's seemingly inexorable rise.	
 But the $1.10 level may represent a formidable top for the
currency, using Elliott wave analysis as a guide. Elliott wave
tracks the very long-term historical patterns and trend changes
in an asset. 
 The Aussie may be in a corrective pattern, measured in three
legs A, B and C. In this view, it is close to forming a wave C
that ends at $1.1083. Wave A extended from 2001 to 2008, when
the Aussie climbed to $0.9851 from $0.4775, Reuters Matching
showed.	
 The global financial crisis triggered wave B, a sharp fall
to $0.6007 that is now being reversed in a wave C pattern. In
Elliott analysis, the size of the move in wave C should equal
that in wave A. 
 That means $1.1083 could be a major top. Of course, a
sustained break above that level would reset the so-called wave
count and therefore change the targets of the analysis.	
 Further out, longer-term investors looking at the charts may
want to consider how relatively well Fibonacci projections have
held up.	
 The 161.8 percent projection of 2010's move from $0.9389 to
the year's low of $0.8066 was $1.0236. This level had capped
rallies for the past six months -- that is, until the current
move above parity began last month.	
 The 161.8 percent extension of 2008's large decline from
$0.9851 to $$0.6007 in the midst of the financial crisis mayhem
is roughly $1.2225. 
 
 THE HARDER IT FALLS?	
 A march higher in the Aussie will not be in a straight line,
though. The temptation to take profits, even ahead of $1.10 or
90 yen, is strong, especially among short-term investors.	
 For example, the net long position of Japanese retail
investors who trade on margin has been trimmed to A$1.2 billion
from A$3.1 billion in mid March when the latest rally in the
Aussie began. These investors might be tempted to increasingly
cut their still-sizable long position as Aussie nears $1.10. 
 The Aussie is expected to decline to $1.00 in six months and
then $0.98 by this time next year, median forecasts of the
latest Reuters poll showed. 
 Those who see longer-term support for the Aussie suggest
even a serious bout of profit taking will not change the
uptrend, which should continue as Asian central banks look to
further diversify their holdings as they accumulate more U.S.
dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating too quickly.	
 A growing source of support for the Aussie actually comes
from exporters, who provide underlying demand now that Australia
is running consistent trade surpluses. For their part, the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been publicly sanguine so
far about the impact of Aussie strength on exporters.	
 Constant talk of mergers and acquisitions in the booming
mining industry and expectations for more rate hikes are also
underpinning the currency.	
 Indeed, thanks to the unprecedented mining investment boom
worth hundreds of billions of dollars, the RBA is predicting the
economy will grow at a healthy 4 percent pace each of the next
two years.	
 This means the RBA, which has increased rates by 175 basis
points since October 2009, will eventually resume tightening
after being on hold for the past five months.	
 While interbank markets see only a one-in-three chance of
the next rate hike coming by Christmas, many analysts expect the
4.75 percent cash rate to rise to 5.25 percent by year-end and
5.5 percent by mid-2012. 
 Long-term Aussie bulls will not wait idly in their pen.

 By Eric Burroughs and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, April 21 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled to
a three-year low against a basket of currencies on Thursday,
with market players selling the greenback to buy buoyant risky
assets in a move that threatens to drive the dollar index
towards its historic low.
 The dollar has taken a hit in the past few days as investors
have flocked back to higher-yielding currencies, commodities and
equities after a brief shake-out earlier in the week.
 The chart outlook for the greenback is looking dire after it
tumbled through the 74.17 trough touched in November 2009, a
move that may spark a run towards the 70.698 all-time low hit in
2008.
 Investors have rushed into risky assets due to strong U.S.
corporate earnings and signs the global economy is chugging
along even as the Federal Reserve stays very cautious about when
it will start to unwind its super-loose policy.
 Traders said the move was being fueled in relatively
illiquid trade and there was a risk of a dollar rebound later in
the day as market players cover short positions before long
Easter weekends in many parts of the world.
 But the overall outlook was dim for the dollar as the Fed is
still buying bonds and the threat by ratings agency Standard &
Poor's to cut the United States' prized AAA rating reminded
investors of the hurdles the world's reserve currency faces.
 ""It's been pretty amazing, a one-way freight train,"" said a
senior trader at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong. ""You just can't fade
it, the trend is so powerful.""
 A series of records have been broken this week. Gold 
vaulted to all-time highs above $1,500 an ounce and the Aussie
powered to peaks above $1.07, while the Singapore dollar
, Swiss franc  and South Korean shares <.KS11>
reached all-time highs.
 The dollar has suffered the most against commodity-linked
currencies such as the Aussie and Canadian dollars, as well as
emerging markets currencies such as the Singapore dollar as
authorities in Asia allow more currency strength to fight
inflation.
 Yet Asian authorities have regularly intervened to buy
dollars to limit the gains in their currencies, including on
Thursday.
 Traders say a portion of those dollar purchases are
typically shifted into the euro, Aussie and other currencies,
creating a vicious circle that drags the dollar lower.
 ""Every day it's going on ... The strong local currencies
usually mean interventions and euro buying against the dollar,""
said a trader for a European bank in Singapore. Traders also
noted Asian central banks buying the Aussie and Canadian dollar.
 The dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.6 percent from late New York
trade to 73.898, the lowest since August 2008 -- just before it
surged during the Lehman Brothers collapse as investors
scrambled for safe-havens.
 The DXY's fortunes had already been looking grim since last
month when the index broke an upward trendline off the 2008 and
2009 lows.

 EURO RESILIENT BUT LAGS
 The euro pushed to a 16-month peak but has lagged the
broader move due to the ongoing worries about the euro zone
crisis, underscored this week by reports that Greece may
restructure its debt in coming months.
 A solid auction of Spanish debt the previous day helped
provide some reassurance that the problems plaguing Greece,
Ireland and Portugal would not spread to the country seen as the
next most vulnerable in the euro zone.
 The euro was up 0.7 percent at $1.4612  after jumping
to a high of $1.4618 on EBS, triggering stops on the way up
after breaching an option barrier at $1.4550 and the January
2010 high at $1.4583.
 The single currency also appears to be poised for further
gains on the charts, with the path clearing for a run at the
2009 peak at $1.5145.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.6 percent at $1.0756 
after pushing as high as $1.0772 on Thomson Reuters Matching --
the highest since being floated in the early 1980s. For the
week, the Aussie was up 1.8 percent, making it the best
performer among G10 currencies.
 ""The AUD is burning, burning hot,"" said one trader at
another European bank in Singapore.
 The dollar dipped 0.7 percent against the yen to 81.95 yen
, breaking chart support with the fall below 82.00 -- the
intraday high reached on March 18 when the G7 intervened to sell
the yen.
 The yen has also slid broadly with the dollar as the Bank of
Japan has loosened policy since the massive earthquake, tsunami
and nuclear crisis, making the low-yielding yen an attractive
funding currency for carry trades along with the dollar.
 Trading activity may start to slow before the Easter
holidays. Trading desks in London and Hong Kong will be shut
both Friday and Monday, while Sydney markets will be closed
until next Wednesday.

 HONG KONG, April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slid to a
3-year low against a basket of major currencies and Asian stocks
jumped to a 3-year high on Thursday, as investors scrambled to
get in front of upward momentum in higher-yielding assets,
particularly in emerging markets.

pushed the dollar index to its lowest level since August
2008 and charts suggesting that the greenback could move towards
an all-time low of 70.698 hit earlier that year. 
 Asian stocks rose to their highest level since January 2008,
extending their rebound from a brief tumble earlier in the week.

 DOLLAR ON BACKFOOT, GOLD AT RECORD	
 The sharply weaknening U.S. dollar has suffered the most
against commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars, as well as emerging markets currencies such as
the Singapore dollar as authorities in Asia allow more currency
strength to fight inflation.	
 Brazil's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate
on Wednesday to 12 percent from 11.75 percent as it
seeks to rein in consumer prices.	
 Spot gold hit a record high of $1507.15 an ounce and
spot silver soared to a 31-year high while the Australian
dollar powered to peaks above $1.07 -- a level not seen since
the currency became free-floating in the early 1980's.	
 The euro pushed to 15-month peaks but has lagged the broader
move due to the ongoing worries about the euro zone crisis
although a solid auction of Spanish debt the previous day helped
provide some reassurance.

 * Protectionism fears if free trade momentum lost
 * WTO chief says weakest have most to lose
 * China guards ""developing"" status
 
 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, April 21 (Reuters) - Talks aimed at removing trade
barriers worldwide are going nowhere after a decade, documents
due out on Thursday will show, raising fears of protectionism
and questions over whether the rules of the game should change.
 Delegates and trade officials agree that the hundreds of
pages of legal texts and backup documents that were meant to
revive the ambitious but stalled Doha round of talks may well
have the opposite effect -- showing how little has changed since
the last attempt to strike a deal in 2008.
 Global prosperity is at stake, the World Trade Organisation
says. International trade traditionally grows about twice as
fast as the world economy, and is one of its engines with $15
trillion of goods changing hands last year. Tariffs on imports,
subsidies for exports, and quotas for both, restrict it.
 Economists cite the depression of the 1920s and 1930s, when
protectionism was rampant, and the long period of prosperity
that followed early free trade moves in 1945, as evidence that
free trade is indeed a force for good.
 Free trade supporters say failure would particularly hurt
poor countries, which rely on trade to lift them out of poverty.
 ""The consequences of a failure to conclude the Doha Round
will be more detrimental to developing countries, particularly
the least-developed among them,"" WTO Director-General Pascal
Lamy said last week.

 THE CHINA-U.S. PLAYOFF
 Farmers and industrialists want access to foreign markets,
and a number of countries where those voices shout loudest
signed up last week to a renewed effort to make Doha work.
 ""We are prepared to show further flexibility and to
contribute to the successful conclusion of the round this year,""
said government ministers from Australia, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland in an open letter.
 ""We call on all members to do the same,"" they said in a
statement aimed at the organisation's heavyweights -- the United
States, China, the European Union, and emerging export
powerhouses Brazil and India.
 In world trade talks though, the bigger they are, the harder
they play. On industrial goods and services, the United States
and China, the two biggest trading nations, are poles apart.
 The Doha talks, named after the Qatari city where they began
in late 2001, were officially called the Doha Development Round.
They offered special treatment to developing countries,
including a few that were included for the first time.
 China was one of the developing countries, but the United
States argues that having since become the world number one
exporter and number two importer, it should offer more access.
 So should Brazil and India, especially in the areas of
chemicals, information technology and industrial machinery,
Washington says.
 ""No three economies have benefited more from trade
liberalisation over the last 10 years than China, India and
Brazil. That's a good thing,"" said U.S. Trade representative Ron
Kirk last week in a pre-emptive defence against any blame for
the talks' failure.
 ""But with that blessing comes a responsibility.""
 China wants to keep the developing status it was promised in
2001 and argues that it has already done much to open its
markets. Brazil, meanwhile, is one of a group of agricultural
exporting countries that believes Washington should do more to
open up its huge but heavily protected agriculture market.
 The European Union has in the past been publicly critical of
the hardline U.S. position with regard to China. Since 2008
though, it has been less vocal, and one EU source
acknowledged that China's rapid growth has become an issue.
 The EU sees itself as a middleman in non-agricultural talks.
On agriculture, it has already agreed to take by 2013 the types
of measures Washington is being pushed to agree now.
 
 PLAN B
 Pushing into the void where the Doha agreement should be are
an increasing number of bilateral trade agreements. Some see
these as the future of free trade in a fast moving world where
10 years of discussions just cannot capture the moment.
 EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht talked of a ""Plan B""
earlier this month, and bilaterals are a big part of policy for
all the big players already.
Others, including Lamy, however, fear the bilateral approach
will hurt the weakest countries.
 Bilateral deals leave no incentive for powerful players to
consider, for example, exemptions on food export restrictions
requested on April 5 under the Doha umbrella by a group of
countries vulnerable to rising food prices.
 Trade delegates also increasingly question whether Doha is
simply too ambitious in scope with its attempt to draw in the
complex services sector and address the development agenda too.
""There could be a smaller agreement that most countries could
sign up to, or a smaller group that signs up to something others
cannot accept,"" said one trade source. ""The only thing for sure
is that nobody wants to be the one to kill the round.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Major stock markets rose
sharply on Wednesday after strong corporate earnings in both
the United States and Europe, while gold jumped to record highs
above $1,500 an ounce in a broad commodities rally.
 Weakness in the U.S. dollar and a well-received bond
auction from Spain pushed the euro to its highest in 15 months.
Currencies that benefit from higher commodity prices
outperformed, with the Australian dollar at a post-float high
and the Canadian dollar hitting a 3-1/2-year high.
 Upbeat profits and outlooks from companies including
chipmaker Intel bolstered economic optimism and offset concerns
of sovereign debt problems on both sides of the Atlantic.
 ""It isn't just the good reports, but also the encouraging
comments about how things look for the remainder of the year,""
said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
 ""This is a testament to the strength of earnings we can
expect to come out from here,"" added Luschini, who helps
oversee $53 billion and owns Intel shares.
 World equities, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 2.1 percent, extending the
previous session's 0.5 percent rise and further recovering from
Monday's 1.6 percent loss.
 Intel  posted higher than expected sales and
forecast quarterly revenues well above estimates. The world's
biggest cosmetics group, L'Oreal , and carmaker PSA
Peugeot Citroen  also came in with robust figures.
 U.S. stocks posted their best day in a month, lifting the
Dow industrials to the highest in almost three years.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 186.79

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - The dollar plummeted on
Wednesday against major and emerging market currencies as the
prospect that U.S. interest rates would remain at record lows
encouraged investors to seek higher returns elsewhere.
 The euro hit a 15-month high above $1.45, while rising
commodity prices and inflation sent the Canadian and Australian
dollars to multi-year peaks. Against major currencies, the
greenback had its worst day in a month.
 Perhaps more crucially, traders said, the dollar extended a
multi-week slide against large emerging currencies, hitting
two-year lows against the Brazilian real and Mexican peso.
 China also allowed the yuan to touch a record high, and a
top central bank official called for more currency flexibility
to ease inflation.
 Some analysts said this had markets betting that China
would soon allow the yuan to rise even more quickly, which
would likely put further pressure on the dollar.
 ""The only reason these countries would let their currencies
strengthen is if they think their competitors for exports will
also let their currencies go,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing
director of Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Borthwick said a ""one-off revaluation of the yuan is not
out of the question"" and that he expects that China's currency,
up 1 percent against the dollar this year and 4.5 percent since
mid-2010, could appreciate another 6 percent by year end.
 EURO, AUSSIE SOAR
 While China and others are tightening policy, markets
expect the Federal Reserve to move slowly in soaking up all the
dollars it has poured into the economy since 2008 to help the
economy rebound from its worst recession since World War Two.
 U.S interest rate futures suggest the Fed won't raise its
benchmark rate until the second quarter of 2012.
 The European Central Bank hiked rates this month for the
first time since 2008 and is expected to hike again. The
contrast has helped boost the euro, which rose 1.2 percent on
Wednesday to $1.4519, near an earlier 15-month high.
 The chase for yields also boosted the Australian dollar to
an almost three-decade high at $1.0693. The currency benefits
from Australia's 4.75 percent interest rate and its role as a
large supplier of raw materials and commodities for the booming
Chinese economy.
 The Canadian dollar rose to its highest in more than three
years against the greenback, buoyed by Tuesday's above-forecast
Canadian inflation.
 The dollar also fell against the yen, down 0.3 percent to
82.36 yen.
 GREECE RISKS LINGER
 Some analysts, however, said euro strength may be nearing a
peak, particularly if fears that Greece may have to restructure
its debt become reality. A German government adviser on Tuesday
said Greek restructuring was inevitable.
 If it were to provoke similar steps in Portugal, Ireland
and possibly Spain, the subsequent hit on European banks and
the broader euro zone economy could drive the euro as low as
$1.20, said Michael Hart, director of FX strategy at Roubini
Global Economics in London
 ""Nothing is really different between now and when the Greek
fears emerged last year and the euro was below $1.20,"" he said.
""If anything, the situation is worse. Authorities tried to kick
the can down the road but haven't even kicked it hard enough,
because it's not 2013 we're talking about now but 2011.""
 But fears about U.S. finances may offset euro weakness.
 S&P slapped a negative outlook on the United States' prized
AAA credit rating this week for fear Washington would not act
boldly enough to cut a $1.4 trillion budget deficit, and
emerging central bank attempts to reduce reliance on the U.S.
dollar could help support demand for other currencies.
 ""There's a desire to hold fewer dollars, and that's going
to be supportive of the euro,"" said BNY Mellon strategist
Michael Woolfolk.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Upbeat earnings and outlooks
from companies including chipmaker Intel lifted global stocks
and fueled risk appetite on Wednesday, driving commodities
higher and the Australian dollar to a post-float high.
 Broad weakness in the U.S. dollar and a well-received bond
auction from Spain helped push the euro to its highest in 15
months, while gold set new record highs above $1,500 an ounce.
 Solid corporate earnings in the U.S. and Europe bolstered

 * Little-known firm Champlink acting as broker into Libya
 * 120,000T of fuel shipped to Tunisia in April so far
 
 (Adds U.N. diplomats, details; paragraphs 2, 15-18)
 By Jessica Donati and Emma Farge
 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Muammar Gaddafi's government is
circumventing international sanctions to import gasoline to
western Libya by using intermediaries who transfer the fuel
between ships in Tunisia.
 U.N. diplomats in New York said they suspected Gaddafi's
attempts to import gasoline might consistute a violation of U.N.
Security Council sanctions banning any transactions with Libya's
state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC).
 One intermediary company, Hong Kong-based Champlink,
previously unknown to the oil trading community, has sought a
transaction for fuel delivery into Libya, and European oil
traders said they had been approached by other such firms.
 ""Gaddafi's people are looking to buy gasoline, via (Tunisian
port) La Skhira... and Champlink. They ship-to-ship at La
Skhira,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the situation.
 In a fax, obtained by Reuters, Champlink approached trading
firms with an ""urgent"" request stating, ""we have been appointed
as procurers for end user in Libya and looking for ready
shipments for gasoline.""
 The fax proposed either shipping directly to the western
Libyan port of Zawiyah, near the capital Tripoli, or to
Tunisia's La Skhira, to be transferred onto a waiting tanker.
 The fax, dated April 1, requests fortnightly 25,000-tonne
shipments of gasoline for the next six months, highlighting the
possibility of ""tanker-to-tanker transfer.""
 It said neither the cargo nor the end user company is on any
international sanctions list.
 Champlink's Bhagoo Hathey, whose signature is on the fax,
confirmed in an email to Reuters last week that a shipment of
40,000 tonnes arrived at La Skhira earlier this month, but did
not name the supplier or say whether or not the gasoline had
been shipped on to Libya.
 In a later email he denied receiving any shipment at La
Skhira.
 In a separate document seen by Reuters, a company called
Afrimar Tunisia, which is part of Afrimar Group North Africa,
sent a request on April 12 to shippers for a vessel with
capacity to carry 40,000 tonnes of gasoline loading from Turkey
to La Skhira for ship-to-ship transfer there.
 The firm -- whose website www.afrimar.com shows it has a
branch in Tripoli -- said it had two additional cargoes
available from the end of April at two week intervals for which
it needed to charter vessels.
 Afrimar did not respond to an email enquiry and was not
available for comment on Wednesday.
 It is not known whether or not any shipments handled by
Afrimar have reached Libya.
 The United States, the United Nations and European Union
imposed sanctions on the Libyan government and selected Libyan
companies, including NOC, in late February and in March. It is
not illegal for Libya to export or import oil or gasoline, but
it is illegal to trade with NOC.
 ""We assume that somehow the NOC is involved at some level,""
a Security Council diplomat told Reuters.
 He added that the council's Libya sanctions committee,
which oversees compliance with the U.N. measures adopted on Feb.
26 and March 17, has not been informed of the issue yet.
 The sanctions on Libyan firms have left both government and
rebel forces seeking fuel supplies, although shipments have
begun to resume to rebel-held territory mainly in the east of
the country.
 While Gaddafi's government needs fuel to run its military
assaults on rebels in the east and in the besieged, rebel-held
western port of Misrata, as important for the stability of his
rule is avoiding discontent in the capital by ensuring supplies
of basic goods, including fuel for cars and public transport.
 A month ago, shortages led to increasingly vocal complaints
about the government. Residents reported long lines and even
gunfights at petrol stations as people tried to stock up. The
supply situation has markedly improved in recent weeks.
 
 HIGH IMPORTS
 Oil trading and shipping sources said at least 120,000
tonnes of gasoline had arrived so far this month at La Skhira
for ship-to-ship transfers, a figure that amounts to nearly half
of Tunisia's annual imports.
 While La Skhira is used to trans-ship fuel to other
countries in addition to Tunisia's domestic fuel needs, the
volumes arriving there are unprecedented.
 It was unclear which, if any, of the receiving vessels at
La Skhira had then sailed for Libya.
 OPEC member Libya is one of Africa's top crude oil producers
but, even in peacetime, relies on gasoline imports because of
inadequate refining capacity.
 Libyan state television said on Tuesday Tripoli was working
to ensure the arrival of several gasoline cargoes to meet
demand, and that it had restored its refinery in Zawiyah to
normal production capacity.
 The sources said they know of three vessels transhipping
gasoline in the port of La Skhira this month, and one of these
cargoes had been picked up by a Libya-flagged vessel.
 It was not clear whether Champlink or Afrimar was involved
in any of these transactions.
 A manager at the Tunisian importing body STIR, who asked not
to be named, said he did not know of Champlink's existence,
adding: ""All imports to Tunisia are done by STIR and if there
are other things going on, I am not aware of that.""
 A second source at STIR said Tunisia had received no
gasoline imports into La Skhira for its own domestic use in
April, which could imply the shipments were onward bound for
Libya.
 
 THIRD PARTIES
 Oil traders say they have been approached by several
previously unheard of companies seeking to buy fuel to delivery
into Libya. Several said they refused the offer because of the
risk of breaching international sanctions.
 ""I had one enquiry for 10,000 tonnes from a company I had
never heard of,"" said one trader, adding, ""It's a difficult
time, because you need to triple check all counterparties and
make sure they are not breaching sanctions.""
 Although the United Nations named Libya's NOC and several
subsidiaries on its list of entities whose assets were frozen,
traders said they believed fuel deliveries could still be
possible since it would take time to update sanctions lists to
cover any newly emerging Libyan companies.
 ""My guess is that this can't continue. Refined products is
one area of vulnerability for Gaddafi, but if the governments
(imposing sanctions) have to play catch up on sanctions, then
there is a window,"" said Saket Vemprala of research group
Business Monitor International.
 ""From a military point of view, if the West can starve the
government of fuels it will be important.""
 Oil traders have previously found ways of getting around
international sanctions including those against Iran, Iraq and
South Africa. Lawyers, though, say Libyan sanctions are robust
by historical standards.
 ""Reloading products has always been big business. You re-do
the bills of lading....this is nothing new as far as the
industry is concerned,"" said a veteran oil products trader.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Upbeat earnings and outlooks
from companies including chipmaker Intel lifted global stocks
and fueled risk appetite on Wednesday, driving commodities
higher and the Australian dollar to a post-float high.
 Broad weakness in the U.S. dollar and a well-received bond
auction from Spain helped push the euro to its highest in 15
months, while gold set new record highs above $1,500 an ounce.
 Solid corporate earnings in the U.S. and Europe bolstered
optimism about the economy and offset concerns of sovereign
debt problems on both sides of the Atlantic after Standard &
Poor's on Monday downwardly revised its outlook for the United
States' prized AAA credit rating.
 ""What you've seen over the last couple of days is some very
good news that has come out on the earnings front -- you are
starting to see much sounder beats as it relates to companies,""
said Burt White, managing director and chief investment
officer, LPL Financial in Boston.
 World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 2 percent, extending the previous
session's 0.5 percent rise and further recovering from Monday's
1.6 percent loss.
 Intel  posted higher than expected sales and
forecast quarterly revenues well above Wall Street's estimates,
while the world's biggest cosmetics group, L'Oreal ,
and carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen  also came in with
robust figures.
 Major U.S. stock indexes soared. The Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 189.06 points, or 1.54 percent, at
12,454.98. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 18.12
points, or 1.38 percent, at 1,330.74. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was up 54.23 points, or 1.97 percent, at
2,799.14.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> rose 1.8 percent, snapping a
three-day losing run, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> rose 1.7 percent. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF>

 DEBT WORRIES
 Yields on 10-year Spanish government bonds 
fell to 5.46 percent after Spain saw solid demand for 10- and
13-year bonds at an auction, though speculation of debt
restructuring by Greece forced Madrid to pay higher yields than
a month ago to attract investors. [ID:nLDE73I1P8]
 The euro rose 1.2 percent versus the dollar to $1.4512
, pulling further away from this week's low of around
$1.4155. Traders said stop-losses were triggered through last
week's high of $1.4521 and on the break of $1.4530.
 Renewed pressure on Greece to explore a debt restructuring,
[ID:nLDE73J0AT] has rattled peripheral debt markets in recent
sessions pushing Greek and Portuguese bond yields to new
highs.
 ""All in all, relatively reassuring results providing no
indication Spain's decoupling from the periphery is under
immediate threat. That said, the risk of contagion has
certainly not been taken off the table,"" said Richard McGuire,
rate strategist at Rabobank.
 Higher-yielding currencies rose, with the Australian dollar
 up 1.5 percent at $1.0678 after hitting a post-float
high of $1.0692.
 Against a basket of currencies <.DXY>, the U.S. dollar fell
0.7 percent to 74.354.
The soft dollar boosted commodities, with copper  up
2.3 percent and Brent crude  1.9 percent to above $123 a
barrel, recovering from a 1.7 percent drop in the previous two
sessions.
 Gold  breached $1,500 an ounce for the first time and
silver hit a 31-year high. Concerns about government debt
problems, inflation and turmoil in the Middle East also helped
boost gold prices.

 By Harry Papachristou
 ATHENS, April 20 (Reuters) - Greece said on Wednesday it
still planned to issue bonds again by early 2012, betting that a
Portuguese bailout this summer and reforms at home will calm
markets that are increasingly factoring in a debt restructuring.
 The cost of insuring Greek five-year government paper shot
to a record high on Wednesday, topping Iceland's premium in 2008
when its financial system imploded as worries that Athens could
end up forcing haircuts, or losses, on its debt holders gathered
momentum.
 But Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said he
considered Greece's debt -- expected to hit about 160 percent of
GDP in 2012 -- ""totally sustainable"", and that a restructuring
was out of the question.
 ""We believe it (a restructuring) harbours extreme dangers
for the Greek economy, the banking system, businesses and
households,"" he told reporters.
 His refusal to consider a cutting on deal on repayments
chimed in with recent comments by euro zone policymakers but
contrasted sharply with latest market expectations.
 In a Reuters poll published on Wednesday, 46 of 55
economists said they expected Greece would have to restructure
in the next two years, most likely by extending maturities on
its debt. [ID:nLDE73J1N8]
 Papaconstantinou said the market mood might change after the
summer, once Portugal clinches its bailout deal with the EU and
IMF and Greek reforms gather pace.
 Greece still assumes it will not need to borrow money from
the EU's rescue fund, the EFSF, to cover a 27 billion euro gap
in its finances next year, he said.
 A plan to raise 15 billion euros from privatisations by the
end of 2013 to pay down debt was feasible, and ""our intention
remains to go to markets as soon as possible and by early 2012
at the latest"".
 The country will also unveil in detail next month how it
will gradually reduce its deficit from about 15 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 1 percent of GDP in 2015, he added.
 
 2012 ISSUANACE 'A NON-STARTER'
 European Central Bank ratesetters Juergen Stark and Lorenzo
Bini-Smaghi both recently warned against a Greek restructuring,
saying it would hammer the country's banking system and damage
Europe's credibility.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde also dismissed
that option in comments to parliament on Tuesday.
But rumours about an imminent restructuring pushed Greek
bank stocks <.FTATBNK> 4.6 percent lower after
Papaconstantinou's comments on Wednesday [ID:nATH006034],
reflecting widespread scepticism in the market.
 ""The government's assessment is very optimistic,"" said Ken
Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas. ""The issue of going to the
market as soon as 2012 looks like a non-starter.""
 He said it was unlikely that market sentiment will improve
enough by next year to allow Greek borrowing costs to fall to
sustainable levels.
 ""A more realistic assessment is that the EFSF will have to
be used to cover Greece's financing gap.""

(Recasts; adds quote on risks to passage, background, byline)
 By David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, April 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative
Ron Kirk on Wednesday said he will not bundle free-trade pacts
with South Korea, Colombia and Panama into a single bill for
congressional approval, despite Republican pressure to do so.
 ""It is highly unlikely to zero that they would be
(submitted) in one bill,"" Kirk told reporters. ""We know of no
legislative template for an omnibus trade bill.""
 The Obama administration's top trade ambassador said that
the Panama and South Korea deals were essentially ready for
congressional consideration and technical talks with lawmakers
were underway. Kirk said the process for Colombia also would be
started soon, aiming for a vote after mid-June.
 Some Republicans in Congress have urged Kirk for a single
vote on all three but he said this could complicate the
process.
 ""Even though I'm very confident they'll pass, we would run
the risk of all three being knocked down by a point of order,""
he said, referring to a parliamentary maneuver. ""So what we're
talking with Congress about is staging and timing.""
 The Obama administration is pushing for approval of the
trade pacts by July, because that is when rival free trade
deals take effect, including the European Union's pact with
South Korea and Canada's pact with Colombia. If U.S. deals are
not in place by then, U.S. exports to these countries could be
put at a disadvantage.
 BROADER APPROACH
 Kirk also said he wanted to work with Congress to approve
other legislation on trade adjustment systems and trade
preference programs that help developing countries.
 ""We've given notice to Congress that we're ready to start
the informal and formal process on Korea, Panama and soon
Colombia, but want it to be part of a holistic strategy that
also includes the trade adjustment systems and also the
preference programs,"" he said.
 This would include discussions with Congress on extending
the expired Andean Trade Preference Act, which allowed Colombia
and other Andean countries to export goods to the United States
without paying duties.
 Kirk also said he believes there is a more receptive
attitude toward more trade deals as a way to boost exports and
job growth in the United States.
 ""What we hope is that we have been able to demonstrate to
the American public that there is a way to have fair trade,"" he
said. ""Trade really can be a way to empower us to sell more
(abroad) and to create jobs here.""

* Slovak ""No"" could pose a risk to debt crisis contagion
 * Vote expected later this year
 
 By Petra Kovacova
 BRATISLAVA, April 20 (Reuters) - A junior Slovak government
party said on Wednesday it will not back the country's
participation in Europe's planned permanent bailout mechanism,
opening the possibility that Slovakia may not meet its financing
quota.
 The conflict in the centre-right coalition is a reminder of
rising political hurdles to solving the single currency's debt
crisis, after a Finnish anti-euro party scored strong gains in
an election last weekend, stoking fears about a veto of
Portugal's pending bailout.
The Slovak liberal Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) said it
would support the creation of the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM), due to come into force in mid-2013 with 80 billion euros
in cash reserves.
 But the party they will not support a subsequent move to
authorise the Slovak contribution to the scheme, around 600
million euros. The votes are expected in the autumn.
 Slovakia, the euro area's second poorest member after
Estonia, irritated its partners last year when it rejected
taking part in the bailout for Greece.
 ""We are here to defend interests of Slovak citizens and not
those of foreign banks, which have for long time been making
profits on high interests on loans to irresponsible countries,""
SaS leader Richard Sulik told reporters.
 ""We will not be fancied in Brussels for rejecting the ESM,
but taxpayers' money is more important to us,"" he added.
 The ESM vehicle will also be backed 620 billion euros of
guarantees, increasing the euro area's potential arsenal to
tackle future financial crises and in effect committing member
states to additional contributions if required.
 Prime Minister Iveta Radicova, whose coalition has 77 votes
in the 150-seat parliament, said talks were underway to secure
support for the legislation. The SaS has 21 deputies.
 ""Talks are underway and we will talk to all political
parties in parliament,"" Radicova told reporters. ""There is still
room for talks.""
 Radicova may need to turn to the strongest leftist
opposition party SMER, led by her predecessor and fierce
opponent Robert Fico. 
 A senior source from within SMER told Reuters there was no
clear decision within the party whether to back the ESM.
 Slovakia had rejected a bilateral loan to debt-laden Greece
last year, earning harsh criticism for violating solidarity
principles, but endorsed creation of the temporary European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to be replaced by the ESM.
 Sulik made headlines in December last year with a
recommendation the central European country, which adopted the
euro in January 2009, should prepare a ""plan B"" for potentially
leaving the elite club [ID:nLDE6BC1ER].

 * Started exploration tests on the block 14T
 * Seeking to develop a second jetty
 
 By Kevin Mwanza
 NAIROBI, April 20 (Reuters) - State-run National Oil
Corporation of Kenya (NOCK) sees its market share more than
doubling to 15 percent by 2013 and is seeking contracts with oil
producing nations to cushion rising prices, it said on
Wednesday.
 At present NOCK controls 7.3 percent of Kenya's oil market
through its 70 petrol stations and has a 30 percent -- or 25
million litre -- monthly oil import quota.
 ""We are aiming to be at a 15 percent market share before
2013,"" NOCK's acting managing director, Summaya Athmani, told a
news conference.
 ""We have been engaged in discussions with producing
countries to get what we call government-to-government
contracts.""
 Athmani said the company was in touch with several oil
producing countries including Kuwait and Qatar and looking to
increase alternative sources of fuel including biodiesel from
Brazil.
 Fuel prices have become a hot topic in east Africa's largest
economy after the Energy Regulatory Commission raised them last
week.
 The prices can have a big effect on the rate of inflation in
Kenya because many of its 40 million people rely on kerosene for
lighting and cooking.
 NOCK was blamed for high fuel prices in the country after it
failed to deliver a consignment on time in March, increasing
delivery costs after international oil prices rose.
 ""We were experiencing logistical challenges from the
refinery that was producing the cargo. We then decided to get
alternative delivery ... it arrived within the specified time
frame,"" said Athmani.
 The corporation plans to develop a second jetty outside the
existing Kilindini jetty in Mombasa, which will allow larger
cargo ships to dock. It also plans to expand its storage
facilities.
 NOCK said it had started exploring for oil on its Block 14T
on the Magadi basin in March but had not yet started seismic
tests.
 ""We are doing exploration for petroleum on block 14T. The
contract was signed in March and at the moment we are on the
ground now acquiring gravity before we move into the seismic,""
said Athmani.

 By Darya Korsunskaya
 MOSCOW, April 20 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Wednesday tried to soothe BP's worries about its future
in the country, saying that both Rosneft and BP's local venture
TNK-BP should cooperate with the British oil major.
 BP's Arctic exploration and share swap deal with Rosneft has
been deadlocked after a court slapped it with an injunction at
the behest of BP's Russian partners in TNK-BP.
 Some analysts said that Rosneft may drop BP and replace it
with another major.
 ""As for cooperation with such a respectable company as BP,
we would welcome that both for TNK-BP and for Rosneft,"" Putin
told reporters after his annual address to the Russian
parliament.
 He also reiterated that he was caught off guard by
differences between BP and its Russian oligarch partners in
TNK-BP.
 ""When the British colleagues came to us with their
proposals on working with Rosneft, I said we would support this.
At the time, no-one told me personally or Rosneft about any
mutual obligations to TNK-BP. We simply did not know anything
about this,"" Putin said.
 In January, BP and Rosneft announced their $16 billion deal
amid much fanfare in London after BP's chief executive officer
Robert Dudley met Putin in Moscow.
 But BP's oligarch partners in TNK-BP - Mikhail Fridman,
German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik - have won
every round of the legal battle against BP, arguing that the
Rosneft deal violates a right of first refusal on BP deals in
Russia set out in TNK-BP's shareholder agreement.
 The investors won an injunction in an arbitration court,
which froze the agreement. BP and Rosneft extended a deadline to
close the deal until May 16.
 Putin said on Wednesday that the matter should be resolved
in a legal way in courts.
 ""If there are some issues or questions, linked to
mutual obligations, then they should be settled in a legal way,
through court decisions,"" he said.

port) La Skhira... and Champlink. They ship-to-ship at La
Skhira,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the situation.
 In a fax, obtained by Reuters, Champlink approached trading
firms with an ""urgent"" request stating, ""we have been appointed
as procurers for end user in Libya and looking for ready
shipments for gasoline.""
 The fax proposed either shipping directly to the western
Libyan port of Zawiyah, near the capital Tripoli, or to
Tunisia's La Skhira, to be transferred onto a waiting tanker.
 The fax, dated April 1, requests fortnightly 25,000-tonne
shipments of gasoline for the next six months, highlighting the
possibility of ""tanker-to-tanker transfer.""
 It said neither the cargo nor the end user company is on any
international sanctions list.
 Champlink's Bhagoo Hathey, whose signature is on the fax,
confirmed in an email to Reuters last week that a shipment of
40,000 tonnes arrived at La Skhira earlier this month, but did
not name the supplier or say whether or not the gasoline had
been shipped on to Libya.
 In a later email he denied receiving any shipment at La
Skhira.
 In a separate document seen by Reuters, a company called
Afrimar Tunisia, which is part of Afrimar Group North Africa,
sent a request on April 12 to shippers for a vessel with
capacity to carry 40,000 tonnes of gasoline loading from Turkey
to La Skhira for ship-to-ship transfer there.
 The firm -- whose website www.afrimar.com shows it has a
branch in Tripoli -- said it had two additional cargoes
available from the end of April at two week intervals for which
it needed to charter vessels.
 Afrimar did not respond to an email enquiry and was not
available for comment on Wednesday.
 It is not known whether or not any shipments handled by
Afrimar have reached Libya. 
 The United States, the United Nations and European Union
imposed sanctions on the Libyan government and selected Libyan
companies in late February and in March.
 These have left both government and rebel forces seeking
fuel supplies, although shipments have begun to resume to
rebel-held territory mainly in the east of the country.
 While Gaddafi's government needs fuel to run its military
assaults on rebels in the east and in the besieged, rebel-held
western port of Misrata, as important for the stability of his
rule is avoiding discontent in the capital by ensuring supplies
of basic goods, including fuel for cars and public transport.
 A month ago, shortages led to increasingly vocal complaints
about the government. Residents reported long lines and even
gunfights at petrol stations as people tried to stock up. The
supply situation has markedly improved in recent weeks.
 
 HIGH IMPORTS
 Oil trading and shipping sources said at least 120,000
tonnes of gasoline had arrived so far this month at La Skhira
for ship-to-ship transfers, a figure that amounts to nearly half
of Tunisia's annual imports.
 While La Skhira is used to trans-ship fuel to other
countries in addition to Tunisia's domestic fuel needs, the
volumes arriving there are unprecedented. 
 It was unclear which, if any, of the receiving vessels at
La Skhira had then sailed for Libya.
 OPEC member Libya is one of Africa's top crude oil producers
but, even in peacetime, relies on gasoline imports because of
inadequate refining capacity. 
 Libyan state television said on Tuesday Tripoli was working
to ensure the arrival of several gasoline cargoes to meet
demand, and that it had restored its refinery in Zawiyah to
normal production capacity.
 The sources said they know of three vessels transhipping
gasoline in the port of La Skhira this month, and one of these
cargoes had been picked up by a Libya-flagged vessel.
 It was not clear whether Champlink or Afrimar was involved
in any of these transactions.
 A manager at the Tunisian importing body STIR, who asked not
to be named, said he did not know of Champlink's existence,
adding: ""All imports to Tunisia are done by STIR and if there
are other things going on, I am not aware of that.""
 A second source at STIR said Tunisia had received no
gasoline imports into La Skhira for its own domestic use in
April, which could imply the shipments were onward bound for
Libya.
 
 THIRD PARTIES
 Oil traders say they have been approached by several
previously unheard of companies seeking to buy fuel to delivery
into Libya. Several said they refused the offer because of the
risk of breaching international sanctions.
 ""I had one enquiry for 10,000 tonnes from a company I had
never heard of,"" said one trader, adding, ""It's a difficult
time, because you need to triple check all counterparties and
make sure they are not breaching sanctions.""
 The United Nations named Libya's National Oil Company and
several subsidiaries on its list of entities whose assets were
frozen, but traders said they believed fuel deliveries could
still be possible since it would take time to update sanctions
lists to cover any newly-emerging Libyan companies.
 ""My guess is that this can't continue. Refined products is
one area of vulnerability for Gaddafi, but if the governments
(imposing sanctions) have to play catch up on sanctions, then
there is a window,"" said Saket Vemprala of research group
Business Monitor International.
 ""From a military point of view, if the West can starve the
government of fuels it will be important.""
 Oil traders have previously found ways of getting around
international sanctions including those against Iran, Iraq and
South Africa. Lawyers, though, say Libyan sanctions are robust
by historical standards.
 ""Reloading products has always been big business. You re-do
the bills of lading....this is nothing new as far as the
industry is concerned,"" said a veteran oil products trader.

(Updates prices, changes dateline, previous LONDON)
 NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - The euro surged to its
highest in 15 months against a weaker dollar on Wednesday,
boosted by higher risk appetite and after a bond auction from
Spain was well received by investors.
 The response to the Spanish auction provided a fillip to
the euro zone common currency which is eyeing its Jan. 13, 2010
high. Traders said before that, the euro would have to clear
option barriers at $1.4550 and $1.4600.
 ""This is not a euro-centric move and instead is a broadly
based U.S. dollar move,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""Loose U.S. monetary
policy juxtaposed against a European tightening cycle, a
warning from S&P that with no credible plan in place the U.S.

background.""
 The euro rose 1.4 percent versus the dollar to $1.4527,
pulling further away from this week's low of around $1.4155.
Traders said stop-losses were triggered through last week's
high of $1.4521 and on the break of $1.4530.
 The euro jumped 1.5 percent to 120.17 yen, moving away from
a two-week trough hit this week. Trading conditions were thin
with many dealers already out for the Easter break.
 Data showing business activity in Germany and France
continued to outpace the rest of the common currency bloc has

 Both the dollar and the yen are usually sold off when risk
appetite is buoyant. Demand for riskier assets like stocks and
higher-yielding currencies picked up as upbeat corporate
earnings in the U.S. raised growth expectations.
 Market sentiment was calmer after nerves were rattled on
Monday by S&P's warning on U.S. credit ratings and on fears
that Greece will have to restructure its debt.
 ""Investor focus is on the earnings season in the U.S. and
this is key in driving growth expectations and pushing stock
markets higher. This keeps the focus away from the euro zone
periphery right now,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist
at UBS in Zurich.

 The chase for yields benefited the Australian dollar, which
hit a fresh post-float high of $1.0688. It last traded at
$1.0662, up around 1.3 percent on the day.
 Traders said stop-losses were hit on the break of $1.0610
and $1.0650.
 The Canadian dollar rose to its highest in over three years
against its U.S. counterpart, buoyed by above-forecast Canadian
inflation on Tuesday and rising commodity prices.
 All of which saw the dollar index fall to a 16-month low.
 Traders said talk of central banks recycling intervention
proceeds into growth-linked currencies and the euro was also
leading to a drop in the U.S. dollar.
 Still, the dollar managed to eke out modest gains versus
the yen. It rose 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday to
82.7 yen. Traders said Japanese exporters' offers were layered
in the 83.20-83.50 area with stops seen above 83.50.
 Sterling fell sharply against the euro after Bank of
England minutes showed policymaker caution about economic
growth outweighed inflation worries. The euro was at 88.60
pence, up 0.9 percent on the day.

 * Setback for Lukashenko on eve of state-of-nation speech

(Adds analyst on where exchange rate likely to settle)
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, April 20 (Reuters) - The Belarussian rouble 
lost more than a third of its value against the dollar on
Wednesday after the central bank introduced a free floating
exchange rate for trade between banks.
 The development starkly highlighted the currency problems of
the ex-Soviet republic and amounted to a setback for President
Alexander Lukashenko who was due on Thursday to deliver his
annual state of the nation speech.
 Coming nine days after a bomb blast at a Minsk metro station
that killed 13 people, the rouble's fall against the dollar
piled on the misery for the average Belarussian citizen who was
promised better times ahead when Lukashenko was re-elected for a
fourth term last December.
 Bankers said the rouble on Wednesday plunged in value to
4,800 to 5,300 per dollar in trading on the interbank market.
This compared with the official exchange rate of 3,074 roubles
per dollar.
 Dealers said demand for dollars on the market had surged
after Belarus dropped restrictions on the rate used by banks and
companies on Tuesday, opening the door to a partial devaluation
of the currency.
 ""There is a lot of delayed demand (for dollars),"" one trader
said. 
 He warned that the one-off surge, which reflects the fact
that many players had not been able to buy dollars for weeks,
may ease off, pointing to the rouble recovering some ground.
 While ordinary citizens in theory can exchange roubles at
the official rate, the reality is that supply of dollars from
official exchange points has dried up, forcing ordinary people
to buy roubles on the street at black market rates. 
 The other implication is that prices of imported goods will
probably continue to rise -- prices for goods ranging from food
to computers are up more than 20 percent since the start of
April. 
 
 DRAINING RESERVES
 Belarus has lost a quarter of its foreign currency reserves
this year, trying to support the rouble as its current account
deficit soared, partly under the impact of high pre-election
spending late last year.
 In past weeks, as the supply of dollars has run out,
Belarussians have been queuing for hours at exchange points to
acquire whatever foreign currency was available.
 If the rouble stays down at around 5,000 to the dollar, the
flow of dollars to these retail outlets is liable to dry up
completely since they are only allowed to operate at around the
official rate.
 Exporters, too, still have to sell 30 percent of their
foreign currency revenue to the central bank at the official
rate. The central bank can then resell it to banks or companies
it picks, also at an artificially low rate.
 Lukashenko, who is at odds with the West over a police
crackdown on the opposition following his disputed re-election
last December, promised to bring the average monthly wage to 500
dollars in 2010 and double it by 2015.
 But this will be almost impossible to achieve if the rouble
continues to depreciate.
 The central bank and government have said that they expect
gradually to unify the market in one exchange rate once it
settles down from the initial moves. Foreign analysts' estimates
for how much the rouble needs to fall in fundamental terms were
around 20-30 percent, less than Wednesday's slump.
 ""I think the fair exchange rate will be around 4,000-4,300
if the central bank gets the Russian loans -- which I think is a
matter of one week -- and if exporters stop withholding foreign
currency,"" said Anastasia Golovach of Renassance Capital.
 In Thursday's state of the nation speech, Lukashenko seems
likely to blame rising energy prices for the current economic
problems and opposition forces whom he regularly accuses of
sowing panic among the population.
 Lukashenko blamed the April 11 metro bombing on forces which
he said were intent on destabilising the country. After
announcing the arrest of the main suspects, he said opposition
leaders should also be questioned over the bombing.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - The euro and commodity
currencies surged higher in thin trading conditions on
Wednesday, as upbeat corporate earnings in the U.S. prompted
investors to buy riskier assets amid rising growth expectations.
 Gains in U.S. and European shares soothed market sentiment
after nerves were rattled on Monday by S&P's warning on U.S.
credit ratings and on fears that Greece will have to restructure
its debt.
 Intel Corp forecast revenues well above Wall Street's
targets, sending its shares higher in after hours trade. 
 IBM results also outpaced expectations and it raised its
full-year profit forecast.
 The moves showed investors continue to favour
higher-yielding currencies at the expense of the dollar and yen,
and a global equities underscored a rebound in risk-taking
sentiment.
 ""Investor focus is on the earnings season in the U.S. and
this is key in driving growth expectations and pushing
stock markets higher. This keeps focus away from euro zone
periphery right now,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist
at UBS in Zurich.
 The euro climbed over 1 percent to 119.82 yen, pulling away
from a two-week trough of 116.49 yen hit on EBS earlier this
week.
 The euro also rose more than 1 percent versus the dollar to
$1.4489, bringing it back within sight of last week's 15-month
high of $1.4521. Traders said trading conditions were thin with
many dealers already out for the Easter break.
 ""People have disappeared for the Easter break thus
participation in an already fractured, panicked market is in
short supply. Expect more gaps and false moves today as London
chases this risk on move higher,"" said a spot trader at a U.S.
bank.
 Traders said a large option barrier at $1.4530 that had
capped the euro's rise last week had now expired, leaving the
market free to target the next level of option structures at
$1.4550.
 Samarjit Shankar, analyst at BNY Mellon, said the bank's
flow indicators showed the euro was the strongest net bought
currency among the G10 as its decline earlier this week gave the
market better re-entry levels.
 Data highlighting business activity in Germany and France
continued to outpace the rest of the common currency bloc has
kept alive rate hike expectations by the European Central Bank.
 ""This has also buoyed the single currency despite the
lingering sovereign debt crisis in the region's peripheral
markets,"" Shankar added.
 The euro was given an added boost after a Spanish bond
auction saw decent investor demand, although yields were higher.

 AUSSIE BUOYANT
 The chase for yields continues to benefit the Australian
dollar, which hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0662 to trade up
around 1.2 percent on the day. Traders said stop-losses were hit
on the break of 1.0610 and $1.0650.
 The Canadian dollar rose to its highest in over three years
against its U.S. counterpart at C$0.9512, buoyed by above
forecast Canadian inflation on Tuesday and rising commodity
prices.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday
to 82.75 yen while the dollar-index was down 0.6 percent at
74.522, a fresh 16-month low.
 As the dollar's value falls, the price of gold hit a record
high above $1,500 and silver rose to a 31-year high.

 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee came no closer to increasing interest rates
this months as concerns about the strength of the economy
outweighed inflation risks, further dimming the chance of a hike
before August.
 The MPC maintained its 6-3 split in favour of keeping rates
on hold this month, according to minutes of its April 6-7
meeting on Wednesday, saying the outlook for inflation had not
changed enough to alter their view.
 While they said that the path of near term inflation was
likely to be higher than the Bank forecast in February, the
extent of the recovery from the slowdown at the end of last year
was still unclear.
 Those who voted to hold rates steady said news on demand and
activity over the month had probably been to the downside.
 ""An increase in Bank rate in current circumstances could
adversely affect consumer confidence, leading to an exaggerated
impact on spending,"" the minutes said.
 The minutes dropped the line used in March, that some those
voting for unchanged rates had thought the case for a rate hike
had increased.
 Interest rate futures rose as investors pushed back their
expectations for a first post-crisis hike. Markets are now
pricing in only a 50 percent chance of an increase in August.
November futures are only just pricing in a full quarter-point
hike.
 ""It seems that the move towards the hawkish side has lost
momentum,"" said BNP Paribas economist Alan Clarke. ""It's
aggressively neutral.""
 The BoE has held interest rates at their record-low of 0.5
percent for more than two years, in contrast to the European
Central Bank, which raised borrowing costs earlier this month.
 The MPC noted that British services firms and manufacturers
showed reasonably healthy growth, but construction and energy
production was likely to depress growth in the first quarter.
 The Office for National Statistics will publish preliminary
growth figures for the first three months on April 27.
 Retailers in particular are suffering from consumers´
reluctance to spend in the face of higher taxes, rising prices
and weak wage growth.
 The minutes said that despite the drop in inflation to 4
percent in March, there was still a significant risk that
inflation would exceed 5 percent. 
 Andrew Sentance, Martin Weale and Spencer Dale continued to
vote for higher borrowing costs. Sentance wanted a 50 basis
point hike and the other two a 25 basis point increase.
 The MPC also voted to maintain the stock of quantitative
easing purchases at 200 billion pounds, with Adam Posen
repeating his call for a 50 billion pound increase.

group
 * Mongolia suspended deliveries following accidents - Xinhua
(Adds details, comment from South Gobi Resources)	
 BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - Mongolia has halted truck
deliveries of coal from the South Gobi region to China, with the
ban expected to last about two days, after China closed a part
of the border on Tuesday citing a technical glitch, a lobby
group for the Mongolian mining sector said.	
 The South Gobi region is the location of the Tavan Tolgoi
property, one of the world's biggest coal deposits. Mongolia has
yet to build railway infrastructure in the region and exporters
continue to depend on trucks.	
 ""The Chinese side said they had some problems (at the border
crossing of Zamyn Uuud) with their computer software registering
the vehicles,"" said Baasanjav Enkhbaatar, chairman of the
Mongolian Mining Club.	
 ""It affected all the traders in Mongolia and so the
Mongolian government is taking countermeasures.""	
 Official Chinese news agency Xinhua said Mongolia suspended
coal deliveries following a spate of accidents on a dirt road
running from Tavan Tolgoi.	
 Citing local media, it said 23 people were killed in 31 road
accidents on the Tavan Tolgoi highway in 2010, with another
three fatalities in the first quarter of 2011.	
 Officials at the Mongolian Mining Corp were not immediately
available for comment.	
 
 ""The Mongolian government does close off shipments for a day
or two when there has been an accident -- sometimes there is so
much dust caused by the trucks and local herds or herdsmen are
hit,"" said Jim Reichert, senior infrastructure specialist with
the World Bank in Ulan Bator.	
 ""They need to build a railway as soon as possible to
transport the coal -- there are any number of reasons to do
that,"" he said.	
 Private financing was available to build railways south to
China, but the Mongolian government blocked construction in
order to concentrate on a cross-country rail network that would
link Tavan Tolgoi with Russia and the Pacific coast.	
 The Tavan Tolgoi project is estimated to contain 6 billion
tonnes of coal reserves and its eastern block is scheduled to be
listed on an overseas stock exchange within a year.	
 The government is currently assessing bids for the western
block of the project from ArcelorMittal , Vale
and Xstrata , among others. [ID:nL3E7FD0IE]	
 China imported 16.59 million tonnes of coal from Mongolia in
2010, up 176 percent on the year and behind only Indonesia,
Australia and Vietnam.	
 Mongolia hopes to become China's biggest foreign supplier,
but its transportation infrastructure is already creaking under
the strain.	
 The Mongolian Mining Corp and South Gobi Resources
also have mining operations in the South Gobi region.	
 David Bartel, vice-president in charge of Mongolian
operations at South Gobi Resources, said deliveries from the
company's mine were not affected.	
 ""The block is just from the Tavan Tolgoi area -- they have
not stopped shipments from our mine,"" he said.	
 The mine is about 400 km from Tavan Tolgoi and 45 km from
China and the company is currently building a dedicated road to
the border, he said.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Upbeat earnings from companies
including chip maker Intel lifted stocks and boosted appetite
for riskier assets on Wednesday, driving commodities higher and
the Australian dollar to a 29-year high versus the dollar.
 The positive showing so far in the quarterly earnings season
has helped offset concerns of government debt problems on both
sides of the Atlantic after Standard & Poor's on Monday cut the
outlook on the United States to negative.
 However, some investors remain wary of government debt
problems, inflation and turmoil in the Middle East, and sent
gold to an all-time high above $1,500.
""While S&P grabbed some headlines earlier in the week, on a
future event that may or may not happen, it seems things on the
ground are coming up pretty good,"" said Philip Isherwood,
European equities strategist at Evolution Securities.
 ""The economic and corporate message is good. There is
nothing to fear but fear itself.""
 Intel posted higher than expected sales and forecast
quarterly revenues well above Wall Street's estimates, while the
world's biggest cosmetics group, L'Oreal, and carmaker PSA
Peugeot Citroen also came in with robust figures.
 Of the 45 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter
earnings so far, 79 percent have either beaten or met market
expectations while the remainder came in below forecasts, data
from Thomson Reuters StarMine showed.
 U.S. stock index futures rose 0.9 to 1.2 percent, indicating
a firm start on Wall Street.
 Societe Generale said in a note that hedge funds were
cautious on U.S. equities, keeping short positions on the S&P
500 and the Russell 2000, though they were net long on Japanese
equities.
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.8 percent, snapping a
three-day losing run, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
rose 1.5 percent.
 World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
advanced 1.2 percent, extending the previous session's 0.5
percent rise and further recovering from Monday's 1.6 percent
loss.
 Emerging market stocks climbed 2 percent.
 
 POSITIVE DISTRACTION
 The improvement in sentiment also boosted the euro and high
yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar, which was up
1.3 percent at $1.0658 after hitting a 29-year high of $1.0662.
 ""Investor focus is on the earnings season in the U.S. and
this is key in driving growth expectations and pushing stock
markets higher. This keeps focus away from the euro zone
periphery right now,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist
at UBS in Zurich.
 The euro rose 1.4 percent to $1.4538, while the dollar fell
0.9 percent against a basket of currencies.
 The soft dollar added to the boost for commodities, with
copper up 1.6 percent and Brent crude up 1.1 percent to below
$123 a barrel, recovering from a 1.7 percent drop in the
previous two sessions.
 Gold breached $1,500 an ounce for the first time and silver
hit a 31-year high.
 Yields on 10-year Spanish government bonds fell 3 basis
points to 5.47 percent after Spain saw solid demand for 10- and
13-year bonds at an auction, though speculation of debt
restructuring by Greece forced Madrid to pay higher yields than
a month ago to attract investors.
 ""The average yields (were) both a shade lower than where
they were trading in the secondary market heading into the
sale,"" said Richard McGuire, rate strategist at Rabobank.
 ""All in all, relatively reassuring results providing no
indication Spain's decoupling from the periphery is under
immediate threat. That said, the risk of contagion has certainly
not been taken off the table.""

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2011 04:00AM ET</span>",Foreign firms bidding for China contracts face uneven playing field," * Worries include favoritism, lack of transparency
 * Foreign vendors fear being excluded from tenders
 * Little progress seen on ""indigeous innovation"" concerns

 By Michael Martina	
 BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - Foreign companies bidding for
public projects in China, valued at $1 trillion a year, face a
sharply tilted playing field, a European Union business lobby
said on Wednesday, citing favouritism and corruption as
influencing the award of contracts.	
 A study by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China
said that foreign companies suffer from delayed information
about new projects, tenders announced via obscure channels, and
unfair awarding and appeals processes.	
 Such complaints are nothing new in China, where
multinationals have long seen difficulties such as intellectual
property theft and unclear regulations as the price for
competing in the world's second-biggest economy.	
 But fair bidding for public projects has taken on new
urgency as China embarks on a massive spending binge on
strategic industries such as high-speed rail and nuclear power
that could equal $1.5 trillion over five years. [ID:nL3E6N221U]	
 Major concerns for companies, the report said, include the
challenge of finding out about tenders on time and the need to
alter bids based on standards that vary by municipality.	
 ""The procedures are all roughly similar but some require
different forms and certificates than others -- you never know,""
the report quoted a European medical device manufacturer as
saying. 
 ""These sound like small differences, but when each
municipality has its own rules, the time involved in bidding in
all these municipalities can multiply."" 
 The problem is acute for small- and mid-sized foreign
companies, said Gilbert Van Kerckhove, chair of the EU Chamber's
Public Procurement Working Group, since it can be too costly for
such businesses to know when tenders will be announced in local
newspapers and websites.	
 ""For small and medium-sized companies it is a matter of size
and politics. Large companies have the ability to sniff around
in advance,"" Van Kerckhove said.	
Bids on China's government projects, from rail to roads and
stadiums, are often tendered at sub-central government levels, a
murky regulatory space where relations with local-level
officials can come into play in the awarding of contracts.	
 ""The systems are becoming more clear and standardized, but
-- and it's a big but -- the decision on who to buy from is
often made before the official process even begins,"" a senior
manager at an international wind power equipment manufacturer
told Reuters on condition of anonymity.	
 The EU Chamber suggested China establish central and
electronic platforms to coordinate nationwide tenders in the
vast public procurement market, which it values at more than 7
trillion yuan ($1 trillion) a year.	
 That figure is an approximation, the EU Chamber said, but
one that illustrates the state's large role in China's economy
and public tendering processes.

 PROMISE VERSUS ACTION 
 The study also highlights foreign companies' concerns that
China's ""indigenous innovation"" polices continue at the local
level despite assurances from top leaders that they would not be
discriminatory against foreign firms.	
 ""They say they are de-linking indigenous innovation policies
from the procurement catalogs, but in reality it is not always
easy for the central government to control local entities,"" Van
Kerckhove said, referring to the lists of items government
entities consult when making purchases.	
 Top Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao during
his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in January, have
said China would separate its quest to promote Chinese
innovation from public procurement opportunities.	
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, due to assume the
ambassadorship to China, scolded China just two weeks after Hu's
visit on the gap between the Chinese government's promises and
actions. [ID:nN02263100]	
 Multinational companies have worried that China's use of
indigenous innovation policies would give procurement
preferences to domestic firms or force foreign companies to
transfer technology in order to win contracts.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - The euro and commodity
currencies such as the Australian dollar gained on Wednesday, as
upbeat corporate earnings in the U.S. prompted investors to buy
riskier assets amid rising growth and inflation expectations.
 Gains in U.S. and European shares soothed market sentiment
after nerves were rattled on Monday by S&P's warning on U.S.
credit ratings and on fears that Greece will have to restructure
its debt.
 Intel Corp forecast revenues well above Wall Street's
targets, sending its shares higher in after hours trade. 
 International Business Machines results also outpaced
expectations and it raised its full-year profit forecast. 
 The moves showed investors continue to favour
higher-yielding currencies at the expense of the dollar and yen,
and a rise in Asian and European equities underscored a rebound
in risk-taking sentiment.
 ""Investor focus is on the earnings season in the U.S. and
this is key in driving growth expectations and pushing
stock markets higher. This keeps focus away from euro zone
periphery right now,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist
at UBS in Zurich.
 The euro climbed 0.9 percent to 119.45 yen, pulling away
from a two-week trough of 116.49 yen hit on EBS earlier this
week.
 The euro rose 0.6 percent versus the dollar to $1.4420,
having clawed above short-term resistance around the $1.4365/80
area. It's next target was last week's 15-month high of $1.4521.
 Samarjit Shankar, analyst at BNY Mellon, said the bank's
flow indicators showed the euro was the strongest net bought
currency among the G10 as its decline earlier this week gave the
market better re-entry levels.
 Data highlighting business activity in Germany and France
continued to outpace the rest of the common currency bloc kept
alive rate hike expectations by the European Central Bank.
 ""This has also buoyed the single currency despite the
lingering sovereign debt crisis in the region's peripheral
markets,"" Shankar added.
 Spain will issue up to 3.5 billion euros of 10- and 13-year
paper on Wednesday after yields for the euro zone states
struggling with high debt jumped this week.
 
 AUSSIE BUOYANT
 The chase for yields continues to benefit the Australian
dollar, which hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0609 in early
European trade. Traders said stop-losses were scattered above
1.0610.
 The yen got no help from data showing that Japan logged a
smaller-than-expected trade surplus in March and that exports
fell more than expected year-on-year, in a sign of the
disruptions caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami that
struck Japan's northeast on March 11.
 ""There is little doubt that this is a factor for the yen to
weaken,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market economist for Mizuho
Corporate Bank in Tokyo.
 ""Two factors that had supported yen strength until now are
shrinking U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials and exporter
flows. Today's data shows that one of those is weakening,""
Karakama added.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday
to 82.79 yen. Dollar-buying by Japanese importers helped lend
the dollar support against the yen, traders said.
 The dollar dipped 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies
to 74.772, falling back in the direction of a 16-month trough of
74.617 set last week.
 As the dollar's value falls, the price of gold hit a record
high above $1,500 and silver rose to a 31-year high.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - The euro and
commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar rebounded on
Wednesday, as investors bought them again after a mild shake-out
of stretched long positions at the start of the week.	
 Gains in U.S. and European shares on upbeat corporate
results helped soothe market sentiment after nerves were rattled
on Monday by S&P's warning on U.S. credit ratings and on fears
that Greece will have to restructure its debt.	
 While those problems remain unresolved, the moves showed
investors continue to favour higher-yielding currencies at the
expense of the dollar and yen, and a rise in Asian equities
underscored a rebound in risk-taking sentiment.	
 ""The fact that there was little emotional reaction after the
S&P move perhaps helped to improve investors' sentiment towards
risk,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko
Securities in Tokyo.	
 The yen got no help from data showing that Japan logged a
smaller-than-expected trade surplus in March and that exports
fell more than expected year-on-year, in a sign of the
disruptions caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami that
struck Japan's northeast on March 11. [ID:nL3E7FJ0B1] 
 ""There is little doubt that this is a factor for the yen to
weaken,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market economist for Mizuho
Corporate Bank in Tokyo.	
 The data showed that car exports fell, likely due to
disruptions to manufacturing supply chains, while imports of
oil-related products rose on the back of high commodity prices,
he said, adding that this trend may continue in April and May.	
 ""Two factors that had supported yen strength until now are
shrinking U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials and exporter
flows. Today's data shows that one of those is weakening,""
Karakama added.	
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday
to 82.91 yen . Dollar-buying by Japanese importers helped
lend the dollar support against the yen, traders said.	
 The euro climbed 0.8 percent to 119.27 yen
, pulling away from a two-week trough of 116.49 yen
hit on EBS earlier this week.	
 The euro rose 0.4 percent versus the dollar to $1.4387
, having clawed above short-term resistance around the
$1.4365/80 area. Both the euro's 100-hour moving average and the
61.8 percent retracement of its recent $1.4521 to $1.4156 slide
both lie near that region.	
 On hourly charts, one possible upside target for the euro
lies at its 200-hour moving average that now lies near $1.4409.	
 
 BETTER RE-ENTRY LEVELS 
 Samarjit Shankar, analyst at BNY Mellon, said the bank's
flow indicators showed the euro was the strongest net bought
currency among the G10 as its decline earlier this week gave the
market better re-entry levels.	
 Data highlighting business activity in Germany and France
continued to outpace the rest of the common currency bloc kept
alive rate hike expectations by the European Central Bank.	
 ""This has also buoyed the single currency despite the
lingering sovereign debt crisis in the region's peripheral
markets,"" Shankar added.	
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies
to 74.918 , falling back in the direction of a 16-month
trough of 74.617 set last week. 
 As the dollar's value falls, the price of gold hit a
record high above $1,500 and silver rose to a 31-year
high.	
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan keeping
monetary policy ultra-loose, both the yen and dollar remain the
funding currencies of choice in carry trades.	
 Market players say macro hedge funds have been using options
recently to take medium-term bets against the yen, both in
dollar/yen and in the South Korean won versus the yen
.	
 In a sign that market players see limited potential for a
further fall in the dollar, dollar/yen put options were sold
while there were limited offers in dollar/yen calls on
Wednesday, said an options trader at a European bank.	
 One focal point for the yen is whether Japanese investors
will step up their investment in overseas assets in the new
fiscal year that started this month, and there are signs that
some are heading in that direction.	
 Japan's third-largest private life insurer, Meiji Yasuda
Life, said on Tuesday it plans to increase its investment in
foreign bonds, focusing on dollar debt, with its confidence in
U.S. Treasuries unshaken by the threat of a credit downgrade.

 The chase for yields continues to benefit the Australian
dollar, which hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0599 .

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on
Wednesday as strong results from chip maker Intel Corp
prompted a rally in tech shares, while renewed strength in
metals prices boosted materials companies and also lifted the
commodity-linked Australian dollar.	
 Upbeat U.S. and European corporate earnings helped soothe
market sentiment, which had been roiled at the start of the week
when rating agency S&P warned it could cut the United States'
sovereign credit rating and as speculation intensified that
Greece would need to restructure its debt.	
 Index futures pointed to a higher opening for European and
U.S. stock markets, with Euro STOXX 50 futures  up 1.2
percent and S&P 500 futures  gaining 0.5 percent.	
 ""All guns are blazing at the moment in the right direction,""
said Austock Group senior client adviser Michael Heffernan. 
 The euro bounced off a two-week low, with business activity
data from France and Germany supporting expectations that the
European Central Bank will continue lifting interest rates,
boosting the single currency's yield advantage over the dollar.	
 Rising equities and a weaker dollar renewed interest in
commodities, with Brent crude reaching $122 a barrel, copper
rising and gold hitting a record above $1,500 an ounce.	
 
 After the Wall Street close, Intel reported strong sales and
forecast quarterly revenues well above Wall Street estimates.
[ID:nN19291560]	
 U.S. stocks had been lifted by strong earnings from
materials and healthcare firms such as Johnson & Johnson
. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.8 percent with
chip stocks prominent among the gainers, although some market
players said the Intel report had prompted short-covering rather
than the start of a turnaround in the fortunes of the tech
sector, which has underperformed this year. 
 ""The market is rebounding, but it's nothing more than
short-covering,"" said Kenichi Hirano, a strategist at Tachibana
Securities. ""Investors will not go long until they see Japanese
corporate earnings later this month.""	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 1.8 percent, with the tech sub-index
up 3.4 percent and the materials sector
gaining 2.3 percent.	
 The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent on Tuesday, while the
Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.5 percent. 
 
 CARRY TRADE	
 The euro traded around $1.44, having bounced off a
two-week low around $1.4155 set on Monday.	
 The European Central Bank earlier this month raised its key
interest rate from a record low, and analysts see further
tightening in the pipeline.	
 With the Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve expected to
keep their monetary policy ultra-loose for the time being, the
dollar and yen have become the currencies of choice for the
carry trade -- the strategy of use cheap loans to fund
investments in higher yielding assets.	
 The hunt for yield is boosting the Australian dollar
, which hit a fresh 29-year high around $1.0599. 
 The yen was pressured by data showing Japan logged a
smaller-than-expected trade surplus in March, a sign of the
disruption to supply chains caused by a massive March 11
earthquake and tsunami in the northeast.	
 ""There is little doubt that this is a factor for the yen to
weaken,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market economist for Mizuho
Corporate Bank in Tokyo. 
 ""Two factors that had supported yen strength until now are
shrinking U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials and exporter
flows. Today's data shows that one of those is weakening.""	
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday
to 82.94 yen . Measured against a basket of major
currencies, the dollar fell 0.2 percent.	
 Gold hit a record $1,500.16 and silver hit a
31-year high at $44.34 an ounce. London metal exchange copper
rose 1 percent to $9,438 a tonne. 
 A weaker dollar tends to boost the attractiveness of
commodities, which are mostly priced in the U.S. currency.	
 Oil prices rose, helped by a larger-than-expected draw in
U.S. stockpiles. Brent crude  was up 0.6 percent at
$122.04 a barrel and U.S. crude gained 0.8 percent to $109.09.

 * Three refineries still shut
 * Power saving plans in summer to curb oil demand
 * March LNG imports down 0.6 pct, thermal coal up 18.5 pct
(Adds detail, comment)	
 By Risa Maeda	
 TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan's imports of crude fell at
their fastest pace in more than a year in March after the
massive earthquake damaged refineries and closed ports, but were
likely to bounce back in April as delayed cargoes unloaded.	
 ""They were not able to discharge a lot of crude as
everything was shut down,"" a regional crude trader said,
referring to the ports and refineries affected by the
earthquake. ""Imports are going to rise in April from March.""	
 Crude demand in the world's third-largest oil consumer
beyond April would depend on how quickly diesel demand picks up
for reconstruction and how much crude is used in direct burning
at power plants. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast
direct burning could rise to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) in
the peak demand summer months.	
 The outlook for oil demand is unclear as the nation tries to
cope with damaged supply chains and the impact of lost
power capacity and the nuclear crisis on business and consumer
activity.	
 With little clarity on when factory output and supply chain
will be fully restored, Japanese corporate confidence plunged by
a record amount in April, a Reuters poll showed. [ID:nL3E7FD3IS]	
 A magnitude 9.0 quake and subsequent tsunami on March 11
devastated the northeast of the country, damaging ports,
refineries and power plants.	
 Although many of the facilities have resumed operations,
quake-affected utilities may be short of power capacity
equivalent to as much as 24 percent of normal power demand
during peak times this summer, the government has estimated. 
 ""For example, companies could implement irregular shifts and
other measures to save power during the summer,"" said Takayoshi
Kitada, head of Mitsubishi Research Institute's industrial
strategy consulting group. ""Together with the continued
disruption in supply chains, that would curb oil demand."" 
 But Kitada added that if utilities boost oil-fired
generation as well as gas-fired power, oil imports could
probably come close to year-ago levels.	
 Also, if oil product margins stay high, some of
the undamaged refineries could take in more oil to produce
products for export. Japan has already resumed shipping oil
products to Asia. [ID:nL3E7FJ0OL]	
 The reconstruction of devastated areas in the Tohoku region
was unlikely to boost demand until January, Kitada said.	
 Still, estimates vary on how the quake will impact demand
this year, and when diesel demand will rise for reconstruction.
In its monthly oil market report this month, the IEA forecast
increased demand could kick in earlier, and has revised its
estimate for Japanese demand upward by 150,000 bpd for 2011 from
its pre-quake estimate.	
 
 MARCH IMPORTS	
 In March, the volume of Japan's customs-cleared crude oil
imports slid 6.6 percent from a year earlier to 17.776 million
kilolitres (3.61 million barrels per day), preliminary data
showed. [ID:nL3E7FK02J]	
 That was the sharpest decline since an 18.4 percent drop in
October 2009. In February, Japan's crude oil imports rose 5.6
percent from a year earlier to 18.872 million kl.	
Three quake-damaged refineries remain shut. The
Kashima refinery operated by JX Holdings is slated to
restart by summer and JX's Sendai refinery is scheduled to
restart by summer 2012. But Cosmo Oil Co has not said
when it will be able to restart its Chiba refinery.	
 Five thermal power plants and four nuclear plants which were
shut after the quake remain closed.	
 
 LNG IMPORTS DOWN, COAL UP	
 Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell 0.6 percent to
6.674 million tonnes last month, the first drop since December,
when imports declined 3.0 percent. They had risen 3.8 percent in
February.	
 Several utilities have given Tokyo Electric some of their
LNG cargoes to help it make up for lost power, forcing them to
use more non-LNG fuel. [ID:nL3E7ES03H]	
 But given Qatar's decision to send an additional 4
million tonnes of LNG to Japan over the next year, utilities may
prefer to use the low carbon fuel to oil or coal.
[ID:nL3E7FJ1AI]	
 Imports of thermal coal for power generation last month
posted their steepest year-on-year increase since May 2010,
rising 18.5 percent to 8.815 million tonnes.	
 Japan's thermal coal imports have risen for the 12th month
in a row.	
 The Japan crude cocktail (JCC) price, or the average price
for customs-cleared crude oil imports, which is used as the
benchmark for LNG prices for Japanese buyers, rose to $103.01 a
barrel in March.	
 That was the highest price since September 2008, when the
price stood at $120.65 a barrel. The price for February was
revised to $95.91.

 TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in March at
a faster pace than economists expected, in a sign that shipments
will continue to weaken and hurt economic growth after last
month's earthquake and tsunami sparked a nuclear crisis and
disrupted supply chains for many manufacturers.	
 The data offers the first glimpse of how the supply side has
struggled since the natural disaster that struck Japan's
northeast coast on March 11, and it suggests Tokyo's trade
balance will swing to a deficit as some companies struggle with
a shortage of electricity and needed parts.	
 Japan's economy is likely to contract in the second quarter
and then resume growing in the third quarter as efforts to
rebuild the northeast take hold. But damage to supply chains and
factory output could linger, depriving the export-focused
country of a vital contribution to gross domestic product and
setting the stage for further easing by the central bank.	
 ""As supply chains are expected to recover in late May, the
drop in exports may prove short-lived,"" said Yuichi Kodama,
economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.	
 ""But due to power supply constraints expected in the summer,
a full pickup in exports is unlikely until at least the end of
this year. The Bank of Japan is likely to be prompted to ease
its policy further in coming months.""	
 Exports fell 2.2 percent in March from a year earlier, more
than a median forecast for a 1.5 percent annual fall. That
marked the first decline in 16 months. Imports rose 11.9 percent
from a year earlier against a forecast for a 6.0 percent annual
rise, trade data issued by the Finance Ministry showed.

 Exports dropped 7.7 percent from February on a
seasonally-adjusted basis. This was the biggest month-on-month
fall since January 2009.	


 
 CAR EXPORTS TUMBLE	
 Exports of cars tumbled 27.8 percent from a year earlier,
making the biggest contribution to the decline in overall
exports. Semiconductors and electronics fell 6.9 percent from a
year ago.	
 Among Japan's two major export destinations, shipments to
China rose an annual 3.8 percent while shipments to the United
States fell an annual 3.4 percent, the first decline since
December 2009.	
 The trade balance came to a surplus of 196.5
billion yen ($2.38 billion), much less than the median estimate
for a 493.6 billion yen surplus. 
 Global makers of products from cars to mobile
phones are finding it harder to get the parts they need after
Japan's earthquake and tsunami wrecked supply chains, and
investors worry that the worst is yet to come for earnings.	
 Toyota Motor Co said it would cut U.S. vehicle
production and might have to lower its full-year U.S. sales
targets if parts shortages extend into the summer.
[ID:nN19289276]	
 The fall in exports suggests that industrial production data
for March, which is due on April 28, could also slow sharply.
The Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting on the same day and
will issue a twice-yearly outlook report on the economy and
prices that includes long-term GDP and consumer price forecasts.

 
 BOJ SEEN HOLDING FIRE	
 The BOJ is expected to hold off on any further
easing next week but will consider giving clearer signals to the
market that surging commodity costs alone would not shake its
commitment to ultra-easy policy, even if they nudge up consumer
prices, sources familiar with the central bank's thinking have
told Reuters. [ID:nL3E7FK02I]	
 ""The BOJ does not see the need to ease policy further
anytime soon, given expectations for the economy's return to a
moderate recovery after a temporary slump,"" said Takeshi Minami,
chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.	
 ""The timing of future easing would depend on the pace of
recovery in output which is expected to pick up gradually.""	
 The BOJ's next move might be to expand its asset-buying
program or boost its outright JGB buying from the market, Minami
said, adding that it could come as early as July when it reviews
the outlook report and the government compiles a second extra
budget involving more bond issuance to fund reconstruction.	
 Japan aims to compile this month an emergency budget worth 4
trillion yen, which will be followed by more spending packages,
as it faces its worst crisis since World War Two after the 9.0
magnitude earthquake and a tsunami devastated its northeast.	
 Japan's economy is expected to contract in the
current quarter but will grow again in July-September on
reconstruction efforts, a Reuters poll showed. Some economists
say gross domestic product may have contracted in January-March,
meaning three straight quarters of contraction to June cannot be
ruled out. [ID:nSLAEFE7SS]

 TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell 2.2 percent in March from a year earlier,
posting their first annual decline in 16 months, after an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis
battered factory output and crippled supply chains, Ministry of Finance data showed on
Wednesday. 
 The fall in exports compared with a median forecast for a 1.5 percent annual decline and
followed a 9.0 percent rise in the year to February. Automobile exports took a hit in
particular, the data showed, underlining the extent of the damage wrought by the disaster on
March 11.	
 Imports rose 11.9 percent in the year to March, more than a 6.0 percent rise expected and
following a revised 10.0 percent increase in February. The trade balance was a surplus of 196.5
billion yen ($2.38 billion). That compared with the median forecast for a surplus of 493.6
billion yen.	
 Economists predict exports are likely to decline in coming months, which could push Japan's
trade balance into a deficit as companies struggle with a shortage of electricity and parts
needed to make their goods.	
 The cost of material damage alone from last month's quake and tsunami has been estimated at
$300 billion, making it the world's most expensive natural disaster. About 14,000 people have
been confirmed dead and tens of thousands made homeless.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on
Tuesday, recouping the prior day's losses, but nagging debt
worries on both sides of the Atlantic and new signals of
inflation dangers in China curbed appetite for risk.
 A weaker dollar propelled gold  to a record peak
above $1,500 an ounce and oil in New York  above $108 a
barrel. Silver  reached $44 an ounce, a 31-year high.
 Investors dipped their toes back into stocks and other risk
assets in part on solid company results, a day after Standard &
Poor's jolted markets when the debt rating agency warned that
political gridlock in Washington is impeding work on paring the
$14 trillion federal debt load.
 ""People took a deep breath and stepped back,"" said Mark
Pawlak, market strategist at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New
York. ""It's not a hugely significant event (for the United
States) because there are precedents for this S&P move with
other AAA-rated sovereign credits. This helped stocks to
stabilize.""
 However, a likely protracted U.S. budget fight and
speculation about a Greek debt restructuring should weigh on
stocks, even if there were upbeat results from Apple 
and corporate heavyweights in the coming days, he said.
 ""Stocks are just chopping in a tight range,"" Pawlak said.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.6 percent, retracing some of Monday's 1.6 percent loss, which
was the biggest one-day drop in a month.
 Wall Street stocks <.DJI> <.SPX> closed up 0.5 percent in
choppy trading. Better-than-expected results from investment
bank Goldman Sachs  and healthcare company Johnson &
Johnson  stoked bids for U.S. shares after they fell
more than 1 percent on Monday on sovereign debt worries. [.N]
 Solid earnings from luxury goods makers LVMH  and
Burberry  spurred a 0.4 percent rise in European stocks
<.FTEU3> after a 2 percent drop on Monday.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down nearly 1.3 percent after
prior day's losses in the United States and Europe.
 Investor unease persisted over a possible Greek debt
restructuring that could further strain the euro zone.
 Greece sold 1.6 billion euros of three-month debt but was
forced to pay a yield of more than 4 percent, more than
quadruple what Germany -- the euro zone's strongest member --
pays on similar obligations.
 DOLLAR SLIPS
 Standard & Poor's rattled investor confidence on Monday
when it changed its outlook on the United States to negative
from stable, threatening the future of the prized AAA credit
rating for the world's top economy.
 In currency trading on Tuesday, the U.S. dollar slipped 0.6
percent against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> after
making headway the previous day.
 Monday's dollar gains came on a rush for safe havens
despite the risk of S&P downgrading U.S. debt in two years if
Washington fails to achieve a budget plan that relies less on
debt.
 S&P's warning intensified scrutiny of the U.S. budget
deficit and the political fight to slash it. The deficit is a
key element in the global imbalances that worry many investors
and policymakers.
 There was no direct reaction to the S&P move on Tuesday
from Beijing, which holds vast reserves of U.S. Treasuries.
However, the head of China's central bank said the country
should diversify investments as its some $3 trillion of foreign
exchange holdings had grown too large.
 Another Chinese rate setter said inflation pressures gave
further scope for a rise in banks' reserve requirements
following seven increases -- together with four raises in
benchmark interest rates -- since October.
 The euro recovered from the previous day's sell-off, helped
by encouraging economic data. For details, see [FRX/]
 The single currency rose 0.7 percent to $1.4336 .
Overall, it has pulled back sharply, having hovered at a
15-month high around $1.4520 for the past week.
 Lingering worries over the cost to bail out peripheral
countries exerted pressure on the European debt market, which
lagged U.S. Treasuries. Ten-year Greek bond yields
 were last up 17 basis points at a euro-era high
of 14.815 percent, while German Bund futures  fell 0.3
percent to 122.12.
 The benchhmark U.S. 10-year note's yield 
slipped 2 basis points to 3.36 percent, its lowest in three
weeks.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded against
the dollar on Tuesday as strong economic data reassured markets
about growth in major euro zone countries even as fears mount
that Greece may have to restructure its debt.
 The data showing April business activity in Germany and
France outpaced the 15 other euro-zone countries helped drive
up the euro, a day after it suffered its biggest selling day in
five months.
 The health of bigger euro zone countries suggest interest
rates in the bloc, which rose this month, could rise again to
counter price pressure, increasing the euro's appeal.
 That outlook lessened the impact of fears over Greece.
 A German government adviser said Tuesday a restructuring of
Greek debt was inevitable, and analysts conceded that such an
outcome would be a negative for the euro.
 The euro on Tuesday rose above $1.43, well off Monday's
two-week low of $1.4155.
 A path toward higher interest rates is not as clear in the
United States, which has yet to begin monetary tightening,
while Japanese rates are expected to remain low as the country
rebuilds after a huge earthquake.
 ""There's a battle of the uglies going on,"" said Standard
Chartered analyst David Mann, and for now the euro's winning.
 Mann said the euro looks set to retest 15-month highs above
$1.45 hit after the European Central Bank hiked rates.
 The euro was last up 0.7 percent at $1.4333. Traders said a
move above $1.4250 triggered automatic buy orders that helped
accelerate the rise.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 82.51 yen and slipped 0.8
percent to $0.9562 Canadian dollars after Canada's inflation
rate hit a 2-1/2-year high in March, jacking up pressure on the
Bank of Canada to raise interest rates.
 THE FISCAL CHALLENGE
 The debt-burdened United States also lags other major
economies when it comes to tightening fiscal policy, another
long-term dollar negative, said Dan Dorrow, head of research at
Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Standard & Poor's this week threatened to cut the United
States' prized AAA credit rating unless the White House and
Congress can slash the huge budget deficit within two years.
 Dorrow said that ""draws attention to and may catalyze
future budgetary cuts that will restrain aggregate demand,
keeping the Fed very accommodative and the dollar weak.""
 Greece, Ireland and Portugal -- the three troubled euro
zone countries facing the harshest budget cuts -- account for 6
percent of euro zone output, Dorrow said, suggesting more
""gentle fiscal headwinds"" and allowing the ECB room to hike.
 But some traders said the euro could encounter more selling
ahead of the Easter holidays. Net euro long positions rose to
their highest since late 2007 in the week to April 12, recent
data showed, leaving scope for a reversal.
 The blemishes on both the U.S. dollar and the euro should
continue to boost the comomdity-sensitive Australian dollar,
Mann said.
 The Aussie was trading at $1.0517, near 29-year highs.
Australia's high benchmark interest rate and its role as a raw
materials supplier to a booming Chinese economy have increased
its appeal.
 ""The Aussie around $1.05 is a pretty major psychological
level, but given Australia's impressive terms of trade, its
strong growth numbers and the resilience of China, there's a
case to be made that we haven't seen the high yet,"" he said.

 BRUSSELS, April 19 (Reuters) - Pan-European bank stress
tests and Portugal's bailout may trigger a second wave of bank
bailouts after the first round set off by the credit crisis
more than two years ago, the EU's antitrust chief said on
Tuesday.
 Banking regulators across Europe are checking 90 banks

stress testing them.
 The results, which sets a minimum level of capital for all
lenders, are set to be published by the end of June and will
highlight banks that need to bolster their finances.
 The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the
International Monetary Fund are now negotiating the details of
Portugal's bailout, the third in the euro zone after
multi-billion euro deals for Greece and Ireland.
 ""We expect to see more cases as a possible consequence of
the program that is being negotiated with Portugal and the

Joaquin Almunia said in the text of a speech at a Global

 He did not provide details.
 The EU executive has cleared dozens of state aid schemes
for banks across the 27-country group since the credit crisis,
usually requiring the lenders to stick to their core business,
divest assets and refrain from making acquisitions until they
have repaid the funds.
 Cases pending before the Commission for approval include

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on
Tuesday, recouping the prior day's losses, but nagging debt
worries both sides of the Atlantic and new signals of inflation
dangers in China curbed risk appetite.
 A weaker dollar propelled gold  to a record peak near
$1,500 an ounce and oil in New York  above $108 a
barrel.
 Investors dipped their toes back into stocks and other risk
assets in part on solid company results, a day after Standard &
Poor's jolted sentiment when it warned political gridlock in
Washington is impeding work to pare the federal debt load.
 Speculation about Greek debt restructuring as early as this
summer has also crimped investor sentiment.
 ""We are getting a tug-of-war between the macros and micros.
We are in the middle of the earnings season with these macro
shocks,"" said Brett Hryb, senior portfolio manager at Manulife
Asset Management in Toronto.
 Wall Street stocks <.DJI> <.SPX> <.IXIC> clung to modest
gains in early afternoon trading after Goldman Sachs 
posted a smaller-than-expected fall in profits and Johnson &
Johnson  reported unexpectedly strong earnings. It fell
more than 1 percent on Monday on worries about sovereign debt
in both Europe and the United States. See [.N]
 European stocks <.FTEU3> climbed 0.42 percent, recovering
from Monday's 2 percent drop after above-consensus results from
luxury goods makers LVMH  and Burberry .
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down nearly 1.3 percent in
the wake of the prior day's losses in the U.S. and Europe.
 Investor unease persisted over a possible Greek debt
restructure that could further strain the euro zone.
 Greece sold 1.6 billion euros of three-month debt, but was
forced to pay a yield of more than 4 percent, more than
quadruple what Germany pays on similar obligations.
 DOLLAR FALLS
 Debt rating agency Standard & Poor's rattled investor
confidence on Monday when it changed its outlook on the United
States to negative from stable, threatening the future of its
prized AAA credit rating.
 The dollar slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies <.DXY> after making headway on Monday. Its gains on
Monday were due to a rush for safe havens despite the risk of
S&P downgrading U.S. debt in two years if Washington fails to
achieve a budget plan that relies less on debt.
 S&P's warning intensified scrutiny of the huge U.S. budget
deficit and the political fight to slash it. The deficit is a
key element in the global imbalances that currently worry many
investors and policymakers.
 There was no direct reaction to the S&P move on Tuesday
from Beijing, which holds vast reserves of U.S. Treasuries.
However, the head of China's central bank said the country
should diversify investments as its some $3 trillion of foreign
exchange holdings had grown too large.
 Another Chinese rate setter said inflation pressures gave
further scope for a rise in banks' reserve requirements
following seven hikes -- together with four increases in
benchmark interest rates -- since last October.
 The euro recovered somewhat from the previous day's
sell-off, as the region's debt problems remained in focus.
 The single currency notched up to $1.4316 . Overall,
it has pulled back sharply, having hovered at a 15-month high
around $1.4520 for the past week. See [FRX/]
 Worries over the cost to bailout peripheral countries
exerted pressure on the European debt market, lagging U.S.
Treasuries. Ten-year Greek bond yields  were last
up 17 bps at a euro-era high of 14.815 percent, while German
Bund futures  fell 0.3 percent at 122.10.
 Benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield  fell 3 basis
points to 3.35 percent, its lowest in about 2-1/2 weeks.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Solid euro zone economic
data helped the euro rebound against the dollar on Tuesday
after its worst day in five months but nagging worries about
debt troubles in Greece looked set to keep the single currency
vulnerable.
 The euro climbed above $1.43, well off a two-week low of
$1.4155 reached on Monday, when fears mounted that Greece will
have to restructure its debt possibly as early as summer.
Traders cited technical support near $1.42 and automatic buy
orders that were triggered above $1.4250.
 The euro zone composite PMI, a measure of the private
sector combining services and manufacturing, nudged up to 57.8
from March's 57.6, beating forecasts for a fall to 57.1 and
showing business activity in Germany and France continued to
outpace the rest of the 17-member common currency bloc.
 ""Coupled with recent data showing elevated price pressures,
robust economic data in core euro zone countries have helped
sustain rate hike expectations,"" said Samarjit Shankar,
managing director of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in
Boston. ""This has buoyed the single currency despite the
lingering sovereign debt crisis in the region's peripheral
markets.""
 The euro was last trading up 0.5 percent at $1.4309, after
rising as high as $1.4327 on Reuters data. It fell about 1.4
percent on Monday, the biggest one-day percentage drop since
November.
 Expectations the European Central Bank will continue
raising interest rates to control inflation after hiking this
month for the first time since 2008 pushed the euro above $1.45
last week. The currency, however, has come under renewed
selling pressure in recent days as worries about debt troubles
in peripheral economies resurfaced.
 Traders said the euro could encounter more selling ahead of
the Easter holidays. Net euro long positions rose to their
highest since December 2007 in the week to April 12,
positioning data showed on Friday, leaving scope for a
reversal.
 The Canadian dollar firmed to a one-week high after data
showed Canada's annual inflation rate in March jumped to its
highest since September 2008, ratcheting up pressure on the
Bank of Canada to resume raising interest rates soon.
 The U.S. dollar fell as low as C$0.9548 and last traded at
C$0.9581, down 0.6 percent on the day.
 GREECE RISK
 A German government adviser said on Tuesday that a
restructuring of Greek debt was inevitable, raising pressure on
Athens to seek a solution to the debt woes that are shaking
investor confidence in the euro zone. Athens has repeatedly
denied such a possibility.
 Greece sold more than 1.6 billion euros of three-month debt
on Tuesday, with yields rising above 4 percent. Foreign demand
also shrank.
 Analysts said the possibility that a country which has
received a bailout may still have to restructure its debt will
likely encourage more investors to exit long euro positions.
 ""The prospect of debt restructuring continues to weigh
heavy on traders' minds given its negative impact on the
European financial sector,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
currency research at GFT in New York. ""The euro could be
subject to further volatility if credit conditions in the
periphery continue to deteriorate.""
 The U.S. dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 82.41 yen, while
against a basket of currencies, it fell 0.6 percent to 75.050.
 Standard & Poor's threatened on Monday to downgrade the
United States' prized AAA credit rating unless the Obama
administration and Congress find a way to slash the yawning
federal budget deficit within two years.
 Given that a majority of U.S. debt is owned by foreign
investors, some analysts were surprised the S&P announcement of
the change to its outlook to negative from stable failed to
trigger lasting dollar selling.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2011 09:40AM ET</span>","Q+A-India's normal monsoon rainfall, impact"," NEW DELHI, April 19 (Reuters) - Expectations of a normal
monsoon in India for a second straight year have raised hopes of
higher farm output, which could tame high food prices and help
persuade the government to free rice and wheat exports.
 India is one of the world's top producers and consumers of a
range of commodities such as sugar, grains, oilseeds and cooking
oils.
 The government on Tuesday forecast normal rains for the 2011
monsoon.
 A bad monsoon can force India into the international markets
as a buyer, as happened in 2009 after initial forecasts had
called for normal rains.

WHAT DOES A ""NORMAL"" MONSOON MEAN? 
A normal monsoon means the country receives rainfall between
96-104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimetres during a
four-month season from June, according to the India's weather
office classification.
 
WHAT DOES A ""BAD"" MONSOON MEAN?
Rainfall below 90 percent of the long period average will be
treated as a bad monsoon, while rainfall above 110 percent of
the average would mean an excess monsoon.

WHEN DOES THE MONSOON ARRIVE IN INDIA? 
The southwest monsoon arrives in India on the southern coast
and usually hits the southern state of Kerala on June 1. After
hitting the southern tip, it takes about a week to cover the
coffee, tea and rubber growing areas of south India. 

HOW FAR AND FAST DOES THE MONSOON TRAVEL? 
The monsoon spreads to the rice-growing areas of eastern
parts of the country in the first 10 days. It usually covers
half of the country in the first fortnight and enters the
oilseed-producing areas of central India in the third week of
June. Cotton-growing areas in the western region get rains by
the first week of July. 
By mid-July, the monsoon covers the entire country. 

DOES A NORMAL MONSOON RULE OUT DROUGHT? 
No. A normal monsoon indicates overall rainfall to be good
but does not rule out drought in some areas. 
Distribution of rains over key crop regions is important for
the overall performance of the monsoon. 

HOW DOES THE MONSOON IMPACT CROPS? 
About 60 percent of farms depend on rainfall. Even in regions
that have irrigation facilities, monsoon rains are beneficial
for crops and help improve yields. 

DOES THE MONSOON IMPACT OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY? 
The farm sector's contribution to the overall economy is 14.6
percent. It is the key source of income for the rural
population, which accounts for two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion
people.
 Normal rains help improve farm incomes and thus increase
demand for cars, motorcycles and consumer goods. Farmers often
turn to gold as an option to invest their extra cash in a good
output year, boosting demand -- and prices. 
 Drought increases rural distress, prompting the government
to increase expenditures on subsidies and welfare schemes for
rural areas, which provide the bulk of its support.

DOES IT IMPACT MONETARY POLICY? 
India is currently struggling with high inflation, driven in
part by food and fuel prices. A normal monsoon would ease
supplies and could rein in food prices. It would also help to
support incomes and thus allow the government more flexibility
on passing on high oil prices on to consumers and cutting
subsidy bills. 
Reducing inflation could prompt the central bank to ease
monetary policy after eight successive interest rate rises. 

HOW DOES THE MONSOON IMPACT THE ENERGY SECTOR? 
Monsoon rains replenish reservoirs and increase ground-water
levels, improving irrigation, which cuts the need for diesel in
pumping water from wells. It also helps hydroelectric power
generation.
If a drought means drinking water is scarce, the government
can decide to cut supply to power generators or farms and
provide more water to households.

"
1636,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2011 09:36AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-India monsoon rains and impact on economy," NEW DELHI, April 19 (Reuters) - India on Tuesday forecast
normal rains for the 2011 monsoon, strengthening the prospect
for good farm output, which could help bring relief to Asia's
third-largest economy in its battle with high food prices.
 Monsoon rains from June to September are a key factor for
global commodities markets as they influence output of various
crops in India, which is among the world's leading producers and
consumers of wheat, rice, sugar and edible oils.
 Rainfall is likely to be 98 percent of the long-term
average, Earth Sciences Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said, adding
the forecast would be reviewed in June when monsoon rains arrive
in South Asia.
 A normal monsoon means the country receives rainfall between
96-104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimetres during the
four-month rainy season, according to India's weather office
classification.
Farming makes up about a fifth of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in India, 60 percent of whose people live in rural areas.
 The seasonal rains usually start on the southern Kerala
coast on June 1 and cover half the country by the first week of
July.
 About half of India's farm output comes from crops sown
during the four-month-long monsoon season.
 The increased soil moisture from the rains is also important
for key winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed.
 Here are facts on the monsoon and its impact:
 
 CROPS
 -- RICE: Indian farmers plant paddy at the start of the
monsoon season. The key areas for rice are the eastern and
southern regions .
 The crop is heavily dependent on rains for irrigation. A
bumper harvest last year means India has ample stocks. But
exports are still banned -- apart from select non-basmati grains
-- and normal rains could prompt the government to ease curbs on
overseas sales. Any decision is likely to come after the end of
July, when the monsoon impact is clearer.
 The government expects production of 94.11 million tonnes in
the crop year to June 2011, according to its latest forecast.
 -- SOYBEAN: A vital crop for the world's top importer of
edible oils. Higher oilseed output would rein in the growth of
edible oil imports and increase oilmeal exports.
 Output in the 2010/11 crop year is seen at 12.59 million
tonnes, according to the latest government forecasts.
 -- SUGARCANE: The world's top sugar producer after Brazil
could allow exports of the sweetener in the next season from
Oct. 1 if rains are favourable for output. India has said
exports of 500,000 tonnes can be made in the current sugar year
to September 2011.
 The government is expecting output of 24.5 million tonnes in
the 2010/11 crop year. Consumption should be some 22.5 million
tonnes.
 -- OTHERS: Corn, lentils and cotton, important crops in
western and central India, also depend heavily on the seasonal
rains. India remains a net importer of lentils.
 
 IRRIGATION, POWER
 -- Monsoon rains replenish reservoirs and lift ground-water
levels, allowing better irrigation and greater generation of
hydropower.
 -- About 40 percent of India's arable land has irrigation
facilities. The rest depends on the monsoon rains.
-- Higher rainfall levels can also reduce demand for diesel,
used to pump water from wells for irrigation when rainfall is
scant.
 
 ECONOMY AND MARKETS
 -- India is largely self-sufficient in major foodgrains such
as rice and wheat, but drought can send the country to
international markets, as in 2009 when India had to import
sugar, sending global prices to record highs and pushing up
inflation.
 -- Ample monsoon rains lift domestic demand, as higher farm
output increases the incomes of rural people, who make up about
two-thirds of India's population of 1.2 billion.
 -- Higher demand for goods and services can boost economic
growth. Also, inflation could ease because a better supply of
crops would lead to lower prices and take the pressure off the
government to step in with fiscal measures and extra subsidies.
 -- A stronger economic outlook can lift sentiment in equity
markets, particularly of firms that sell products in rural
areas, including consumer goods and automobiles.

 OTTAWA, April 19 (Reuters) - Canadian wholesale trade
dropped more than expected in February, shedding 0.6 percent
from January largely due to poor sales in the auto and parts
sector, according to Statistics Canada data on Tuesday.
 In spite of the hefty monthly drop, wholesale trade remains
16.8 percent higher than the most recent low recorded in March
2009 and was above pre-recession levels.
 Analyst's surveyed by Reuters had expected a decline of 0.1
percent in sales. The seasonally adjusted data released on
Tuesday reflects revisions back to January 2006.
 This was the first drop in sales in seven months with
declines recorded in four of the seven subsectors, representing
approximately half of total sales.
 In volume terms sales were down 1.0 percent in February
from January.
 The biggest drop in value terms came from the auto
subsector which fell 3.1 percent in February, and the
miscellaneous subsector which was down 3.5 percent, dragged
down by a 5.6 percent slump in agricultural supplies sales.
 Wholesale inventories, which have been gaining since the
start of 2010, rose 0.3 percent in March. The inventory to
sales ratio, a measure of the number of months it would take to
exhaust inventories at the current sales pace, edged up to 1.16
in February from 1.15 previously.

 HARARE, April 19 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has banned the export

 Zimbabwe, along with South Africa, holds about 90 percent of

 Zimbabwe already has three smelters that have the capacity
to handle 1.5 million tonnes of chrome.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday as it recovered from the previous day's
selloff, but debt problems in the euro zone continued to weigh
on the single currency, keeping it vulnerable to more losses.
 The euro  was up 0.5 percent at $1.4309, nudging up
after stop-loss orders were triggered above $1.4250, while the
Canadian dollar outperformed, jumping to a one-week high against
the U.S. dollar after strong Canadian inflation data.
 The single currency recovered some of Monday's losses, when
risky assets were hit by growing talk Greece will have to
restructure its mountain of debt and by Standard & Poor's threat
to cut the United States' AAA credit rating.
 But traders said the euro could encounter more selling ahead
of the Easter holidays. It may also be hemmed in by options
expiries due on Tuesday at $1.4200 and $1.4300.
 ""The European debt crisis is in the market's focus again,
and people are concerned there is no lasting solution.
Meanwhile, even negative news in the U.S. isn't putting too much
pressure on the dollar anymore,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency
analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 Earlier, comments from a German Finance Ministry official
that a Greek debt restructuring was inevitable caused the euro
to pare some early gains but it then rebounded. [ID:nBAT006174]
Athens has denied such a possibility.
 The comment supported an Athens newspaper report which cited
a European Commission official saying Greece has accepted it
cannot avoid a restructuring. [ID:nLDE73I0D5]
 Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar reversed its recent losses to
hit a one-week high versus the greenback  after data
showed Canadian inflation shot to its highest since September
2008 and above the central bank's target range. [ID:nN19160402]
 The data will add pressure on the Bank of Canada to resume
raising interest rates. The U.S. dollar lost 0.7 percent to hit
C$0.9574.
 
 EURO VULNERABLE
 The euro has pulled back sharply after it was unable to hold
onto a 15-month high above $1.45 hit earlier this month.
 Analysts said the possibility that a country which has
received a debt bailout may still have to restructure its
borrowing was likely to encourage more investors to exit long
euro positions. 
 ""We are now seeing a rapid reversal of fortune with the euro
now ranked as the overall weakest currency across the system of
models,"" BNP Paribas said in an FX quantitative strategy note.
 ""With euro bearish signals still being generated we expect
further euro selling over the short term.""
 Positioning data from the Commodity and Futures Trading
Commission on Friday showed net euro long positions at their
highest since December 2007, leaving scope for a reversal.
[IMM/FX]
 Analysts said investors were wary of holding bets in favour
of the euro over the upcoming four-day Easter holiday weekend,
adding that that the single currency could encounter more losses
if those positions are closed out.
 The dollar <.DXY> slipped 0.4 percent on the day against a
currency basket to 75.182.
 Given that a majority of U.S. debt is owned by foreign
investors, some analysts were surprised the S&P announcement
failed to trigger lasting dollar selling. Some said the dollar's
gains suggested investors were keen to lighten their heavy
positioning in favour of the euro.
 ""The price action suggests the euro was getting pretty
tired. It was definitely looking that way around $1.45,"" said
Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 He said there was a risk that the dollar could squeeze

 The U.S. currency  was flat at 82.61 yen.

 BERLIN, April 19 (Reuters) - Greece's extremely weak balance
sheet means a restructuring is inevitable, an advisor to the
German government said on Tuesday, as Germany's public banks
said such a move would not be a catastrophe for the sector.
 The statements are the latest sign of conviction in the EU's
dominant economic power that Greece's 110 billion euro EU/IMF
bailout will not allow it to avoid renegotiating its debt with
creditors, despite denials from officials across Europe.
 Clemens Fuest, who chairs the German finance ministry's
technical advisory committee, told Reuters that Greece could
barely manage to tread water since half the country's tax
revenue must now be spent simply on meeting interest payments.
 ""One must recognise the realities -- I am expecting a
haircut,"" the economist said. ""(The interest payments) are
breaking Greece."" 
 The president of the Association of German Public Sector
Banks said banks would be able to cope with a restructuring of
Greek debt, a sign that the politically sensitive sector would
not oppose such a move. [ID:nFAB016040]
 A restructuring of Greek debt would be the first by a
western European nation in over half a century and represents a
challenge for EU policymakers struggling to reconcile the
interests of their citizens with the costly steps needed to
preserve the integrity of the 17-nation currency area.
 Greece, saddled with a debt burden that is expected to swell
to 160 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, has denied
repeatedly that it plans to restructure. Bank of Greece Governor
George Provopoulos warned on Monday it would have ""catastrophic
consequences."" [ID:nLDE73H17X]

 * Cost of equipment undisclosed
 * Accord comes at sensitive time for Areva, Lauvergeon

(Adds detail)
 By Christian Plumb and Yoko Kubota
 PARIS/TOKYO, April 19 (Reuters) - French reactor maker Areva
, stepping up its role in Japan's clean-up from its worst-ever
nuclear disaster, will provide Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO)
with equipment to clean up radioactive water.
 The decontamination plant, which uses a process called
""co-precipitation"" to isolate and remove radioactive elements,
will be delivered after Areva specialists studied the crippled
reactor at close range over the last three weeks.
 Areva Chief Executive Anne Lauvergeon landed in Japan in
late March, part of a wider French delegation that flew out to
help TEPCO bring the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant under
control. France is Europe's top generator of nuclear power, from
which it gets nearly 80 percent of its energy needs.
 At a news conference in Tokyo, Lauvergeon said TEPCO was
hoping for the water treatment to start before the end of May.
 ""The situation is a great challenge...every day, every hour
is vital,"" she said. ""We will do everything we can.""
 TEPCO said over the weekend that it hoped to take an initial
step of cooling the reactors and spent fuel at the crippled
Fukushima Daiichi plant within the next three months before
bringing it to a cold shutdown within six to nine months.
 The Japanese power company has started removing highly
contaminated water from one of the reactors, a key step to
repair the cooling system.
 
 
 Areva said other processes could be used in parallel with
the co-precipitation treatment plant, which was ""the most suited
to the present emergency"" but could be supplemented by other
medium and longer term moves.
 Asked about the cost of the decontamination plant,
Lauvergeon, one of France's best known female executives, would
not provide a specific figure, saying this was not the time to
negotiate costs.
 ""The Japanese government is also supporting this,"" she said.
""I trust that there are no concerns over the issue of payment.""
 The Japanese crisis comes at a sensitive time for Areva,
which has been trying to market next-generation reactors
designed to withstand tsunamis, earthquakes or even plane
crashes.
 Lauvergeon's reappointment to a second term as CEO is in
question both because of cost overruns in building the first of
the so-called EPR plants and because of rocky relations with
state-run power company EDF.

 LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - The euro found its footing
against the dollar on Tuesday as it paused from the previous

haunt the single currency, keeping it vulnerable to more losses.
 The dollar held gains made on Monday, when risky assets were

 But it pared gains after a German Finance Ministry official
said a Greek debt restructuring was inevitable. Athens has
denied such a possibility.
 But the comments supported an Athens newspaper report which
cited a European Commission official as saying Greece has
accepted it cannot avoid a restructuring, compounding
speculation of a possible default and capping euro gains.
 Traders cited euro sell orders above $1.4270, and market
participants said the currency could encounter more selling

 The euro has pulled back sharply after it was unable to hold

 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent on the day against a currency

week hit on Monday.
 The U.S. currency was largely unchanged at 82.60 yen, while
the yen suffered against other currencies as hedge funds and
Japanese life insurers are positioned for it to resume its slide
before long.
 
 RISK POSITIONING
 Given that a majority of U.S. debt is owned by foreign
investors, some analysts were surprised the S&P announcement
failed to trigger lasting selling in the dollar. Some said the
dollar's gains suggested investors were keen to lighten their
heavy positioning in favour of the euro.
 ""You'd think the dollar would sell off more on the S&P
because an announcement like that is so rare, but the fact that
it didn't is a warning sign that we could see a bigger position
adjustment than what has already occurred,"" said Paul Mackel,
director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 He added there was a risk that the dollar could squeeze
higher and for longer than investors currently think.
 ""The price action suggests the euro was getting pretty
tired. It was definately looking that way around $1.45,"" he
said.
 A build-up of positions in risky assets -- IMM futures
speculators held near-record long positions in the Australian
dollar last week, while euro longs hit a three-year peak --
suggests that a squeeze could be significant.
 In addition, analysts balanced the U.S. rating threat with
the arguement that foreign investors would continue to buy U.S.
Treasuries due to their depth of liquidity.
 Analysts at Credit Agricole CIB said this would keep the
dollar supported, while pushing the euro to $1.39 by end-June.
 Still, some said longer-term bearish views on the U.S.
dollar and the yen remained intact with both the Federal Reserve
and the Bank of Japan set to keep monetary policy ultra-loose
while interest rates in some other countries keep rising.
 This would keep intact the funding-currency status of the
dollar and the yen in carry trades where they are used to fund
investments in higher-yielding and riskier assets.

 ""China must buy strategic resources for its

 China has never published its holdings of U.S. treasuries,

 ""The programme of reforms is disappointing with regards to
concrete actions to be taken for growth and competitiveness of

 Earlier this year, Berlusconi announced a reform plan aimed

on how that goal would be achieved.
 Italy, one of the world's slowest-growing economies over the

would drop trading band regulations on the interbank market.
 ""The government and the central bank ... will ensure the

 Belarussian banks have so far been allowed to quote the
rouble up to 10 percent off the official rate on the
over-the-counter market as Belarus sought to avoid a full-scale
devaluation.
 Having lost a quarter of its foreign currency reserves this
year, Belarus has effectively maintained multiple exchange rates
since March 30 in a bid to avoid official devaluation as Minsk
sought financial aid from Russia.
 Analysts have said the rouble's value would fall by about
20-30 percent if allowed to float freely and some form of move
had been signalled by President Alexander Lukashenko at the
weekend.
 Belarussian exporters will still have to sell 30 percent of
their foreign currency revenues at the official rate, which was

haunt the single currency, keeping it vulnerable to more losses.
 The dollar held gains made the previous day, when risky

Greece will have to restructure its mountain of debt and
Standard & Poor's threatened to cut the United States' prized
AAA credit rating.
 The euro edged up to the day's high around $1.4260, nudging
higher after stop-loss orders were triggered above $1.4250.
Still, its upside was seen limited given selling by a
semi-official European name in the mid-$1.42 region.
 In addition, traders said they were planning to sell the
euro on any rallies to the $1.4260-70 region. The 21-day moving
average, located around $1.4265, was also seen as initial
resistance for the single currency.
 The euro has pulled back sharply, having hovered at a
15-month high around $1.4520 for the past week, and analysts
said the possibility that a country which has received a debt
bailout may still have to restructure its borrowing could push
the euro lower.
 In the latest episode of the Greek debt saga, an Athens
newspaper on Tuesday cited a senior European Commission official
as saying Greece has accepted that it cannot avoid restructuring
its debt. Athens has denied such claims.
 Many in the market have flocked to U.S. assets despite the

""There isn't a dollar-negative sentiment anymore.""
 
 RISK POSITIONING
 The dollar slipped a touch on the day against a currency
basket to 75.407, but it stuck near its highest in more than a
week hit on Monday.
 The U.S. currency slipped 0.1 percent on the day to 82.55
yen as the Japanese currency edged broadly higher after elevated
risk aversion prompted investors to cut back on carry trades,
which involve selling the low-yielding Japanese currency for
higher-yielding ones.
 Many in the market expected the S&P threat would be followed
by similar negative reassessments from other ratings agencies,
which may curdle sentiment for U.S. Treasuries and the dollar.
 But analysts at Credit Agricole CIB said the market's apathy
to the S&P announcement suggested a positive sign for the
dollar.
 ""It remains important to maintain perspective ... the
reality remains no comparable asset exists for U.S. Treasury in
terms of depth of liquidity,"" they said in a note, adding that
they expected the euro to fall to $1.39 by end-June.
 In addition, a build-up of positions in risky assets -- IMM
futures speculators held near-record long positions in the
Australian dollar last week, while euro longs hit a three-year
peak -- suggests that a squeeze could be significant.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - World stocks bounced back from
their previous session's trouncing on Tuesday but debt woes on
both sides of the Atlantic and new signals from China on
inflation dangers weighed on markets.
 Wall Street looked set open higher, lifted by better than
expected first quarter earnings from investment banking
bellwether Goldman Sachs , which nonetheless fell 72
percent.
 Greece sold 1.6 billion euros of three-month debt, but was
forced to pay more than 4 percent, underlining growing unease in
the market over a potential restructuring.
 The dollar was 0.4 percent weaker against a basket of major
currencies <.DXY> after climbing on Monday as investors
engineered a classic rush to safety even as Standard & Poor's
threatened to downgrade U.S. debt.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> bounced back, but only in the
context of having fallen nearly 2 percent on Monday as the
investor mood remained cautious. Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed
down nearly 1.3 percent.
 S&P stirred up investor concerns on Monday when it changed
its outlook on the United States to negative from stable,
threatening the future of its prized AAA credit rating.
 The threat brings into focus the huge U.S. budget deficit
and the difficulty that Washington has in paring it down. The
deficit is a key element in the global imbalances that currently
worry many investors and policymakers.
 There was no direct reaction to the S&P move on Tuesday from
Beijing, which -- in counterpoint -- holds vast reserves of U.S.
Treasuries, though the head of China's central bank said the
country should diversify investments as its some $3 trillion of
foreign exchange holdings had grown too large.
Another Chinese ratesetter said inflation pressures gave
further scope for a rise in banks' reserve requirements
following seven hikes -- together with four increases in
benchmark interest rates -- since last October.
 ""Discussions on the U.S. losing its AAA-status have been
active for two years, if not longer. S&P's move might have been
a jolt, but should not really be a true surprise,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.
 Equity investors, meanwhile, focused on the earnings season.
 In Europe, there was some boost from LVMH  and
Burberry , which both beat consensus forecasts.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up three quarters of a
percent.
 ""We were hit down big time yesterday and I expect to see
some bargain hunting,"" said Simon Clark, trader at ETX Capital.
 Goldman's first quarter result augured well for the pace of
corporate activity as 2011 progresses, one banker said.
 ""Goldman is a good indicator for the global M&A and IPO
markets so overall this is encouraging going forward,"" said
Joerg Rahn, chief investment officer at Macard, Stein & Co in
Hamburg.
 
 EURO STABLISES
 The euro recovered somewhat from the previous day's
sell-off, but the region's debt problems remained in focus and
euro zone core bond yields rose .
 The single currency edged up to $1.4298 . Overall, it
has pulled back sharply, having hovered at a 15-month high
around $1.4520 for the past week.
 ""The European debt crisis is in the market's focus again,
and people are concerned there is no lasting solution.
Meanwhile, even negative news in the U.S. isn't putting too much
pressure on the dollar anymore,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency
analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Growth in the euro zone
services sector slowed slightly this month but factories ramped
up production, with prices rising at the fast monthly rate in
three years, purchasing managers' surveys showed on Tuesday.
 The April data showed the fastest pace of job growth since
late 2007, but also highlighted that business activity in
Germany and France continued to outpace the rest of the common
currency bloc.
 ""Employment should help sustain robust broad-based economic
growth in coming months,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist
at data compiler Markit, although he noted that growth remained
too dependent on the euro zone's two largest economies.
 ""Less welcome was the news on inflation, with prices charged
for goods and services showing the largest monthly jump since
the all-time high seen during the oil price peak of 2008. 
 The Flash Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'
Index (PMI) slipped to 56.9 in April from the previous month's
near 4-year high of 57.2, in line with consensus.
 This is the 20th month the index, which measures the
activities of companies ranging from banks to hotels, has been
above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.
 The flash manufacturing PMI rose to 57.7 from 57.5 in March,
confounding consensus expectations in a Reuters poll for a fall
to 57.0, while the output index bounced to 60.0 from 58.5.
 The euro zone composite PMI, a broader measure of the
private sector which combines the services and manufacturing
data, nudged up to 57.8 from March's 57.6, beating forecasts for
a fall to 57.1.
 The composite index is often used as a guide to growth and
Markit said it was at similar levels to the first three months
of the year and pointed towards quarterly economic growth of 0.8
percent in the second quarter.
 Analysts polled by Reuters last week predicted second
quarter growth of 0.4 percent for the euro zone economy.
 
 INFLATION PRESSURE ACCELERATES
 Inflation pressure is picking up across the euro zone
economy even as input cost rises eased somewhat.
 This will be noted by the European Central Bank, which
raised interest rates this month for the first time since July
2008.
 Indeed, the service sector output price index rose to its
highest since then, up nearly a full point to 53.2.
 This happened as input price rises cooled in manufacturing.
That sub-index fell to 79.6 from 82.2. But this was still the
third-highest reading in the survey's 14-year history, exceeded
only by those in the prior two months, Markit said.
 Official euro zone data showed inflation rose to 2.7 percent
in March, considerably above the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.
 Hiring accelerated this month to its strongest pace since
November 2007, the PMI showed, with the composite employment
index rising to 53.6 from 53.1. Unemployment in the euro zone
dipped to 9.9 percent in February after holding steady at 10
percent in January.

 BEIJING, April 19 (Reuters) - China has ""considerable"" scope
to further increase its reserve requirement ratio for banks, Hu
Xiaolian, a deputy governor at China's central bank said in
comments published on Tuesday.	
 ""In both theory analysis and real situation estimates, there
is considerable room to increase the deposit reserve ratio in
the future,"" Hu said in a speech made on Friday, two days before
the People's Bank of China (PBOC) increased the ratio to an
all-time high of 20.5 percent for big banks. [ID:nL3E7FH05Y]	
 ""It should be noted that increases in the deposit reserve
ratio are mainly aimed at soaking up liquidity generated by
foreign exchange inflows, and the increases have no big impact
on normal positions of financial institutions with an overall
neutral effect,"" Hu added.	
 Her comments were in line with remarks of Central Bank
governor Zhou Xiaochuan who said there was no limit to how high
the deposit reserve ratio could be raised. [ID:nL3E7FG019]	
 Hu added that four increases in benchmark interest rates had
helped to lessen the real negative interest rates, but added
that China must let interest rate ""play a bigger role"" in
managing inflation.	
 ""Long-term, continuous real negative interest rates will
affect saving and spending behavior, encourage investments and
undermine inflation management,"" she said.	
 China's inflation hit a 32-month-high of 5.4 percent in
March, while China's one-year benchmark deposit rate is set at
3.25 percent. 
 
 IMPORTED INFLATION	
 Hu also said China has to make the yuan more
flexible as a way to address imported inflation.	
 ""Due to a recovery in demand worldwide, sufficient
liquidity, geopolitical events and big natural disasters,
commodity prices are expected to continue rising,"" Hu said.	
 Price increases abroad, coupled with rising costs at home,
will put pressure on the central bank to keep full-year
inflation at about 4 percent in 2011, Hu noted.	
 ""From the current trend, the inflation situation needs high
attention,"" Hu said. ""The latest price rise is driven by
complicated factors at home and abroad. There is no fundamental
change in these factors so far, and we face big challenges to
achieve the full-year 4 percent control target.""	
 She said domestic drivers of economic growth are strong
while the global economic recovery is well on track this year.	
 ""If there is no big surprise, China can achieve 8 percent or
even higher economic growth for the whole year,"" Hu said.

(Adds detail, background)	
 TOKYO, April 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Meiji Yasuda Life plans
to increase its investment in foreign bonds, focusing on dollar
debt, with its confidence in U.S. Treasuries unshaken by the
threat of a credit downgrade, a top executive said on Tuesday.	
 Japan's third-largest private life insurer, with total
assets of 26 trillion yen ($314.5 billion), said it plans to
increase its holdings of foreign bonds that are not
currency-hedged by 170 billion yen in the 2011/12 fiscal year
that began on April 1.	
 ""U.S. President (Barack) Obama is saying he is serious about
fiscal reform. U.S. Treasuries are the world's largest bond
market and our confidence is unshaken,"" Yasuharu Takamatsu,
Meiji Yasuda's director of investments, told a news conference.	
 ""How we will invest depends on yield levels and, more
importantly, currency levels. But we won't change our initial
investment plan,"" he added, when asked about the impact of
Standard and Poor's cut in its rating outlook on U.S. sovereign
debt on Monday.	
 The insurer expects U.S. yields to gradually climb
in line with improvements in the U.S. Economy, to around 4.1
percent next March from about 3.3 percent now.	
 Meiji Yasuda has been warming to foreign bonds in the past
year. The company said it increased unhedged foreign bond
holdings by 500 billion yen in the last financial year as it
sees limited risk in the yen's rise.	
 Although the company has not yet disclosed a
currency breakdown of its foreign-denominated assets for the end
of March, as of last September about 90 percent of its foreign
assets were in dollars -- the highest ratio among Japan's top
nine life insurers.	
 
 UNDER PRESSURE	
 The company has a cautious view on the euro, saying the
common currency's rally driven by expectations of European
Central Bank rate hikes was likely to run its course soon.	
 The currency will again come under pressure from worries
about debt problems in the euro zone's periphery countries, as
well as concerns that fiscal tightening could slow growth, the
company said.	
 Meiji Yasuda also said the yen is likely to fall for the
time being because the Bank of Japan is expected to be the last
major central bank to look to exit its stimulative policies. 
 Meiji Yasuda also said it plans to boost its yen bond
holdings by around 1 trillion yen in the current financial year
while extending the duration of the maturities.	
 In the year that ended on March 31, the company increased
its Japanese bond holdings by 2 trillion yen.	
 It also raised its foreign-denominated bond holdings with
currency hedging by around 140 billion yen, the company said.	
 For Japanese life insurers, foreign bond buying with
currency hedging is an attractive alternative to low-yielding
yen bonds. 
 Meiji Yasuda said the company could increase its holding of
hedged foreign bonds if Japanese yields fall too much.	
 Takamatsu added that the insurer would trim its holdings of
Japanese stocks and alternative investments, as it tries to
limit its exposure to risky assets. 
 Japanese insurers have been reducing Japanese shares for
many years ahead of the introduction this financial year of new
government regulations that raise the risk weighting on stocks
and other risky assets that insurers hold.	
 The company also said it held both bonds and shares of Tokyo
Electric Power Co , the operator of a crippled nuclear
power plant in Fukushima.	
 Meiji Yasuda said it planned to hold the utility's bonds to
maturity as it expects the company to receive government
support, given its importance as an operator of vital
infrastructure.

 * Profit-taking seen in region
 * Gold below record, up 0.7 percent today

 By Sugita Katyal	
 SINGAPORE, April 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid on
Tuesday, falling further from a three-year high hit last week as
investors took profits on risks of a Greek debt restructuring in
Europe and the long-term threat of a U.S. government debt
downgrade.	
 The euro nursed heavy losses early in Asia while the yen
gained across the board as worries about sovereign debt problems
in Europe and the United States prompted investors to unwind
carry trades.	
 Standard & Poor's threatened on Monday to downgrade the
United States' prized AAA credit rating unless the Obama
administration and Congress find a way to slash the yawning
federal budget deficit within two years. 
S&P slapped a negative outlook on the country's top-notch
credit rating and said there's at least a one-in-three chance
that it could eventually cut it. 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 percent to
12201.59.	
 Japan's Nikkei stock average fell as much as 1.5
percent after the S&P cut before closing down 1.2 percent at
9,441.03. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng also shed 1.5 percent, then
climbed a bit to be off 1.2 percent. Foreign investors trimmed
holdings they put on in the past few weeks.	
 Outside Japan, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks
slipped further away from a nearly three-year
high hit last week. It was down 1.1 percent dragged down by
falls in energy and materials. 
 The S&P outlook cut ""is likely to shift more capital away
from the U.S. and other developed markets towards emerging
markets because in relative terms, emerging markets will look
safer, more atractive, and investors will no longer look at the
US with the same kind of confidence they did in the past,""
Dariusz Kowalczyk of CACIB. 
 He added that S&P announcement ""would be supportive for the
currencies and asset prices throughout the emerging world."" 
 Despite the threat of a S&P ratings cut, U.S. Treasuries
were mostly steady as other concerns, such as falling stock
prices, appeared to trump the outlook revision.	
 After an earlier sell-off, the 30-year bond was
10/32 higher in price and yielding 4.45 percent, down from 4.47
percent late Friday. 
The gap between two-year note yields and 30-year bond yields
briefly hit a recent high of 384 basis points, or the largest
spread since March 17, but it was last at 379 basis points, up
from 377 basis points late on Friday.	
 Traders and analysts said the S&P threat would likely have
little lasting impact, and even the euro's slide on worries
about Greece seemed more driven by profit-taking after the
euro's rise ran out of steam above $1.45 last week. 
 The euro fell to as low as 116.41 yen -- the
lowest since March 30. The dollar also underperformed the yen,
falling to a near three-week low around 82.16 , before
recovering slightly to last stand at 82.59.	
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars slipped on the U.S.
dollar and yen as falling stocks, escalating euro debt woes and
a credit warning for U.S. debt sparked a wave of risk aversion. 
The Australian dollar slipped to $1.0465, from
$1.0510 late in New York and a high of $1.0572 on Monday. It
dipped as far as $1.0454 offshore after S&P's warning to
Washington.[ID:nN18195555]. 
Spot gold rose as much as nearly 1 percent in early
morning trade, before trimming gains to $1,490.95 an ounce at
0559 GMT, up 0.7 percent. In the previous session, gold reached
a record high of $1,497.20
ICE Brent crude  for June fell 32 cents to $121.29 a
barrel by 0315 GMT. U.S. crude  was down 40 cents at
$106.72 a barrel. 
 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) painted an upbeat
outlook for the local and global economies in minutes of the
April policy-setting meeting released on Tuesday.

 By Ian Chua and Eric Burroughs	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, April 19 (Reuters) - The yen edged higher in
Asia on Tuesday as more market players cut back on carry trades,
but the move will likely be short-lived as hedge funds and
Japanese life insurers positioned for the yen to resume its
slide before long.	
 Risky assets were hit by a double-whammy on Monday after
fears mounted that Greece will have to restructure its mountain
of debt, possibly as early as this summer, and Standard & Poor's
threatened to cut the United States' prized AAA credit rating.	
 The drop in Wall Street shares spilled across Asia, with
Japan's Nikkei average and Hong Kong's Hang Seng
both shedding about 1 percent as investors booked profits and
closed positions heading into the Easter holidays later this
week.	
 Traders and analysts said the S&P threat would likely have
little lasting impact, and even the euro's slide on worries
about Greece seemed more driven by profit-taking after the
euro's rise ran out of steam above $1.45 last week.	
 But the build-up of positions in risky assets -- IMM futures
speculators held near-record long positions in the Australian
dollar last week, while euro longs hit a three-year peak --
suggested that a squeeze could last for a bit longer. 
 ""It's kind of a healthy correction. The market had bought
too much in a kind of euro euphoria,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. 
 ""Events regarding the peripheral countries are used as an
excuse to take profits. It's not a restart of the euro crisis,""
Yamamoto said.	
 S&P slapped a negative outlook on the U.S. top-notch rating
and said there was at least a one-in-three chance that it could
eventually be cut unless the Obama administration and Congress
find a way to slash the yawning federal budget deficit within
two years.	
 ""Discussions on the U.S. losing its AAA-status have been
active for two years, if not longer. S&P's move might have been
a jolt, but should not really be a true surprise,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.	
 In a classic flight to safety, the dollar jumped and
Treasury yields fell -- suggesting investors were not fretting
too much about the S&P action while looking to see if Washington
makes progress on reducing deficits.	
 Japan's finance minister said that he still thinks
Treasuries are an attractive investment for the world's second
biggest holder of FX reserves, totaling $1.12 trillion.	
 
 
 EURO EXPOSED	
 The euro was down slightly at 117.35 yen . The
single currency fell as low as 116.49 yen on EBS, the lowest
since March 30, on Monday before staging a late-day recovery
along with U.S. stocks.	
 The single currency was also little changed at $1.4220
after having skidded to a low of $1.4156 on Monday,
breaking the upward trendline of its January-April surge and
leaving it exposed to a deeper pull-back.	
 The dollar dipped to 82.42 yen , having fallen to a
near three-week low of 82.19. Macro hedge funds were looking to
go long the dollar around these levels, both buying spot and
picking up dollar/yen call options, traders said.	
 Traders also cited talk of Japanese life insurers buying
dollars to purchase Treasuries and other debt when the dollar
falls near 82. Japanese life insurers have been repeatedly cited
as dollar buyers since the greenback plunged to a record low
last month.	
 Meiji Yasuda, Japan's No. 3 life insurer by asset size with
$315 billion, said on Tuesday that it plans to boost foreign
bond holdings and to focus unhedged bond purchases on U.S.
bonds, saying it had confidence in U.S. Treasuries. 
 The 82.00 level marks a critical zone of chart support --
it's the intraday peak reached during the March 18 bout of
coordinated G7 intervention, while 81.99 is the 38.2 percent
retracement of dollar/yen's March-April surge.	
 Against the dollar, the euro was at $1.4230 after
sliding to a two-week low at $1.4156 on EBS. The euro's next
layer of support stems from a cluster of daily highs and lows
bunched at $1.4035/55. Further down, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the euro's January-April surge is at $1.3887.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was little
changed at 75.516 after touching a two-week high of 75.810, well
off a 16-month low of 74.716 set last week.	
 Still, analysts said longer-term bearish views on the U.S.
dollar and the yen remained intact with both the Federal Reserve
and the Bank of Japan set to keep monetary policy ultra-loose,
maintaining their funding-currency status in carry trades.	
 In fact, the early threat of a downgrade may help U.S.
policy leaders to make progress on agreeing to substantial
budget cuts, said Michael Sneyd, an analyst at Societe Generale.	
 ""All-in-all, we expect a rebound in risk once the heavy
de-leveraging has run its course, but this may take until after
the Easter break and EUR/JPY should then be the best performer.""	
 The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at $1.0470
after having shed about a cent on Monday to a low of
$1.0454. But the Aussie was not far off a 29-year high of
$1.0585 set earlier this month, outperforming other currencies.	
 The New Zealand dollar also took a hit from the
drop in higher-yielding currencies after reaching a three-year
peak the previous day.

 * No evidence of serious spillover from Japan to rest of
Asia
 * Hard to see China accelerating yuan reform

 By Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, April 19 (Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank may
need to slightly downgrade its forecast of 1.5 percent economic
growth for Japan this year but a contraction in the economy is
unlikely, Changyong Rhee, its chief economist, said on Tuesday.	
 ""We have no reason to assume that the growth rate will be
minus ... Supply chain elements we believe are less severe than
we originally thought. On the other hand, the power shortage
seems to have become a more serious problem,"" Rhee told Reuters
in interview.	
 ""We may have to adjust our number a little bit but it won't
likely be a minus number.""	
 The ADB's growth forecast for Japan in its Asian Development
Outlook, compiled a week after the devastating March 11
earthquake and tsunami, is more bullish than most private sector
analysts, some of whom predict a contraction for this year.	
 Rhee nevertheless played down expectations that rebuilding
efforts will eventually bolster the Japanese economy, saying
reconstruction would amount to only 4 to 5 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) at most and would pale in comparison to
the extent of damage already done.	
 Asked about possible spillover to the rest of Asia, Rhee, a
South Korean national, said he saw little sign that Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis would have a serious
negative impact on Asian economies.	
 But he added that individual companies may already be hit by
a shortage of goods imported from Japan.	
 ""Many final goods manufacturing companies in South Korea
heavily depend on parts and intermediate goods from Japan ...
They are worrying about the possibility that this supply chain
disruption may continue more than expected.""	
 Asked about Standard and Poor's cut in its rating outlook
for U.S. sovereign debt on Monday, Rhee said the action was
expected and not a shock to Asian holders of U.S. Treasury
bonds.	
 On currency issues, Rhee, a former G20 sherpa for South
Korea, said it was hard to predict whether Chinese currency
reform would gain traction as a result of Group of 20
discussions on including the yuan in the basket of currencies
that make up IMF Special Drawing Rights.	
 He cited uncertainty about whether China would accept the
preconditions for SDRs, such as liberalising its capital
markets.	
 Rhee said the Group of Seven joint intervention last month
to halt the yen's rise was well justified due to over-reacting
markets but was ""not a good message"" for its G20 counterparts.	
 ""It would have been much better if the G20, rather than G7,
intervened. Now we are talking about exchange rate issues within
G20 and many advanced countries talk about non-cooperation from
emerging nations ... This could have been a good chance to
build confidence in each other.""

 TOKYO/SYDNEY, April 19 (Reuters) - The yen edged higher in
Asia on Tuesday as a slide in Asian stock markets prompted more
market players to cut back on carry trades, even as hedge funds
were spotted adding to bets that the Japanese currency would
soon resume its drop.	
 Risky assets were hit by a double-whammy on Monday after
fears mounted that Greece will have to restructure its mountain

Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.	
 In a classic flight to safety, the dollar jumped and
Treasury yields fell despite the threat of an S&P ratings cut --
suggesting investors were not fretting too much about the action
while looking to see if Washington makes progress on reducing
deficits.	
 Japan's finance minister said that he still thinks
Treasuries are an attractive investment for the world's second
biggest holder of FX reserves, totaling $1.12 trillion.	
 
 The twin drivers saw Wall Street post its biggest fall in a
month and provided investors a timely excuse to take profits on
long positions in higher-yielding currencies and equities before
the Easter holidays. 
 That helped the yen, which had recently been dumped in
favour of higher-yielding currencies, rise broadly.	
 The euro was steady on the day at 117.30 yen
after falling as low as 116.49 yen on EBS, the lowest since
March 30.	
 The single currency was also little changed at $1.4220
after having skidded to a low of $1.4156 on Monday,
breaking the upward trendline of its January-April surge and
leaving it exposed to a deeper pull-back.	
 The dollar dipped to 82.53 yen after having fallen to
a near three-week low of 82.19. Traders said macro hedge funds
were looking to go long the dollar around these levels, both
buying spot and picking up dollar/yen call options.	
 Traders also cited talk of Japanese life insurers buying
dollars to purchase Treasuries and other debt when the dollar
falls near 82. Japanese life insurers have been repeatedly cited
as dollar buyers since the greenback plunged to a record low
last month.	
 The 82.00 level marks a critical zone of chart support --
the intraday peak reached during the March 18 bout of
coordinated G7 intervention, while 81.99 is the 38.2 percent
retracement of dollar/yen's March-April surge.	
 Against the dollar, the euro was at $1.4207 after
sliding to a two-week low at $1.4156 on EBS.	
 This helped the dollar index , which tracks its
performance against a basket of major currencies, rise to
two-week highs of 75.810, well off a 16-month low of 74.716 set
last week.	
 Still, analysts said the longer-term bearish views on the
U.S. dollar and yen remained intact with both the Federal
Reserve and Bank of Japan set to keep monetary policy
ultra-loose, maintaining their funding-currency status.	
 In fact, the early threat of a downgrade may help U.S.
policy leaders to make progress on agreeing to substantial
budget cuts, said Michael Sneyd, an analyst at Societe Generale.	
 ""All-in-all, we expect a rebound in risk once the heavy
de-leveraging has run its course, but this may take until after
the Easter break and EURJPY should then be the best performer.""	
 The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at $1.0464
after having shed about a cent on Monday to a low of
$1.0454. But the Aussie was not far off a 29-year high of
$1.0585 set earlier this month, outperforming other currencies.	
 The New Zealand dollar also took a hit from the
drop in higher-yielding currencies after reaching a three-year
peak the previous day.

 By Sugita Katyal	
 SINGAPORE, April 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Tuesday
after rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered its U.S. credit
outlook to negative, prompting a global flight to other assets.	
 The euro nursed heavy losses early in Asia while the yen
gained across the board as worries about sovereign debt problems
in Europe and the United States prompted investors to unwind
carry trades.	
 Standard & Poor's threatened on Monday to downgrade the
United States' prized AAA credit rating unless the Obama
administration and Congress find a way to slash the yawning
federal budget deficit within two years. 
S&P, which assigns ratings to guide investors on the risks
involved in buying debt instruments, slapped a negative outlook
on the country's top-notch credit rating and said there's at
least a one-in-three chance that it could eventually cut it. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 percent to
12201.59.	
 ""The overnight tumble of U.S. shares further deepened
investor worries about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery,""
said Simon Liu, deputy investment officer of Polaris Group's
asset management firm in Taiwan.	
 ""In the longer term, foreign fund flows will go into
emerging markets and out of developed economies,"" said Liu.	
 Despite the downgrade in the outlook for U.S. sovereign
debt, U.S. Treasuries were mostly steady as other concerns, such
as falling stock prices, appeared to trump the outlook revision.	
 After an earlier sell-off, the 30-year bond was
10/32 higher in price and yielding 4.45 percent, down from 4.47
percent late Friday. 
The gap between two-year note yields and 30-year bond yields
briefly hit a recent high of 384 basis points, or the largest
spread since March 17, but it was last at 379 basis points, up
from 377 basis points late on Friday.	
 Some analysts said the decline in Asian stocks was likely
profit-taking triggered by a global pull back in risk-taking due
to the long-term threat of a U.S. rating downgrade and
nearer-term fears of a Greek debt restructuring. 
 Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent after the S&P
cut with the benchmark Nikkei average down 142.66 points
at 9,413.99, while the broader Topix shed 1.35 percent
to 825.07. 
 Outside Japan, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks
slipped further away from a nearly three-year
high hit last week. It was down 1.2 percent in early trade. 
The euro fell to as low as 116.41 yen -- the
lowest since March 30. The dollar also underperformed the yen,
falling to a near three-week low around 82.16 , before
recovering slightly to last stand at 82.59.	
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars slipped on the U.S.
dollar and yen as falling stocks, escalating euro debt woes and
a credit warning for U.S. debt sparked a wave of risk aversion. 
The Australian dollar slipped to $1.0465, from
$1.0510 late in New York and a high of $1.0572 on Monday. It
dipped as far as $1.0454 offshore after S&P's warning to
Washington.[ID:nN18195555]. 
Spot gold rose as much as nearly 1 percent in early
morning trade, before trimming gains to $1,489.19 an ounce by
0303 GMT, up half a percent. In the previous session, gold
reached a record high of $1,497.20	
 NYMEX crude for May delivery , which expires on
Tuesday, was down 6 cents at $107.06 a barrel by 0035 GMT, after
settling down $2.54 at $107.12 a day earlier.	
 Brent crude for June  fell about 0.4 percent to
$121.17 a barrel versus a $121.61 settlement in the previous
session.	
 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) painted an upbeat
outlook for the local and global economies in minutes of the
April policy-setting meeting released on Tuesday.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2011 08:24PM ET</span>",China c.bank gov says FX reserves excessive -report," SHANGHAI, April 19 (Reuters) - China's huge stockpile of
foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, have become
excessive and the government must diversify investments using
the reserves, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of
China, said in comments published on Tuesday.	
 The country's foreign exchange reserves swelled by nearly
$200 billion in the first quarter of this year to more than $3
trillion, indicating hefty capital inflows, and the government
has so far focused on investing mainly in U.S. dollar assets,
including U.S. Treasures.	
 ""Foreign exchange reserves have exceeded our country's
rational demand, and too much accumulation has caused excessive
liquidity in our markets, adding to the pressure of the central
bank's sterilisation,"" Zhou was quoted by the official Shanghai
Securities News as saying.	
 ""The State Council has required a cut in excessive
accumulation and good management of the funds accumulated,
including diversification of investments,"" Zhou was quoted as
telling forum at Tsinghua University in Beijing.	
 To keep the yuan exchange rate stable in a
capital account control system, the PBOC injects huge amounts of
yuan into the banking system by buying foreign currencies from
commercial banks. 
 The central bank then soaks up the excess yuan in the system
via open-market operations and higher bank deposit reserve
requirements. This is to prevent the money from flowing into the
economy and fuelling inflation.	
 The newspaper did not quote Zhou as giving any details on
the diversification of foreign exchange reserve use, although
Chinese economists have urged the government to buy more assets
in other currencies, such as euro and yen, as well as to invest
in strategic goods such as oil and non-ferrous metals.	
 Commenting on other aspects of China's economy, Zhou was
quoted as saying that the central government was considering
letting local authorities issue municipal bonds for the first
time as the main avenue for future financing of regional
infrastructure construction.	
 Local governments have so far relied mainly on sales of land
for such financing, supported by quasi-treasury bonds issued by
the central government on their behalf or special funds.	
 That has helped inflate China's real estate prices and
caused strong resistance from regional authorities to steps from
the central government to cool the property market, among other
problems.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - A threat by Standard &
Poor's to cut its AAA rating of U.S. government debt and
renewed worries about Europe's debt crisis spurred a sell-off
in major world stock markets on Monday.
 The weakness started in European markets on fears that
Greece will have to restructure its debt possibly as early as
the summer. That put the euro on track for its biggest one-day
decline in five months against the U.S. dollar.
 The sell-off picked up pace later when rating agency
Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on the United States to
negative from stable, citing the risk that policymakers would
fail to agree on proposals to cut its large budget deficit over
the next two years. See [ID:nN18195555]
 Longer-dated U.S. government bond prices initially fell but
recovered in afternoon trade. While the U.S. debt outlook is
certainly problematic, it is not as damaging, at least
immediately, as the euro zone's sovereign woes have been,
analysts said.
 ""This morning's S&P story added to the negative tone
throughout global markets and that has exacerbated the move
lower,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""It does very much highlight
the difficult situation in the U.S.""
 While the S&P maintained the country's top AAA credit
rating, the move signals there's at least a one-in-three chance
that it could cut the long-term rating within two years.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
started what is in many places a holiday-shortened week by
losing 1.5 percent.
 Wall Street stocks fell more than 1 percent as the S&P's
revision added to worries about the global economy after China
moved to curb liquidity to counter rising inflation pressures.
 Equities ended off their lows in a heavily traded session,
though the decline still amounted to the largest in a month.
 Some analysts said the sell-off in equities was overdone,
citing the recovery in the U.S. bond market and fresh worries
about the euro zone.
 ""The behavior of the bond market suggests that we could get
a rebound in stocks, at least one related to the S&P news,""
said David Joy, chief market strategist at Columbia Management
in Boston, which oversees $347 billion.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 140.24
points, or 1.14 percent, to end at 12,201.59. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 14.54 points, or 1.10 percent, to
finish at 1,305.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slid
29.27 points, or 1.06 percent, to close at 2,735.38.

 European shares sunk to a three-week closing low, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> off 1.7 percent.
 The euro hit a two-week low against the dollar of $1.4155
. It recovered some of the losses to be quoted late
afternoon at $1.4232, still down 1.4 percent and on track for
its biggest one-day drop since late November. The euro also
lost 1.9 percent to 117.68 yen .
 The euro's decline came after German government sources
said they did not believe Greece, which sealed a 110 billion
euro ($157.7 billion) bailout from the EU and IMF last year,
would make it through the summer without restructuring. The
Greek government has denied repeatedly that it plans to
restructure. See [ID:nLDE73H0IC]
 Pressure on Portugal also grew after the anti-euro True
Finns party scored big gains in the Sunday vote and vowed to
push for changes to a Portuguese rescue that is expected to
total 80 billion euros.
 SAFE-HAVEN GOLD SHINES
 Gold prices rallied to record highs of nearly $1,500 an
ounce while other commodities tumbled as investors fled to
safe-haven assets. Worries about the euro zone's debt problems
and the inflation picture in China added to investor jitters.
 Spot gold  rose to an all-time high of $1,497.20 an
ounce. Benchmark gold futures in New York  rose to a
record of $1,498.60 an ounce. [GOL/]
 ""The U.S. debt situation got a reality check,"" said John
Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. ""Only precious
metals will be seen as attractive in the aftermath of the
outlook downgrade.""
 Oil came under pressure after OPEC ministers said high
crude prices could place a major strain on economies on
consumer countries' economies. Brent crude for June 
fell $1.84 to settle at $121.61 a barrel, having slipped to a
session low of $121. U.S. crude  for May fell $2.54 to
settle at $107.12, after slipping as low as $106.54.
 The sell-off in stocks and some commodities pushed up the
yen as investors closed riskier trades funded by the
low-yielding Japanese currency. The dollar lost 0.5 percent to
82.67 yen, and hit a low of 82.16 yen .
 In the bond market, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes
 were trading 9/32 higher in price to yield 3.38
percent. The long bond  rose 7/32 in price to yield
4.457 percent.
 Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets in
Toronto, said the S&P announcement is really only catching up
to what the markets have already priced in.
 ""The prospect of an actual default by the U.S. on debt
issued in its own currency isn't a realistic worry, in a
financial market that has a lot more real worries to deal with,
including genuine Eurozone default risks,"" he said.
 ""We are less concerned over a downgrade to the outlook than
we are about the growth implications of turning to fiscal belt
tightening before the economy has self-sustaining momentum.""

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro slid more than 1
percent against the dollar on Monday, suffering its worst
one-day drop since November on mounting concerns that Greece
will be forced to restructure its debt.
 Another factor hurting the euro was anti-aid sentiment in
Europe, which showed signs of growing.
 Rampant risk aversion generally weighed on the euro zone's
single currency even as Standard & Poor's revised its outlook
on the United States' long-term rating to negative from stable
but affirmed its 'AAA/A-1+' sovereign credit rating.
 An actual ratings downgrade of U.S. debt would be negative
for the U.S. dollar, but most believe S&P's announcement was a
warning and therefore, it did little to rattle the greenback's
performance against the euro.
 In late afternoon New York trading. the euro was down 1.4
percent at $1.4232, with the session low at $1.4155 -- a
two-week low -- according to Reuters data. It was the biggest
fall since a 1.86 percent decline on Nov. 23.
 The euro's rise has stalled since it hit a 15-month high
last week.
 ""The key takeaway from the S&P announcement is that the
U.S. has been put on notice, but no ratings action is likely
until 2013,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""With no one expecting any serious progress on deficit
reduction until after the 2012 election, S&P seems to be
simply firing a shot across the bow to U.S. policymakers,"" he
said.
 While U.S. fiscal tensions are increasing, the United
States is far from defaulting on its debt.
 ""Continued concerns about America's bloated deficits and
policymakers' inability to agree on the difficult measures
needed to address budgetary challenges remains a key risk for
the dollar,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Esiner said while this is remote, the risk may be
increasing.
 The possibility of the U.S. losing its AAA rating could
result in a wholesale abandonment of dollar assets and would
potentially destabilize the entire global economy, he said.
 German government sources said they expected Greece will
not make it through the summer without debt restructuring,
although Athens denied a debt rescheduling was imminent.
 Earlier, a Greek newspaper reported that Greece had told
the IMF and the European Union this month it wants to
restructure its debt. Greek debt pared losses as a finance
ministry source in Athens said the story was untrue.
 Players also monitored Portugal's progress toward a
bailout after strong gains in a weekend election in Finland by
an anti-euro party that has vowed to veto the rescue package.
 Analysts doubted the Finnish vote could do more than slow
down a bailout, but the vote's outcome added to negative euro
sentiment, encouraging investors to cut long positions.
 ""The real fear is that anti-euro aid sentiment is building
across Europe, which, should it spill into countries like
Germany, could have significant ramifications,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 FOR U.S., A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK
 Standard & Poor's cited huge budget deficits and rising
government indebtedness as the reason for the U.S. outlook
revision, with the path to addressing those issues unclear.
 The euro fell to its lowest in almost three weeks against
the yen. It last traded at 117.60 yen, down 1.9 percent.
 The dollar also hit its lowest in almost three weeks
against the yen to around 82.16 yen, before recovering to
82.62 yen, down 0.6 percent for the day.
 ""In jittery markets and given plenty of event risk, the
clearest winners look to be the Swiss franc and Japanese yen,
which should remain well supported during the next 24 to 48
hours,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at
Wells Fargo in New York.

afternoon at $1.4227, still down 1.4 percent and on track for
its biggest one-day drop since late November. The euro also
lost 2.2 percent to 117.28 yen .
 German government sources said they did not believe Greece,
which sealed a 110 billion euro ($157.7 billion) bailout from
the EU and IMF last year, would make it through the summer
without restructuring. The Greek government has denied
repeatedly that it plans to restructure. See [ID:nLDE73H0IC]
 Pressure on Portugal also grew after the anti-euro True
Finns party scored big gains in the Sunday vote and vowed to
push for changes to a Portuguese rescue that is expected to
total 80 billion euros.
 SAFE-HAVEN GOLD SHINES
 Gold prices rallied to record highs of nearly $1,500 an
ounce while other commodities tumbled as investors fled to
safe-haven assets after S&P's move. Worries about the euro
zone's debt problems and inflation in China added to investor
jitters.

an all-time high of $1,497.20 an ounce. Benchmark gold futures

yen as investors closed riskier trades funded by the
low-yielding Japanese currency. The dollar lost 0.8 percent to
82.42 yen, and hit a low of 82.16 yen.
 In the bond market, investors resisted the temptation to
dump Treasuries after the S&P announcement. Shorter-dated U.S.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro suffered its worst
one-day drop since November against the dollar on Monday as
concerns mounted that Greece will be forced to restructure its
debt and anti-aid sentiment in Europe showed signs of growing.
 Rampant risk aversion generally weighed on the euro zone
single currency even as Standard & Poor's revised its outlook
on the United States' long-term rating to negative from stable
but affirmed its 'AAA/A-1+' sovereign credit rating.
 An actual ratings downgrade of U.S. debt would be negative
for the U.S. dollar, but most believe S&P's announcement was a
warning and therefore did little to rattle the greenback's
performance against the euro.
 ""The key takeaway from the S&P announcement is that the
U.S. has been put on notice, but no ratings action are likely
until 2013,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""With no one expecting any serious progress on deficit
reduction until after the 2012 election, S&P seems to be simply
firing a shot across the bow to U.S. policymakers,"" he said.
 While U.S. fiscal tensions are increasing, the United
States is far from defaulting on its debt.
 ""The prospect of an actual default by the U.S. on debt
issued in its own currency isn't a realistic worry, in a
financial market that has a lot more real worries to deal with
(including genuine euro zone default risks),"" said Avery
Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
 ""We are less concerned over a downgrade to the outlook than
we are about the growth implications of turning to fiscal
belt-tightening before the economy has self-sustaining
momentum.""
 The euro was last trading down 1.4 percent at $1.4234, with
the session low at $1.4155 -- a two-week low -- according to
Reuters data. It was the biggest fall since a 1.86 percent
decline on Nov. 23.
 German government sources said they expected Greece will
not make it through the summer without debt restructuring,
although Athens denied a debt rescheduling was imminent.
 The euro's rise has stalled since it hit a 15-month high
last week, though market players expect it to be supported by
prospects of another rise in euro zone interest rates.
 Earlier, a Greek newspaper reported that Greece had told
the IMF and the European Union this month it wants to
restructure its debt. Greek debt pared losses as a finance
ministry source in Athens said the story was untrue.
 Players also monitored Portugal's progress toward a bailout
after strong gains in a weekend election in Finland by an
anti-euro party that has vowed to veto the rescue package.
 Analysts doubted the Finnish vote could do more than slow
down a bailout, but the result of the vote added to negative
euro sentiment, encouraging investors to cut long positions.
 ""The real fear is that anti-euro aid sentiment is building
across Europe, which, should it spill into countries like
Germany, could have significant ramifications,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 NEGATIVE OUTLOOK
 Standard & Poor's cited huge budget deficits and rising
government indebtedness as the reason for the U.S. outlook
revision, with the path to addressing those issues unclear.
 The euro fell to its lowest in almost three weeks against
the yen. It last traded at 117.26 yen, down 2.2 percent.
 Euro/yen fell below a cluster of support in the 119.20 yen
to 119.30 yen area that coincides with some intraday lows hit
in April. A trader for a Japanese bank said the euro could drop
toward 115 yen in the near term.
 The dollar also hit its lowest in almost three weeks
against the yen to around 82.16 yen, before recovering slightly
to 82.40 yen, down 0.9 percent on the day.

 * Southern Africa seen averaging at 4.5 percent
 * North Africa political turmoil to pull growth down
 
 JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Reuters) - The African Development
bank is cutting its 2011 growth forecast for the continent
mainly due to political unrest in North Africa, AfDB Chief
Economist Mthuli Ncube said on Monday.
The AfDB will give its formal economic forecasts in June,
but Ncube told Reuters in an interview that growth in the
continent was likely to come in no higher than 5 percent this
year, down from a previous projection of 6 percent.
 ""The trend is slightly lower mainly because our expectation
this year is that Ivory Coast will have a negative rate of
growth. In Northern Africa the revolutions in Tunisia and what
is happening in Egypt and Libya is going to pull down growth.""
 ""Our expectation is that for Egypt, growth is going to be as
low as 0.5 percent and for Tunisia as low as 1.0 percent so that
has dragged down growth in the whole region,"" Ncube said.
 Countries in North Africa, including Tunisia, Egypt and
Libya, as well as Ivory Coast in West Africa have seen
widespread protests that have toppled governments in Tunisia and
Egypt and led to Western-led air strikes in Libya.
 Ncube said southern Africa would be cushioned by the
recovery in commodity prices, with growth averaging 4.5 percent
in 2011.""
 The bank has said the continent needs to diversify its
economy away from resources and invest more in manufacturing and
other sectors.
 Fast-growing economies in southern Africa such as Angola and
Zambia rely heavily on resources such as oil and copper.
 
 NORTH AFRICA
 Despite the short-term negative impact on economic growth,
the political unrest in north Africa could bring much-needed
democracy.
 ""The absence of democracy and its stifling of
entrepreneurship in Tunisia and Egypt was costing the economy,""
Ncube said, adding the bank estimated a 2.0 percent of GDP cost
per annum to the country.
 The AfDB is increasing its loans to Tunisia, giving it $1
billion this year, and more after 2011.
 As for Libya, Ncube said the economy would contract this
year but the extent of that decline would be limited if Muammar
Gaddafi were to step down.
 ""We're expecting the economy to shrink by at least 10
percent this year. It would definitely be better for the economy
if Gaddafi stepped down,"" Ncube said.
 Western powers, led by the United States, France and
Britain, are spearheading air strikes in Libya but Gaddafi has
given no signs of giving i2n to pressure to step down.

 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Fresh worries over Europe's
debt crisis and a downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook by
Standard & Poors spurred a sell off in major world stockmarkets
on Monday.

Portugal's pending bailout by the European Union exacerbated
anxiety over how European policy-makers will handle the
region's festering debt and bank problems.

(Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro slumped broadly on
Monday as concern increased that Greece will be forced to
restructure its debt and uncertainty grew over a bailout for
Portugal.
 Rising risk aversion generally weighed on the euro zone
single currency after Standard & Poor's, while affirming the
'AAA/A-1+' sovereign credit rating on the United States,
revised its outlook on the long-term rating to negative from
stable.
 While the dollar fell against the yen, hewing to the risk
aversion theme, the impact on the euro was greater because
Europe's problems are already manifest. While U.S. fiscal
tensions are increasing, the United States is far from
defaulting on its debt.
 ""The prospect of an actual default by the U.S. on debt
issued in its own currency isn't a realistic worry, in a

 The euro was last trading down 1.5 percent at $1.4210, with

Reuters data. German government sources said they expected
Greece will not make it through the summer without debt

 Standard & Poor's cited huge budget deficits and rising
government indebtedness as the reason for the U.S. outlook
revision with the path to addressing those issues unclear.
 But ""the dollar is still the safe haven of first and last
resort,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon
in New York.
 The United States was last put on review for possible
downgrade in January 1996 after Republicans refused to vote to
increase the debt ceiling, said Kathy Lien, director of
research at GFT in New York. However, this was extremely
short-lived because the outlook was upgraded back to stable in
March after the U.S. government raised the debt ceiling.
 Moody's Investors Service said on Monday Washington's
debate over its budget is positive despite uncertainty over the
outcome as it is a potential change in the direction of fiscal
policy, but made no changes to its ratings or outlook.
 The euro fell to its lowest in almost three weeks against

* Italy must have clear, predictable incentives-EU energy boss
* Changing investor return on current deals breaches EU rules
 
 BRUSSELS/ROME, April 18 (Reuters) - The European Union's
energy chief urged Italy to set up a clear and predictable
support scheme for the solar energy sector and ensure stability
for investors to avoid possible penalties.
 Under a law passed in Italy in March, current generous
incentives to the booming solar market -- originally expected to
run from 2011 to 2013 -- will apply only to those solar plants
that connect to the grid by the end of May. 
 The law was issued in compliance with the EU's directive on
2020 green energy targets but the sudden change in the support
scheme has caused uproar among investors and operators about the
future of business in one of Europe's biggest solar markets.
EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said in a letter
to Italy's Industry Minister Paolo Romani he was concerned about
consequences of such changes for investment in the renewable
energy sector after receiving complaints from sector operators.
 ""It is fundamental that the Italian government creates as
soon as possible a clear, stable and predictable internal
framework for incentives to guarantee the development of
renewable energy,"" Oettinger said in the letter, a copy of which
was obtained by Reuters.
 Italy's solar sector has boomed since 2007, when extensive
production incentives were first launched. It has attracted the
world's biggest photovoltaic module makers such as China's
Suntech Power Holdings Co, Trina, Yingli Green Energy and U.S.
firm First Solar. 
 ""The changes which alter financial returns on existing
projects risk violating general principles of national and EU
rights and, moreover, compromising the stability of the
investments in the sector,"" the letter said.
 The contents of the letter were confirmed by European
Commission Energy Spokeswoman Marlene Holzner who said the
Commission could open an infringement procedure against
countries that cannot give certainty about the incentives to
renewable energy investors.
 Italy's major renewable energy body, APER, has said it would
appeal to Brussels against the law which could cause damage to
investors totalling billions of euros.
 Rome, which has been drafting a new support scheme to
replace the one which expires at the end of May, is due to
present the new incentive plan by the end of April.
 The draft had been expected to be presented to a state body
representing the heads of Italy's 20 regions on Wednesday this
Wednesday but it has not yet been added to the meeting's agenda.
 Italy plans to put a six-monthly or annual cap on solar
incentive costs rather than on installed capacity under the new
solar support scheme and aims to scrap incentives from 2017,
Industry Undersecretary Stefano Saglia said last week.
 Solar sector operators and investors fear the government
will introduce an annual limit on installed photovoltaic
capacity, saying such a move would brake growth of the sector in
Italy, as has happened in Spain.
