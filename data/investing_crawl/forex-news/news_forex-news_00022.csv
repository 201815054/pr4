 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Tuesday
and European shares looked set to extend gains as strong U.S.
consumer spending data soothed some fears that the economy was
slipping back into a recession.	
 However, low volume and the inability to sustain early gains
suggested a general lack of conviction among investors over how
long the rebound will last.	
 Still, the slight gains in equities after a battering this
month encouraged some investors to switch out of safe-haven
assets like the Swiss franc and gold and buy high-yieding
currencies such as the Australian dollar. 
 U.S. stock futures  consolidated gains in Asia after
solid overnight gains following news that consumer spending
recorded its largest increase in five months in July in the
United States. 
 European shares were expected to open higher, tracking gains
on Wall Street and in Asia, with German and French indexes seen
up as much as 0.8 percent and London shares expected to advance
nearly 3 percent, catching up with the broader market following
a holiday on Monday. 
 Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 while Australia
climbed 0.3 percent, though both indices were off early highs as
players moved in to square positions before awaiting more
evidence on whether the U.S. economy has turned a corner.	
 Pessimism about the health of the U.S. economy and worries
about Europe's sovereign debt crisis have hammered global stock
markets this month, driving MSCI's All-Country World Index
down nearly 15 percent from its May high.	
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index is on
track to post its worst monthly return since October 2008.	
 Even though Hong Kong shares are down more than 9
percent this month with valuations near the trough of the global
financial crisis, Adrian Mowat, chief emerging markets
strategist at JP Morgan, said there was more downside left as
equities were still early in the downgrade cycle.	
 ""It is very important to remember that the turning point in
markets is not when they start to look cheap but it is when the
macro economic data is changing, signaling the tightening cycle
is coming to an end, signaling markets are cheap or oversold,""
Mowat told Reuters Televison.	
 With China still ordering banks to set aside more deposits
in reserves and allowing more yuan gains, that end may still be
some way off, but that did not deter some brave investors.	
 Hong Kong-listed shares of China Construction Bank Corp
, the world's No.2 lender, rose more than 4 percent
after news that Bank of America Corp will sell about
half of its stake in the Chinese bank. 
 Excluding CCB, however, turnover in Hong Kong was very low.	
 Traders were eyeing an Italian bond auction later in the day
which will serve as a barometer of investor demand after recent
bond purchases by the European Central Bank have helped drive
down Italy's borrowing costs. 
 Investors were also awaiting U.S. consumer confidence data
for August and minutes from the Federal Reserve's last committee
meeting on Aug 9 which could offer more clues on divisions among
board members over further stimulus measures. 
 
 
 WATCHING CREDIT MARKETS	
 Fears that the festering debt crisis would engulf larger
euro zone economies like Italy and France have made investors
such as U.S. money market funds reduce exposure to European
banks and pushed their credit default swap spreads higher.	
 The Itraxx European senior financials index has
pushed beyond the peaks seen during the last crisis, and at 247
bps the spread is starting to reflect credit ratings that are
not reflective of their current ones.	
 On Tuesday though, Asia credits were firmer with the spread
on Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment grade index
tightening by 6 bps to 152 bps/154 bps.	
 Strong equity gains also put safe-haven bets like the Swiss
Franc, gold and U.S. Treasuries on the backfoot with a rare bit
of good news out of Europe in the shape of merger news in
Greece' banking sector on Monday. 
 The U.S. dollar traded at 0.8184 Swiss francs , just
below a five-week high of 0.8239 hit overnight while the euro
was at 1.1888 francs , not far off a seven-week high
of 1.1970 francs touched on Monday. 
 U.S. Treasuries nursed losses with 10-year yields
at 2.24 percent, up by about five basis points from
F riday after Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke
steered clear of announcing any fresh stimulus measures last
week.	
Spot gold stabilised around $1,790 per
ounce levels after falling by nearly seven percent in about a
week. It hit a record $1,911 last week. 
 Volume was thin with a number of Asian markets, including
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, out for
holidays.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Stocks rallied on Monday along
with oil after a merger between two major banks in Greece gave
investors a rare bit of encouraging news out of Europe.
 Greek equities jumped 14 percent and the country's banking
shares alone surged 29 percent as the merger shrank the number
of weak banks in the euro zone, reducing the chance of calls on
the region's Financial Stability Fund for recapitalization.
 The participation of the Qatar Investment Authority in the
tie-up between Eurobank  and Alpha Bank  --
the second- and third-largest banks in Greece -- also showed
that some foreign investors were beginning to see European
assets as undervalued. The deal creates the largest bank in
southeastern Europe. For more, see [ID:nLDE77Q03M]
 ""We'll probably need to see greater policy action in the
region, but the merger needs to be done and that's why we're
seeing a pause in the recent selling pressure,"" said David
Ruff, portfolio manager at the Forward Select EM Dividend Fund
in San Francisco.
 Even with Monday's rally, Greek banking shares were still
down nearly 50 percent year-to-date, troubled by rating
downgrades, deposit outflows and loan impairments in the wake
of the country's worst recession in four decades. The merger
news sent stocks of Eurobank and Alpha up 30 percent each.
 An unexpected surge in U.S. consumer spending for July --
which indicated the economy was not falling back into recession
-- further boosted sentiment across global markets.[ID:N1E77S0BS]
 Trading volume around the world was low, with London closed
for a holiday and Wall Street recovering from Hurricane Irene.

smaller than normal. For more, see:[ID:nL5E7JT1JU]

jumped, due to less-than-feared property damage from the
weekend's Hurricane Irene. [.N]
 BONDS, DOLLAR, GOLD DOWN
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell as investors turned to stocks.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down
22/32, its yield at 2.2676 percent.
 The dollar was 0.1 percent lower against a basket of major
currencies <.DXY> [USD/].
 Spot gold  also fell, by more than 2 percent, to
below $1,790 an ounce as investors moved away from safe-havens
to embrace riskier assets like oil.
 U.S. crude oil  settled up 2.2 percent, above $87 per
barrel and extending gains from Friday on the possibility of
fresh stimulus for the U.S. economy from the Federal Reserve.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke left the door open for such stimulus
during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week. [O/R].
 Bernanke, in his annual address to central bankers, gave no
details on whether the Fed was planning to flood markets with
more dollars to help the economy. But he said the central
bank's policy panel would meet for two days next month instead
of one to discuss additional monetary stimulus, offering hopes
of a move then. [ID:nN1E77R0GB]
 Some analysts think it may be hard for Bernanke and the Fed
to follow through with another round of bond buying after the
$600 billion program that expired in June.
 ""He (Bernanke) has a much, much harder decision this time,""
Jim Walker, founder of Asianomics, told Reuters television.
""What he's got to do is convince the dissenting voices in the
Fed -- and there are now three of them -- that economic growth
is so bad that it is time to use even more extraordinary
measures.""

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on
Monday along with oil after news of a merger between two major
banks in Greece suggested that Europe was working through its
financial problems.
 Surprisingly strong U.S. consumer spending for July --
which indicated the economy was not falling back into recession
-- helped sentiment, although weak pending sales of existing
homes mitigated this somewhat. For more see [ID:N1E77S0BS].
 However, trading volumes across markets were lighter than
usual as New York City struggled to return to work after the
weekend's flooding and power outages, including in the Wall
Street district, from Tropical Storm Irene. [ID:nN1E77R061]
 The closure of London markets for a holiday further crimped
activity.
 U.S. crude oil futures  rose about 2 percent,
extending gains from Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke left the door open last week for further action to
stimulate the U.S. economy and fight unemployment [O/R]. Spot
gold  fell 2 percent as investors moved away from
safe-havens to embrace riskier assets like oil.
 The dollar edged 0.3 percent lower against a basket of
major currencies <.DXY> [USD/]. U.S. Treasuries prices fell as
investors reduced their bids for bonds in favor of stocks,
although bond market volume was very light in early New York
trading, according to data from ICAP. [US/]
 Shortly after 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Wall Street's Dow
Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 154.69 points, or 1.37
percent, at 11,439.23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was up 20.08 points, or 1.71 percent, at 1,196.88. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 49.21 points, or 1.98 percent,
at 2,529.06.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was

 Troubled by rating downgrades, deposit outflows and loan

percent in the year to date. The tie-up between Eurobank and
Alpha Bank thus signals a move in the right direction, analysts
said. [ID:nLDE77Q03M]
 ""The deal is about a friendly merger between Alpha Bank and
Eurobank, with the participation to a significant extent of the
Qatar Investment Authority,"" which is already a shareholder in
Alpha, a banking source told Reuters.
 Shares of U.S. insurers were also higher in Monday's early
trading due to less-than-feared property damage from the
weekend storm.
 World shares <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 2.1 percent and European
stocks <.FTEU3> 1.6 percent, partly on speculation that the
United States might resort to another round of monetary easing,

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on
Monday along with oil after news of a merger between two major
banks in Greece suggested that Europe was working through its
financial problems.
 Surprisingly strong U.S. consumer spending for July --
which indicated the economy was not falling back into recession
-- helped sentiment, although weak pending sales of existing
homes mitigated this somewhat. For more see [ID:N1E77S0BS].
 However, trading volumes across markets were lighter than
usual as New York City struggled to return to work after the
weekend's flooding and power outages, including in the Wall
Street district, from Tropical Storm Irene. [ID:nN1E77R061]
 The closure of London markets for a holiday further crimped
activity.
 U.S. crude oil futures  rose about 2 percent,
extending gains from Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke left the door open last week for further action to
stimulate the U.S. economy and fight unemployment [O/R]. Spot
gold  fell 2 percent as investors moved away from
safe-havens to embrace riskier assets like oil.
 The dollar edged 0.3 percent lower against a basket of
major currencies <.DXY> [USD/]. U.S. Treasuries prices fell as
investors reduced their bids for bonds in favor of stocks,
although bond market volume was very light in early New York
trading, according to data from ICAP. [US/]
 Shortly after 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Wall Street's Dow
Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 154.69 points, or 1.37
percent, at 11,439.23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was up 20.08 points, or 1.71 percent, at 1,196.88. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 49.21 points, or 1.98 percent,
at 2,529.06.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 21/32, with the yield at 2.2641 percent.
 GREEK DEAL
 The run-up in stocks was largely due to the merger between
Eurobank  and Alpha Bank , the second- and
third-largest banks in Greece.
 ""We've actually started putting cash to work,"" said Keith
Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset
Management, with $18 billion in assets. ""A few things (are)
helping the stock market -- there's relief coming from the
storm and Europe, particularly with Greece.""
 Troubled by rating downgrades, deposit outflows and loan
impairments in the wake of the country's worst recession in
four decades, Greek bank shares have tumbled more than 55
percent in the year to date. The tie-up between Eurobank and
Alpha Bank thus signals a move in the right direction, analysts
said. [ID:nLDE77Q03M]
 ""The deal is about a friendly merger between Alpha Bank and
Eurobank, with the participation to a significant extent of the
Qatar Investment Authority,"" which is already a shareholder in
Alpha, a banking source told Reuters.
 Shares of U.S. insurers were also higher in Monday's early
trading due to less-than-feared property damage from the
weekend storm.
 World shares <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 2.1 percent and European
stocks <.FTEU3> 1.6 percent, partly on speculation that the
United States might resort to another round of monetary easing,
as indicated in Friday's speech by Fed Chairman Bernanke.
 Bernanke, in his annual address to central bankers at
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, gave no details on whether the Fed was
planning to flood markets with more dollars to help the
economy. But he said the central bank's policy panel would meet
for two days next month instead of one to discuss additional
monetary stimulus, offering hopes of a move then.
[ID:nN1E77R0GB]
 Some analysts think it may be hard for Bernanke and the Fed
to follow through with another round of bond buying after the
$600 billion program that expired in June.
 ""He (Bernanke) has a much, much harder decision this time,""
Jim Walker, founder of Asianomics, told Reuters television.
 ""What he's got to do is convince the dissenting voices in
the Fed -- and there are now three of them -- that economic
growth is so bad that it is time to use even more extraordinary
measures.""

 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street were
poised to open higher on Monday in line with stronger global
equity and commodity prices as investors speculated about the
possibility of fresh stimulus for the U.S. economy.
 Higher-than-expected U.S. consumer spending for July was
also expected to boost sentiment, analysts said. The data
supported views that the economy was not falling back into
recession. For more see [ID:N1E77S0BS].

with New York City struggling to return to work after the

 By Patrick Graham	
 LONDON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks jumped almost one
percent on Monday while the dollar struggled after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke left the door open for further
action to stimulate the U.S. economy and fight unemployment.	
 World shares rose 0.9 percent, with Asian
markets tracking a strong bounce for Wall Street, which closed
up 1 percent following Bernanke's keynote speech in Jackson Hole
on Friday.	
 IMF chief Christine Lagarde also added to market pressure
for policymakers to do more to prop up a flagging global economy
at the meeting of central bankers, telling officials they must
""act now"" to save the recovery.	
 European stocks also gained, up 0.7 percent, and
U.S. stock futures  rose around 1 percent after Hurricane
Irene, downgraded to tropical storm status, spared the nation's
financial centre the worst. 
 London markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.	
 Bernanke gave no details of further action to boost the U.S.
recovery but said the central bank's policy panel would meet for
two days next month instead of one to discuss additional
monetary stimulus, offering some hope to investors of a move
then. .	
 Analysts said a bad run of data before the Fed's meeting may
prove crucial. 
 ""The change to a two-day meeting to 'allow a fuller
discussion' is something that will likely keep
market expectations elevated about the possibility of futher
monetary policy stimulus,"" Barclays Capital economist Michael
Gapen said in a note to clients.	
 ""Mr Bernanke said the Fed is in a data-dependent mode and
there will be many discussions at the two-day FOMC in
September."" 
 
 BARRIERS	
 Both the dollar and euro gained around 1 percent against the
Swiss franc, in which investors are now facing negative rates of
return following the Swiss National Bank's moves to flood the
market with liquidity.	
 But the possibility of more monetary stimulus in the U.S.
kept the dollar broadly under pressure, down 0.3 percent
against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. 
 Against the yen, the greenback traded at 76.62 yen ,
recoiling from a recent high around 77.69.	
 ""The fact that Bernanke did not talk about inflation risk
has helped equity markets and put pressure on the dollar,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 ""But there is not much more potential for the dollar to
sell-off with markets now focusing on FOMC minutes and the U.S.
employment report this week,"" he said. 
 Debt troubles and political issues on both sides of the
Atlantic make monetary policy the only viable
short-to-medium-term policy response to slowing growth, said
Viktor Shvets, regional strategist at Samsung Securities in Hong
Kong.	
 But following through with another round of bond buying will
be harder this time around, some analysts say, citing rising
core inflation in the U.S. and a split regarding policy within
the Fed as obstacles.	
 ""He (Bernanke) has a much, much harder decision this time,""
said Jim Walker, founder of Asianomics and former chief
economist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, in a Reuters television
interview.	
 ""What he's got to do is convince the dissenting voices in
the Fed and there are now three of them that economic growth is
so bad that it is time to use even more extraordinary measures,""
said Walker.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.6 percent on subdued
volumes. South Korea's KOSPI , the Asian market
considered to be the most geared to a global economic recovery,
jumped more than 3 percent, then cooled to be up 2.8 percent.	
 MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan rose 2.1 percent.
It is down 11 percent so far this month in its worst performance
since October 2008, reflecting the scale of concern over global
growth and its impact on the region's energy and commodity
stocks. 
 Brent crude  traded just above $111 on Monday,
dipping as oil refiners and terminals along the U.S. east coast
weathered the worst of tropical storm Irene, easing fears of
fuel supply disruptions. 
 NYMEX crude for October delivery  was up 0.2 percent.

 By Ian Chua and Antoni Slodkowski	
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The dollar came under light
pressure against a basket of major currencies in Asia on Monday,
with traders speculating the Federal Reserve may offer more
stimulus next month in the face of an uncertain growth outlook.	
 While Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke gave no details of further
action to boost the U.S. recovery at an eagerly awaited speech
on Friday, he said the central bank would extend its September
policy meeting to two days to consider its options.

 ""If the economy were to fall into recession, we believe the
Fed would initiate another round of quantitative easing,""
Michael Carey, chief economist for North America for Credit
Agricole, said in a note to clients.	
 Analysts added, however, that the hurdle is high for
introducing more monetary easing due to a rise in core inflation
and a split regarding the policy within the Fed.	
 ""Hence the trade-off for the policy, between boosting
activity and employment and generating inflation or other
distortions in asset markets, has become less attractive,"" Carey
said.	
 Market expectations for a fresh round of bond buying by the
Fed had eased in the leadup to the central bank's annual
symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, so the fact that Bernanke
did not announce any immediate action was not a major
disappointment, traders said.	
 This leaves the focus squarely on upcoming data including
the closely-watched non-farm payrolls reports due on Friday as
well as data on U.S. personal spending and manufacturing for
clues about the health of the world's largest economy.	
 The dollar index shed 0.2 percent to 73.702, not far
from 4-month lows around 73.421 and off Friday's peak of 74.464.	
 ""The fall in the dollar on Friday was also caused by a rise
in euro/Swissie, which pushed euro/dollar higher,"" said a trader
for a Japanese bank, adding that a further rise in the pair
could put more pressure on the greenback.	
 The euro rose 0.2 percent to 1.1735 francs on
Monday, nearing resistance at 1.1810, a 76.4 percent retracement
of the its drop from an early July peak of 1.2346 francs down to
a record low of 1.0075 hit on EBS in early August.	
 There is more resistance at 1.1894, the next major peak on
charts.	
 Against the yen, the greenback traded at 76.70 yen ,
recoiling from a recent high around 77.69 but keeping well above
the record low plumbed earlier this month at 75.941 yen.	
 Analysts said Japan's ruling party vote to decide the
country's next prime minister was seen as having no impact on
the yen.	
 The euro popped above $1.4500 , building on Friday's
0.8 percent rally, but struggled to decisively break resistance
at its Aug. 17 high of $1.4518 and July 27 peak of $1.4537. It
last traded at $1.4525.	
 A customer trader for a major Japanese bank said the euro
may rise more in the near term, possibly to as high as $1.4580,
its early July peak. The market's view of the euro has not
changed in any positive way, and its latest firmness is more a
reflection of dollar weakness, investors say.	
 
 BROAD PRESSURE	
 The greenback gained on the Swiss franc which came under
broad pressure after Swiss bank UBS threatened on
Friday to charge clients a fee on deposits, aiming to discourage
them from using some accounts to hoard the safe-haven currency
because of financial market volatility. 
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 0.8094 francs, having hit a
one-month high around 0.8152 francs on Friday.	
 Concerns that the global economy would fall back into
recession and fears that the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis
could spread to the region's banking system have sent currency
investors scurrying to the safety of the Swiss franc and yen.	
 This has prompted both the Swiss and Japanese authorities to
act in recent weeks to temper the strength of their respective
currencies.	
 While the Swiss National Bank said it was not involved in
UBS's decision to consider imposing a fee, traders said the move
posed a fresh hurdle for franc bulls.	
 The Australian dollar extended last week's gains, having
risen against a broadly weaker greenback after Bernanke kept the
door open to more policy action to stimulate the U.S. economy.
It last traded up 0.4 percent at $1.0627 hovering at a
3-1/2 week peak.	
 Trading on Monday was subdued with British markets closed
for a holiday.

 By Vikram Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, Aug 29 (Reuters) - European stocks were set to
open up on Monday, in line with Asian shares which rose while
the dollar struggled after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
left the door open for further action to stimulate the U.S.
economy and fight unemployment.	
 An index of European stock futures  was up 1.9
percent, and U.S. stock futures  rose 0.9 percent after
Hurricane Irene, downgraded to tropical storm status, spared the
nation's financial centre the worst. 
 London markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.	
 Bernanke gave no details of further action to boost the U.S.
recovery but said the central bank's policy panel would meet for
two days next month instead of one to discuss additional
monetary stimulus, offering some hope to investors.
.	
 Given the dysfunctional political climate on both sides of
the Atlantic and the diminishing probability of viable
longer-term fiscal policies, monetary policy is the only viable
short-to-medium-term policy response, said Viktor Shvets,
regional strategist at Samsung Securities in Hong Kong.	
 But following through with another round of bond buying will
be harder this time around, some analysts say, citing rising
core inflation in the U.S. and a split regarding policy within
the Fed as obstacles.	
 ""He (Bernanke) has a much, much harder decision this time,""
said Jim Walker, founder of Asianomics and former chief
economist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, in a Reuters television
interview.	
 ""What he's got to do is convince the dissenting voices in
the Fed and there now three of them that economic growth is so
bad that it is time to use even more extraordinary measures,""
said Walker.	
 For now, though, the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan
, poised for its worst monthly return since
October 2008, cheered any signs that more help from the Fed
could be on its way.	
 The index rose 2.1 percent led by cyclical sectors such as
materials and energy. It is down 11.3 percent so far this month
as a U.S. sovereign rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's and
increasingly worrisome developments on the European debt
situation spooked investors. 
 South Korea's KOSPI , the Asian market considered to
be the most geared to a global economic recovery, jumped more
than 3 percent, then cooled to be up 2.8 percent.	
 In China, the Shanghai Composite fell 1.2 percent,
bucking the trend across Asia, as the latest move by the central
bank to mop up excess liquidity and fight inflation hurt banking
and property stocks. 
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.6 percent on subdued
volumes. Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda will become the new
prime minister after winning a leadership run-off vote in the
ruling party. 
 ""U.S. jobs data is going to be much more important for
setting the tone in the market, so people are looking at it for
mid-term investment decisions,"" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general
manager at Daiwa Securities.	
 A Reuters poll showed economist forecast U.S. non-farm
payrolls rising 80,000 in August with unemployment staying at
9.1 percent.	
 
 DOLLAR WOES	
 Stubbornly high unemployment coupled with the possibility of
more monetary stimulus in the U.S. kept the dollar under
pressure in Asian trading.	
 The dollar index a measure of its strength against a
trade-weighted basket of currencies, stood at 73.572, having
fallen from Friday's peak of 74.464. Against the yen, the
greenback traded at 76.69 yen , recoiling from a recent
high around 77.69.	
 The U.S. currency, however, outperformed the Swiss franc,
which came under broad pressure after Swiss bank UBS
on Friday threatened to charge clients a fee on deposits, trying
to discourage them from using some accounts to hoard the
safe-haven currency because of financial market volatility.

 In commodity markets, Brent crude  fell below $111 on
Monday as oil refiners and terminals along the U.S. east coast
weathered the worst of a tropical storm, easing fears of fuel
supply disruptions in the world's top oil consumer. 
 NYMEX crude for October delivery  was up 0.3 percent.	
 Spot gold fell 0.3 percent to $1,821.99 an ounce
retreating slightly from an over 3 percent rally in the previous
session.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - World stocks rose 1 percent
and the dollar fell on Friday as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke left the door open for future U.S. economic stimulus.
 Speaking at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, Bernanke did not offer new measures to boost the
economy but said it was critical for the economy's health to
reduce long-term joblessness. For details, see [ID:nLDE77P0JC]
http://r.reuters.com/qyt43s
 U.S. stocks ended more than 1 percent higher, reversing
losses of as much as 2 percent just after Bernanke started
speaking, while Treasuries, whose yields are at near-historic
lows, ended higher but well off earlier gains.
 Bernanke said the central bank's policy panel would meet
for two days in September instead of one to discuss additional
monetary stimulus, offering some hope to investors.
 ""He didn't give the market the green light for QE3 -- he
also didn't give the market the red light for QE3,"" said Kevin
Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park,
New Jersey, referring to the Fed's quantitative easing
program.
 ""By implying that inflation is viewed as not a concern, it
leaves the possibility for something down the road,"" he added.
 The speech follows several turbulent weeks for markets,
with investors facing concerns about another U.S. recession and
escalating euro zone debt troubles, as well as a downgrade of
the top-tier U.S. credit rating.
 Analysts said the very choppy trade in many markets after
Bernanke spoke reflected the concern about the U.S. economy, as
well as a realization that U.S. interest rates will stay at
record lows for years to come.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.7 percent, but are down 11.1 percent
since the start of the month, while ICE Brent for October
delivery  settled at $111.36 a barrel, gaining 74
cents.
 Bernanke's speech last year laid the groundwork for the
Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program to revive the economy
under the rubric ""QE2"" for the Fed's second round of stimulus,
or quantitative easing.
 The stimulus plan was the basis for a sharp rally in stocks
last fall.
 The dollar gained on the euro after the speech but later
shed those gains, with the euro last up 0.8 percent at
$1.4489, near a session peak of $1.4502 set on trading platform
EBS.
 The dollar <.DXY> was down 0.7 percent against a basket of
currencies.
 An increase of money supply, such as the QE2 program, tends
to erode the value of the dollar relative to other currencies.
It also depresses Treasury yields and encourages investors to
seek higher returns elsewhere.
 ""I would say that longer term, the Fed is keeping their
powder dry,"" said Andrew Busch, senior currency strategist at
BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. ""But the fact is that the Fed
has the easiest monetary policy on the planet, and that will
eventually force the dollar to go lower.""
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 134.72 points, or 1.21 percent, at 11,284.54. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 17.53 points, or 1.51 percent,
at 1,176.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 60.22
points, or 2.49 percent, at 2,479.85.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> ended the day down 0.7
percent at 919.03.

 WALL ST PREPARES FOR IRENE
 As Hurricane Irene bore down on North Carolina, tens of
thousands of people evacuated and East Coast cities, including
New York, braced for a weekend hit from the powerful storm.
[ID:nN1E77P00B]
 Wall Street scrambled to raise cash in case the storm
causes major disruption in trading for thousands of traders who
live in the New York metro area.
 The repurchase market, a major source of cash for Wall
Street to fund trades and operations, showed an increase in
interest rates on loans that mature on Monday, a sign markets
are worried there could be disruptions - however temporary - as
a result of the hurricane.
 Interest rates on loans backed by Treasury bonds that
expire on Monday rose by several hundredths of a percentage
point from late Thursday to about 0.08 percent in the $1.6
trillion repurchase market.
 U.S. Treasuries prices clung to slight gains, even as
volume petered out.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  last traded
up 12/32 in price to yield 2.19 percent, down from Thursday but
up 12 basis points on the week. They posted a full-point gain
immediately after Bernanke started speaking.
 Gold rose after days of liquidation pushed bullion down
from record highs this week. Spot gold  was up 2.2
percent at $1,808.60 an ounce.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for October
delivery rose for a second day and settled at $85.37 a barrel,
gaining 7.00 cents. Traders positioned ahead of the arrival of
Irene, as oil terminals, refineries, pipelines and other energy
infrastructure prepared for the stormy weekend.

68,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2011 04:03PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar falls in U.S. afternoon trade,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved broadly lower against its major counterparts in U.S. trade Friday, as the Federal Reserve Bank postponed a decision on further monetary easing and gross domestic product was shown to have grown more slowly than expected in the second quarter.
In afternoon U.S. trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.74% to hit 1.4486.
After much market anticipation, Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke addressed mounting speculation that the U.S. central bank would move to trigger growth in a faltering U.S. economy.
Speaking from the central bank’s annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bernanke said although the Fed had the capacity to stimulate U.S. economic growth, further discussion was necessary to weigh the benefits of an additional round of quantitative easing.
“These options were discussed in August and we will continue to consider these and other pertinent issues at our meeting in September,” Bernanke said.
Separately, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1% in the second quarter. That followed a 1.3% rise in the previous three-month period but was below market expectations for a 1.1% gain for the April to June quarter.
Consumer spending, the largest component of the U.S. economy, rose at an annualized rate of 0.4% in the first quarter, the smallest gain in a year, but up from the initial estimate for a 0.1% gain.
Wall Street shares were on track to post their first weekly gain in a month, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1% to 11,254.20, the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2% to 2,469.21, and the S&P 500 added 1.1%. to 1,172.56.
Meanwhile, the greenback was down against the British pound, with GBP/USD gaining 0.37% to hit 1.6339. 
The dollar was lower against the Japanese yen but up against the Swiss franc with USD/JPY retreating 1.08% to hit 76.69, and USD/CHF sharply higher by 1.79% to hit 0.8074. 
The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD down 0.52% to hit 0.9830, AUD/USD higher by 1.37% to hit 1.0573, and NZD/USD rising 1.46% to hit 0.8391.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.61% at 73.87.
The Federal Reserve’s next Federal Open Market Committee meeting was scheduled for September 20."

(Updates prices, adds details, comment)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
euro and yen on Friday, erasing earlier gains after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank can do more
to boost growth but offered no details on how it might act.
 But the greenback soared against the Swiss franc, hitting a
one-month high above 0.8100  after Swiss bank UBS said it
may charge fees on some franc deposits. [ID:nWEA2169]
 Worries about the U.S. economy and the euro zone debt
crisis have boosted demand for the safe-haven franc in recent
months, driving it to record highs. But rapid appreciation has
hurt Swiss exports and tourism, putting pressure on the
economy.
 The franc also tumbled against the euro and yen.
 Analysts said the choppy trade in currencies and other
markets -- stocks swung from losses to gains after Bernanke
spoke while Treasuries came off earlier highs -- reflected
concern about the U.S. economy and a realization that U.S.
interest rates will stay at record lows for years to come.
 A government report on Friday showed the economy grew at
just a 1 percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from
the previous estimate of 1.3 percent, and Bernanke said it was
critical to reduce the unemployment rate, which exceeds 9
percent.
 ""I would say that longer term, the Fed is keeping their
powder dry,"" said Andrew Busch, senior currency strategist at
BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. ""But the fact is that the Fed
has the easiest monetary policy on the planet, and that will
eventually force the dollar to go lower.""
 The euro was last up 0.6 percent at $1.4466 , near a
session peak, after having fallen as low as $1.4327 after
Bernanke spoke. Low U.S. bond yields were also likely to keep
the dollar under pressure against the yen. The dollar fell 1.1
percent to 76.60 yen  on Friday.
 High-yield currencies also rallied against the greenback,
with the Australian dollar up 1.4 percent at $1.0582 .
 BERNANKE SPEAKS
 Financial markets have see-sawed this week as investors
debated whether Bernanke would signal another round of
stimulus, known as quantitative easing.
 Last year, he used his speech at the annual central bankers
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal what became a
$600 billion bond-buying program. See [ID:nW1E7JM00N] and
[ID:nN1E77O23L]
 Failure to hint at another round of quantitative easing, or
QE, boosted the dollar initially. Under QE, the Fed prints
money to buy bonds, which should depress U.S. Treasury yields
and encourage investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. An
increase in the money supply erodes the value of the dollar.
 But the dollar began to lose ground as investors bet weak
growth would keep Fed policy loose even if it doesn't provoke
another round of asset purchases.
 ""Ultimately, the U.S. economy is stalling and the Fed won't
be changing rates soon, so there's little reason for a
sustained dollar rally,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 SWISS, YEN STILL IN FOCUS
 Analysts said Swiss efforts to weaken the franc also
suggested fears that investors are still eager to buy
safe-haven currencies.
 The dollar was last up 1.8 percent at 0.8065 franc ,
while the euro rose 2.3 percent to 1.1674 francs .
 The euro zone debt crisis also contributed to the safety
bid, and traders said the euro would struggle to hold above
$1.45. Sell orders were said to be layered between $1.4460 and
$1.4500.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default neared
record highs as fears swirled that a second Greek bailout may
yet unravel. [ID:nB5E7JM00D]
 Worries about both the United States and Europe were
reflected in gains for the Japanese yen, which investors tend
to see as a safe-haven currency in times of distress.
 The euro shed 0.5 percent to 110.88 yen .

73,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2011 12:34PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY falls in early U.S. trade on Fed decision delay,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved lower against the Japanese yen in U.S. trade Friday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced the central bank would postpone a decision on monetary policy until next month’s meeting.
In early Asian trade, USD/JPY hit 77.51, the pair’s highest since Thursday ; the pair subsequently consolidated at 76.61, dropping 1.11%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.47, Tuesday’s low, and resistance at 77.93, Tuesday’s high.
In a highly anticipated speech, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said further discussion was necessary on monetary easing options and that the topic would be reviewed at the central bank’s next Federal Open Market Committee meeting beginning September 20.
“These options were discussed in August and we will continue to consider these and other pertinent issues at our meeting in September,” Bernanke said.
Dealers had been looking for signs from the Fed of a possible new round of quantitative easing in light of persistently high unemployment, weak factory orders and the recent downgrade by Standard & Poor’s of the U.S. top-notch credit rating.

74,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2011 11:48AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD gains in early U.S. trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved higher against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Friday, following the release of weak economic numbers and a much-anticipated speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
EUR/USD hit 1.4329 in early U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since Thursday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4427, gaining 0.33%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4328, last Thursday’s low, and resistance at 1.4500, Tuesday’s high.
Speaking from the annual convention of Federal Reserve officials in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Chairman Ben Bernanke postponed a decision on monetary policy options until the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting late next month.
“These options were discussed in August and we will continue to consider these and other pertinent issues at our meeting in September,” Bernanke said.
Dealers had been looking for signs from the Fed of a possible new round of quantitative easing in light of persistently high unemployment, weak factory orders and the recent downgrade by Standard & Poor’s of the U.S. top-notch credit rating.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - World stocks and oil turned up
slightly on Friday on the growing belief that even though Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke did not offer new measures to boost the
economy, he left the door open for future stimulus.
 Speaking at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, Bernanke said it was critical for the economy's health
to reduce long-term joblessness but did not offer new measures
to help growth. For details, see [ID:nLDE77P0JC]
http://r.reuters.com/qyt43s
 U.S. stocks erased a 2 percent fall and Treasuries, whose
yields are trading at near-historic lows, came off session
highs as Bernanke said the central bank's policy panel would
meet for two days in September instead of one to discuss
additional monetary stimulus.
 ""I think the door is open for them to do a lot more, but
there's nothing in the speech that shows he will take immediate
action,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in
St. Petersburg, Florida.
 The speech follows several turbulent weeks for markets,
with investors facing concerns about another U.S. recession and
escalating euro zone debt troubles, as well as a downgrade of
the U.S.'s top-tier credit rating.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.1 percent, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 index <.SPX> was up 0.8 percent. Both had extended
losses directly after the speech, along with oil. Brent crude
 was last up 10 cents at $110.72 a barrel.
 Bernanke's speech last year laid the groundwork for the
Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program to revive the economy
under the rubric ""QE2"" for the Fed's second round of stimulus,
or quantitative easing.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading
12/32 higher in price to yield 2.19 percent, down from 2.23
percent late on Thursday.
 The dollar gained on the euro after the speech but later
shed those gains, with the euro  last up 0.3 percent.
 An increase of money supply, such as the QE2 program, tends
to erode the value of the dollar relative to other currencies.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 39.20 points, or 0.35 percent, at 11,189.02. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 6.18 points, or 0.53 percent, at
1,165.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 33.24
points, or 1.37 percent, at 2,452.87.
 Wall Street scrambled to raise cash in case Hurricane Irene
causes major disruption in trading for thousands of traders who
live in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
 The repurchase market, a major source of cash for Wall
Street to fund trades and operations, showed an increase in
interest rates on loans that mature on Monday, a sign markets
are worried there could be disruptions - however temporary - as
a result of the hurricane. Interest rates on loans backed by
Treasury bonds that expire on Monday rose by several hundredths
of a percentage point from late Thursday to about 0.08 percent
in the $1.6 trillion repurchase market.

 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - World stocks and oil declined
on Friday as investors played down chances that Fed chief Ben
Bernanke would signal further U.S. economic stimulus in a
much-anticipated speech.
 Gold prices gained, while the dollar slipped ahead of the
talk, which Bernanke was due to deliver at 10 a.m. EDT (1400
GMT) at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming.
 A year ago in the same place, he opened the door to a
second round of quantitative easing. Although there was some
belief that he would announce a third round of asset buying
this year, he is not now expected to come up with a fresh dose
of shock treatment for the ailing U.S. economy.
 He is expected rather to acknowledge his disappointment
over the pace of growth, possibly downgrade his outlook, and
explain which medicines left in the Fed's cabinet are best
suited to fortify the economy. For details see [ID:nFEDAHEAD].
 ""They really want something to come out of the meeting but
they're no longer expecting the kind of plan they were earlier
this week,"" said William Larkin, portfolio manager with Cabot
Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.
 Earlier the Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic
product expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent in the second
quarter, downward revision of its prior estimate of 1.3
percent. For more see [ID:N1E77P09C].

 Still, the uncertainty about what may come kept many
investors on edge.
 The dollar eased <.DXY> as investors shuffled positions
ahead of the Wyoming speech. It was last down 0.4 percent

 Some traders expected the greenback to stage a short-term
bounce if Bernanke does not signal further monetary stimulus.
 In the oil market, Brent crude futures extended losses
ahead of Bernanke. ICE Brent October crude  fell 57
cents to $110.05 a barrel.
 Core euro zone government bond prices were flat to slightly
higher, while the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note

 * Euro recoups losses, vulnerable to selloff

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Friday in a
paring of long positions before a much anticipated speech from
the head of the Federal Reserve, with some expecting the
greenback to bounce if he does not signal a chance of further
monetary stimulus.	
 The euro edged up 0.4 percent on the day to $1.4430.
while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian
and New Zealand dollars also advanced.	
 Markets have see-sawed this week, reflecting a divide over
expectations of how strong a signal Ben Bernanke may provide on
the chances of more monetary easing in the coming months when he
speaks at 1400 GMT in a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.	
 Earlier this week, there was strong speculation Bernanke
might announce a third round of asset purchases or some other
extraordinary policy, pressuring the dollar. But this view has
been scaled back, giving the greenback a boost on
Thursday. 
 ""If Bernanke signals he is likely to be less accommodative
about providing liquidity, we could see the dollar recover and
depending on how Wall Street reacts to that, we could see some
flows into the greenback,"" said Roberto Mialich, FX strategist
at Unicredit in Milan.	
 ""On the other hand, if he signals that he is ready to act
and provide more (economic) support, then the dollar will
weaken. If he says he is ready to act but not right now, I don't
think the markets will be too disappointed.""	
 He added even if the markets were disappointed, the euro was
unlikely to fall below $1.43, while on the topside it could rise
as high as $1.4550.	
 More quantitative easing would flood the financial system
with more dollars and likely boosting stocks, higher yielding
currencies and the euro.	
 If Bernanke refrains from setting the stage for more easing,
the dollar is likely to benefit, at least in the short term.	
 Part of the reason why investors have pared back their
expectations of something dramatic from Bernanke is the
realisation that despite sharp falls in stock markets, U.S.
inflation is higher. Though growth remains weak, Fed officials
do not appear particularly concerned about recession risks.	
 
 
 YEN RECOVERS	
 The euro was supported, brushing off rising Greek credit
default swaps although offers from Asian sovereign names above
$1.4460 and through $1.4490 blunted a push higher. Stop-loss
orders were cited above $1.4520.	
 On the downside, bids from Asian sovereign investors would
limit losses at around $1.4400.	
 Slight weakness against the euro prodded the dollar index
down 0.4 percent to 74.00.	
 Many traders said their euro/dollar positions were largely
square before Bernanke's speech, with some seeing the risk of
selling in the euro to around $1.43 as an initial reaction.	
 Others said they may pick up the euro on a fall to $1.4250.	
 Some analysts said they expected mild dollar selling if the
Fed boosts investor confidence that it is prepared to loosen
policy if the global economic outlook deteriorates, without
committing to easing measures for the moment.	
 ""For the dollar to rally you need risk aversion,"" said Peter
Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale.	
 ""For it to sell off you need either really positive risk
appetite or a halfway house where optimism about the U.S. isn't
secured but pessimism has not worsened, which would lead to a
smaller scale sell-off.""	
 He added the third scenario was most likely, saying that the
dollar may slip against the euro and the yen. 
 The dollar traded 0.7 percent lower at 76.95 yen ,
coming off a two-week high of 77.70 yen struck on Thursday. It
hit a record low of 75.941 yen a week ago, giving rise to
jitters that Tokyo would intervene in currency markets for the
second time in less than a month.	
 Macro funds sold the dollar in early European trade, but
traders cited massive bids in the 76.80-90 region, which stamped
out a further fall.	
 Looking past Bernanke's speech, traders said the euro may
come under pressure from continuing worries about the euro
zone's debt crisis. The cost of insuring Greek debt against
default neared record highs as a row over a deal with Finland to
back its bailout contributions for Greece with collateral showed
no sign of easing. .	
 Despite its gains against the dollar, the euro slipped 0.2
percent versus the yen .	
 Euro/dollar risk reversals remain elevated and skewed in
favour of euro weakness with the one-month risk reversals
, trading around 3.25 for euro puts, up from 3.2
at the start of the week.	
 ""While Fed policy is an immediate focus with Jackson Hole,
the troubling developments in various financial sectors and euro
area stress measures cannot go unnoticed,"" Deutsche Bank said in
a note.

 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - European shares fell sharply and
Wall Street looked set to open weaker on Friday, with markets
playing down chances of a major shift towards further U.S.
economic stimulus from Ben Bernanke later in the day.	
 The Federal Reserve chairman was scheduled to speak at a Fed
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.	
 A year ago in the same place, he opened the door to a second
round of quantitative easing. Although there was some belief
that he would announce a third round of asset buying this year,

 The uncertainty about what is to come has put many investors
in a cautious frame of mind.	
 ""With many traders feeling like we're standing on the edge,
looking down into a global recession, Bernanke has the ability
to significantly elate or deflate the markets today,"" said
Jonathan Sudaria, dealer at Capital Spreads.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were flat.	
 But the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 lost more
than 1 percent, still battered by concerns about the
deteriorating economic situation.	
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.3 percent.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The dollar came off a two-week
high against the yen on Friday, weighed down by the euro's gains
on political progress in Spain, but was seen likely to recoup
losses and firm further on views the Federal Reserve will not
signal strong economic stimulus.	
 The greenback was also under pressure from the Australian
dollar which gained on the Australian central bank
chief's upbeat remarks about the country's economy, soothing
worries over deep interest rate cuts. 
 Markets started the week thinking Bernanke may announce a
third round of asset purchases or some other extraordinary
policy later on Friday in a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
pressuring the dollar. But this view has changed, giving the
U.S. currency a broad boost on Thursday. 
 This was mostly because markets realised that despite sharp
falls in stock markets, U.S. inflation is higher and the risk of
a vicious deflationary cycle has diminished. While growth
remains weak, Fed officials do not appear particularly concerned
about recession risks.	
 ""The market is still yen long and as the yen failed to get
stronger (versus the dollar) we may see further unwinding of
those positions ahead of Bernanke, boosted by lingering fears of
intervention,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign
exchange research at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 The dollar traded down 0.2 percent at 77.30 yen ,
coming off a two-week high hit overnight of 77.70 yen. It hit a
record low of 75.941 yen a week ago, giving rise to jitters that
Tokyo would intervene in currency markets for the second time in
less than a month.	
 Traders say Japanese exporters may refrain from selling the
dollar in their end-of-month transactions ahead of Bernanke's
speech, hoping he does not announce QE3, which could spur
further unwinding of dollar shorts, sending the dollar higher.	
 ""Exporters sold quite a lot (of dollars) yesterday around
77.50 and now stronger offers are lined up around 78.30,"" said a
trader for a major Japanese bank, adding that stop loss orders
by speculators are seen around 76.80 yen.	
 Individual Japanese players were also spotted liquidating
some yen-long positions ahead of the Jackson Hole speech, due to
start at 1400 GMT.	
 Charts indicate the pair is poised for a rebound, having
formed a round-bottom pattern. Strong support looms at the daily
tenkan line at 76.82 yen and the 21-day moving average at 77.12
yen, with resistance posed by the kijun line at 78.10 yen.	
 While Bernanke is expected to stop short of offering a grand
economic fix, he may well signal a willingness to adjust the
central bank's $2.8 trillion portfolio to try to get more bang
for each buck, and some think this would be enough to send the
dollar down.	
 ""We believe the Fed's commitment to keeping policy rates low
will re-ignite the USD's trend depreciation and push the
greenback lower especially against higher-yielding growth
currencies,"" said BNP Paribas strategist Steven Saywell.	
 ""Anticipating an ongoing Fed commitment to easy monetary
policy, we favour building short USD exposure,"" he said.	
 
 NUDGING HIGHER	
 Failure by the Fed to inject more dollars into the system
could help the currency extend gains sharply as investors pull
out of stocks and other risky assets. A euro slide below $1.4250
could speed up the dollar's gains, some analysts say.	
 The euro recouped mild losses sustained on Thursday, adding
0.2 percent to $1.4410 as stop loss-buying was triggered after
Spain's government reached an agreement with the main opposition
People's Party over plans to enshrine in its constitution limits
on the public deficit. 
 The common European currency continued to exasperate
traders, staying stuck in the middle of its well-trodden
$1.4518-$1.4259 range, down from this week's peak near $1.4500.	
 With the euro-zone debt crisis back in full swing and
two-year Greek yields hovering around record highs,
investors say the euro may drop after Bernanke's speech as the
market's focus will likely move back to Europe.	
 Wild talk that Germany may face a ratings downgrade and
could introduce a short-selling ban sent Germany's DAX stock
index 1.7 percent lower and also weighed on other
equity markets on Thursday, though both rumours were later
denied. 
 But some traders said Chinese demand for euros will cap the
currency's losses.	
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday China's
President Hu Jintao showed ""definitive"" confidence in the euro
and the European economy despite some concerns, after the two
leaders met in Beijing. 
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.0472 after
Australia's central bank chief said the country was well
positioned to tackle any further weakening of international
conditions. 
 The Aussie's march higher was stopped by strong resistance
at its 21-day moving average of $1.0499, but it stayed well
above its support at the 200-day moving average of $1.0336.	
 U.S. gross domestic product data for the April-June quarter
is due later on Friday, with some risk it may be
revised down to under 1 percent.

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.20% to hit 1.4407.
In figures released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of Americans filing for unemployment assistance rose by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, in the week ending August 19. Market expectations were for jobless claims to fall to 405,000 from 412,000 the previous week.
In addition, the Labor Department said those who continue to receive state unemployment checks fell by 80,000 to 3.64 million in the week ended Aug 13. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag, and expectations were for a decline to 3.70 million.
Wall Street shares snapped a three-day winning streak, with the the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.5% to 11,149.82, the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.95% to 2,419.63, and the S&P 500 lost 1.56%. to 1,159.27.

In early Asian trade USD/JPY hit 77.51, the pair’s highest since Thursday ; the pair subsequently consolidated at 77.30, dropping 0.22%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.47, Tuesday’s low, and resistance at 77.70, the day’s high.
Earlier in the day, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment assistance rose by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, in the week ending August 19.
Market expectations were for jobless claims to fall to 405,000 from 412,000 the previous week.
In addition, the Labor Department said those who continue to receive state unemployment checks fell by 80,000 to 3.64 million in the week ended Aug 13. 
Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag, and expectations were for a decline to 3.70 million.
Japan’s Statistics Bureau announced late Thursday that the core consumer price index for July rose 0.1% year on year, while Tokyo’s core consumer price index fell to an annualized rate of minus 0.2% from 0.4% the preceding month.
The rise in the national consumer price index helped to temporarily diffuse ongoing deflation concerns in Japan, as the economy battles to recover from the devastating March 11 earthquake.
Meanwhile, the yen moved higher against both the euro and the British pound with EUR/JPY down 0.04% to hit 111.32, and GBP/JPY falling 0.15% to hit 125.91.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was scheduled to speak later Friday at the central bank’s annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

speech

 By Frederik Richter	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up on
Friday and gold slipped ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke on the U.S. economic outlook later in the
day, while the euro gained after Spain agreed on a
constitutional debt brake. 
 European shares are seen opening flat to lower, ahead
of the speech, according to financial bookmakers. 
 S&P 500 futures  rose 0.4 percent during Asian
trading hours, pointing to slight gains in Western markets
later. 
 Stocks on Wall Street fell on Thursday as investors lowered
their expectations that Bernanke, who is due to address central
bankers at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at
about 1400 GMT on Friday will announce drastic
measures to kickstart growth in the world's top economy.	
 His speech last year laid the groundwork for the Fed's $600
billion bond-buying program to revive the economy under the
rubric ""QE2"" for the Fed's second round of stimulus, or
quantitative easing. 
 While investors have speculated Bernanke could signal a new
monetary offensive in his talk, many analysts say he could well
disappoint those looking for major measures, such as a QE3. 
 ""The market is lacking upside potential as some doubt there
will be another round of quantitative easing from the Fed,"" said
Lee Suk-won, a market strategist at E-Trade Securities.	
 Investors are also looking out for the U.S. government's
preliminary estimate for June-quarter economic growth before
Bernanke's speech on Friday.	
 The MSCI world equity index edged up
0.1 percent, taking its gains this week to almost 2 percent,
which recovers only a fraction of the steep 16 percent loss it
suffered over the four previous weeks. 
 Asian stocks flip-flopped on Friday, with the Nikkei
225 index closing up 0.29 percent at 0530 GMT, while the
broader MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index gained
0.1 percent. 
 ""While there is speculation that there may not be a
clear indication of QE3 from Bernanke, investors do not want to
take positions,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst
at Mizuho Securities. 
 The Australian dollar rose 0.5 percent against the U.S.
dollar after cautiously upbeat comments by Australia's
top central banker pointed to lower risks of deep interest rates
cuts. 
 The Euro rose against the U.S. dollar to $1.4427,
boosted by an agreement between Spain's government and
opposition parties to enshrine caps on public debt in the
country's constitution. 
 Brent crude  was flat at $110.60 per barrel
ahead of the Bernanke speech, with sentiment supported by
worries about Hurricane Irene's impact U.S. East Coast
supplies. 
 Gold rose 0.5 percent to $1,778.6, but the
precious metal is still on track for a weekly loss of almost 4
percent, its first after seven straight weeks of gains as
investors rushed into the safe haven during unprecedented market
turmoil.

EUR/USD hit 1.4381 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Thursday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4373, easing 0.04%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4328, the day’s low, and resistance at 1.4500, Tuesday’s high.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - World stocks dropped and the
U.S. dollar rose against the yen on Thursday as investors
lowered their expectations that the Federal Reserve would
signal a dramatic rescue for the economy this week.
 Weakness in stocks, which partly reflected jitters over a
sharp drop in German shares, helped boost safe-haven gold.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is due to address central bankers
at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. His
speech last year laid the groundwork for the Fed's $600 billion
bond-buying program to revive the economy under the rubric
""QE2"" for the Fed's second round of stimulus, or quantitative
easing.
 While investors have speculated Bernanke could signal a new
monetary offensive in his talk, many analysts say he could well
disappoint those looking for major measures, such as a QE3.
 ""Over the last couple of days, we have gone from pure
excitement about QE3 to being far more muted. I suspect there
has been some positioning for a slightly more mundane speech
coming from Bernanke,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Worries about the faltering U.S. economic recovery as well
as the euro zone debt crisis have plagued investors for weeks.
 Stocks posted gains earlier this week partly on expectation
the soft U.S. economy would trigger another round of monetary
stimulus from the Fed.
 Under quantitative easing, the Fed effectively prints money
to buy bonds, with the aim of depressing U.S. Treasury yields
even further and encouraging investors to seek higher returns
elsewhere.
 An increase of money supply would also erode the value of
the dollar relative to other currencies. On Thursday, the
dollar rose to 77.48 yen , up 0.7 percent.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.1
percent. The benchmark, however, is on track to post its first
weekly gain in five weeks, having hit an 11-month low earlier
this month.
 Talk of a broad short-selling ban in Germany caused a slump
in European indexes, with the DAX <.GDAXI> leading the way and
falling to a low of 5,451 points before paring losses and
ending down 1.7 percent.
 Comments from the German finance ministry and a regulator
appeared to quash initial fears, although it was not enough to
restore the market's earlier gains and the broader FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> ended the day down 1.25 percent.
 In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> fell 170.89 points, or 1.51 percent, to end at
11,149.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 18.33
points, or 1.56 percent, to end at 1,159.27. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 48.06 points, or 1.95 percent,
to end at 2,419.63.
 ""They're selling ahead of Bernanke and being fairly
cautious in their positioning,"" said Len Blum, managing partner
of Westwood Capital LLC in New York.
 Among U.S. stocks, Apple  slipped 0.7 percent to
$373.72 after the resignation of its founder and chief
executive, Steve Jobs.

America . Shares of the Dow component jumped 9.4 percent
to $7.65 but are still down for the month. For details, see

 GOLD REVERSES LOSS, BONDS AND OIL UP
 Worries about a global recession have sent investors
scrambling for gold and other safe-haven assets in recent
weeks.
 Gold traded higher on Thursday, a day after registering its
biggest percentage one-day drop since December 2008. Spot gold
 was last up 0.5 percent at $1,759.99 an ounce.
 U.S. Treasury prices also advanced. Benchmark 10-year
Treasury notes  finished 19/32 higher in price to
yield 2.23 percent, down 7 basis points from late on
Wednesday.
 Data showing higher-than-expected claims for U.S. jobless
benefits helped support bond prices and was the latest report
to suggest the job market is still struggling to gain
momentum.
 Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve
Bank, said in an interview with Reuters Insider television that
he does not see another U.S. recession looming.[ID:nN9E7H7011]
 In the oil market, U.S. crude futures edged up in volatile
trading as strong gasoline and heating oil futures supported
prices on the threat from Hurricane Irene.
 The storm was forecast to affect the U.S. Northeast -- and
possibly the New York City area -- on Saturday or Sunday.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday
and stocks slumped as investors shied away from risky trades
amid speculation that Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke will
not hint at new plans to stimulate the economy this week.
 Talk that Germany might follow other European countries by
banning short-selling also pushed the euro lower, erasing gains
seen after news that Berkshire Hathaway  would invest
$5 billion in Bank of America . For more see
[ID:nN1E77O0ET].
 Though a German Finance Ministry spokesman said there were
no plans to ban short-selling, the damage to European stocks
had been done, and that rippled through U.S. markets.
[ID:nB4E7JF02O]
 The dollar tends to rise when markets grow nervous because
investors cut trades funded with the U.S. currency. Low U.S.
interest rates let investors borrow dollars at almost no cost.
 Fading expectations of more Fed easing -- markets came into
the week thinking Bernanke could announce a third round of
asset purchases or some other extraordinary policy when he
speaks on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming -- are also good for
the dollar and bad for stocks and risk appetite.
 Under quantitative easing, the Fed prints money to buy
bonds, which should depress U.S. Treasury yields and encourage
investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. An increase in the
money supply erodes the value of the dollar.
 ""We spent the better part of this week pricing in a QE3
announcement. Now we're seeing some give-back. and the more QE3
is priced out, the more the dollar will strengthen,"" said Brian
Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey.
 If the Fed does refrain from injecting more dollars into
the system, Dolan said the currency could extend gains sharply
as investors pull out of stocks and other risky assets. A euro
slide below $1.4250 could speed up greenback gains, he said.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.4380 , though it
recovered from a global session low of $1.4325.
 The dollar rose to 77.48 yen , up 0.7 percent. It hit
a record low beneath 76 yen last week. The dollar also hit a
one-week high just shy of 0.8000 Swiss francs before easing to
0.7932 francs, down 0.3 percent .
 The dollar could rack up more gains against both currencies
if Bernanke holds off on QE3, said Boris Schlossberg, director
of currency research at GFT in New York.
 ""Should that scenario turn out to be true, the greenback
could climb to 78.00 yen and could finally retake the 0.80
barrier against the Swissie as fears of further dilution of the
currency begin to dissipate,"" he said.
 Some analysts still think Bernanke may signal the Fed is
ready to act if necessary, which could help riskier currencies
including the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 Handicapping the euro's next moves is tougher: Investors
shrugged off a surge in Greek bond yields , which
rose on fear a planned second Greek bailout may yet unravel.
But analysts said market focus will return to Europe's debt
crisis after Bernanke's speech.
 Fed data showed the U.S. central bank conducted $500
million of currency swaps with the European Central Bank in the
week ended Aug. 24, suggesting some strains in short-term
funding markets. [ID:nN1E77O1N0]
 Some European banks have had to pay more to fund short-term
U.S. operations lately due to fear they may be exposed to debt
from troubled euro zone countries. [ID:nN1E77O18R]
 Yet some traders said Chinese demand for euros will cap the
currency's losses. [ID:nB9E7J201Z]
 ""China has not wavered in its support of the euro and the
euro zone,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Faros
Trading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""We believe China, other
Asian central banks and Middle Eastern reserve managers'
euro/dollar purchases will continue at a gradual pace.""

disappoint those looking for major measures such as a QE3.
 ""Over the last couple of days, we have gone from pure
excitement about QE3 to being far more muted. I suspect there
has been some positioning for a slightly more mundane speech
coming from Bernanke,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Jitters ahead of Bernanke's speech also weighed on gold,
but the dollar rose to a two-week high against the yen in the
belief that the Fed would not be expanding the U.S. money
supply.
 In Germany, a Finance Ministry spokesman told Reuters they
are not planning a general short-selling ban. However, markets
have been sensitive to developments in the euro zone region,
given the area's growing sovereign debt crisis and concerns
about European banks' stability.
 Worries about both the euro zone debt crisis as well as the
faltering U.S. economic recovery have plagued investors for
weeks, causing stocks on Friday to post their fourth straight
weeks of declines.
 Also dragging on U.S. stocks, shares of Apple 
declined 1.4 percent to $371.18 after the resignation of its
well-known chief executive, Steve Jobs. Bank shares rose,
however, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway 
said it would invest $5 billion in Bank of America .
 Shares of the Dow component jumped 12 percent to $7.83 but
are still down for the month. For details, see [ID:nN1E77O0HA]

 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 113.52 points, or 1.00 percent, at 11,207.19. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 10.89 points, or 0.92
percent, at 1,166.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 25.79 points, or 1.05 percent, at 2,441.90.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European share
was down 1.3 percent.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.9
percent. The benchmark index, however, is on track to post its
first weekly gain in five weeks, having hit an 11-month low
earlier this month.
 GOLD DROPS
 Funds liquidated positions in gold, causing spot gold
 was decline 0.8 percent to $1,735.79 an ounce. U.S.
December gold futures  were down $17.50 an ounce at
$1,739.50.
 Spot gold hit a record high of $1,911.46 earlier in the
week, but saw its biggest percentage one-day drop since
December 2008 on Wednesday.
 Thursday's fall came after CME Group  raised trading
margins on bullion futures by about 27 percent, the biggest
hike in more than two and a half years and the second increase
in a month.
 Gold prices had jumped about $400 since July as worries
about a global recession sent investors scrambling for the
safe-haven asset.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 77.41 yen , moving
further away from a record low of 75.941 set on trading
platform EBS last week.
 Any more printing of money by the Fed would pressure the
dollar, potentially triggering a spike in commodity prices as
it did last year.
 U.S. Treasury prices also advanced, after data showing
higher-than-expected new claims for U.S. jobless. Benchmark
10-year Treasury notes  were trading 17/32 higher in
price to yield 2.24 percent, down from 2.30 percent late on
Wednesday.

 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - World stocks dropped following
weakness in German shares on Thursday, and the U.S. dollar
climbed against the yen on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke will not unveil dramatic measures to rescue the
economy on Friday.
 Stocks in Europe and the United States fell amid trader

the market's close. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> was down 2.1
percent.
 Gold fell for a third day as an exchange sharply raised

 Bernanke is due to address central bankers at an annual
symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. His speech last
year laid the groundwork for the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying
program to revive a sputtering U.S. economy under a policy that
was termed the second round of quantitative easing.
 While many doubt Bernanke will immediately commit to
conducting a third round of quantitative easing, investors
generally expect him to stress that the central bank stands
ready to act if necessary.

excitement about QE3 to being far more muted. I suspect there

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a
two-week high against the yen on Thursday and could extend
gains on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will
refrain from signalling a new round of bond purchases to
stimulate the economy.
 The euro erased gains to trade slightly lower against the
dollar after having earlier jumped on risk appetite fed by news
that Berkshire Hathaway  said it would invest $5
billion in Bank of America . For more see
[ID:nN1E77O0ET].
 Foreign currency trading was range bound as market
participants awaited a key speech by Bernanke at a central bank
conference on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
 Speculation the U.S. central bank may signal a third round
of bond buying, known as quantitative easing, has weighed on
dollar sentiment in recent weeks, although investors have pared
back expectations.
 ""Over the last couple of days, we have gone from pure
excitement about QE3 to being far more muted. I suspect there
has been some positioning for a slightly more mundane speech
coming from Bernanke,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""But all in all, nothing has really settled. The market's
quietness is almost hiding the fact that underneath everything
is still fairly vulnerable and fairly nervous,"" she said.
 Under quantitative easing, the Fed effectively prints money
to buy bonds. More money circulating in the financial system
can reduce U.S. Treasury yields, thus weighing on the dollar, .
and can encourage investors to seek higher returns elsewhere.
 YEN, SWISS FRANC
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 77.10 yen , moving
further away from a record low of 75.941 set on trading
platform EBS last week. Speculations that Japan may intervene
to stem yen strength also helped support the currency pair.
 The dollar rose to a one-week high of 0.7985 Swiss franc
 and last traded up 0.2 percent at 0.7972. The euro
also hit a one-week high of 1.1519 francs .
 Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in
New York, said the dollar could pop against both low yielders
if Bernanke does not offer any new accommodative measures to
stimulate the economy.
 ""Should that scenario turn out to be true the greenback
could climb to 78.00 versus the yen and could finally retake
the 0.80 barrier versus the Swissie as fears of further
dilution of the currency begin to dissipate,"" he said.
 More quantitative easing could boost stocks, higher
yielding currencies and the euro. On the other hand, if
Bernanke disappoints markets, the dollar is likely to benefit,
at least in the short term, analysts said.
 But some analysts say even though a firm commitment to QE3
is unlikely, Bernanke may pledge readiness to act to help the
economy if necessary, which could help riskier currencies
including the Australian and New Zealand dollars after an
initial knee-jerk drop.
 Against the dollar, the euro traded slightly lower at
$1.4398.
 Investors shrugged of a surge in yields on Greek bonds on
fears that an escalating row over demands by Finland for
collateral on Greek loans may derail the rescue package.
 Two-year Greek yields  rose more than 200 basis
points to a record high of 46.38 percent. The risk premium
versus 10-year Bunds also hit the highest since the launch of
the single currency at 1,640 bps.
 Analysts said after Bernanke's speech, the market's focus
will likely move back to Europe's sovereign debt woes and the
fragility of the euro zone economy and banking sector.
 But Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Faros Trading
in Stamford, Connecticut, said continued support from China may
limit euro weakness.
 Chinese President Hu Jintao showed ""definitive"" confidence
in the euro and the European economy despite some concerns,
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the two leaders met
in Beijing. [ID:nB9E7J201Z]
 ""China has not wavered in its support of the euro and the
euro zone. For this reason the euro continues to rally against
the U.S. dollar, much to many market-watchers dismay,""
Borthwick said.
 The New Zealand currency  rose 0.2 percent after
better-than-expected data on New Zealand retail sales.

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The euro inched up against the
dollar on Thursday, tracking gains in European shares on
speculation the Federal Reserve may signal more economic
stimulus measures, but analysts saw the risk of a correction if
such expectations are not met.	
 Sovereign and eastern European demand boosted the single
currency to a session high in early European trade, traders
said, keeping the dollar under selling pressure ahead of a
highly anticipated speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on
Friday.	
 Speculation of a third round of quantitative easing has
dented the dollar in past weeks, but while investors are worried
the U.S. economy may slip into recession, some are unconvinced
Bernanke is ready to signal another round of bond-buying to
stimulate the economy. 
 Some analysts say the possibility of another bombshell
announcement on monetary policy was unlikely after the U.S.
central bank only three weeks ago surprised markets by pledging
to keep rates low for the next two years.	
 As a result, they saw the possibility of a downward
correction in higher-risk currencies including the euro and the
Australian and New Zealand dollars, which have benefited from
recent dollar weakness.	
 ""There is a risk of a 'buy the rumour sell the fact'
situation after the event and there is a possibility that risk
will sell off again,"" said Ankita Dudani, currency strategist at
RBS.	
 She said that, once Bernanke has spoken, the market's focus
will likely move back to Europe's sovereign debt woes and the
fragility of the euro zone economy and banking sector, along
with the weakening global growth outlook, which will keep
investors risk-averse.	
 The euro rose 0.3 percent on the day to $1.4469 while
European shares rose 0.8 percent in early trade.
Further gains in the euro were limited by offers from U.S.
leveraged investors around $1.4475. 
 Market participants have also cited offers from Asian
sovereign names around $1.4500, which have kept the euro below
that level for the past week.	
 Gains in the euro pushed the dollar 0.2 percent lower
versus a currency basket, but the U.S. currency inched up
0.2 percent to 77.10 yen.	
 The dollar remains supported versus the yen on talk that
Japan may enter the FX market to stem ongoing strength in its
currency, which rallied to a record high of 75.94 to the dollar
last week.	
 Tokyo traders said short-term players slightly lightened
their dollar/yen positions, wary that exporters -- still hoping
to sell the dollar above 79 yen if Tokyo steps into the market
-- would be forced to offload it early next week in
end-of-month-transactions. 
 But they also said the dollar may strengthen against the yen
further in the near term, given the potential for more position
unwinding.	
 The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar
were little changed on the day, holding gains made
earlier in the week.	
 Some in the market said a profit-taking slide in gold prices
helped to boost demand for higher-risk currencies.	
 But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the
move, along with higher equities and the previous day's sell-off
in U.S. bonds, saying the moves were likely rooted in position
unwinding rather than any big shift in risk appetite or
investors' views of economic fundamentals. 
""I don't think market players are all that bullish about the
outlook for the global economy,"" said Makoto Noji, senior bond
and currency strategist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. 
""If economic conditions don't show much improvement as we
enter September and October, I think U.S. authorities will face
pressure again to adopt additional economic stimulus measures
and the dollar could come under pressure, especially against the
yen,"" Noji said.

 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - World stocks edged up on Thursday
while gold fell sharply as investors were optimistic the Federal
Reserve would signal at a gathering this week that it is
committed to supporting the U.S. economy if necessary.	
 Fed chief Ben Bernanke is due to address central bankers at

 The MSCI world equity index rose 0.3
percent. The benchmark index is on track to post its first
weekly gain in five weeks, having hit an 11-month low earlier
this month.	
 European stocks added 0.4 percent while emerging
stocks were steady on the day. 
 French bank Credit Agricole and Austria's
Raiffeisen Bank both rose after reporting
better-than-expected quarterly earnings, and the STOXX Europe
600 banking index was up 2.1 percent.

 U.S. stock futures were up 0.1 percent , pointing to a
slightly firmer open on Wall Street.	
 Technology shares will be in the spotlight after Steve Jobs
resigned as chief executive of Apple . Apple shares fell
more than 4 percent in Frankfurt after a 7 percent
tumble in after-hours trade on Wall Street.	
 London Brent crude oil  rose 0.5 percent to $110.70.	
 Bund futures  fell 33 ticks, but investors remained
jittery about the euro zone debt crisis. 
 Greek two-year bond yields rose to 44.77
percent, after surging more than 400 basis points on Wednesday
on uncertainty over implementation of a second rescue package.	
 Greece agreed last week to provide cash collateral for
triple-A rated Finland's loans in a bilateral deal that sparked
requests for similar treatment from Austria, the Netherlands and
Slovakia. This prompted rating agency Moody's to warn that
Greece's bailout payments could be delayed. 
 ""Greece is missing, in the first seven months of the year,
its deficit-reduction targets as the recession reduces the tax
receipts for the government,"" said ING rate strategist
Alessandro Giansanti. 
 ""In this environment, the odds of a full default event for
the Greek bonds have substantially increased."" 
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against a basket of
major currencies. Any more money printing by the Fed would
pressure the dollar, potentially triggering a spike in commodity
prices as it did last year.	
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.4427.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The dollar stayed firm
against other major currencies on Thursday and could eke out
more gains after a short-covering rally the day before, as
investors fret that the Federal Reserve may fail to signal new
stimulus for the economy this week.	
 Market players are worried that the U.S. economy could slip
into recession and are unconvinced that Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke is ready to signal another bond-buying programme when
he speaks on Friday at a central bank conference in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming.	
 ""The Fed is in a similar position to the SNB (Swiss National
Bank) - maybe they would like to act now, but there is not
enough hard evidence that the move is warranted,"" said Rob Ryan,
an FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.	
 U.S. orders for durable goods surged in July, rising twice
as much as economists had forecast, while the Congressional
Budget Office said on Wednesday that the U.S. budget deal and
lower interest rates will slice projected budget deficits nearly
in half over the next 10 years. 
 ""Given political opposition and the risk of a loss of
independence (by central banks) at a later stage, they both feel
that they need to see evidence of further economic pain that
would provide the political cover for action,"" said Ryan.	
 A profit-taking slide in gold extended in Asian trade by
more than 1 percent, sending it to $1,730 per ounce, and
a rise in U.S. Treasury yields also helped the dollar hold on to
Wednesday's hefty gains, analysts said.	
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent versus a basket of major
currencies , edging above the Tenkan line on its daily
chart to 74.064, up from the previous day's trough of 73.666,
while firming against the Australian dollar and the
euro .	
 ""As Bernanke is unlikely to unveil another bond-buying
programme, I expect the current short-covering in the dollar to
continue after his speech,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief FX
analyst at Citibank.	
 The greenback held steady against the yen at 76.96 yen
, hovering above a record low of 75.941 yen marked on
trading platform EBS last week.	
 Tokyo traders said short-term players slightly lightened
their dollar/yen positions, wary that exporters -- still hoping
to sell the dollar above 79 yen if Tokyo steps into the market
-- would be forced to offload it early next week in end-of-month
transactions.	
 They echoed Takashima's view and said the dollar may
strengthen further against the yen in the near term, given the
potential for more position unwinding.	
 ""The dollar might rise a bit above 77.23 yen, its August 22
high, if market players try to trigger stop-loss buying,"" the
trader said.	
 Japan unveiled a $100 billion credit line on Wednesday for
companies investing overseas and stepped up monitoring of
currency positions of financial institutions in an attempt to
curb the yen's strength.	
 Market players see the credit line as intended to help
offset the pain of yen strength for Japanese exporters rather
than to curb the currency itself.	
 
 CAUTION	
 They cautioned against reading too much into the previous
day's sell-off in gold and U.S. bonds plus a rally in equities,
saying the moves were likely rooted in position unwinding rather
than any big shift in risk appetite or investors' views of
economic fundamentals.	
 ""I don't think market players are all that bullish about the
outlook for the global economy,"" said Makoto Noji, a senior bond

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The dollar was firm
against major currencies on Thursday and could eke out further
gains after a short-covering rally the day before, as investors
fret that the U.S. Federal Reserve may not signal new stimulus
for the economy this week.	
 While players are worried that the U.S. economy may slip
into recession, they are not convinced that Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke is ready to signal another bond-buying programme when
he addresses a central bank conference on Friday in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming.	
 ""The Fed is in a similar position to the SNB (Swiss National
Bank) - maybe they would like to act now, but there is not
enough hard evidence that the move is warranted,"" said Rob Ryan,
an FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.	
 U.S. orders for durable goods surged in July, rising twice
as much as economists had forecast, while the Congressional
Budget Office said on Wednesday that the U.S. budget deal and
lower interest rates will slice projected budget deficits nearly
in half over the next 10 years. 
 ""Given political opposition and the risk of a loss of
independence (by central banks) at a later stage, they both feel
that they need to see evidence of further economic pain that
would provide the political cover for action,"" said Ryan.	
 The dollar added to hefty gains versus a basket of major
currencies edging above the Tenkan line on its daily
chart to 74.057, up from the previous day's trough of 73.666,
while firming against the Australian dollar and the
euro by about 0.1 percent each.	
 A profit-taking slide in gold and a rise in U.S. Treasury
yields also helped the dollar rise broadly on Wednesday,
analysts said.	
 The greenback held steady against the yen at 76.94 yen
, hovering above a record low of 75.941 yen marked on
trading platform EBS last week.	
 Tokyo traders said short-term players slightly lightened
their dollar/yen positions, wary that exporters -- still hoping
to sell the dollar above 79 yen if Tokyo steps into the market
-- would be forced to offload it early next week in
end-of-month-transactions.	
 But they also said the dollar may strengthen against the yen
further in the near-term, given the potential for more position
unwinding.	
 ""The dollar might rise a bit above 77.23 yen, its August 22
high, if market players try to trigger stop-loss buying,"" the
trader said.	
 The yen was stronger against other crosses, climbing against
0.1 percent against the euro to 110.824 yen and 0.2
percent to 80.44 yen versus the Aussie dollar .	
 Japan unveiled a $100 billion credit line on Wednesday for
companies investing overseas and stepped up monitoring currency
positions of financial institutions in an attempt to curb the
yen's strength.	
 Market players see the credit line as a measure intended to
help offset the pain of yen strength for Japanese exporters
rather than to curb the currency itself.	
 
 CAUTION	
 Market players cautioned against reading too much into the
previous day's sell-off in gold and U.S. bonds plus a rally in
equities, saying the moves were likely rooted in position
unwinding rather than any big shift in risk appetite or
investors' views of economic fundamentals.	
 ""I don't think market players are all that bullish about the
outlook for the global economy,"" said Makoto Noji, senior bond
and currency strategist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.	
 ""If economic conditions don't show much improvement as we
enter September and October, I think U.S. authorities will face
pressure again to adopt additional economic stimulus measures
and the dollar could come under pressure, especially against the

In early Asian trade, USD/JPY hit 77.15, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 76.88, dropping 0.12%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 75.97, last Friday’s low, and resistance at 77.71, the high of August 9.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against
the yen on Thursday, clinging to gains made the previous day on
short-covering as investors fretted that the U.S. Federal
Reserve may not signal new stimulus for the economy this week.	
 While investors are worried that the U.S. economy may slip

than expected, also helped the dollar rise broadly on Wednesday,
analysts said.	
 The dollar could add to its gains against the yen in the
near-term, given the potential for further position unwinding,
said a customer trader for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 ""The dollar might rise a bit above 77.23 yen, its August 22
high, if market players try to trigger stop-loss buying,"" the
trader said.	
 Traders said, however, that the potential for month-end

gains by the dollar relatively limited. 
 The dollar held steady at 76.96 yen , staying above a
record low of 75.941 yen hit on trading platform EBS last week.	
 Japan unveiled a $100 billion credit line on Wednesday for

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Thursday,
pointing to a positive open in Europe, but caution prevailed as
investors awaited the outcome of a central bank symposium in
Jackson Hole on Friday.	
 Following solid gains on Wall Street, Japan's Nikkei share
average advanced 1.5 percent, while stocks elsewhere in
Asia as measured by MSCI added 0.4 percent.	
 Financial bookmakers expect European shares to open higher
as well, although the opening gain may be less than 0.5 percent.

 Gold extended its spectacular decline, after a wave of
profit-taking triggered the biggest daily drop in futures since
1980, while currencies marked time ahead of a speech United
States Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday.	
 ""If there is no form of stimulus announced on Friday markets
may be susceptible to sharp declines given how much weak data
has been ignored over the last couple of days,"" said Jonathan
Sudaria, a night dealer at London Capital Group.	
 ""Basically people are covering short positions before
Jackson Hole. I'm sure he will comment on the possibility of
easing but I doubt he can explicitly indicate QE3,"" said
Hideyuki Ishiguro, assistant manager of investment strategy at
Okasan Securities.	
 In the U.S., Apple shares tumbled as much as 7 percent in
after-hours trading after the shock resignation of its chief
executive officer Steve Jobs, knocking Nasdaq futures 
down almost 1 percent, though U.S. stock index futures
 were off a milder 0.2 to 0.4 percent.	
 
 GOLD STRUGGLES	
 Spot gold slipped to $1,732 an ounce, taking losses
to some $180 since it hit a record high of $1,911.46 earlier in
the week. 
 The fall came after COMEX futures for the precious metal
fell over $100 on Wednesday, the biggest one-day drop since 1980
and one of the steepest on record.	
 Gold faced renewed pressure on Thursday after CME Group
raised trading margins on bullion futures by about 27
percent, the biggest hike in more than two and a half years and
the second increase in a month.	
 Gold prices have jumped $400 since July as worries about a
global recession sent investors scrambling for the safe-haven
asset. The intensity of the move prompted some analysts to call
for gold investors to take money off the table.	
 Traders attributed the unwinding of long positions as the
main factor driving down gold as well as U.S. Treasuries, rather
than a return of risk appetite.	
 ""I don't think market players are all that bullish about the
outlook for the global economy,"" said Makoto Noji, senior bond
and currency strategist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.	
 ""If economic conditions don't show much improvement as we

pressure again to adopt additional economic stimulus measures
and the dollar could come under pressure, especially against the
yen,"" Noji said. 
 In the currency markets, the euro traded around $1.4406
, down from this week's peak near $1.4500. But it remained
in the middle of a prevailing $1.4300-$1.4500 range. 
 This saw the dollar index edge back above 74.000,
still stuck in slim range roughly between 73.400 and 74.400. 
 Against the yen, the dollar drifted up to 77.02 .,
putting more distance from an all-time low around 75.94 plumbed
Friday.	
 Copper inched up 0.2 percent to $8,892 per tonne,

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Gold sold off in the biggest
one-day percentage drop since December 2008, during the
financial crisis, while the dollar rose on Wednesday on bets a
speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke later this week will not
reveal any major initiatives.
 Government bonds, which like gold rallied dramatically in
recent weeks, fell sharply as investors withdrew from a broad
range of safe-haven assets. World stocks posted solid gains for
a second day.
 Investors focused on raising cash because of the
uncertainty ahead of Bernanke's speech to fellow central
bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.
 Wednesday's trading was not a typical move from one asset
class to another, and cash raised was not immediately poured
into stocks or other riskier assets like oil. Stocks rose, but
on average volume.
 ""Markets are looking forward to Bernanke and Jackson Hole
and are increasingly reluctant to carry risk into the speech in
coming days,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director and head of
sales at Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 U.S. stocks flipped between positive and negative territory
for much of the day, but ended with 1 percent gains on the S&P
500 as investors jumped back into beaten-down financial shares.
Gold-related exchange-traded funds and shares dropped,
however.
 Markets have been in turmoil for the past month, weighing
another possible U.S. recession and the impact of the euro zone
debt crisis on the global economy. Benchmark stock indexes are
on track for their worst month since the fall of 2008, after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank.
 Investors had been hoping for additional action from the
U.S. central bank to help, but a more likely outcome may be
just gradual measures.
 For gold investors, analysts said it was time to take money
off the table after a safe-haven rally extended too far, too
fast in recent weeks. Bullion had been up by as much as $400
per ounce since July.
 Spot gold  dropped 4 percent to end at $1,750.55 per
ounce.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$104 at $1,757.30 an ounce.
 ""You have a commodity that retail investors, hedge funds
and everybody were long, and the technical indicators showed it
was overbought. It was just a matter of time before the market
starts cracking,"" said Mihir Dange, COMEX gold options floor
trader for Arbitrage LLC.
 ETFs tracking gold stocks and gold-mining stocks fell after
the drop in bullion futures. The SPDR Gold XTrust Index 
lost 3.4 percent, while the Market Vectors Gold Miners Index
 fell 2.5 percent.
 Among gold-related shares, Barrick Gold  dropped 3.3
percent to $48.99, Goldcorp Inc  fell 3.6 percent to
$49.44 and Kinross Gold  lost 1.9 percent to $16.74.
 The dollar rose, but traders said they saw little
conviction behind the gain. The dollar <.DXY> was last up 0.2
percent against a basket of currencies.
 While investors have speculated Bernanke could signal a new
monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy, many
analysts say he could well disappoint those looking for a big
bang approach such as a third round of Treasury bond buying, or
""quantitative easing,"" dubbed QE3.
 ""I think some of the dollar buying is based on the idea
that Bernanke won't be too aggressive just yet,"" said Kathy
Lien, head of research at GFT Forex in New York.
 BOND PRICE DROP
 Bond losses accelerated in afternoon trading despite a
decent response to a $35 billion auction of five-year Treasury
notes, part of this week's $99 billion in coupon-bearing
supply.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was last
down 40/32 in price and yielding 2.29 percent, up from 2.16
percent late on Tuesday.
 The U.S. stocks' gain followed a rally in both world and
U.S. stocks on Tuesday. The S&P 500 is still down 12.5 percent
since July 22, roughly the start of the recent sell-off.
 ""Whenever you have waterfall decline like we did,
historically you'll get a nice bounce,"" said Linda Duessel,
market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
 Among factors supporting stocks was data showing
better-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders, along with a
U.S. Congressional Budget Office prediction of a decline in the
deficit as a result of the government's recent debt-reduction
agreement.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were last
up 0.7 percent.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 143.95 points, or 1.29 percent, at 11,320.71. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 15.25 points, or 1.31 percent,
at 1,177.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 21.63
points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,467.69.
 The S&P financial index <.GSPF> jumped 2.8 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
gained for a third straight session to end up 1.4 percent.
 In the oil market, Brent crude oil futures pared gains in
late trading on uncertainty over Bernanke's speech but ended
higher. In London, ICE Brent crude for October delivery 
settled at $110.15 a barrel, rising 84 cents, or 0.77 percent.
 U.S. crude for October delivery  settled at $85.16 a
barrel.

 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Gold futures were headed on
Wednesday for their biggest one-day loss since March 2008,
while the dollar rose on bets a speech by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke later this week will not reveal any major
initiatives.
 Government bonds, another safe play, also sold off sharply,
while world and U.S. stocks flipped between positive and
negative territory.
 Heightened uncertainty surrounding Bernanke's speech to
fellow central bankers on Friday by the head of the Federal
Reserve kept stock gains in check, although gold-related
exchange-traded funds and shares dropped.
 Markets have been in turmoil for the past month, weighing
another possible U.S. recession and the impact of the euro zone
debt crisis on the global economy. Benchmark stock indexes are
on track for their worst month since the fall of 2008, after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank.
 Investors have been hoping for additional action from the
U.S. central bank to help.
 ""The speech is a real wild card for markets so people are
being cautious,"" said Kathy Lien, head of research at GFT Forex
in New York.
 Wednesday's trading was not a typical move from one asset
class to another.
 Classic safe havens like gold and Treasuries sold off in
heavy volume, but the cash raised was not immediately poured
into stocks or other riskier assets like oil. Stocks rose, but
on low volume. Oil, which was volatile all day before ending
lower, also had tepid flows.
 Investors instead focused on raising cash to be stored away
until the uncertainty surrounding Bernanke's speech on Friday
fades.
 For gold investors, analysts said it's time to take money
off the table after a safe-haven rally extended too far, too
fast in recent weeks. Bullion had been up by as much as $400
per ounce since July.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  were down
$98.30 to $1,763.10 an ounce. Trading was hectic with volume
headed toward one of the busiest sessions of the year.
 Spot gold  also tumbled, and appeared headed for its
biggest two-day decline in almost three years.
 ""You have a commodity that retail investors, hedge funds
and everybody were long, and the technical indicators showed it
was overbought. It was just a matter of time before the market
starts cracking,"" said Mihir Dange, COMEX gold options floor
trader for Arbitrage LLC.
 Exchange-traded funds tracking gold stocks and gold-mining
stocks fell after the drop in bullion futures. The SPDR Gold
XTrust Index  lost 3.4 percent, while the Market Vectors
Gold Miners Index  fell 3.4 percent.
 Among gold-related shares, Barrick Gold  dropped 4.2
percent to $48.58, Goldcorp Inc  fell 5.3 percent to
$48.58 and Kinross Gold  lost 3.4 percent to $16.48.
 DOLLAR UP
 The dollar edged up, but traders said there was little
conviction behind the gain. The dollar <.DXY> was last up 0.1
percent against a basket of currencies.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that the
Fed's Bernanke will use his speech at an annual conference of
central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new
monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.
 However, many analysts think he is most likely to outline
gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for a
big bang approach such as a third round of Treasury bond buying
or ""quantitative easing,"" dubbed QE3.
 ""I think some of the dollar buying is based on the idea
that Bernanke won't be too aggressive just yet,"" GFT's Lien

 BOND PRICE DROP
 Bond losses accelerated in afternoon trading despite a
decent response to a $35 billion auction in five-year Treasury
notes, part of this week's $99 billion in coupon-bearing
supply.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was last
down 36/32 in price and yielding 2.28 percent, up from 2.16
percent late on Tuesday.
 Stock investors tried to build on positive sentiment after
weeks of selling. Both world and U.S. stocks rallied on
Tuesday, although the U.S. S&P 500 is still down 13 percent
since July 22, roughly the start of the recent sell-off.
 Data showing better-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders
was supportive for stocks, as was a U.S. Congressional Budget
Office prediction of a project decline in the deficit as a
result of the government's recent debt-reduction agreement.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were last
up 0.3 percent.

up 107.62 points, or 0.96 percent, at 11,284.38. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 11.88 points, or 1.02 percent, at
1,174.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 16.95

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against major
currencies on Wednesday, erasing early losses as investors
trimmed bets against the U.S. currency on fear the Federal
Reserve may not signal new stimulus for the economy this week.
 The yen weakened to around 77 per dollar, not far from a
recent record low, after Japan unveiled new steps to curb its
currency's strength and after Moody's downgraded the country's
sovereign debt.
 Moves in the currency market were limited, and traders said
there was little conviction behind them, as reflected by
several back-and-forth moves inside fairly tight ranges.
 While investors are worried that the U.S. economy may slip
into recession, they are not entirely convinced that Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke is ready to announce another bond-buying
program on Friday. The Fed already pledged earlier this month
to hold interest rates near zero until at least 2013.
 ""Markets are looking forward to Bernanke and Jackson Hole
and are increasingly reluctant to carry risk into the speech in
coming days,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director and head of
sales at Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Bernanke used last year's annual Jackson Hole speech to
hint at another round of quantitative easing, which eventually
pumped $600 billion into the financial system.
 More money in the system depresses the value of the dollar
and encourages investors to seek higher returns elsewhere.
 The euro was last down 0.1 percent at $1.4420 
while the dollar reversed early losses to trade up 0.4 percent
at 76.98 yen .
 Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus
Consulting in Washington, said ""markets are bit confused about
whether there will be a QE3 or not"" and investors are taking
profits. He said a $130-per-ounce decline in gold  over
the last two days reflects that.
 A surge in U.S. July orders for long-lasting durable goods
also eased some fear about the U.S. economy. [ID:nN1E77N096]
 YEN INTERVENTION STILL A RISK
 Despite its gains, the dollar remained near a record low of
75.941 yen set on the EBS platform last week, and some analysts
said that could spark another round of intervention by Japan to
weaken the currency.
 Japan unveiled a $100 billion credit line on Wednesday for
companies investing overseas and stepped up monitoring currency
positions of financial institutions in an attempt to curb the
yen's strength.
 But Citigroup currency strategist Todd Elmer said the new
scheme ""treats the symptoms, not the underlying cause (of yen
strength), so it's not going to have any impact whatsoever in
supporting dollar/yen.""
 But while the yen is a favorite shelter for investors who
want to exit trades in higher-yielding but riskier assets, yen
appreciation hurts Japan's economy by undercutting its exports.
 Societe General strategist Sebastien Galy said Japan ""is
laying the ground for far more aggressive policy.""
 He said the dollar may grind lower in the near term and
could break through its record low. ""But when it does, the next
shoe will drop,"" he said.
 Bank of Japan data suggested Japan sold roughly 4.5
trillion yen in a currency intervention on Aug. 4, its
biggest-ever one-day action, but it has had limited effect.
 Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on Japan's
government debt by one notch to Aa3, blaming a build-up of debt
since the 2009 global recession and revolving-door political
leadership that has hampered effective economic strategies.

 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Gold futures on Wednesday
were headed for their biggest one-day loss since March 2008,
while the dollar rose on bets a speech by Fed chairman Ben
Bernanke on Friday will not reveal any major initiatives.
 Government bonds, another safe play, also sold off sharply,
while world and U.S. stocks flipped between positive and
negative territory.
 Heightened uncertainty surrounding the speech to fellow
central bankers by the head of the Federal Reserve kept stock
gains in check, although gold-related exchange-traded funds and
stocks dropped.
 Markets have been in turmoil for the past month, weighing
another possible U.S. recession and the impact of the euro zone
debt crisis on the global economy. Benchmark stock indexes are
on track for their worst month since the fall of 2008, after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank.
 Investors have been hoping for additional action from the
U.S. central bank to help.
 ""The speech is a real wild card for markets so people are
being cautious,"" said Kathy Lien, head of research at GFT Forex
in New York.
 For gold investors, analysts said it's time to take money
off the table after a safe-haven rally extended too far, too
fast in recent weeks. Bullion had been up by as much as $400
per ounce since July.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  were down
$96.30 to $1,765.00 an ounce. Trading was hectic with volume
set to be one of the busiest sessions of the year.
 Spot gold , meanwhile, was down 3.9 percent to
$1,758.49 an ounce, and appeared headed for its biggest two-day
decline in almost three years.
 ""You have a commodity that retail investors, hedge funds
and everybody were long, and the technical indicators showed it
was overbought. It was just a matter of time before the market
starts cracking,"" said Mihir Dange, COMEX gold options floor
trader for Arbitrage LLC.
 Exchange-traded funds tracking gold stocks and gold-mining
stocks fell after the drop in bullion futures. The SPDR Gold
XTrust Index  declined 3.7 percent, while the Market
Vectors Gold Miners Index  fell 3.5 percent.
 Among gold-related shares, Barrick Gold  shares
dropped 4.3 percent to $48.49, Goldcorp Inc  shares fell
5.3 percent to $48.58 and Kinross Gold  shares lost 3.4
percent to $16.48.
 DOLLAR UP
 The dollar edged up, but traders said there was little
conviction behind the gain, as reflected by several
back-and-forth moves inside fairly tight ranges.
 The dollar <.DXY> was last up 0.2 percent against a basket
of currencies.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that the
Fed's Bernanke will use his speech at an annual conference of
central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new
monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.
 However, many analysts think he is most likely to outline
gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for a
big bang approach such as a third round of Treasury bond buying
or 'quantitative easing', dubbed QE3.
 ""I think some of the dollar buying is based on the idea
that Bernanke won't be too aggressive just yet,"" Lien said.
 BOND PRICE DROP
 Bond losses accelerated in early afternoon trading despite
a decent response to a $35 billion auction in five-year
Treasury notes, part of this week's $99 billion in
coupon-bearing supply.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was last
down 28/32 in price and yielding 2.25 percent, up from 2.16
percent late on Tuesday.
 Stock investors tried to build on positive sentiment after
weeks of selling. Both world and U.S. stocks rallied on
Tuesday, although the U.S. S&P 500 is still down 13 percent
since July 22, roughly the start of the recent sell-off.
 Data showing better-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders
were supportive for stocks, as was a U.S. Congressional Budget
Office prediction of a project decline in the deficit as a
result of the government's recent debt-reduction agreement.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were last
up 0.4 percent.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 32.93 points, or 0.29 percent, at 11,209.69. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.70 points, or 0.32 percent, at
1,166.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 3.32

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares

 UPBEAT U.S. DATA
 Stock investors initially tried to build on positive

 Supportive for some markets was data showing
better-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders, as well as a
U.S. Congressional Budget Office prediction of a decline in the
deficit in coming years as a result of the government's recent

 NEW YORK, AUG 24 (Reuters) - Gold prices dropped on
Wednesday, suffering their biggest two-day loss since the peak
of the financial crisis, while the dollar rose as investors bet
a speech by the Federal Reserve Chairman later this week will
not reveal any major central bank initiatives.
 World stocks edged higher as investors tried to build on
positive sentiment after weeks of selling ahead of a key speech
on Friday by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 U.S. equity markets were volatile, however, seesawing
between gains and losses on investor skepticism that the Fed
can offer any new policy prescriptions that can help the
economy.
 Markets were supported by better-than-expected U.S. durable
goods orders and after the U.S. Congressional Budget Office
predicted a decline in the U.S. deficit in coming years as a
result of the government's recent debt-reduction agreement.
 That was enough to buoy sentiment in stocks as investors
shifted away from safe plays like government bonds and precious
metals.
 Financial shares led the gains on the U.S. benchmark
Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> in its third day higher. Both
world and U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday.
 Investors are hoping for additional action from the U.S.
central bank because the U.S. and euro zone economies appear in
danger of sliding into recession.
 The day's rise follows weeks of equity market turmoil, with
benchmark stock indexes on track for their worst month since
the fall of 2008, after the Lehman Brothers collapse.
 A year ago, Bernanke told the market a second round of
monetary support, or quantitative easing, was on the way. The
announcement of QE2 led to a sharp rally in stocks last fall.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
0.7 percent on the day.
 European shares were higher, though Japanese shares sold
off following Moody's Investors Service's downgrade of the
country's sovereign debt. For more, see: [ID:nL4E7JO17A]
 Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> closed down more than 1
percent. Overseas investors in particular reacted negatively to
the downgrade.
 GOLD TUMBLES
 Spot gold  fell sharply for a second session,
dropping more than 3 percent as rising equity markets prompted
bullion investors to take profits after the metal's sharp
rally.
 Gold  fell 2.8 percent to $1,777.69 an ounce, having
hit a one-week low of $1,765.10. It was more than $100 below a
record $1,911.46 an ounce hit in the previous session.
 Adding support for stocks, U.S. government data showed new
orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than
expected in July on strong demand for aircraft and motor
vehicles.
 ""The durable goods data looked very decent, but we'll need
a bigger catalyst to move higher,"" said Randy Bateman, chief
investment officer of Huntington Asset Management in Columbus,
Ohio, which oversees $14.5 billion. ""It would be nice to get
one from Bernanke, but I don't think that's likely.""
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that
Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a central banker
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new monetary
offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.
 However, many analysts think Bernanke is most likely to
outline gradualist measures, which would disappoint those
looking for a big bang approach such as a fresh round of bond
buying, or QE3.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 18.62 points, or 0.17 percent, at 11,195.38. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.86 points, or 0.16 percent, at
1,164.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 6.11
points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,439.95.
 Oil also gained on the speculation, with Brent October
crude  up 40 cents at $109.71 a barrel.
 The dollar traded near a record low against the yen as
traders shrugged off a program that urges firms to exchange yen
for foreign assets, a development that left some on alert for
more market intervention.
 The dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 76.51 yen ,
close to an all-time low just beneath 76 yen.
 In bond markets, core euro zone sovereign bond prices fell.
Some tension returned to the peripheral sector, with Greece's
yield hitting a record 42 percent.
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell after the Congressional Budget
Office predicted a decline in the U.S. deficit in the coming
years as a result of the government's recent debt-reduction
agreement.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was last
down 10/32 in price and yielding 2.19 percent, up from 2.16
percent late on Tuesday.

 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - World stocks edged up and oil
advanced on Wednesday as investors tried to position themselves
ahead of a Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's key speech.
 The gains follows weeks of market turmoil, with
disappointing U.S. economic news and escalating worries about
the debt crisis in Europe hitting sentiment. Benchmark stock
indexes are on track for their worst month since the fall of
2008, after the Lehman Brother fall.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
0.1 percent on the day but were on track for a 10.3 percent
year-to-date loss. The U.S. benchmark Standard & Poor's 500
<.SPX> index was nearly flat after the opening.
 European shares were also higher, though Japanese shares
sold off following a Moody's downgrade of the country's
sovereign debt. [ID:nL4E7JO17A]
 Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> closed down more than 1
percent. Overseas investors in particular reacted negatively to

 Although U.S. stocks were near flat, they were supported by
stronger-than-expected U.S. durables data. The U.S. government
data showed new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods
rose more than expected in July on strong demand for aircraft
and motor vehicles.
 ""The data gives us a leg up going into Bernanke's speech
and moderates some of the negative feeling that has been
around,"" said Roger Volz, director of cash equities at BGC
Financial in New York.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that
Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a central banker
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new monetary
offensive to support a faltering U.S. economy.
 Many analysts think Bernanke is most likely to outline
gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for a
big bang approach such as a fresh round of bond buying, known
as QE3.
 The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank
could tweak the Fed's balance sheet as a means to put further
pressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor them
at low levels. These could be implemented in September and
October at coming Fed meetings. [ID:nN1E77I0NF]

 * Euro up in quiet trade; markets eye Bernanke speech Friday

 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near record
lows against the yen after measures taken by Japan to help
companies deal with the impact of a strong yen proved
ineffective, and concerns over the health of the global economy
kept investors wary of risk.	
 Major currencies held within recent ranges as markets sat
tight ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
on Friday in which he will give his latest assessment on the
U.S. economy and may refer to additional steps to stimulate
sluggish growth.	
 Last year, Bernanke used the meeting to bring up the idea of
the central bank's $600 billion bond-buying programme that
became known as QE2. That pumped money and led to a rally in
stock markets and growth-linked currencies. 
 ""We think most people aren't looking for QE3 and are more
bent towards an operation twist where the Fed would increase the
maturity of its portfolio by buying longer-term assets,"" said
Kiran Kowshik, currency strategist at BNP Paribas.	
 ""The market does not seem to be expecting too much, so if
Bernanke does take more decisive measures, the dollar should
sell off broadly as it would support risk-seeking behaviour,"" he
added. 
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at
76.50 yen, shrugging off Japan's announcement of a new credit
line to facilitate companies' acquisitions of overseas firms and
their procurement of energy and resources from abroad.	
 ""These measures ... are not really going to have much of an
impact on dollar/yen,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at
RBS Global Banking.	
 ""Besides, the market, especially the speculative community,
does not have too much ammunition left to drive dollar/yen to
recent lows in the current environment.""	
 Traders reported bids on approach to 76.00 and exporter
offers above 76.80. Dollar/yen hit a record low of 75.94 on
Friday, but traders are wary of further dollar selling which may
force the Japanese to intervene by selling yen for the second
time this month to stem strength in their currency.	
 The yen had a brief sell-off after Moody's cut its rating on
Japan, blaming a build-up of debt since the 2009 global
recession and revolving-door political leadership that has
hampered effective economic strategies. 
 Still, such cuts have had scant effect on yields as the vast
bulk of Japanese debt is owned by the Japanese themselves.

 EURO PARES LOSSES	
 The euro pared early losses to trade with gains of
around 0.2 percent for the day at $1.4462. Traders reported
persistent demand from Asian sovereigns at lower levels with
stops above $1.4480.	
 ""It is a bit surprising that the euro has held up well
despite the Ifo numbers and that shows that downside risks to
euro zone rates have probably been priced in,"" added RBS's
Robson.	
 The euro recovered from a brief dip after the Ifo survey of
German business sentiment came in below market expectations.
. It also took within its strike a surprise drop
in June industry orders. 
 Traders said the euro's gains would be checked by ongoing
concerns that the Greek bailout package may be in jeopardy and
about the state of the global economy after weak data out of
Germany. 
 A minister in Angela Merkel's conservative party propelled
Germany into a euro zone debate about guarantees for Greek aid
on Tuesday, backing a demand for collateral by Finland, which
said it could quit the bailout programme if its request was
turned down.	
 German Chancellor Merkel told her Christian Democrats and
their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, she
rejected any special demand from Finland for collateral.

 The euro eased against the Swiss franc at 1.1415 francs
, but held well above a record low hit earlier this
month of 1.0075. Euro/Swiss one-month implied vols eased
slightly, although they were supported at 17.5 percent
.	
 The threat of further easing measures from the Swiss
National Bank was forcing options market players to stay long
euro/Swiss franc vols, analysts said.

 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - World stocks were generally
weaker on Wednesday and Wall Street looked set for losses as
investors shuffled positions ahead of a highly anticipated
Jackson Hole speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.	
 The mood in Europe was not helped by the Ifo survey showing
German business morale posting its steepest drop since the
aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in late 2008.	
 Japanese shares sold off following a Moody's downgrade.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei average closed down more than 1
percent. Overseas investors in particular reacted negatively to
Moody's Investors Service's downgrade of Japan's sovereign debt
rating.	
 The yen was slightly stronger against the dollar after Japan
unveiled a $100 billion credit line to help companies deal with
the impact of recent currency strength but failed to intervene
in the market.	
 In Europe, investors were balancing the possibility of more
stimulus being announced by Bernanke in the Wyoming resort town
on Friday against chanced of being disappointed.	
 U.S. stocks shot up 3 percent on Tuesday on speculation
Bernanke would signal new help, but many investors are sceptical
that he will deliver, given the Fed's recent pledge to keep
rates near zero and the political difficulties of taking action
as a presidential election year approaches.	
 ""We think most people aren't looking for (a third
quantitative easing programme) and are more bent towards an
operation twist where the Fed would increase the maturity of its
portfolio by buying longer-term assets,"" said Kiran Kowshik,
currency strategist at BNP Paribas.	
 Investors are looking for additional action from the Fed
because the U.S. and euro zone economies appear in danger of
sliding into recession. It is also the one-year anniversary of
Bernanke's telling the market that a new round of quantitative
easing, or QE2, was on the way.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were down
0.1 percent for a 10.3 percent year-to-date loss. 
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was flat.	
 
 NARROW RANGES	
 The dollar hovered near record lows against the yen after
the measures taken by Japan to help companies. Generally,
concerns over the health of the global economy kept investors
sensitive to risk.	
 Major currencies were largely confined to tight ranges as
markets sat tight ahead of the Bernanke speech.	
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies .	
 On bond markets, core euro zone sovereign bond prices fell.
Some tension returned to the peripheral sector with Greece's
yield hitting a record 42 percent.

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.22% to hit 1.4409.
A batch of U.S. economic news released Tuesday served to heighten expectations for the Federal Reserve’s meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where investors are pinning hopes on a new round of quantitative easing from the U.S. Central Bank.
The U.S. Census Bureau reported that new home sales dropped more than expected in July, falling 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 298,000. Economist’s forecasts were for a 1% gain in July to 310,000.
It was the third straight month the figure declined and slowest growth rate since February.
In a separate report, the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank said its manufacturing index slumped to minus 10 in August from minus 1 in July, the lowest monthly rating since June of 2009. Forecasts were for the figure to fall to minus 7 for the month.
Wall Street shares rallied for a second straight day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 3%, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.3%, and the S&P 500 gained 3.4%.
Federal Reserve officials said two weeks ago that the economy faced increased risk and that they were “prepared to employ” more tools “as appropriate.” The Fed has already completed two rounds of asset purchases referred to as quantitative easing.
Meanwhile, the greenback was up against the British pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.07% to 1.6484. 
The dollar gained ground against both the yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY adding 0.08% to hit 76.72, and USD/CHF higher by 0.12% to hit 0.7932. 
The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD up 0.16% to hit 0.9888, AUD/USD lower by 0.38% to hit 1.0486, and NZD/USD falling 0.92% to hit 0.8284.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.16% at 73.99.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was scheduled to deliver a speech at the Jackson Hole meeting on Friday.

In early Asian trade USD/JPY hit 76.62, the pair’s lowest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 76.78, adding 0.16%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 75.97, last Friday’s low and the pair's all time low and resistance at 77.19, Monday’s high.

 * Gold rebounds 1 percent to around $1,850 an ounce
 * Japan markets little moved by Moody's downgrade
 * U.S. crude down slightly to $85.30 a barrel

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - European shares may rise on
Wednesday on speculation the Federal Reserve may signal further
policy moves to support the struggling U.S. economy, even as a
rally in Asian stock spluttered out.	
 Japanese assets showed a muted reaction to a downgrade of
Tokyo's government debt by ratings agency Moody's, while the
dollar fell slightly versus the yen after Japan unveiled a $100
billion credit line to help companies deal with the impact of a
strong currency but shied away from intervening in the markets.	
 Gold climbed more than 1 percent, after tumbling from a
record high on Tuesday as investors switched money back into
shares, propelling U.S. stocks up around 3 percent. 
 Wall Street's rally, perversely, was driven by more dismal
U.S. economic data, which raised expectations that Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use a speech on Friday at a
central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal
a fresh monetary offensive to fend off a renewed recession.	
 Euro STOXX 50 futures  rose 0.9 percent, Germany's
DAX futures  were up 0.9 percent and France's CAC futures
 up 0.6 percent, while financial bookmakers called
London's FTSE 100 to open as much as 0.8 percent higher.

 
 Last year, Bernanke used the Jackson Hole meet to prepare
the ground for the Fed's second round of quantitative easing, a
$600 billion bond-buying programme designed to pump cash and
confidence into financial markets that became known as ""QE2"".	
 ""The market is becoming more pessimistic about the economic
outlook and is responding by pricing in a greater chance of
QE3,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, economist at BNP Paribas, in a client
note.	
 But while Bernanke is expected to acknowledge his
disappointment over the pace of growth in the economy, many Fed
watchers say the chances of a major new bond buying operation
being announced at Jackson Hole are limited.	
 ""I think we'll see (QE3) because America needs growth, but I
don't think we'll necessarily get it on Friday,"" said Neil
Dwane, chief investment officer for Europe at RCM.	
 
 RECESSION FEARS	
 Asian shares opened higher but swiftly retreated into
negative territory, with Japan's Nikkei share average
falling 1.1 percent, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific
shares outside Japan lost 0.8 percent.	
 S&P 500 futures  fell 0.9 percent, suggesting Wall
Street's rebound may be coming to a halt for now.	
 World stocks have tumbled this month on fears the United
States is slipping back into recession and as Europe's sovereign
debt crisis worsens.	
 The MSCI index remains down 14 percent for the month so far,
and about 18 percent below is April high.	
 Moody's announced shortly before Asian markets opened that
it was cutting Japan's credit rating by one notch to Aa3,
mirroring an earlier downgrade by rival S&P, blaming large
budget deficits and a buildup of debt since the global recession
of 2009. 
 ""It's been a while since Japan lost its triple-A status, so
it is unlikely that Japan's interest rates will rise sharply,""
said Fumiyuki Takahashi, managing director at Barclays Capital.	
 The dollar quickly came off an intraday high of 76.88 yen,
and was trading slightly down on the day around 76.60
after Japan's statement on the yen. 
 Tokyo's new credit line will facilitate firms' acquisitions
overseas and their procurement of energy and resources from
abroad, but analysts were sceptical the measures would calm
markets after the yen hit a record high of 75.941 last week. 
""The scheme treats the symptoms not the underlying cause,""
said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in Singapore.	
 Japanese government bond September 10-year futures fell
initially after the Moody's announcement, but reversed course as
equities slipped to trade up 0.18 point at 142.73, and the
benchmark 10-year yield dipped 0.5 basis point to 1.005 percent.

 Japanese government bonds are insulated by the fact that the
vast majority of Tokyo's debt pile is domestically held.	
 ""JGBs have tended not to show any lasting reaction to
ratings downgrades in the past -- probably because in Japan the
problem if anything is one of over-saving, which banks recycle
into JGBs, which remain 'risk free assets',"" said Naomi Fink,
head of Japan strategy at Jeffries Japan.	
 Gold was up about 1 percent just below $1,850 an ounce,
after suffering its biggest one-day fall in 18 months on
Tuesday. Gold's safe-haven appeal has driven it to a series of
records in recent months. 
 U.S. crude oil, which has tended to follow equities in
recent months, fell 0.2 percent to $85.30 a barrel.

EUR/USD hit 1.4442 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4437, dropping  0.03%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4260, last Friday’s low, and resistance at 1.4526, the high of July 27.
Earlier Tuesday, Markit Economics reported that Germany’s Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index came in at 52.0 in August, exceeding forecasts of 50.6 reading for the period.
While the Manufacturing PMI for the euro-zone as a whole fell to 49.7 in August from a 50.4 reading the previous month, the July number outpaced market forecasts of a drop to 49.5.
Positives garnered in the market from the encouraging manufacturing and service sector data were muted by the release of German ZEW Economic Sentiment which fell to minus 37.6 in August from minus 15.1 in July, far worse than the forecast of a drop to minus 26.0. 
The figure for the euro-zone as a whole during the period registered minus 40, far below forecasts of a minus 6.2.

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied, oil rose
and the dollar slipped on Tuesday on speculation the Federal
Reserve may signal more stimulus is ahead for the U.S.
economy.
 More dismal U.S. economic data helped spur the
expectations, which boosted world stocks as measured by the
MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> 2.4 percent and
the U.S. benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> 3.4 percent.
 Financial markets have been in turmoil for the past month
on concerns the United States may be headed for another
recession and as the euro zone's debt crisis has worsened.
 Steep recent losses have put the MSCI All-Country World
Index and S&P 500 on track for their worst month since 2008,
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 A report showing China's factory sector held up better than
expected in August helped boost world shares overnight.
 A magnitude 5.9 earthquake that struck the U.S. East Coast
and Canada, forcing evacuation of some buildings, had very
minimal impact on markets.
 In the latest disappointing news on the U.S. economy,
factory output in the U.S. central Atlantic region contracted
again in August and new home sales fell to a five-month low in
July. [ID:nN1E77M0M4]
 Manufacturing, which had been among the strongest sectors
in the U.S. recovery, has become an area of concern. Last
Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said an index covering factory
activity in its region dropped to a near 2-1/2 year low in
August.
 Equity investors are taking a ""bad news is good news""
approach, though, betting the Fed could step in with help
again. Stocks staged a rally in the fourth quarter of last
year, when the Fed announced a $600 billion bond-buying
program.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his speech on Friday at a
central banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a
new monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.
 ""The market is really geared up for the idea of additional
asset purchases to at least be put on the table when Bernanke
speaks,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey. ""I'm not sure it will play out that
way, but that's what the market is betting on now.""
 Some analysts say Bernanke is more likely to outline
gradualist measures, which would disappoint those looking for a
big bang approach such as a fresh round of bond buying, already
dubbed QE3.
 The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank
could tweak the Fed's balance sheet as a means to put further
pressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor them
at low levels. These could be implemented in September and
October at coming Fed meetings. [ID:nN1E77I0NF]

 Stimulus measures like those previously undertaken by the
Fed increase the amount of dollars in the system, driving down
the currency's value, which helps U.S. exports but prompts

 The dollar <.DXY> edged down 0.4 percent against a basket

 In the oil market, prices rose on the stimulus hopes, as
well as continued violence in Libya and planned disruptions to
Nigeria's oil exports.

 Gold prices retreated from their first-ever foray above a
record $1,900 an ounce in the sharpest one-day drop in 18
months as rebounding equities prompted traders to rethink a
bullion rally which many now see as overdone.
 The precious metal  fell almost $90 from a record

 ""Gold has reached that point where it moves $40-$50/ounce

The Gartman Letter.
 Spot gold  fell 3.7 percent to $1,826.60, its biggest
one-day percentage loss since February 2010.
 The sharp rally in stocks caused traders to pare Treasuries
holdings.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year note  was last down
13/32 in price, its yield edging up to 2.15 percent from 2.11
percent late on Monday.
 BANK BORROWING COSTS HIT
 Ongoing fears over European banks' exposure to heavily
indebted European nations like Greece and Italy are making it
more expensive for banks to fund themselves in short-term
funding markets.
 U.S. bank debt costs are also being pressured in unsecured
bond markets. The cost for interbank borrowing -- measured by
three-month Libor, or the London interbank offered rate -- rose
to 0.31178 percentage point on Tuesday.
 European banks are facing higher dollar funding costs as
U.S. money fund investors, nervous about exposure to peripheral
euro zone countries, reduce the length and amount of loans to
banks in the region.
 The Thomson Reuters Peripheral Euro Zone Banks Index

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied, oil rose
and the dollar fell on Tuesday as dismal U.S. data increased
hopes the Federal Reserve may offer more economic stimulus.
 A magnitude 5.9 earthquake that struck the U.S. East Coast
and Canada and forced some evacuation of buildings caused some
market jitters, with U.S. stocks briefly paring gains. However,
no major damage or injuries were reported. For details, see
[ID:nN1E77M1DF]
 It was the second day of gains for stocks after four weeks
of losses. Financial markets have been in turmoil for the past
month on concerns the United States may be headed for another
recession and as the euro zone's debt crisis has worsened.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> and Wall Street's benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 index <.SPX> are on track for their worst month
since 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index jumped 1.7 percent, while
the S&P 500 gained 3 percent. Data from China showing factory
sentiment was not as weak as expected helped boost world shares
overnight.
 In the latest disappointing news on the U.S. economy,
factory output in the U.S. central Atlantic region contracted
again in August and new home sales fell to a five-month low in
July. [ID:nN1E77M0M4]
 Equity investors are taking a ""bad news is good news""
approach, though, betting that the data may spur more action
from the Fed. Stocks staged a rally in the fourth quarter of
last year, when the Fed announced a $600 billion bond-buying
program.
 ""People are putting money on the Fed saying something and
buying stocks ahead,"" said King Lip, chief investment officer
at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.
 There is concern, however, that investors are overly
optimistic, and many strategists have noted the U.S. economy
has improved since a year ago.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his speech on Friday at a
central banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a
new monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on
Tuesday on better-than-expected German and Chinese factory data
which eased worries about global growth and on expectations the
Federal Reserve may ease policy further to stimulate a flagging
U.S. economy.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will speak at the central bank's
annual retreat in Wyoming on Friday. At last year's speech, he
prepared markets for a $600 billion bond-buying program.
 Such measures increase the amount of dollars in the system,
driving down the currency's value, which helps U.S. exports,
and prompting investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. U.S.
stocks, under pressure since late July, rallied on Tuesday.
 ""There is growing expectation, or rather hope,"" that
Bernanke's speech ""may contain some reference to a potential
third round of quantitative easing,"" said Samarjit Shankar,
managing director of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in
Boston.
 ""However, we would continue to caution that risk appetite
remains very tentative for now as global growth stalls and
further monetary stimulus via potential QE3 in the U.S. may not
materialize given underlying price pressures.""
 The euro last traded up 0.4 percent at $1.4414 
after climbing as high as $1.45 on trading platform EBS, the
top of a tight $1.40-$1.45 range that has held firm since early
July.
 Europe's debt and banking crisis has had some investors
wondering whether the European Central Bank would soon have to
adopt some monetary easing of its own, but a solid German
manufacturing index eased some of those fears. For details, see
[ID:nL5E7JM0VJ].
 The German data, taken with a report showing China's
factory sector held up better than expected in August, helped
investors overlook a separate report showing a sharp fall in
German economic sentiment. [ID:nL4E7JM2D] [ID:nL5E7JN0Q0]
 Commodity-linked, growth-sensitive currencies such as the
Australian and New Zealand dollars gained ground.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $1.0480 .
Strong Australian-Chinese trade links make the Aussie sensitive
to Chinese economic data. The New Zealand dollar jumped 1.1
percent to $0.8329 .
 INTERVENTION STILL ON RADAR
 Investors remained wary that the Swiss National Bank could
reenter markets to curb recent franc strength. The euro had
climbed as high as 1.1430 francs earlier and was last up 0.5
percent at 1.1404 francs .
 The SNB has cut interest rates to zero, flooded the banking
system with francs and intervened in the forward market to make
returns on francs less attractive to potential investors.
 Some of that appeared to be working. In the options market,
implied volatility in euro/Swiss  dipped below 18
percent from 20 percent on Monday as tighter ranges in spot
suggested the recent SNB measures were taking effect.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 76.66 yen , although
market players remained wary of yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities.
 Bank of Japan data suggested Japan sold roughly 4.5
trillion yen in currency intervention on Aug. 4, its biggest
one-day yen-selling intervention ever. [ID:nT9E7J2068]
 But the yen ended up rising back to levels seen before
intervention a few days later, thanks largely to hedge fund
buying, said Citigroup analyst Todd Elmer in New York.
 A mild earthquake that shook parts of the U.S. East Coast
had little impact on the currency market.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks jumped and the
dollar fell on Tuesday as dismal U.S. data spurred hopes the
Federal Reserve may offer more economic stimulus.
 Financial markets have been in turmoil over the past month
on concerns the United States may be headed for another
recession and as the euro zone's debt crisis has worsened.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, and Wall Street's benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 index <.SPX> are on track for their worst month
since 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index jumped 1.7 percent, while
the S&P 500 gained more than 2 percent. Data from China showing
factory sentiment was not as weak as expected helped boost
world shares overnight.
 In the latest disappointing news on the U.S. economy,
factory output in the U.S. central Atlantic region contracted
again in August and new home sales fell to a five-month low in
July. For details, see [ID:nN1E77M0M4]
 Equity investors are taking a ""bad news is good news""
approach, though, betting that the data may spur more action
from the Fed. Stocks staged a rally in the fourth quarter of
last year, when the Fed announced a $600 billion bond-buying
program.
 ""People are putting money on the Fed saying something and
buying stocks ahead,"" said King Lip, chief investment officer
at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.
 There is concern, however, that investors are overly
optimistic, and many strategists have noted the U.S. economy
has improved since a year ago.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a central
banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new
monetary offensive to support a faltering U.S. economy.
 Bernanke, however, is most likely to outline gradualist
measures, which would disappoint those looking for a big bang
approach such as a fresh round of bond buying, known as QE3.
 ""The market is really geared up for the idea of additional
asset purchases to at least be put on the table when Bernanke
speaks,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey. ""I'm not sure it will play out that
way, but that's what the market is betting on now.""
 The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank
could tweak the Fed's balance sheet as a means to put further
pressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor them
at low levels. These could be implemented in September and
October at coming Fed meetings. [ID:nN1E77I0NF]

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro advanced on Tuesday
as German and Chinese factory data relieved some worries about
a slowdown in global growth, while world stocks rose.
 Bank of America  and other financials weighed on
U.S. stocks shortly after the opening, with Bank of America shares, down 2.5 percent at $6.26, at one point hitting their
lowest level since March 2009.
 Focus also remained on whether the Federal Reserve could
offer more economic stimulus. U.S. bond prices were lower.
 Although euro zone and Chinese PMI data showed economic
activity was likely to slow, they indicated there was still
some growth. For details see [ID:nL4E7JN0JB], [ID:nL9E7I401I]

 By Nia Williams and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday after
better-than-expected German manufacturing data outweighed a
dismal reading of investor sentiment, although gains looked
limited as the overall gloomy outlook for global growth
persisted.	
 The single currency rose 0.9 percent on the day to $1.4500
, also boosted by a rally in European shares. The euro
recovered from initial selling after the influential ZEW index
showed German economic sentiment fell to -37.6 in August, far
below forecasts of a -25.0 reading. 
 Traders said real money accounts were seen buying euros
while others in the market cited demand from Asian sovereign
names, although an options barrier at $1.4500 and stop-loss
orders suspected around $1.4550 capped further gains in the
single currency.	
 Investors chose to focus on a flash manufacturing activity
PMI for Germany that stayed at 52.0 in August, reassuring some
market players who thought it could fall below 50 and signal a
contraction. .	
 ""The scenario doesn't look bright, but the fact that German
manufacturing activity was unchanged ... and euro zone services
and composite PMIs were also close to unchanged was not a bad
return in view of the headwinds we've been seeing of late,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC.	
 ""The data hasn't proven to be as worrying as feared, and
that more than offsets the short-term impact of the ZEW.""	
 Analysts said the latest manufacturing activity data was
seen as a key gauge of whether the euro zone's deepening
sovereign debt crisis, which in recent weeks has spread from the
periphery to the core economies of Italy and Spain, is weighing
on broader economic growth.	
 Spurred also by a 1.2 percent rise in European shares
, improving demand for riskier currencies dented the
dollar, knocking it 0.6 percent lower versus a currency basket
to 73.667. 
 The dollar has been on the back foot ahead of a speech by
Federal Reserve President Ben Bernanke on Friday at the U.S.
central bank's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.	
 Investors are keen to see if the Fed will signal more
measures to stimulate the struggling economy. Speculation of a
possible third round of quantitative easing has pressured the
dollar lower in past months.	
 Commodity currencies climbed after the Chinese Purchasing
Managers' Index data turned out to be not as bad as some had
feared, reassuring investors that demand for commodities would
continue. 
 ""Asia has been the driver of global growth, so if Asia stays
strong that will really help global markets,"" said Steven
Saywell, head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas. 
 The Australian dollar was last trading 1.1 percent higher at
US$1.0500 , while the New Zealand dollar rose
1.1 percent to US$0.8324.	
 
 WARY OF INTERVENTION 
 The euro rose 0.6 percent versus the safe-haven Swiss franc
to 1.1418 francs , with investors still cautious of
more action from the Swiss National Bank to curb the franc's
strength.	
 In the options market, implied volatility in euro/Swiss
dipped to around 18 percent from 20 percent on Monday
as tighter ranges in spot suggested the recent
liquidity measures implemented by the SNB are taking effect.	
 The SNB has cut interest rates to zero, flooded the banking
system with francs and intervened in the forward market to make
returns on francs more unattractive to potential investors.	
 The dollar dipped 0.4 percent against the yen to
76.57 yen , although market players remained wary of
yen-selling intervention by Japanese authorities, in the wake of
the dollar's drop to a record low around 75.94 yen late last
week.	
 Bank of Japan money market data suggests Japan sold roughly
4.5 trillion yen in currency intervention on Aug. 4, its biggest
one-day yen-selling intervention ever. 
 But the yen ended up rising back to levels seen before
intervention a few days later, and Citi analysts said long yen
positioning by hedge funds would keep the dollar under downward
pressure even as Japan threatens to keep selling its currency. 
 The latest IMM data shows an ongoing rise in net long yen
positions -- bets the currency will rise -- and the analysts
said the bank's hedge fund positioning data shows the reduction
in net long positions since intervention has been limited
compared with a cut in other currencies versus the dollar.	
 ""With a slight lag, rises in USDJPY have been met with JPY
buying by hedge funds,"" analyst Todd Elmer said. ""This build-up
in long JPY positioning and tendency among investors to buy on
dips suggests that intervention has thus far been an ineffective
deterrent.""

 By Dominic Lau	
 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks, the euro and
commodities rose on Tuesday, after gauges of Chinese and euro
zone economic activity came in less gloomy than feared,
encouraging investors to dip back into the market after a recent
sharp selloff on global growth concerns.	
 Although the euro zone and Chinese PMI data showed economic
activity was likely to slow, they indicated there was still some
growth. 
 Hopes of more stimulus from the U.S. central bank also
buoyed markets, which shrugged off much weaker-than-expected
readings of the ZEW business sentiment index for Germany, the
single currency bloc's largest economy. 
 ""Any data that just hints that the world is not ending is
going to be well received by the markets,"" Ian Richards,
European equity strategist at RBS, said.	
 Financial markets have stabilised in the past two sessions
after a few weeks of turmoil amid mounting fears of a new global
crash to match that of 2008.	
 U.S. stock index futures    climbed 1.2 to
1.4 percent, indicating a firm start on Wall Street.	
 Gold retreated more than 1 percent, after punching
another record high in Asia at $1,911.46 an ounce, as investors
dipped into riskier assets, while oil prices held steady, with
Brent crude  above $108.50 a barrel, as government
loyalists in Libya staged a fight back.	
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
advanced 0.9 percent on Tuesday, leaving the
benchmark down more than 12 percent this month and looking
likely to post its biggest monthly percentage drop since October
2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.	
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.2 percent,
extending the previous session's 0.8 percent rise, while Tokyo's
Nikkei average ended 1.2 percent higher.	
 Some investors were also hoping the U.S. Federal Reserve
would flag further stimulus when central bankers gather in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, late this week, a year after Chairman Ben
Bernanke launched a second round of a government bond buying
programme, known as quantitative easing, to revive the economy.	
 St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Japan's Nikkei
newspaper that the Fed could buy more bonds or make a commitment
on the size of its balance sheet if the economy weakens and
deflation reappears, but said the time was not yet right for
such moves. 
 ""Many of the gains being seen here seem to be coming off the
expectation that the Fed will serve up further stimulus
measures, possibly as soon as the end of this week,"" said
Cameron Peacock, market analyst at IG Markets.	
 ""Clearly with this being priced in, failure to deliver here
will see traders heading for the exits once again.""

 
 LESS GLOOMY FOR NOW	
 For now, investors seemed to be prepared to chase riskier
assets again, putting worries about a possible global recession
and the euro zone sovereign debt crisis on the back burner.	
 The euro was up 0.8 percent at $1.4469 on Tuesday,
while the Australian dollar edged 0.9 percent higher to
$1.0494.	
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 76.58 yen , still
holding above a record low of 75.94 yen struck late last week as
market players were wary of any yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities.	
 The U.S. currency has lost 5.6 percent against the yen this
year and more than 15 percent versus the Swiss franc , as
investors sought safety.	
 ""Japanese officials continue to express concern about yen
strength, with the volume only likely to build ahead of the
Democratic Party of Japan leadership election expected on
Monday,"" BNP Paribas said in a note.	
 ""Accordingly, we continue to see intervention risk build as
the week progresses, even if from a market point of view there
seems little to argue for intervention just ahead of Jackson
Hole.""	
 Copper gained 1.7 percent to trade above $8,800 a
tonne, rebounding on relief that PMI data showed China's economy
is slowing only slightly. 
 Yields on 10-year benchmark German Bunds rose
4.4 basis points to 2.145 percent.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Ian Chua	
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro edged
higher on Tuesday but could come under pressure if euro
zone manufacturing data point to more downside risk in a market
already fretting about a global recession.	
 The Australian dollar clawed higher after a gauge of
Chinese manufacturing was not as weak as some had feared, and
was last up 0.6 percent on the day at $1.0460 . 
 HSBC's China flash Purchasing Managers' Index showed
the Chinese factory sector may have slowed slightly in August
for a second straight month. The reading, however, still edged
up to 49.8 in August, better than July's final reading.

 There had been vague market rumours earlier that the
China flash PMI might turn out to be much weaker. 
 The market's focus now turns to flash PMI data for Germany,
France and the euro zone due later in the day for clues on
whether the region's deepening debt crisis is weighing on
broader economic growth.	
 ""The current stabilisation in risk is conditional on
European PMIs not disappointing sharply. Weaker growth in
Germany would lead the market to think that help for peripheral
Europe will be harder to come back,"" warned Sebastien Galy,
analyst at Societe Generale.	
 The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.4370 , with
support in the $1.4340-45 area, where traders said there are
some buy orders lurking. 
 Lower down, there is talk of good bids at $1.4260 to
$1.4270, right around support at last Friday's intraday low near
$1.4259, while selling interest starts from $1.4420 with more
selling interest at $1.4450. 
 Not helping the common currency is the ongoing public
squabbling between the bloc's member states on how to tackle the
region's debt problems.	
 Germany's Angela Merkel is facing growing domestic criticism
of her euro zone policies, with the Bundesbank slamming an
anti-crisis package she agreed to in Brussels last month and a
senior ally warning he would vote against key parts of it.

 
 WARY OF INTERVENTION 
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 76.81 yen
. 
 Market players are wary of any yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities, in the wake of the dollar's drop to a
record low around 75.94 yen late last week. 
 Since dollar/yen bounced around 3 yen from intraday lows the
last time Japan conducted yen-selling intervention on Aug. 4,
market players reckon that the dollar may get a similar lift if
Japanese authorities were to step in again.	
 Any dollar bounce in the event of intervention is likely to
be met by strong dollar selling interest at levels around 79 yen
to 80 yen, market players say.	
 ""We think it's going to be very, very difficult for the MOF
to get a real successful intervention. There's just a wall of
offers,"" said Rob Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in
Singapore, referring to Japan's Ministry of Finance, which is in
charge of currency intervention.	
 Although intervention may spur dollar short-covering by
trend-following commodity trading advisors, Japanese exporters
and retail investors are likely to sell into any dollar bounce,
Ryan said, adding that some hedge funds have already positioned
themselves for possible intervention. 
 ""We've seen some of the macro players turn around and go
long dollar/yen, or take off their shorts because they're
effectively waiting for the MOF to come in and to give them
better levels to go short again,"" he said.	
 ""It means first of all, the MOF is not going to get the big
short-covering from these accounts if they do intervene, and
secondly they're going to run into offers pretty quickly,""
Ryan said.	
 Bank of Japan money market data suggests Japan sold roughly
4.5 trillion yen in currency intervention on Aug. 4, its biggest
one-day yen-selling intervention ever. 
 But the yen ended up rising back to levels seen before the
intervention a few days later.	
 Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in Singapore,
said intervention may prove more effective if Japan were to
shift toward repeated small-scale intervention, but added that
such a switch in tactics was unlikely. 
 ""If they were to engage in repeated interventions, they
would likely face very stiff criticism from international
policymakers,"" Elmer said.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - European shares were set
to follow Asian gains on Tuesday after a survey of Chinese
factory output soothed fears of a hard landing for the world's
No.2 economy, but gold hit a record on persistent concerns about
the health of the developed world. 
 Asian markets took heart from HSBC's China flash purchasing
managers' index (PMI), which, although showing the factory
sector was likely to slow slightly for a second consecutive
month in August, indicated the motor of the global economy in
recent years was still growing robustly.	
 ""It suggests there's still plenty going on and it's business
as usual,"" said Martin Angel, a dealer at Patersons Securities
in Australia.	
 European stock index futures pointed to gains, with
futures for the Euro STOXX 50  up 0.8 percent, Germany's
DAX  up 1 percent and France's CAC  up 0.8
percent, while financial bookmakers called London's FTSE 100
up around 0.5 percent . 
 World stocks remain deep in negative territory for the
month, with MSCI's all-country world index about
19 percent below its May high. 
 The euro firmed a touch but remained vulnerable as
traders awaited flash PMI data for Germany, France and the euro
zone, with a weak number likely to exacerbate fears about the
region.	
 
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.2 percent
on Tuesday, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific
shares outside Japan gained 2 percent .

 The MSCI index is down nearly 14 percent for the
month, and about 18 percent below its April high. A
decline of 20 percent or more is the rule-of-thumb definition of
a bear market.	
 World stocks have been tumbling since the beginning of
August -- and perceived safe havens such as gold, U.S.
Treasuries and Japanese government bonds have rallied -- on
fears of a slide back into recession for the United States and
growing concerns that Europe's politicians are failing to
contain its sovereign debt crisis.	
 ""Today's gain is likely a technical rebound, with the lack
of political momentum from the United States and Europe on
resolutions to their economic issues leaving investors with
little conviction,"" said Han Chi-hwan, a market analyst at
Daewoo Securities in Seoul.	
 
 HARD LANDING UNLIKELY	
 Most markets extended gains after the Chinese flash PMI from
HSBC, designed to preview China's factory output before official
data, which showed the index edging up to 49.8 in August from
July's final reading of 49.3. 
 That left the index just below the 50-point mark that
separates expansion from contraction, but HSBC itself believes a
reading as low as 48.0 in China would still point to annual
growth of 12-13 in industrial output and 9 percent in GDP.	
 ""Risks of a hard landing are still remote,"" said Qu Hongbin,
an economist at HSBC.	
 There had earlier been vague market rumours that the
number would be much weaker. 
 The Australian dollar , which is sensitive to
expectations of Chinese demand for Australia's commodities such
as iron ore and coal, rose to stand up 0.6 percent on the
day around $1.0465. 
 London metal exchange copper rose 1
percent , although Shanghai futures  were weaker.

 Resource stocks were prominent amongst the gainers and S&P
500 futures rose 0.9 percent , pointing to
Monday's tentative rally on Wall Street continuing. 
 But many investors remained pessimistic about the outlook
for rich world economies, particularly the euro zone, where the
big fear is that the debt crisis that has swamped Greece,
Portugal and Ireland will spread to bigger, harder to save
economies such as Spain or Italy.	
 Spot gold soared to the latest in a succession of
all-time highs above $1,910 an ounce and was on course for its
biggest monthly rise in 29 years.	
 ""We are not hearing much good news out of Europe or the
United States,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Investec Australia. 
 ""For the time being investors are happy looking at gold as
safe haven in these troubled times, and will continue to do so
until we see something positive and sustainable.""	
 U.S. crude oil  gained 0.8 percent to around
$85.10 a barrel , after falling on Monday on hopes that
Libyan exports would restart soon as the country's six-month-old
civil war neared an end with rebel troops entering Tripoli. 
 ""It could take months before oil can start to flow again
from Libya,"" said John Vautrain, a director at energy consulting
firm Purvin & Gurtz. 
""I think there was a lot of euphoria on Monday. But the whole
country is not completely pacified yet and we don't have an
organised government. A lot is lacking.""	
 
 EURO ZONE DATA DUE	
 The euro traded around $1.4380 , up a little on
the day but below Monday's high around $1.4434, as markets
awaited flash PMI surveys from the euro zone's big economies.

 ""The current stabilisation in risk is conditional on
European PMIs not disappointing sharply,"" warned Sebastien Galy,
analyst at Societe Generale.	
 ""Weaker growth in Germany would lead the market to think
that help for peripheral Europe will be harder to come back."" 
 The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was a
touch weaker at 74.031, but off Monday's low of 73.814 .	
 Worries about more action from Swiss and Japanese
authorities to weaken their currencies helped support the dollar
index.	
 Against the yen, the dollar was at 76.75 yen , off a
record low around 75.94 set last Friday. The Swiss franc traded
at 0.7880 francs , having carved out a slim trading band
between 0.7800 and 0.8000.	
 Japanese government bonds eased after their rally of recent
months, with September 10-year futures <2JGBv1> falling
0.22 point to 142.55, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose 2.5
basis points to 1.010 percent .

 SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up on
Tuesday after modest gains on Wall Street, but remained deep in
negative territory for the month, while gold hit another record
above $1,900 an ounce as investors continued to fret about the
health of the global economy.	
 The euro was under pressure as traders awaited flash

 Spot gold soared to the latest in a succession of

 The softer euro helped the dollar index , which tracks
the U.S. currency's performance against a basket of major

 Worries about more action from Swiss and Japanese

as Wall Street shares managed slight gains and investors look to the Federal Reserve for action to stimulate the U.S. economy.
 
EUR/USD hit 1.4356 in early Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since August 21; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4362, rising 0.03%.
 
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4260, last Friday’s low, and resistance at 1.4518, last Wednesday’s high.
 
U.S. stocks finished the day higher, ending a two-day losing streak with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.34%, to close at 10,854.70, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.15% to 2,345.38, and the S&P 500 eked out a 0.03% rise to 1,123.82.

In early Asian trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.01% to hit 1.4357.
Financial issues played center stage in Monday trade on Wall Street, with JPMorgan Chase falling 2.7% and Bank of America tumbling by 7.9%.  U.S. bank issues continue to suffer as they are seen as most vulnerable to the European debt crisis. 
By the end of the U.S. trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.34%, to close at 10,854.70, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.15% to 2,345.38, and the S&P 500 eked out a 0.03% rise to 1,123.82.
Earlier Monday, Credit Suisse reduced its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 1,100 from its previous forecast of 1,275.
The S&P 500 has lost 18% since hitting a three-year high on April 29. Weak manufacturing numbers, a drop in consumer confidence and persistent unemployment at above 9% have all contributed to a lack of confidence in the performance of U.S. equities.
Meanwhile, the greenback was down against the British pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.04% to 1.6462. 
The dollar was higher against the Japanese yen but down against the Swiss franc with USD/JPY adding 0.06% to hit 76.84, and USD/CHF lower by 0.08% to hit 0.7896. 
The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD up 0.01% to hit 0.9905, AUD/USD lower by 0.08% to hit 1.0400, and NZD/USD falling 0.11% to hit 0.8230.

 * U.S. stocks end up slightly in volatile session
 * Brent crude oil falls on hopes for end to Libya conflict
 * Gold sets record high again near $1,900 an ounce
(Updates with U.S. market closes)
 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks struggled to end
barely higher on Monday after four weeks of losses, while Brent
crude prices slipped on prospects Libya's civil war will soon
end and restore oil exports from the north African country.
 Traditional safe-haven gold hit a third consecutive
all-time high near $1,900 after staging its biggest weekly gain
in 2-1/2 years last week.
 Sharp volatility in stocks, which has marked trading in
recent weeks, underscored investor nervousness.
 The turmoil largely reflects persistent worries that the
United States may fall back into recession, as well as the
threat that sovereign debt problems in euro zone peripheral
countries could spread to the larger economies.
 Shares of financial companies, seen as most vulnerable to
the debt crisis in Europe, underperformed other sectors.
JPMorgan Chase  fell 2.7 percent to $33.41 and was the
top drag on the Dow, followed by Bank of America , down
7.9 percent at $6.42.
 The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one
another rose again, heading back toward their highest levels
since late 2008 as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to
European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt
crisis. For details, see [ID:nL5E7JM1B5]
 ""The ground zero of all worries is financials,"" said
Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based
Fort Pitt Capital Group.
 Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a
central banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a
new monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy.
[ID:nN1E77I0NF]
 That helped support stocks and gold but weigh on U.S. bond
prices.
 Bernanke, however, is most likely to outline gradualist
measures, which would disappoint those looking for a big-bang
approach such as a fresh round of bond buying, known as QE3.
 The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank
could tweak the Fed's balance sheet as a means to put further
pressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor them
at low levels. These could be implemented in September and
October at coming Fed meetings.
 ""The Fed is definitely on people's minds, and you could
argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity
currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy
measures,"" said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in
New York.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
gained 37.00 points, or 0.34 percent, at 10,854.65. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 0.29 point, or 0.03
percent, at 1,123.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added
3.54 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,345.38.
 The S&P, which on Friday posted a fourth week of losses, is
down 16.4 percent since July 22, roughly when the recent
sell-off began.
 For the day, shares of large-cap technology companies
outperformed most other shares, with IBM  leading gains
on the Dow. IBM was up 0.9 percent at $158.98. Shares of
Hewlett-Packard  rose 3.6 percent to $24.45 after its
sharp losses last week.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
rose 0.8 percent to close at 916.78.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> ended down 0.1
percent after fluctuating between negative and positive
territory for much of the day. The index has fallen for five
weeks in a row and appears headed for its worst monthly
performance since October 2008, when markets were reeling after

strongest one-week rise since February 2009.
 ""Gold is driven by the expectation that at some point
inflation will come back, and a continuation of people looking
for a safe haven beside just the U.S. Treasury bonds,"" said Leo
Larkin, metals equity analyst at Standard & Poor's.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against some
commodity-linked currencies on Monday as investors speculated
the Federal Reserve could take new measures to boost the U.S.
economy, lifting appetite for riskier assets.
 The euro wobbled against the dollar for fear the European
Union was moving too slowly to address its debt and banking
crisis, while Swiss authorities tried to drive down the franc.
 The Fed will host its annual retreat in Wyoming this week,
and recent market turmoil and signs of weaker U.S. growth have
boosted expectations Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke may hint at more
emergency stimulus for the economy.
 At last year's meeting Bernanke hinted at what eventually
became a $600 billion 'quantitative easing' bond-buying
program, known as QE2.
 ""The Fed is definitely on people's minds, and you could
argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity
currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy
measures,"" said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in
New York.
 The Australian dollar  was last up 0.2 percent at
$1.0414. The New Zealand dollar  rose 1 percent to
$0.8241 while the greenback slipped 0.1 percent to 0.9894
Canadian dollar .
 Fed easing increases the amount of dollars in the system,
pushing down the currency's value and U.S. interest rates. That
encourages investors to seek higher returns in stocks or other
currencies. But some analysts said Bernanke may hold off on
aggressive easing plans. For more see [ID:nN1E77I0NF].
 Karl Schamotta, senior market strategist at Western Union
Business Solutions in Calgary, said that with the financial
system already awash with cheap money, providing additional
liquidity is extremely risky. In addition, the markets are
already doing the central bank's work by pushing Treasury
yields to shockingly low levels.
 ""Investors looking for a third round of large-scale asset
purchases are likely to be disappointed,"" he said. ""Those
looking for another injection of cheap liquidity may express
their disappointment by pushing short yields and the dollar
upward.""
 The latest positioning data shows speculators increased
their bets against the dollar last week. [IMM/FX]
 The euro  traded down 0.2 percent at $1.4361. Concern
about the European debt crisis rose after German Chancellor
Angela Merkel on Sunday rebuffed calls for joint
euro-denominated bonds as a way for fiscally weak euro zone
countries to borrow. [ID:nL5E7JJ3MN]
 SWISSIE, YEN IN SPOTLIGHT
 The euro and dollar edged up against the Swiss franc
 . Traders said the Swiss National Bank
intervened in the one-month forward market to deter investors
from buying the currency   [ID:nL5E7JM0SD].
The SNB declined comment.
 The euro  traded 0.4 percent higher at 1.1346
francs. The franc has soared to record highs against both
currencies as fear about Europe's debt crisis and the U.S.
economy pushed investors toward the traditional safe haven. A
strong franc hurts Swiss exports and tourism.
 The dollar rose slightly against the yen but remained near
its all-time low, last trading at 76.78 yen .
 Credit Suisse currency strategists said that while ""the
risk of intervention seems to be rising, we think the main
impact would be to slow rather than stop yen appreciation.""
 Those looking for a more fairly valued safe-haven currency
should consider Norway's crown, said Lena Komileva, global head
of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 Norway's fiscal stimulus sets it apart from indebted
countries that are being forced into austerity programs, while
a tight labor market should preclude near-term rate cuts.
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 5.4505 crowns .

 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Stock markets rebounded on
Monday as investors snapped up shares after recent selling made
them look attractive, while Brent crude prices slipped on
prospects Libya's civil war will soon end.
 Even as investors waded into riskier markets after a very
tough August, traditional safe-haven gold hit a third
consecutive all-time high near $1,900 after staging its biggest
weekly gain in 2-1/2 years last week.
 Speculation that the Federal Reserve could take new
measures to boost the U.S. economy helped support Wall Street
stocks and gold after four weeks of losses but weighed on U.S.
bond prices.
 Talk of possible new Fed stimulus follows weeks of market
turmoil and persistent worries that the United States may fall
back into recession. The threat that sovereign debt problems in
euro zone peripheral countries could spread to the larger
economies also contributed to volatility.
 ""The Fed is definitely on people's minds, and you could
argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity

 Brent crude  settled at $108.36, down 26 cents on
the Libya news For more, see: [ID:nL5E7JL0LD]. But U.S. crude
oil  settled higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Crude for September delivery expired and settled at $84.12 a
barrel, up $1.86, or 2.26 percent.
 ""A resolution of the conflict is modestly bearish for crude
oil prices, but it is less likely that we will get a $10-$20
drop in price of crude,"" Jason Schenker, president at Prestige
Economics LLC in Austin, Texas, said in a note.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 89.76 points, or 0.83 percent, at 10,907.41. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 5.65 points, or 0.50 percent, at
1,129.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 12.43

 Even with the day's bounce, sharp volatility in the market
underscored nervousness among investors.
 The S&P has fallen more than 12 percent so far in August
and is down 16 percent since July 22, roughly when the recent
sell-off began.
 ""The rebound is pretty much focused on buying into some of
the safer issues,"" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco. Shares of large-cap
technology companies outperformed other shares, with IBM
 leading gains on the Dow. IBM was up 1.2 percent at
$159.42.
 Financials, seen as most vulnerable to the crisis in
Europe, underperformed other sectors. Shares of JPMorgan Chase
, were down 2.3 percent at $33.54 and the top drag on
the Dow, followed by Bank of America , down 6.3 percent
at $6.53.
 The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one
another rose again, heading back toward their highest levels
since late 2008 as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to
European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt
crisis. [ID:nL5E7JM1B5]
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was flat. The

 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures fell on
Monday as Libya's civil war moved closer to an end, suggesting
oil exports would resume soon, while stock markets bounced back

 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil fell on Monday
as Libya's civil war appeared to be nearing an end, while gold
rallied to another record high as economic worries kept
investors flocking to the commodity.
 Stocks pared early gains and were near flat in midday U.S.
trading, with financials among the hardest hit. In the United
States, shares of JPMorgan Chase , down 1.6 percent at
$33.79, were the top drag on the Dow industrials, followed by
Bank of America , down 6.3 percent at $6.53.

 Banks are seen as most vulnerable to the crisis in Europe.
An early bounce in U.S. stocks following four weeks of losses

 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped and world
stocks rose on Monday above recent 11-month lows on hopes the
conflict in Libya could be ending as energy shares moved higher
after last week's equity market selloff.
 U.S. stocks jumped at the open, led by Exxon Mobil Corp
, which rose 2 percent. Investors, however, offset buys
of risky assets by continuing to buy gold. Persistent worries
that the sovereign debt crisis in euro zone peripheral
countries may spread to bigger economies in the region
encouraged flows into gold, pushing it to another record high.

 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped against
commodity-linked currencies on Monday as some investors
speculated the Federal Reserve would take new measures to boost
the ailing U.S. economy, while Swiss authorities moved to drive
down the franc.
 The Fed will host its annual retreat in Wyoming this week,
and recent market turmoil and signs of weaker U.S. growth have
fed expectations that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke may hint at
more emergency stimulus for the economy.
 At last year's meeting Bernanke hinted at what eventually
became a $600 billion 'quantitative easing' bond-buying
program, known as QE2.
 ""The Fed is definitely on people's minds, and you could
argue that some of the bounce seen in high-yield commodity
currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy
measures,"" said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in
New York.
 Others anticipate Bernanke will highlight the need to
continue supporting the economy, but may stop short of
announcing more asset buying. For more see [ID:nN1E77I0NF].
 Bernanke could be the ""game changer"" for the market this
week, said Ulrich Leuchtmann, strategist at Commerzbank.
 Fed easing increases the amount of dollars in the system,
pushing down the currency's value and U.S. interest rates. That
encourages investors to seek higher returns in stocks or
currencies that carry higher interest rates.
 Among the best performers Monday were the Australian dollar
, up 0.6 percent at $1.0454, and the New Zealand dollar
, up 1.2 percent at $0.8266.
 The euro  traded 0.2 percent higher at $1.4424,
supported by a 1.3 percent rise in European shares <.FTEU3>.

their bets against the dollar last week. [IMM/FX]
 ""QE3 would probably lead to further dismay among foreign
investors and selling of dollars,"" Citigroup strategists said
in a note to clients.
 SNB INVOLVED, YEN EYED
 The euro and dollar also rose against the Swiss franc
 . Traders said the Swiss National Bank
intervened in the one-month forward market to drive down the
forward rate and deter investors from buying the currency
  [ID:nL5E7JM0SD]. The SNB declined
comment.
 The euro  traded 0.6 percent higher on the day
against the Swiss franc at 1.1370 francs. Its one-month forward
interest rate adjustment  was around -27.00,
falling towards roughly -30.40 hit last week.
 The franc has soared to record highs against both
currencies as fear about Europe's debt crisis and the U.S.
economy pushed investors toward the traditional safe haven.
 To slow franc appreciation, the SNB has mentioned the
possibility of pegging it to the euro. Investors remain on edge
that the central bank could sell francs on the spot market,
though attempts to weaken the franc this way in 2010 failed.
 Traders also speculated that Japan could intervene to
weaken the yen. Though up slightly from Friday, the dollar was
not far from its all-time low, trading at 76.75 yen .
 But Credit Suisse currency strategists said that while ""the
risk of intervention seems to be rising, we think the main
impact would be to slow rather than stop yen appreciation.""
 The euro's gains were limited though by continued worries
about the euro zone debt crisis and the perception that
officials were moving too slowly to address problems.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday rebuffed calls
for joint euro-denominated bonds as a way for fiscally weak
euro zone countries to borrow. [ID:nL5E7JJ3MN]
 ""If things start to take a turn for the worse in the euro
zone, it's hard to see what they can come up with to help,""
said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - World stocks held above a recent
11-month low on Monday while oil prices slipped as investors
concerned about a global economic downturn stayed away from
buying risky assets.	
 In Europe, shares bounced back as hopes of an end to the
conflict in Libya pushed energy shares higher and a recent sharp
selloff encouraged investors back into the market.	
 European stocks were up 1.3 percent, as a 1 percent
rise in U.S. stock futures  indicated Wall Street would
open higher.	
 Investors, however, were in no mood to aggressively buy
risky assets. Persistent worries that the sovereign debt crisis
in euro zone peripheral countries may spread to bigger economies
in the region continued to encourage safe-haven flows into gold,
pushing it to another record high .	
 The benchmark MSCI index of world stocks has now fallen for
five weeks in a row and looks to be heading for its worst
monthly performance since October 2008, when markets were
reeling after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.	
 ""I am sure that there are some bargain hunters active in the
market. Equities might gain some momentum as the week
progresses,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin
Dolphin. 
 ""But if the market has to sustain the rebound, it has to
have some cyclical sectors such as banks and mining behind it.
Defensives tend to steady the markets, but I am not sure that
they help to lead to a sustainable path for a rebound."" 
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.7 percent
at one point before erasing most losses.	
 Emerging stocks lost 0.3 percent with losses led
by Shanghai shares which hit a 13-month low.	
 ""A bigger concern is a slowdown in China's economy. We
haven't reached that stage yet, but the equity market could be
pricing that in, just in case,"" said Lee Wee-Liat, regional head
of property at Samsung Securities. 
 Beyond the short-term bounce, the equity market faces
headwinds from the weakening outlook for earnings, especially in
Europe.	
 According to Thomson Reuters data, analysts made more cuts
than upgrades to their profit forecasts in the last month,
pushing the earnings momentum for the STOXX Europe 600
companies to -11.88 percent from -6.8 percent a month ago. 
 U.S. Brent crude oil  fell 1.3 percent. On top of a
weak economic outlook, the potential for a restart of Libyan oil
flows into the market if the Gaddafi regime collapses also
weighed on prices.	
 Bund futures  fell 35 ticks.	
 Gold hit a third consecutive all-time high near $1,900 an
ounce, after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2-1/2 years last
week.	
 The euro rose 0.3 percent. The dollar held above a
record low around 75.94 yen hit on Friday, thanks to
concerns about intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 The U.S. currency fell 0.1 percent against a basket
of major currencies.	
 Investors are waiting to see whether the Federal Reserve
flags further stimulus when bankers gather in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, late this week, a year after Chairman Ben Bernanke
launched a second round of quantitative easing to revive the
economy. 
 Additional bond purchases by the Fed could help reflate
asset prices, but many view the chances of a third round of
quantitative easing as limited and expect the Fed to take
gradual measures to boost the economy.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - European stocks extended
four weeks of losses on Monday, tracking jittery Asian shares
lower, while gold shot to new highs as investors worried about
the sluggish U.S. economic outlook and Europe's festering debt
crisis. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
fell 0.7 percent in early trade, tracking Friday's losses on
Wall Street on worries that the U.S. economy may slide back into
recession. 
 Spot gold prices rose more than 1 percent to a record
$1,882.20 per ounce as the shaky global outlook
prompted investors to move more money into safe havens, while
oil prices tumbled on hopes Libya may resume full output soon as
a six-month civil war seemed to be nearing an end.	
 Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1 percent,
with increasing expectations that Tokyo will intervene in forex
markets to weaken the strong yen offsetting growing worries that
the U.S. economy may be sliding back into a recession.	
 Shares elsewhere in the region as measured by the MSCI Asia
Pacific ex-Japan index fell more than
1 percent, unable to hold on to early advances.	
 A similar pattern was seen in S&P 500 futures , which
recoiled from early gains to slip 0.4 percent ,
pointing to more losses in Western markets later in the day.	
 ""Given the economic hurdles faced in Europe and the United
States, an upward trend is hard to sustain,"" said Park
Yong-myung, a fund manager at Hanhwa Investment Trust
Management.	
 Adding to the bearish tone, European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny told an Austrian magazine he was
concerned that euro zone countries will not push through
parliamentary approval of changes to their EFSF bailout fund as
quickly as planned.	
 Member states have to adopt revisions to the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) so that it can take over
from the ECB the job of buying debt of struggling members on
secondary markets if needed.	
 Khiem Do, head of Asian multi-asset with Baring Asset
Management in Hong Kong, said there would be little visibility
on the direction of markets until it was clear whether the
United States would slide into recession or not.	
 ""The sentiment of markets is very weak at the moment,"" he
said.	
 MSCI's world stock index fell 0.5
percent. The index has slipped into a bear market territory by
dropping more than 20 percent from its three-year high in May.

 
 BERNANKE IN FOCUS 
 A key event this week will be a speech by Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Aug. 26 in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, during which he is expected to provide an economic
outlook and hints on how policymakers plan to handle the turmoil
in financial markets.	
 Bernanke used the same event last year to suggest the Fed
could help growth by buying long-term bonds, but no major
announcements are expected this time.(For a preview of
Bernanke's speech, see )	
 On Friday, U.S. stocks fell after Hewlett-Packard's
weaker outlook and corporate shakeup added to uncertainty for
investors after a month of bad surprises ranging from a U.S.
credit rating downgrade to a sharp slowdown in world growth. 
 
 Markets will also watch data on bond buying by the European
Central Bank and debt issuance by European countries such as
Italy on Tuesday to see if the euro zone's debt crisis is
worsening.	
 Also on Tuesday, a raft of preliminary manufacturing data
will shed light on whether economies from China to the euro zone
are continuing to lose momentum, adding to global growth fears.

 Brent oil futures  tumbled more than 3 percent at one
point to $105.15 a barrel, weighed down by a firmer U.S. dollar
and as the months-long conflict in oil-producing Libya appeared
to enter its decisive phase, with rebel fighters streaming into
the heart of Tripoli. 
 The dollar index , which tracks the strength of the
greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.1 percent.	
 The dollar surged higher against the yen, but later pared
some of its gains, with traders citing talk that the spike in
the dollar was triggered by bids by a U.S. bank. 
 The move came as investors were increasingly on edge about
the possibility that Japan may intervene to curb yen strength,
in the wake of the dollar's drop down to a record low around
75.95 yen late last week. 
The dollar was largely flat against the yen at 76.71 yen
, having risen to as high as 77.23 yen earlier.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Asian stocks turned
positive on Monday, recovering a small portion of last week's
steep losses, while gold shot to new highs as investors worried

crisis.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell slightly on
Monday, expanding last week's steep losses and gold hit another

(Updates with details)
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Equity markets slid anew and
gold set a second-straight record high on Friday as fears of a
possible U.S. slide into recession and concerns related to
Europe's debt crisis kept investors on edge.
 Wall Street marked a fourth week of losses, pulled lower by
a 20 percent plunge in Hewlett-Packard  -- its worst day
since the 1987 market crash -- after the Silicon Valley icon
unveiled a dismal outlook and a difficult corporate shake-up.
 The benchmark S&P 500 index has shed 13.1 percent so far in
August and is on track for its worst month since October 2008,
when the financial crisis and deep recession mauled markets.
 The day's activity seemed mild when compared with Thursday,
when the yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds plummeted below
2 percent for the first time since at least 1950 on fears the
U.S. economy was careening toward a new recession.
 Those fears appear valid. Bill Gross, manager of the
world's largest bond fund at PIMCO, told Reuters Insider that
the week's rally in Treasury yields signaled ""not only a
potential for a recession but the almost high probability of
recession.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 172.93
points, or 1.57 percent, at 10,817.65. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 17.12 points, or 1.50 percent, at
1,123.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 38.59 points,
or 1.62 percent, at 2,341.84.
 Investors halted a rush into bonds but kept pouring into
gold, which posted its biggest one-week gain in 2-1/2 years and
remains on track for its biggest one-month rise in nearly 12
years in August. Bullion is up 30 percent so far this year.
 While rising commodity prices sapped some safe-haven buying
of gold, it has gained 6 percent over the past five days.
 ""Right now, gold is inversely correlated with fear and
nothing else. When stocks are down, gold's up,"" said Frank
McGhee, head precious metals trader at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC.
 Spot gold  shot to a record $1,877 an ounce on volume
that was the week's highest but below last week's pace.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$30.20 at $1,852.20 an ounce.
 Commodity prices rebounded after the U.S. dollar plumbed a
record low against the yen on speculation Japanese authorities
will not intervene too much to halt the yen's surge. For
details see: [ID:nN1E77I0EC]
 The dollar fell as low as 75.941 yen  on trading
platform EBS, but later pared most losses. It last traded at
76.500 yen, down 0.1 percent.
 Currency traders were emboldened by a Wall Street Journal
report citing Japan's top currency official as saying Japanese
authorities do not plan to intervene in the market often.
 The dollar's slump turned commodity markets, where crude
oil prices rose about 2 percent at one point. ICE Brent October
crude  closed up $1.63 at $108.62 a barrel. U.S. crude
oil  settled down 12 cents at $82.26 per barrel.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> slipped 0.4 percent to 73.976.
The euro  was up 0.4 percent at $1.4392.
 U.S. stocks at first see-sawed but turned lower by midday
as European stocks closed down on recession fears and
skittishness about regional bank funding in Europe.
 ""What I'm seeing right now is basically a crisis of
confidence, more-so than an economic crisis or financial crisis
necessarily at this stage,"" said Natalie Trunow, chief
investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management
in Bethesda, Maryland, which manages about $14.8 billion.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
off 1.6 percent, while emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> fell
2.5 percent.
 European shares flirted with two-year lows. The
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares closed
down 1.7 percent at 909.79.
 U.S. Treasury yields inched up from a low of 1.97 percent
on Thursday as some investors took profits. [ID:nN1E77I09T]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
1/32 of a point in price to yield 2.06 percent.
 Yields have dropped about 73 basis points on the 10-year
note in August as disappointing economic data, the Federal
Reserve's low interest rate policy and jitters over rising bank
funding costs have driven investors to safe-haven bonds.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Gold set a record high and
equity markets slid anew on Friday as lingering fears about
Europe's debt crisis and a potential slide into recession for
major economies kept the bid for safe-havens alive.
 Commodity prices rebounded after the U.S. dollar plumbed a
record low against the yen on speculation Japanese authorities
will not intervene too much to halt the yen's surge. For

 Gold prices rallied almost 3 percent early in the session
as investors sought refuge from Thursday's hefty losses in
stocks, when the yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds slipped
below 2 percent for the first time since at least 1950.
 Spot gold  jumped to a record $1,877 an ounce and was
last trading near $1,846.50, still on track for its biggest
one-month rise in nearly 12 years in August and its biggest
one-week gain since early 2009.
 Rising commodity prices sapped some safety bids for gold
after its gains of about 6 percent over the past five days.
 ""Right now, gold is inversely correlated with fear and
nothing else. When stocks are down, gold's up,"" said Frank
McGhee, head precious metals trader at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC.
 ""If we see the stock markets rally, I would not be
surprised to see profit-taking starting to set in.""
 U.S. stocks at first see-sawed but turned lower by midday,
while European stocks closed down as concerns about recession
and regional bank funding in Europe dominated the market's mood
and kept investors skittish going into the weekend.
 ""It's been a difficult week and confidence that this is
just a soft patch or slowdown is declining every day,"" said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors
LLC in Albany, New York. ""So I just think more investors are
just concluding it's not a good idea to own stocks over the
weekend.""
 U.S. stocks edged down on Hewlett-Packard 's weaker
outlook, and its corporate shake-up added to a wealth of
uncertainty for investors. Volatility remained high.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 172.63 points, or 1.57 percent, at 10,817.95. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 17.12 points, or 1.50
percent, at 1,123.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 38.59 points, or 1.62 percent, at 2,341.84.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
off 1.6 percent, while emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> fell
2.6 percent. European shares flirted with two-year lows.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed down 1.7 percent at 909.79.
 ""What I'm seeing right now is basically a crisis of
confidence, more-so than an economic crisis or financial crisis
necessarily at this stage,"" said Natalie Trunow, chief
investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management
in Bethesda, Maryland, which manages about $14.8 billion.
 The dollar fell as low as 75.941 yen  on trading
platform EBS, but later pared most losses. It last traded at
76.500 yen, down 0.1 percent.
 Currency traders were emboldened by a Wall Street Journal
report citing Japan's top currency official as saying Japanese
authorities do not plan to intervene in the market often.
 The dollar's slump turned commodity markets, where crude
oil prices rose about 2 percent at one point. ICE Brent October
crude  closed up $1.63 at $108.62 a barrel. U.S. crude
oil  settled down 12 cents at $82.26 per barrel.
 U.S. Treasury yields inched up from a low of 1.97 percent
on Thursday as some investors took profits. [ID:nN1E77I09T]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
1/32 of a point in price to yield 2.06 percent.
 Yields have dropped about 73 basis points on the 10-year
note in August as disappointing economic data, the Federal
Reserve's low interest rate policy and jitters over rising bank
funding costs have driven investors to safe-haven bonds.
 Investors are awaiting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's speech on Aug. 26 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for
hints on how policymakers plan to address the recent turmoil in
financial markets.
 Bill Gross, manager of the world's largest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co, said the rally in Treasury
yields to 60-year lows reflects a high probability of a U.S.
recession. [ID:nN1E77I0ZE] For more from the Interview, please

303,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2011 12:48PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD advances in U.S. trade,"Investing.com - The euro extended gains against the U.S. dollar Friday, as European Union officials weighed the benefits of issuing joint euro bonds in an effort to stabilize debt-threatened euro-zone members.
 
EUR/USD hit 1.4260 in early Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4408, up 0.53%.
 
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4260, the day’s low, and resistance at 1.4518, Wednesday’s high.
 
Earlier, European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said the EU may consider the joint issuing of euro bonds in an effort to strengthen fiscal discipline among euro-zone nations.
 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the idea of jointly issued euro-area bonds, saying that “collectivization” of the region’s debt would have little benefit for euro members.
 
Earlier in the week, Merkel met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Pais where the two rejected an expansion to the USD633 billion rescue fund for debt-threatened countries in the euro-zone, calling instead for tighter regional budget rules and a resubmission of a financial transaction tax.
 
The leaders also proposed that nations consider enacting balanced budget provisions into national law and the formation of a “euro council” to be led by current EU President Herman Van Rompuy.
 
An attempt to pass a financial transaction tax in 2010 was rejected by the European Union.

 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Gold set a record high on
Friday on safe-haven buying but commodities rebounded after the
U.S. dollar plunged to a record low against Japan's currency on
speculation authorities will not halt the yen's surge.
 European stocks closed lower on fears major economies were

U.S. stocks see-sawed near break-even, though, as crude oil and

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded on Friday as an
early sell-off lost steam on central bank demand and technical
buying, although the currency was vulnerable due to fears about
euro-zone banks and a gloomy global outlook.
 The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, plunged to a record low against the
yen, with traders emboldened by a Wall Street Journal report citing
Japan's top currency official saying Japanese authorities do not plan
to intervene often.
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.44530
 on trading platform EBS, having fallen earlier to a low of
around $1.42589 as European shares suffered steep losses. The euro
was also boosted by market chatter that the European Central Bank was
buying peripheral bonds [GVD/EUR].
 ""The rebound in the euro seems to have been timed with the
recovery in equities, which have come back from the worst points of
the day,"" said David Mann, regional head of research for the Americas
at Standard Chartered in New York.
 U.S. stocks <.N> were mixed in midday trading, while an index of
European shares <.FTEU3> fell 1.7 percent.
 ""But it would be very difficult to sustain the euro's rally. I
don't think we should read too much into today's moves. The market
is very choppy and cautious,"" Mann said.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 0.5 percent against
the dollar on the day at $1.44050 , with a weekly gain of
more than 1 percent so far. Some said there is a possibility the euro
could go higher still, especially since it has been testing the upper
band of its trading range.
 And there are some asset managers buying into a ""strong- euro""
notion. Axel Merk, president of Merk Investments in Palo Alto,
California, for instance, has started significantly buying euros
despite the euro-zone sovereign crisis.
 ""Compared with the United States and Japan, the euro zone has
been spending and printing less money. That is why the euro here is
trading near $1.45 and not parity,"" said Merk, who manages assets of
more than $750 million.
 He added that the euro has been the least volatile of the major
currencies and, in fact, may be a bedrock of tranquillity in times of
distress.
 DOLLAR/YEN HITS RECORD LOW
 The dollar sank to an all-time low against the yen beneath 76 yen
 on trading platform EBS. It was last at 76.350, down 0.3
percent and down around 5.9 percent so far this year. Stops were
cited at 75.50 and 75.80 yen.
 Traders said investors have been emboldened by the Wall Street
Journal interview of Takehiko Nakao, Japan's vice finance minister
for international affairs. He said there was no reason for the market
to view the yen as a flight-to-safety currency, adding that the yen's
recent surge does not reflect economic fundamentals. [ID:nN1E77I0EC]
 John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Capital
Markets in New York, said the dollar/yen pair could fall to 75 yen
before Japan intervenes.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc also rose, benefiting from demand for
currencies perceived to offer a safe haven, although its gains were
capped by speculation that Swiss authorities will step in again to
rein in the currency.
 The euro  was last down 0.4 percent on the day
against the Swiss currency at 1.13209 francs, having earlier fallen
roughly 1 percent in choppy trade. The dollar was down 1.0 percent at
0.78630 franc .
 In the options market, euro versus Swiss one-month implied vols
remained at extremely high levels around 20 percent ,
reflecting investor jitters over the SNB's next potential steps.
 Investors have been dumping higher-risk assets after weak U.S.
economic data on Thursday added to the view the global economic
recovery is faltering.
 On the other hand, concerns that euro-zone policy-makers are
dragging their feet over the region's debt problems are also expected
to weigh on the single currency.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.6 percent to 73.832
as a result of the euro's rebound.
 Many analysts expect the dollar, which has also struggled due to
U.S. fiscal problems, will be supported on the view that demand for
the greenback will rise if signs grow that financial institutions may
be facing funding problems.
 Analysts said investors were becoming highly sensitive to signs
of funding strains, following news earlier in the week that an
unnamed euro-zone bank had borrowed $500 million in one-week funds
from the European Central Bank. [ID:nLDE77G0DB]

In early U.S. trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.44% to hit 1.4396.
 
Markets reacted to a slew of U.S. economic data released Thursday, including a Labor Department report that initial jobless claims rose by 9,000 to 408,000 for the week ending August 12.
 
Jobless claims were forecast to hit 400,000 for the period.
 
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell by 3.5% in July, hitting an eight-month low. Economist’s forecasts predicted a gain of 2.7% for the month.

The dollar surrendered ground against both the yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY sinking 0.22% to hit 76.39, and USD/CHF lower by 1.01% to hit 0.7660. 
 
The yen earlier strengthened to a postwar record high of 75.97 versus the dollar, prompting speculation that the Bank of Japan may be prepared for another intervention in the currency market to weaken the Japanese currency.
 
The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD down 0.5% to hit 0.9852, AUD/USD higher by 0.47% to hit 1.0439, and NZD/USD gaining 0.29% to hit 0.8238.

 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to a record high
on Friday and global equity markets extended a sharp sell-off
as fears of a global recession and a funding crunch for
regional banks in Europe intensified.
 Gold prices rallied more than 2.5 percent as investors

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Nia Williams	
 LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The euro recovered early losses
on Friday in thin trade, gaining momentum on stop-loss selling,
but remained at risk of coming under renewed pressure from a
darkening global economic outlook and worries the euro zone
banking sector could face more funding pressures.	
 The single currency rose to a session high of $1.4404
, having earlier fallen to a low of around $1.4258 as
European shares suffered heavy losses. 
 It was last trading up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.4388.	
 The Swiss franc edged up, benefiting from demand for
currencies perceived to offer a safe haven, although its gains
were capped by ongoing speculation Swiss authorities will again
step in to rein in the currency.	
 Investors have been dumping higher-risk assets after weak
U.S. economic data on Thursday added to the view the global
economic recovery is stuttering, while concerns that euro zone
policymakers are dragging their feet over the region's debt
problems are also expected to weigh on the single currency.	
 Some market participants said demand from Russian investors,
and market chatter that the European Central Bank was buying
Italian bonds also helped the euro pare losses. 
 The dollar index slipped 0.4 percent to 73.921 as a
result of the euro's rebound.	
 Many analysts expect the dollar, which has also struggled
due to U.S. fiscal problems, will be supported on the view that
demand for the world's most liquid currency will rise if signs
grow that financial institutions may be facing funding problems.	
 ""Funding pressures are definitely visible in the euro area
because of the vicious circle between the sovereign debt crisis
and the knock-on effects on the financial system due to euro
zone banks' holdings of sovereign debt,"" said Raghav Subbarao,
currency strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""That's something that's definitely a pressure on the euro.
If funding pressures intensify radically, the dollar is the
safe-haven currency. When it's a question of liquidity, and not
solvency, the dollar will benefit.""	
 Analysts said investors were becoming highly sensitive to
signs of funding strains, following news earlier in the week
that an unnamed euro zone bank had borrowed $500 million in
one-week funds from the European Central Bank. 
 That has sent interbank lending rates soaring with the U.S.
dollar Libor/OIS spread blowing out to 21 basis points, the
highest level in 12 months. Three-month Libor struck 4-1/2-month
highs at 0.30300 percent, up from 0.29778 percent on
Thursday. 
 Other signs of possible funding issues were highlighted by
news the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had tapped its currency swap
line with the Federal Reserve in the past week. This was the
first time the Fed has provided liquidity to a foreign central
bank since early March. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
was down around 1.8 percent as global shares struggled after a
dismal reading of U.S. factory activity on Thursday heightened
worries the economy could be heading back into recession.

 
 MARKETS VOLATILE	
 The euro was last down 0.2 percent on the day
against the Swiss franc to 1.1357 francs, having earlier fallen
roughly 1 percent in choppy trade.	
 Concern about the global economic picture is expected to
continue fuelling demand for the franc, but its upside may be
limited by the prospect of more SNB action.	
 The SNB has boosted franc liquidity in the past week or so
by increasing sight deposits and selling the franc via swaps on
the forward market.	
 In the options market euro versus Swiss one-month implied
vols remained at extremely high levels around 22 percent
, reflecting investor jitters over the SNB's next
potential steps.	
 ""There's a regulatory risk in euro/Swiss and as long as that
remains vols will stay high,"" said Olivier Korber, options
strategist at Societe Generale. 
 Despite the risk of further volatility both the euro and the
dollar were poised to end the week largely unchanged as
investors were wary of holding even safe-haven currencies.	
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 76.46 yen,
regaining ground after earlier slipping to 76.31, within a
whisker of its all-time low of 76.25 yen and spurring
speculation that Japanese authorities may enter the market to
stem the currency's strength.

 * European stocks near 2-yr lows, banks hit hard
 * Some European banks face funding stress
 * Weak U.S. factory data rattles investors
 * Gold hits fresh high as buyers seek safe havens

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - A selloff in global stocks
gathered pace on Friday, reflecting mounting concerns the U.S.
economy is heading into another recession and as some European
lenders faced a short-term funding crunch, highlighting the risk
of a banking crisis.	
 Nervous investors fled to the safety of core government
bonds, Swiss francs and gold, which hit a record high, with many
seeking to unwind holdings of riskier assets such as stocks,
commodities and higher-yielding currencies before the weekend.	
 European shares extended steep losses from Thursday, when
they suffered their biggest daily slide in 2-1/2 years, with key
indexes in Britain, France and Germany deep in the red. 
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall
Street, a day after the Nasdaq shed more than 5 percent
and the S&P 500 tumbled 4.5 percent fears. Futures for
the S&P 500 , the Dow Jones  and the Nasdaq 100
 were down by between 1 and 1.2 percent.	
 A short selling ban imposed on financial stocks by some
European stock markets last week appears to have had little
impact. Shares in Europe's biggest banks fell to their
lowest in more than two years on funding fears, taking the
weekly fall to near 10 percent and leaving the battered sector
on course for a fourth straight week of declines.	
 ""Funding pressures are definitely visible in the euro area
because of the vicious circle between the sovereign debt crisis
and the knock-on effects on the financial system due to euro
zone banks' holdings of sovereign debt,"" said Raghav Subbarao,
currency strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 The MSCI world equity index was down 1.3
percent. It has matched the losses in European stocks since the
start of the month, with $1.4 trillion being wiped off
valuations on Thursday and early on Friday -- equivalent to the
size of the Spanish economy.	
 Exane BNP Paribas, in a note, said a global recession was
far from priced in by financial markets. Another global slump
could see corporate earnings plunge 35 percent from peak to
trough, implying a 50 percent cut to consensus earnings per
share estimates.	
 The sharp decline in stock markets is expected to have an
adverse impact on household wealth, further undermining
consumer confidence and demand in coming months. Heightened
uncertainty over growth could also see producers delaying
decision-making, hitting global output.	
 Those concerns are likely to see investors cut exposure to
stocks, metals and oil, and growth-linked currencies such as the
Australian dollar in the coming days, unless the U.S. Federal
Reserve signals more quantitative easing or European politicians
take decisive actions to stem contagion risk from the euro zone
debt crisis.	
 
CRUNCH TIME	
 While investors fled stocks, spot gold hit a record
high of $1,867.30 an ounce, putting it on track for the largest
weekly gains since February 2009. The metal has rallied nearly
14 percent so far this month -- its best month since September
1999 -- benefiting from a deluge of safe-haven flows.	
 ""At the moment the market is just looking for relative safe
havens,"" said Mitsui Precious Metals analyst David Jollie. ""You
can see that in the selloffs across equity markets. The strength
of gold is the other side of the coin from that.""	
 Oil prices fell, with Brent  dropping to as low as
$105.06 a barrel. It has lost more than 9 percent this month,
the worst slide since a near 15 percent drop in May 2010.	
 The drop came as a slew of data on Thursday revived concerns
the United States -- the world's largest consumer of oil, could
be heading for another recession.	
 Factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region fell to its
lowest level since March 2009, stunning investors. An unexpected
fall in existing U.S. home sales in July and a
bigger-than-expected rise in new claims for jobless benefits in
the latest week also added to the wave of risk aversion.	
 Renewed fears that the euro zone debt crisis could engulf
the region's financial system put pressure on short-term funding
markets, forcing some European banks to pay higher rates for
dollar loans and reviving memories of the dark days of late 2009
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.	
 The euro edged up to $1.4377, but euro zone debt
problems and worries about the financial stability of European
banks were likely to check gains.	
 German Bund futures  fell, but were still in sight
of record highs as worries over a global slowdown and the euro
zone debt crisis provided underlying support.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - European stocks are
slated for another fall on Friday after Asian stocks
slumped on growing fears the U.S. economy was sliding into
recession and as some European lenders faced short-term funding
strains, raising fears of a systemic banking crisis on the
continent.	
 European shares were expected to extend Thursday's
steep losses when they suffered their biggest daily slide in
2-1/2 years, with key indexes in Britain, France and Germany set
to open as much as 1 percent lower. 
 The FTSEurofirst index has already lost
15 pct this month, on track for its worst monthly loss since at
least 1997.	
 S&P 500 futures  fell 0.8 percent in Asia,
pointing to more losses for battered Western markets later in
the day.	
 Spot gold rose more than 1 percent to an all-time
high of $1,844.55 an ounce, before easing to $1,841.94 by
0530 GMT. The gains put it on track to a 5.6 percent weekly
rise, its seventh gain in a row and the largest since February
2009. 
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan
fell 3.4 percent, taking its losses
this month to nearly 14 percent. 
 ""(The U.S. data) presents the worst combination for an
economy, i.e. slower growth but higher inflation, that impacted
quite negatively sentiment in Asia trading hours,"" Frances
Cheung, strategist at Credit Agricole told Reuters Insider.	
 ""Worse still, we also have some funding squeeze coming from
Europe and also across a number of Asian markets,"" she said.

 
Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2.1
percent for a third day of declines, while Korea's KOSPI
tumbling over 6 percent and Taiwan down almost
4 percent, suggesting the pressure was more on markets with
a higher exposure to technology.	
 Several global industry heavyweights such as Dell ,
Hewlett-Packard and LG Electronics have cut
sales forecasts this week as the outlook for corporate,
government and consumer tech spending dims.	
 
 US DATA DISAPPOINTS	
A drop in factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region to
the lowest level since March 2009 stunned investors, as the data
from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank is viewed as a
forward-looking indicator of national manufacturing. 
An unexpected fall in existing U.S. home sales in July and a
greater-than-expected rise in new claims for jobless benefits in
the latest week also added to fears that the U.S. economic
recovery could stall and possibly slide into recession. 
In Europe, renewed fears that the euro zone debt crisis could
infect the region's financial system put pressure on short-term
funding markets, forcing some European banks to pay higher rates
for U.S. dollar loans and reviving memories of the dark days of
late 2009 after the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman
Brothers as funding dried up. 
""Clearly, these euro-zone banks are having a tough time
raising money, but it's not at a level that's alarming,"" said
Joe D'Angelo, managing director of money markets at Prudential
Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey, who oversees $50 billion in
assets. 
The U.S dollar booked modest gains in Asia as
investors piled into the safety of U.S. Treasuries despite
falling yields.	
 ""There are still some strains in Asian FX swap... markets,
in which investors are selling dollar and then buying dollar
forwards in order to get some short-term U.S. dollar funding,""
said Cheung.	
 Oil prices fell and U.S. Treasuries surged as investors
rushed into safe-havens after heavy losses on U.S. and European
markets overnight.	
 U.S. 30-year Treasuries surged more than a full
point in Asia, with traders saying the papers were getting an
added boost from vague rumours about an emergency Fed meeting
later on Friday.	
 Brent oil  hit a session low of $106.05 a barrel,
down nearly $1 from the previous session. Brent has lost more
than 9 percent this month, the worst since a near 15 percent
drop in May 2010.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Renewed jitters over Europe's
debt crisis and a raft of weak U.S. economic data sparked a
rout in global equities on Thursday while driving skittish
investors to the safety of gold and U.S. government bonds.
 Spot gold prices and the yield on benchmark U.S., British
and German 10-year government debt set fresh records as
investors dumped stocks and other riskier assets to rush into
safe-haven investments for their perceived security.
 The numbers spelled mayhem -- the Dow lost more than 400
points and declining shares on the New York Stock Exchange
outpaced advancing stocks by more than 16 to 1 -- but major
indexes managed to stay above 2011 lows set last week.
 ""It's much of the same -- concerns over European banks,
U.S. deficits weighing on economic growth and the possibility
of a global recession as the end result,"" said Chris Jarvis,
senior analyst for Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls,
New Hampshire.
 ""These cross currents are driving wild swings for riskier
asset classes such as equities and commodities, specifically
crude oil. Until clarity improves, we expect volatility to
remain elevated relative to historical norms.""
 A drop in factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region
to the lowest level since March 2009 unnerved investors, as
the data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank is viewed
as a forward-looking indicator of national manufacturing.
 An unexpected fall in existing U.S. home sales in July and
a greater-than-expected rise in new claims for jobless
benefits in the latest week added to growing fears that the
U.S. economic recovery could stall and slide into recession.
 SHUNNING RISK
 Investors reacted by avoiding risk. Corporate bonds,
industrial commodities and higher-yielding currencies slid,
and assets viewed as safe havens, such as gold, government
bonds and the dollar, gained.
 European equities suffered their biggest daily slide in
2-1/2 years. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading
European shares fell 4.8 percent to close at 925.19 points,
its biggest one-day percentage drop since March 2009.
 ""The market is beginning to price in a recession. The
Philadelphia Fed number was an absolute abomination,"" said
Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets in London.
 ""Until we get some clear idea of how policy-makers are
going to deal with euro-zone sovereign debt problems, it's not
getting to get any better.""
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-country world
equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tumbled 4.1 percent and emerging
market equities <.MSCIEF> fell 2.8 percent.
 WORRIES ABOUT EUROPEAN BANKS
 U.S. stocks plummeted in sync with bank shares after The
Wall Street Journal reported that regulators were intensifying
their review of the U.S. units of European banks.
[ID:nL5E7JI0Q]
 The sell-off ""is rooted in the European banking system,""
said Jack de Gan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory
Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
 ""It reflects continued concern that sovereign debt issues
indicate we're going to have to bail out all those banks
again. And if there's stress in major European banks, it will
affect U.S. banks, too.""
 The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
William Dudley, said the U.S. central bank is treating foreign
banks the same as their U.S. peers.
 U.S. stocks pared losses at the market's close.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 419.63
points, or 3.68 percent, at 10,990.58. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 53.24 points, or 4.46 percent, to end at
1,140.65. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slid 131.05
points, or 5.22 percent, to finish at 2,380.43.
 In Europe, German shares lost the most, with traders
citing the effects of a short-selling ban on financial stocks
in other parts of Europe and intensifying worries about the
lack of a plan to address the euro-zone debt crisis.
[ID:nL5E7JI3UN]
 The European banking sector, widely exposed to the crisis,
fell 6.7 percent and is down 29.8 percent this year.
 BONDS FLY
 U.S. Treasuries prices soared, with the yield of the
benchmark 10-year note falling below 2.0 percent for the first
time, according to Reuters data, as investors snapped up the
government bonds on fears of a slowdown. [ID:nN1E77H0K3].
 Morgan Stanley told investors that the United States and
the euro zone are ""dangerously close"" to recession, even
though it said that was not its base case. [ID:nL3E7JI1LM]
 The benchmark 10-year note  shot up 27/32 in
price to yield 2.07 percent, after slumping to a record low of
1.97 percent.
 Yields on British 10-year gilts  fell to an
all-time low of 2.238 percent and 10-year German debt
 fell to 2.028 percent.
 Gold rallied to its second record high in a week. Spot
gold  hit a record $1,825.99, although it is still off
its inflation-adjusted peak above $2,000 struck in 1980.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$28.20 at $1,822 an ounce.
 Short-term money markets showed further signs of bank
stress emanating from Europe's fiscal strains. The benchmark
for unsecured dollar loans between banks, three-month Libor,
rose to its highest in 4-1/2 months, the latest in recent
peaks.
 Investors also pulled back over the last week from the
commercial paper market, a key source of short-term funding
for banks and businesses. These strains have contributed to
the stock sell-off and the rush into gold and government
bonds.
 The U.S. dollar and yen firmed as global growth anxiety
and worries about European banks drove investors to the
relative safety of both currencies.[ID:nN1E77H0EL]
 The ICE Futures dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.7 percent to
74.195 while the euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.43370 .
 Crude prices tumbled on the prospect of declining demand.
 Brent crude  slid $3.61 to end at $106.99 a barrel,
breaking below the 200-day moving average, a key technical
indicator closely watched by traders.
 U.S. crude oil tumbled $5.20, or 5.9 percent, to settle at
$82.38 a barrel, and its discount to Brent widened to more
than $24 a barrel.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The dollar, yen, and Swiss
franc climbed on Thursday as worries about a slowing global
economy and European banks' exposure to the euro zone debt
crisis drove investors to the relative safety of these
currencies.
 A sharp contraction in August business activity in the U.S.
mid-Atlantic region and an unexpected 3.5 percent drop in
existing U.S. home sales last month heightened the market's
aversion to risk, with the euro, Australian and Canadian
dollars posting steep losses.
 Wall Street shares and European equities were down big as
well in the aftermath of the U.S. numbers. For more on the U.S.
data, see [ID:nN1E77H0E8].
 ""Today was not a good day for weak Philly Fed data to be
coming out as the market is trading more on emotions than
value,"" said Ken Dickson, investment director for currencies at
Standard Life Investments, with assets under management of more
than $250 billion.
 That said, Dickson, who's based in Edinburgh, thinks the
global economy will not slide into recession as many seem to
expect. ""We think global growth will be soft, particularly in
the developed markets, but we don't think the global economy
will be moving into the double-dip area or an extended
recession.""
 He said that in the medium to long term, Standard life
remains bullish on the dollar including sterling -- currencies
that have struggled as their fiscal deficits came into focus.
 ""The market has taken them (dollar and sterling) to levels
that make them undervalued with market positioning also very
low on these currencies.""
 Rumored intervention by the Swiss National Bank in the
currency forwards market earlier in the European session had a
brief impact on the franc, pushing it lower as the New York
session started. The Swiss currency later surged in the wake of
soft U.S. economic numbers.
 The ICE Futures dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.9 percent at
74.330, while the euro fell 0.9 percent to $1.43004 ,
tracking a nearly 5 percent fall in European stocks <.FTEU3>.
 The euro briefly trimmed losses against the dollar after
U.S. data showing a higher-than-expected rise in July consumer
prices of 0.5 percent and a jump in the weekly jobless claims
by 9,000 in the latest week. See [ID:N1E77H0A2].
 Overall though sentiment on the euro remains negative. A
lack of more drastic measures from Tuesday's Franco-German
summit to address the euro zone debt crisis and worries about a
tax on financial transactions affecting the region's banks have
kept the euro under pressure.
 A Wall Street Journal report overnight saying that the
Federal Reserve is scrutinizing European banks in the United
States has also dented risk appetite in the market,
contributing to a sell-off in equities.
 The report also said the $2.5 trillion U.S. money market
funds industry, which supplies short-term dollar funding to
banks, has retreated from the euro zone in recent months.
[ID:nL5E7JI0Q].
 The dollar and euro traded mixed against the Swiss franc.
The greenback edged higher to 0.79230 franc  while the
euro dropped 0.6 percent to 1.13355 francs . The
euro had earlier climbed to 1.15150.
 Both the euro and dollar initially gained on talk of SNB
intervention in the forwards market, although the Swiss central
bank declined comment.
 Forward market intervention involves selling Swiss francs
in short-dated maturities  to flood the market with the
currency, then buying them back or rolling them over at a later
date.
 Traders said by undertaking franc-selling in the forwards
instead of in the spot market, the SNB was seeking to drive the
return on holding francs even lower, making it less attractive
to potential investors.
 For now, intervention in the currency forwards market could
slow the Swiss franc, but not for long, said Ray Attrill,
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 ""Sentiment on the euro is deteriorating sharply and the
risk is that the Swiss franc could strengthen again.""
 The franc soared to record highs against the dollar and the
euro earlier this month in a rush toward perceived safe havens
sparked by euro zone sovereign debt worries and concerns about
a global slowdown.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 76.510 yen
, not far from its record low of 76.25 yen struck in
March. The euro dropped 0.9 percent versus the yen to 109.515
yen .

 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Renewed worries about Europe's
debt crisis and a raft of weak U.S. economic data hit global
markets on Thursday, driving down stocks and oil prices and
pushing U.S. bond yields to record lows while pushing gold to a
record high.
 Several U.S. economic reports added to the market's funk,
with a drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business
activity index to minus 30.7 especially unnerving investors as
it is a forward-looking indicator of national manufacturing.
 The reports showed factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic
region plunged in August to its lowest level since March 2009;
existing home sales unexpectedly fell in July. The number of
Americans seeking new jobless benefits climbed last week and
consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in four months in
July.
 ""The market is in meltdown mode; the data continues to
stink. I don't know that there's much more to be said. We
continue to be in a soft patch,"" said Sal Catrini, managing
director for equities at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in New York.
 Sentiment worsened after the Philly Fed report as any
reading below zero indicates contraction in factories in
eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
 Aversion to risk swept financial markets, with corporate
bonds, industrial commodities and higher-yielding currencies
sliding and assets viewed as safe-havens, such as gold,
government bonds and the dollar, gaining.
 U.S. Treasuries prices soared and the benchmark 10-year
note yields fell below 2.0 percent for the first time as
investors snapped up the government bonds on fears over a
global economic slowdown. [ID:nN1E77H0K3]
 The benchmark notes  were last up 1-7/32 in
price to yield 2.03 percent after dropping to a record low of
1.98 percent.
 Gold rallied to its second record high in a week. Spot gold
 hit a record $1,825.99, although it is still off its
inflation-adjusted peak above $2,000 struck in 1980.
 Short-term money markets showed further signs of bank
stress emanating from Europe's fiscal strains. The benchmark
for unsecured dollar loans between banks, 3-month LIBOR, rose
to its highest in 4-1/2 months, the latest in recent peaks.
 Investors also pulled back over the last week from the
commercial paper market, a key source of short-term funding for
banks and businesses. These strains have contributed to the
stock sell-off and the rush into gold and government bonds.
 The U.S. dollar and yen firmed as global growth anxiety and
worries about European banks drove investors to the relative
safety of both currencies. [ID:nN1E77H0EL]
 The ICE Futures dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.9 percent at
74.363 while the euro fell 0.9 percent to $1.42908 ,
tracking a more than 4 percent fall in European shares
<.FTEU3>.
 ""We have much lower risk appetite today and that's why
we're seeing the dollar strengthen,"" said Ray Attrill, senior
currency strategist, at BNP Paribas in New York.
 ""Stocks are down across the board and that may be due to
some global growth worries,"" Attrill said.
 U.S. stocks also tumbled more than 4.0 percent, pulled
lower by bank shares after The Wall Street Journal reported
that regulators were intensifying their review of the U.S.
units of European banks. [ID:nL5E7JI0Q]
 The sell-off ""is rooted in the European banking system,""
said Jack de Gan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory
Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
 ""It reflects continued concern that sovereign debt issues
indicate we're going to have to bail out all those banks again.
And if there's stress in major European banks, it will affect
U.S. banks too.""

 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Thursday as
renewed unease about a sluggish economic recovery prompted
investors to cut exposure to riskier assets, though the
safe-haven Swiss franc also dropped amid signs of further moves
by the central bank to stem its rise.	
 European shares shed 2.7 percent, with worries about the
U.S. economy and vanishing prospects of a quick fix for the euro
zone's debt crisis wiping out the previous session's gains.	
 The retreat in riskier assets sent investors scrambling for
safe havens, buoying gold near record highs, German Bund futures
 to all-time peaks and driving benchmark U.S. Treasury
yields to their lowest level in a week.	
 Adding to the glum economic outlook, UK. retail sales grew
at an unexpectedly slow pace in July. 
 Earlier, Morgan Stanley analysts became the latest to cut
forecasts for global growth, citing ""recent policy errors"" in
the United States and Europe, plus prospects of further fiscal
tightening in 2012. 
 Deutsche Bank cut its projection for Chinese GDP growth to
8.9 percent for 2011 from 9.1 percent and to 8.3 percent for
2012 from 8.6 percent, largely reflecting a downgrade in export
outlook due to slower growth in the United States and Europe. 
 In Europe , shares in sectors linked to global
growth such as the automobile sector were worst hit, with some
stop-loss selling adding to the slide.	
 ""There is an ever-increasing danger of a double-dip scenario
and if that happens, then we are in for even a more steep
downturn in stocks,"" said Koen de Leus, a strategist at KBC
Securities in Brussels. 
 ""In the United States, purchasing power of people has gone
down and there is a lot of insecurity concerning jobs. While in
Europe, a lot of countries (are running) ... austerity
programmes.""

 U.S. equity futures pointed to a lower open on Wall Street
after closing flat the previous day, following a gloomy sales
outlook from tech bellwether Dell which fanned fears
slow economic growth would crimp earnings in the third quarter.	
Investors are bracing for a slew of U.S. economic data due
later in the session that could add to concerns the world's
biggest economy is headed for a protracted downturn. The slate
includes inflation, weekly jobless claims, housing and
forward-looking economic sentiment survey results. 
 
 SWISS TUG-OF-WAR	
 The Swiss franc fell against the euro and the dollar with
traders saying the central bank was intervening in the forwards
market in its bid to clip the soaring currency's wings.	
 The franc's sharp gains reflect a broader struggle to tame
Europe's fiscal crisis, with the Swiss currency favoured by
investors seeking safety in a currency other than the euro.	
 ""They (the SNB) have been in the FX swap market,"" said Chris
Walker, currency strategist at UBS. ""But we think the euro/Swiss
franc will still fall back towards parity.""	
 ""The dollar is also being preferred as there are reports of
funding stress and as a loss of risk appetite sees investors
make a scramble for (it).""	
 The euro traded 0.2 percent up at 1.1415 francs
while the dollar stood 0.6 percent firmer at 0.7941 francs

 The greenback also rose against commodity-linked currencies
like the Australian dollar .	
 The growing jitters about the growth outlook drove spot gold
1.1 percent up to $1,808.70, taking it to within $5 of
last week's record high. 
 In bond markets, German Bund futures jumped more than a full
point to a record high of 135.08 as the weak economic outlook
and concerns EU policymakers were not doing enough to tackle the
region's debt crisis spurred the flight to quality.	
 U.S. Treasuries advanced, pushing the 10-year T-note yield
about five basis points lower to a one-week low of
2.09 percent with sustained safe-haven bids expected to send it
to all-time lows around the 2.04 percent seen after Lehman
Brothers' collapse in 2008.	
 Brent crude futures  fell 1.2 percent to $109.20 a
barrel, as investors fretting over the euro zone's debt woes and
slower global growth tried to lock in profits from a rally in
oil prices to their highest levels in nearly two weeks.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell against the
euro and the dollar on Thursday, with traders citing talk the
Swiss National Bank was intervening in the forwards market as
part of efforts to curb the surging currency.	
 The dollar rose against commodity-linked currencies like the
Australian dollar while the yen was supported as
European stocks fell and money market strains drove investors to
the relative safety of the U.S. and Japanese currencies.	
 The dollar gained 0.8 percent to 0.7966 francs while
the euro rose 0.4 percent to 1.1440 francs , having
earlier climbed to 1.1515.	
 ""They (the SNB) have been in the FX swap market,"" said Chris
Walker, currency strategist at UBS. ""But we think the euro/Swiss
franc will still fall back towards parity.""	
 The franc soared to record highs against the dollar and the
euro earlier this month in a rush towards perceived safe havens
sparked by euro zone sovereign debt worries and concerns about a
global slowdown.	
 In a fresh attempt to tame the franc's runaway rise, the SNB
said on Wednesday it would boost liquidity by expanding sight
deposits to 200 billion francs from 120 billion, and said it
would take additional steps if needed.	
 The SNB on Thursday declined to comment on the latest talk
that it was intervening in the forwards market. 
 Forward market intervention involves selling Swiss francs in
short-dated maturities to flood the market with francs,
then buying them back or rolling them over at a later date.	
 Traders said by undertaking franc-selling operations in the
forwards instead of in the spot market, the SNB was seeking to
drive the return on holding francs even lower, making it less
attractive to potential investors.	
 Swiss money market rates moved deeper into negative
territory. The December 2011 Euroswiss contract traded at
100.51, implying a three-month Swiss franc Libor rate of -0.51
percent in December. <0#FES:> The contract has risen from around
100.04 at the start of the week, implying the SNB's action was
working for the moment.

 GLOBAL GROWTH PANGS	
 Meanwhile, the dollar index was up 0.5 percent at
74.088 while the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.4351 ,
tracking a 2.5 percent fall in European shares . 
 Technical support around $1.4360, the euro's 100-day moving
average, and bids seen at $1.4350 were expected to limit further
big losses, while steady sovereign demand at lower levels has
been a pillar of support for the single currency. 
 However, a lack of more radical measures from Tuesday's
Franco-German summit to address the euro zone debt crisis and
lingering worries about some large European banks are likely to
keep the euro under downward pressure. 
 It was lower against the yen at 110.10 yen while
the dollar was flat at 76.54 yen , not far from its record
low of 76.25 yen struck in March.	
 Traders said the greenback could test this record low next
week, when most Japanese players return from holidays and as
Japanese exporters may sell the dollar in end-of-the-month
transactions.	
 One factor that could weigh broadly on the dollar is market
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may eventually launch
another asset-buying programme. 
 Investors are focusing on whether Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
will drop any hints about such further monetary easing measures
when he speaks at the annual Jackson Hole event next week.	
 Before that, a slew of data on Thursday will provide clues
on whether further U.S. stimulus will be needed. Consumer price
inflation data, the Philly Fed survey, initial unemployment
claims, existing home sales and leading indicators are all due
.	
 ""The most important one will be the CPI and the market is
positioned towards a stable to slightly lower number,"" said Adam
Myers, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole.	
 ""If we get a lower number, Bernanke may prepare the ground
for more QE but a higher-than-expected number will make that
case difficult and could see the dollar rally.""	
 The dollar's gains against commodity-linked currencies
pushed the Australian dollar down 0.7 percent to $1.0460
.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell against
the euro and the dollar on Thursday, with traders citing talk
that the Swiss National Bank was adding liquidity via the
currency forwards market.	
 The Swiss franc had been edging higher against the euro for
much of the Asian trading session, after the SNB's latest steps
to curb franc strength, announced on Wednesday, fell short of
expectations. 
 But the Swiss franc quickly retreated late in the Asian
trading session against both the euro and the dollar.	
 ""SNB is in the forward market, I'm hearing,"" said a trader
for a European bank in Singapore, adding that stop-loss selling
of the Swiss franc helped add to its declines.	
 Several other traders also cited talk that SNB was
intervening in the forward market, although details were
sketchy.	
 Such talk comes at a time when the SNB has been adding
billions of francs in additional liquidity, pushing short-term
interest rates down via the forwards. Its actions have pulled
rates into negative territory.	
 The SNB had stepped up its efforts to tame a runaway franc
on Wednesday by announcing an expansion of its liquidity policy.
The SNB said it would boost liquidity by expanding sight
deposits to 200 billion francs from 120 billion, reiterating it
would take additional steps if needed.	
 The euro rose 0.5 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1463
, having risen to as high as 1.1515 francs earlier.	
 The dollar climbed 0.7 percent to 0.7958 , having
risen to as high as 0.7991 .

 SYDNEY, Aug 18 (Reuters) - European shares looked set to
follow Asia lower on Thursday as investors in that region locked
in profits on worries about faltering global demand, while the
Swiss franc fell sharply on speculation the Swiss central bank
was intervening in the forwards market.	
 Commodity and technology shares dragged the region's shares
lower as investors skimmed off some of this week's gains amid
lingering worries on the outlook for the U.S. economy and euro
zone debt.	
 European stocks were set to track their Asian
peers lower, with Germany's DAX seen opening as much as
1.7 percent lower by financial bookmakers. 
 Underscoring the cautious mood in Asia, S&P stock futures
 lost 0.82 percent.	
 With market sentiment still fragile, investors will closely
watch a flurry of U.S. economic data later in the day including
weekly jobless claims, existing home sales and business
conditions in the Mid-Atlantic region.	
 Investors' demand for safe-havens has remained so strong
that an announcement by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) on
Wednesday that it would expand its liquidity policy failed to
bring down the franc as markets had expected more radical
measures such as an exchange rate peg. 
 ""What drove the Swiss stronger is less speculation and more
fear of things going wrong in the euro zone. Until that's fixed,
it's very difficult to see how the SNB can win,"" said Rob Ryan,
FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore. 
 The SNB has been adding billions of francs in additional
liquidity, pushing short-term interest rates down via the
forwards. Its actions have pulled rates into negative territory.

 On Thursday, traders cited talk that the SNB was at it
again, flooding the market with liquidity.	
 The dollar traded at 0.7969 Swiss francs , still below
a two-week high on Wednesday around 0.8011, while the euro stood
at 1.1455 francs , down from Wednesday's peak around
1.1554.	
 Markets are a lot calmer compared with last week, when a
crisis of confidence swept through global financial markets
after Standard & Poor's cut the United States triple-A credit
rating, pushing investors into safe havens such as gold and the
Swiss franc.	
 John Woods, chief investment strategist at Citi in Hongkong,
told Reuters Insider that a strong gap has begun to emerge in
the market performance of export-oriented Asian countries such
as Taiwan compared to markets that are driven by domestic demand
like China or Indonesia.	
 ""I suspect there will be an outperformance both in terms of
equities and currency of the more inward, domestically oriented
countries,"" he said.

 GARDEN VARIETY UNCERTAINTY	
 ""The mood has improved over the past week from sheer panic
to a more garden-variety uncertainty about the future,"" said
Bricklin Dwyer, economist at BNP Paribas.	
 Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 1.2 percent,
while stocks elsewhere in Asia as measured by MSCI
fell 1.3 percent.	
 Taiwan's tech-heavy index lost 2 percent,
making it the biggest loser in the region's major markets,
tracking a fall in U.S. tech shares on Wednesday after Dell's
disappointing sales outlook heightened worries about the
economic growth outlook.	
 Meanwhile, gold traded at $1,790 an ounce, holding
not far from a record high around $1,813.79 set last week. U.S.
crude  was a touch softer at $87.16 a barrel.	
 The dollar continued its gradual decline against the yen,
slipping to 76.65 yen , well off a high above 80.00 set
earlier this month after Japanese authorities intervened to
weaken the yen.	
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Thursday he
will closely watch market moves, when asked by reporters about
the yen's strengthening against the dollar overnight.	
 ""The Bank of Japan is caught between a rock and a hard
place,"" said Jessica Hoversen, FX analyst at MF Global in New
York. ""Intervention did not work earlier this month, but
investors also do not want to be caught on the wrong side.""

374,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2011 10:38PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY edges lower in mid-day Asian trade,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved marginally lower against the Japanese yen in Asian trade Thursday, following a lackluster performance overnight on Wall Street and U.S. data showing higher inflationary trends than expected. 
 
In early Asian trade USD/JPY hit 76.68, the pair’s highest since Wednesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 76.58, easing 0.03%.  
 
The pair was likely to find support at 76.41, Wednesday’s low, and resistance at 77.08, Monday’s high.
 
Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its producer price inflation index rose by 0.2% in July, after a 0.4% decline the previous month. Market expectations were for a July increase of 0.1%.
 
The core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.4% in July.

 
By the end of Wednesday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.04%, to finish at 11,410. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.47% to 2,511, and the S&P 500 eased up 0.09% to 1,194.
 
Meanwhile, Japan’s Ministry of Finance reported that the nation’s trade surplus hit USD947.9 million, as Japanese exports fell 3.3% in July while imports were up 9.9% during the same period.
 
The Finance Ministry release followed Tuesday’s report that the Japan’s gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% in the quarter ending June.
 
Economists had forecast that Japan’s GDP would contract by twice much at 0.6%, due to the lingering effects of the March 11 earthquake and tsunamis.
 
Japanese officials have been hoping that a surge in exports could help stimulate growth in the wake of the earthquake, bu a persistently high yen has stifled export expansion.
 
Meanwhile the yen moved higher against both the euro and the British pound with EUR/JPY down 0.27% to hit 110.19, and GBP/JPY falling 0.28% to hit 126.35.
 
Market eyes were expected to focus on U.S. labor data and consumer price index numbers due out Thursday.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Asian stocks eased on Thursday
following a negative lead from U.S. technology shares, while the
Swiss franc stayed buoyed after plans to curb the currency
disappointed those looking for more drastic action.	
The Swiss National Bank said it would expand its liquidity
policy but stopped short of introducing a franc exchange rate
peg, a topic hotly discussed in markets over the last few days
as a way to cool the red-hot currency. 
 Still, markets are a lot calmer compared with last week,
when a crisis of confidence swept through global financial
markets after Standard & Poor's cut the United States triple-A
credit rating.	
 The historic downgrade came amid fears of a global recession
as both the United States and the euro zone struggled to tackle
their sovereign debt problems, all of which remained unresolved.	
 That saw investors take refuge in safe-havens, sending not
just gold but the Swiss franc soaring as well, a move that is
forcing the Swiss authorities to take more action.	
 ""The mood has improved over the past week from sheer panic
to a more garden-variety uncertainty about the future,"" said
Bricklin Dwyer, economist at BNP Paribas.	
 With market sentiment still fragile, traders said data due
later in the day, including U.S. consumer prices, existing home
sales and regional manufacturing data will be closely watched.	
 Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 0.35 percent,
while stocks elsewhere in Asia as measured by MSCI
edged down 0.43 percent.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index shed 0.69 percent,
although wealth manager AMP jumped after reporting
upbeat results. 
 Australian brewer Foster's crept up 0.6 percent
after the company rejected a $10 billion offer from rival
SABMiller for a second time. 
 Meanwhile, gold traded at $1,785 an ounce, holding
not far from a record high around $1,813.79 set last week. U.S.
crude  was a touch softer at $87.22 a barrel.	
 In the currency market, the dollar traded at 0.7906 Swiss
francs , having retreated from a two-week high around
0.8011, while the euro stood at 1.1394 francs , down
from Wednesday's peak around 1.1554.

as investors appeared uninspired by a meeting between French and German leaders to address Europe’s debt crisis.
 
EUR/USD hit 1.4518 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since July 27; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4425, falling 0.01%.
 
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4151, last Friday’s low, and resistance at 1.4518, the day’s high.

In Tuesday’s meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel the two proposed the formation of a “euro council” to be led by current EU President Herman Van Rompuy.
 
But the two rejected an expansion to the USD633 billion rescue fund for debt-threatened countries in the euro-zone, calling instead for tighter regional budget rules and a resubmission of a financial transaction tax.
 
European shares ended their trading day mixed, with France’s CAC 40 closing up 0.73% to 3,254, while Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.49% to 5,331, and Germany’s DAX lost 0.77% to 5,949.

In early Asian trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.02% to hit 1.4428.
 
According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Wednesday, the producer price inflation index rose by 0.2% in July, after a 0.4% decline the previous month. Market expectations were for a July increase of 0.1%.
 
The core PPI, which does not include food and energy, increased by 0.4% in July, suggesting that lower oil prices have not yet been digested throughout the U.S. economy.
 
By the end of Wednesday’s U.S. trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.04%, to close at 11,410. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.47% to 2,511, and the S&P 500 eased up 0.09% to 1,194.
 
In remarks earlier in the day, Dallas U.S. Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher objected to the recent move by the Fed to extend ultra-low rates until 2013. 
 
Fisher, one of three dissenters from the August 9 Fed decision, said that keeping interest rates at low levels, businesses would have little incentive to spend or hire new employees.
 
The U.S. unemployment rating currently stands at 9.2%.
 
The last time that there were three dissents from Fed board presidents was in November of 1992 under then-Chairman Alan Greenspan.

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - World equities faltered on
Wednesday, pulled down by a fall in U.S. technology stocks and
resurgent skittishness after Swiss measures to halt the franc's
rise frustrated investors seeking harsher steps.
 The turn in sentiment was marked by a sharp reversal in the
U.S. Treasury market, where prices for the benchmark 10-year
note shot up, pushing its yield down to 2.17 percent. Gold
pared early gains but signs of rising inflation and a lack of
solution to the euro zone debt crisis underpinned bullion.
 The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, dropped across the board, hurt
by sharp losses versus the franc, which strengthened even after
the Swiss National Bank announced a series of measures to halt
the currency's steady appreciation. For details see

 The plight of the franc was part of a larger battle over
Europe's fiscal crisis, with the Swiss currency a beneficiary
of investors seeking safety in a currency other than the euro.
 ""You're pitting an economy with less than 8 million people
(Switzerland) against the euro zone, with a population of 338
million,"" said Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist at
CitiFX, a division of Citigroup, in New York.
 ""If euro zone investors want to buy the Swiss franc because
they don't feel safe, there's nothing the Swiss can do about
it,"" he said.
 The euro tumbled more than 2 percent against the franc
 in volatile trade to hit a low of 1.12248 francs,
and was last at 1.1392 francs, down 0.7 percent.
 The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.38 percent at 73.732.
 U.S. stocks turned south at midday but later pared some
losses. Shares of Dell Inc  slumped 10 percent, a day
after the world's second-largest PC maker slashed its full-year
revenue forecast, citing weak technology spending.

3.56 percent from 3.67 percent on Tuesday.
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-country world
equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, gained 0.35 percent.
 The sharp turn in markets came after European equities

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc jumped on
Wednesday and could hit record peaks against the dollar and
euro in days ahead as new measures by the Swiss National Bank
and Swiss government slow the pace of the currency's climb
disappointed investors who had bet on more aggressive action.
 The Swiss franc strengthened even after the SNB said it
would boost liquidity by expanding sight deposits to 200
billion francs from 120 billion, reiterating it would take
additional steps if needed. For story, [ID:nL5E7JH1C9]
 While the SNB expanded its liquidity policy, investors were
disappointed that it did not include a franc exchange rate peg.

announce plans to adopt a currency peg and the price action
today argues that they are unwinding those positions,"" said
Jessica Hoversen, FX analyst at MF Global in New York.
 ""The SNB, however, is testing the water and a peg has not

 The dollar fell 0.9 percent to 0.7894 franc .
 ""Based on the price action, it looked like the market was
positioning for stronger action such as an intervention package
from the Swiss government and they didn't get that,"" said Greg
Anderson, senior currency strategist at CitiFX, a division of
Citigroup, in New York.
 At the end of the day, however, Swiss policy doesn't
matter, he said. ""You're pitting an economy with less than 8
million people against the euro zone with a population of 338
million. If euro zone investors want to buy the Swiss franc
because they don't feel safe, there's nothing the Swiss can do
about it.""
 Spot traders reported abnormally wide spreads being quoted
in the franc while in the options market, overnight implied
volatility continued to trade at extreme levels of over 50
percent on jitters over the potential for more SNB action.
 One-week implied vols were also elevated, trading around
24.1 percent on Wednesday. A week ago, vols were at 18
percent.
 The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, dropped across the board, hurt
by sharp losses versus the franc and improved risk appetite,
with most commodities higher.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4446  in choppy
trading, moving in tandem with the euro/Swiss franc.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.4 percent to 76.46
, near levels seen before Japan's yen-selling
intervention on Aug. 4 and hovering near a record low of 76.25
yen in March.
 ""The Bank of Japan is caught between a rock and a hard
place,"" said MF Global's Hoversen. ""Intervention did not work
earlier this month, but investors also do not want to be caught
on the wrong side.""

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - World equities faltered on
Wednesday, dashed by a downturn in U.S. technology stocks and a
return of investor skittishness after Swiss measures to halt
the franc's rise frustrated investors seeking harsher steps.
 The turn in sentiment was marked by a sharp reversal in the
U.S. Treasury market, where prices for the benchmark 10-year
note shot up, pushing its yield down to 2.18 percent. Gold
prices also reversed course and turned lower.
 The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, dropped across the board, hurt
by sharp losses versus the franc, which strengthened even after
the Swiss National Bank announced a series of measures to halt
the currency's steady appreciation. For details see

 The plight of the franc was part of a larger battle over
the European debt crisis, with the Swiss currency a beneficiary
of investors seeking safety in a currency other than the euro.
 ""You're pitting an economy with less than 8 million people
(Switzerland) against the euro zone, with a population of 338
million,"" said Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist at
Citigroup.
 ""If euro zone investors want to buy the Swiss franc because
they don't feel safe, there's nothing the Swiss can do about
it,"" he said.
 The euro tumbled more than 2 percent against the franc in
volatile trade  to hit a low of 1.12248 francs as
safe-haven demand for the Swiss currency resumed. The single
currency was last at 1.14060 francs, down 0.5 percent.
 The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.42 percent at 73.696.
 U.S. stocks turned south at midday. The Nasdaq fell 1
percent and shares of Dell Inc  slumped 10 percent a
day after the world's second-largest PC maker slashed its
full-year revenue forecast, citing weak technology spending.
 Shortly after 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was down 34.21 points, or 0.30

at 2,503.92.
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-country world
equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, gained 0.1 percent.
 The sharp turn in markets came after European equities
closed at their highest level in more than a week as investors
trained their sights on company earnings and attractive equity
valuations following a dismal opening. A Franco-German meeting
on Tuesday failed to appease investors. [ID:nL5E7JH1OA]
 ""Volatility remains the fundamental theme of the markets at
the moment. But there is still a lot to be positive about,
given where valuations are and as balance sheets look very

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - World equities rose on
Wednesday, lifted by strong outlooks and results from U.S.
retailers, while crude oil gained on a larger-than-expected
decline in U.S. gasoline supplies.
 The earnings reports from consumer bellwethers Target Corp
 and Staples Inc  pushed U.S. Treasury prices
down, as did fears that inflation may be on the rise after a
Labor Department report showed rising producer prices. For

 European stocks, which had fallen as financials bore the
brunt of selling on Tuesday after French President Nicolas
Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to appease
investor concerns about Europe's debt crisis, rebounded.
 Stocks also gained as investors speculated the Federal
Reserve will again intervene in the U.S. bond market in an
attempt to shore up a still-struggling economy.
[ID:nN1E77G0DE]
 Investors are watching for any indications of further
monetary easing, in particular when Federal Reserve Chairman

 ""Part of the stabilization in the equity market is that
there is some expectation that there is going to be something
coming out of those meetings,"" said Alan De Rose, head trader
of government trading and finance at Oppenheimer & Co in New
York.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 8/32 in price to yield 2.25 percent.
 Both Target and Staples posted better-than-expected
quarterly earnings, leading Target to forecast a more
profitable year than analysts expected and Staples to raise its
profit outlook.
 Deere & Co  and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc  also
posted better-than-expected quarterly profits.
 ""We've seen some household names put out better earnings
numbers this morning, and that's extremely constructive,"" said
Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New

 * Swiss franc surges as lack of radical SNB measures
disappoint
 * Market stays wary over potential for currency intervention
 * Euro steady versus dollar, yen nears record high

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc jumped sharply on
Wednesday as fresh steps by the Swiss National Bank to stem the
currency's gains disappointed a market positioned for more
radical measures.	
 The SNB said it would boost liquidity by expanding sight
deposits to 200 billion francs from 120 billion, reiterating it
would take additional steps if needed, which market players said
could mean direct intervention or setting a floor on the
euro/Swissie exchange rate. 
 ""There is disappointment in the lack of a strong commitment
to measures that would stand in the way of a strong Swiss
franc,"" said Michael Sneyd, currency strategist at Societe
Generale.	
 The euro tumbled more than 2 percent against the franc in
volatile trade to hit a low of 1.12248 francs on EBS
trading platform as safe-haven demand for the Swiss currency
resumed.	
 Earlier, the euro had strengthened past 1.15 francs for the
first time this month as talk the Swiss might introduce a lower
target level against the single currency left traders wary of
betting against such a move.	
 Spot traders reported abnormally wide spreads being quoted
in the franc while in the options market, overnight implied
volatility continued to trade at extreme levels of over 50
percent on jitters over the potential for more SNB action. 
 SocGen's Sneyd said investors would be aware that more
measures could be announced later this week or over the weekend.	
 The Swiss cabinet may hold a press conference following a
meeting later on Wednesday, or possibly on Thursday, to discuss
the impact the strong currency is having.	
 ""The Swiss franc will very much remain a favoured currency
because of ongoing concerns about the euro zone debt crisis and
it will be a battle between those who want to buy Swiss francs
and the authorities who want to stem its gains,"" Sneyd said.	
 The euro was last down 0.6 percent at 1.1400 francs, still
comfortably away from its record low of 1.0075 hit just over a
week ago. The dollar was down 0.9 percent at 0.7890
francs.	
 
 EURO ZONE WORRIES	
 Lena Komileva, global head of G10 currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman, said the SNB's measures were ""inadequate in
an environment where investors are seeking safe havens"", adding:
""This will invite more speculative flows into the Swiss franc.""	
 Demand for safe-haven assets was expected to continue as
concerns remain about a weakening global economy and the lack of
a clear solution to the euro zone debt crisis. This also kept
the yen firm, with the dollar down 0.35 percent at 76.50 yen
, near a record low of 76.25 yen.	
 French and German plans for closer fiscal integration failed
to convince investors that leaders had gone far enough to tackle
the spreading debt crisis, weighing on sentiment towards the
euro.	
 But traders said Middle East demand helped lift the euro 0.3
percent against the dollar to $1.4453, off a session low
around $1.4324.	
 A move back below support at its 100-day moving average
around $1.4356 and the 55-day moving average at $1.4330 could
leave the euro open to a test of last week's low just above
$1.41.	
 Traders said a large $1.40/1.47 double-no-touch range bet
may well serve to keep the euro restricted against the dollar,
at least until the structure is said to expire around the middle
of next week. 
 France and Germany unveiled plans on Tuesday for closer euro
zone integration, including deficit limits and biannual summits
and said that joint euro zone bonds may be a longer-term option.

 Many experts believe the only way to ensure affordable
financing for the bloc's most financially distressed countries
would be for the euro area to issue joint bonds.

 LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - World stocks dipped while
top-rated government bonds rallied on Wednesday as investors
grew concerned that French and German plans for closer fiscal
integration may be insufficient to stop the regional debt crisis
from spreading further.	
 The Swiss franc surged against the euro after fresh measures
announced by the Swiss National Bank to counter the franc
strength did not contain drastic moves such as an exchange rate
target which some had expected. 
 France and Germany unveiled far-reaching plans for closer
euro zone integration on Tuesday but stopped short of increasing
the size of the region's rescue fund and rejected for now the
idea of a common euro bond. 
 Support for a common bond had been growing as it is
increasingly seen as a way to allow highly indebted euro zone
countries to regain access to commercial markets while providing
investors a safeguard through joint liability.	
 ""There weren't any scoops as the proposals had been
mentioned over the past few days. Overall, the outcome of the
meeting wasn't convincing, with no euro bond project,"" said
Patrice Perois, trader at Kepler Capital Markets, in Paris.	
 MSCI's world equity index fell 0.1 percent,
having hit a 1-1/2 week high on Tuesday. The index hit an
11-month low earlier in August during a volatile week which saw
a rush to safe-haven assets.	
 European stocks fell half a percent while emerging
stocks were steady.	
 Investors were particularly unimpressed by a plan to tax
financial transactions.	
 ""A European Tobin-like tax is not the solution. Again,
European leaders fail to provide a proper answer to the right
question,"" Natixis said in a note to clients. 
 ""The efficiency of such a tax is clearly not proved.""	
 U.S. stock futures  pointed to a steady open on Wall

 U.S. crude oil  rose 1.2 percent to $87.68 a barrel.	
 German bund futures  rose 47 ticks.	
 The euro erased early losses to gain a quarter
percent to $1.4437. The dollar fel 0.2 percent against a
basket of major currencies.	
 The single currency fell more than 2 percent to 1.1224
francs as the SNB rejected for now measures such as
direct intervention or pegging the currency.	
 ""This is a disappointment as the market was expecting far
more radical measures from the SNB like targeting a specific
exchange rate,"" said Lena Komileva, senior vice president of
foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
 ""This is more of the same, and is inadequate in an
environment where investors are seeking safe haven. This will
invite more speculative flows into the Swiss franc.""

 By Daniel Magnowski	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The euro wobbled on Wednesday
after French and German leaders failed to deliver a solution to
the euro zone debt crisis and restore confidence after a global
market rout, while Japanese shares fell, dragged down mainly by
hi-tech.	
 European shares were expected to fall as much as 0.8 percent
when markets open.	
 Electronics stocks were weak across Asia after computer
maker Dell slashed its 2012 sales forecast late on
Tuesday, a deeply bearish signal not only for the shaky state of
global demand but for other hi-tech manufacturers, many of
which are listed in Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei. 
 Japan's Nikkei fall 1 percent, but then recovered to
be 0.4 percent down. Bellwether tech exporter Sony
sliding 2.7 percent after it cut the price of its Playstation 3
gaming console to boost sales.	
 In South Korea, LG Electronics tumbled 4.5
percent, though the benchmark KOSPI stock index was up
1.1 percent.	
 Adding to the cautious mood in Asia, S&P stock futures
 fell almost half a percent in early trade, extending
losses on Wall Street overnight, before levelling off by 0500
GMT. 
 Roland Randall, senior strategist at TD Securities in
Singapore said global markets were at the moment largely driven
by fundamentals, but still expected more policy initiatives
after the inconclusive Franco-German summit.	
 ""This is not panicking any more, it's just investors being
disappointed relative to expectations on these two fronts,
economic activity and evidence of central banks' and
politicians' efforts,"" he said.	
 The euro fell to $1.4407 from Tuesday's
session high of around $1.4470, as traders expected more
downward pressure once markets in Europe open later in the day. 
 A hotly anticipated meeting between French President Nicolas
Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday fell
short of producing a plan of dramatic action to tackle the euro
zone's debt crisis, an outcome many market watchers had
anticipated. 
 While long-term deficit reduction has become a pressing
problem for many developed economies, many investors fear that
calls for immediate spending cuts in many euro zone countries
and the United States could retard global growth further.	
 Germany reported on Tuesday that its economy came close to
stalling in the second quarter, though other data showed U.S.
industrial output rose at its fastest pace in seven months in
July, perhaps indicating the economy started the second half of
the year on better footing than many analysts had feared.
 


 ASIAN DEMAND	
 Still, many fund managers see Asian markets as more
promising investment targets than the United States and Europe.	
 ""Asia is not immune to the developed world woes, as the
region remains a key exporter,"" said a survey of investment
managers published on Wednesday by Singapore-based Russell
Investments.	
 ""However, the domestic story is becoming more and more
powerful as countries look inward to drive future growth.""	
 MSCI's broadest index of non-Japanese Asia Pacific shares
was up 0.9 percent, supported by gains in Hong
Kong, Australia and Thailand.	
 The index has lost around 10 percent since the start of the
year, much of it in recent weeks, as sovereign debt problems in
Europe and the United States as well as fears that the U.S.
could slide back into recession prompted investors to sell
equities and other riskier assets in both emerging and developed
markets. 
 Shares in Hong Kong were up 1.3 percent,
boosted by a speech by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Keqiang in which
he promised to open more sectors for investment from Hong Kong,
while a rise in Australia's main index was tempered by
global concerns.

 DOLLAR 
 The dollar index against major currencies was flat at
0500 GMT. Against the yen, the dollar traded around 76.67
, down from more than 80 yen earlier in August. 
 Gold , attractive to some investors as a refuge from
turmoil in currencies, bonds and shares, is one of the
best-performing assets this year. It traded at $1,784.44 per
ounce on Wednesday, little changed from the previous session
around $30 below the peak it touched last week. 
 U.S. crude oil futures  rebounded 62 cents to $87.10

412,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2011 07:36PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD dips in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro eased slightly against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, as a meeting of leaders from Europe’s two largest economies failed to excite the market on prospects of a solution to the region’s debt woes. 
 
EUR/USD hit 1.4410 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4390, falling 0.12%.
 
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4105, last Thursday’s low, and resistance at 1.4475, Monday’s high.
 
Earlier Tuesday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Paris to address the European debt crisis.
 
The two rejected an expansion to the USD633 billion rescue fund for debt-threatened countries in the euro-zone, calling instead for tighter regional budget rules and a resubmission of a financial transaction tax.
 
The leaders also proposed that nations consider enacting balanced budget provisions into national law and the formation of a “euro council” to be led by current EU President Herman Van Rompuy.
 
An attempt to pass a financial transaction tax in 2010 was rejected by the European Union.
 
Putting a further damper on enthusiasm for the euro, the European Union’s Eurostat announced that gross domestic product in the region eased up just 0.2% in the second quarter, falling short of a 0.3% market forecast.
 
Growth in Europe’s largest economy also slowed, as a report earlier in the day showed that Germany’s GDP rose 0.1% in the quarter ending in June. The second quarter figure was in marked contrast to a 1.3% expansion rate in the first quarter, and well below economist’s forecasts of a 0.5% rise.
 
European shares finished their Tuesday session mixed, with France’s CAC 40 down 0.25%, Britain’s FTSE 100 higher by 0.13%, and Germany’s DAX Index shedding 0.45%.

Market eyes were focused on Europe and a much anticipated meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met earlier Tuesday in Paris to discuss the European debt crisis.
 
The leaders of Europe’s two largest economies dismissed an expansion of the USD633 billion rescue fund for debt-threatened countries in the euro-zone, calling instead for tighter regional budget rules and a resubmission of a financial transaction tax.
 
Sarkozy and Merkel also vowed to protect the euro, by proposing that euro-zone nations consider enacting balanced budget provisions into national law and the formation of a “euro council” to be led by current EU President Herman Van Rompuy.
 
An earlier attempt to pass a financial transaction tax in 2010 was rejected by the European Union.
 
The resurrection of the tax proposal took its toll on U.S. financial issues with Wall Street putting an end to a three-day winning streak.
 
By the end of Tuesday’s U.S. trading session,the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.67%, to close at 11,405.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.24% to 2,523.45, and the S&P 500 eased 0.97% to 1,192.76.
 
Putting a further damper on market sentiment, the European Union announced that gross domestic product among the 17-nation euro-zone rose just 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.8% in the previous three-month period.
 
Market expectations were for GDP to expand by 0.3% in the region in the second quarter. 
 
Meanwhile, the greenback was up against the British pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.08% to 1.6443. 
 
The dollar lost ground against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY falling 0.03% to hit 76.77, and USD/CHF lower by 0.02% to hit 0.7958. 
 
The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD up 0.05% to hit 0.9828, AUD/USD lower by 0.08% to hit 1.0475, and NZD/USD falling 0.23% to hit 0.8341.
 
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.03% at 74.07.
 
The U.S. Department of Labor was to release its monthly core producer price index, an inflation indicator, on Wednesday.

By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro slid
on Tuesday after the leaders of France and Germany failed to
live up to market expectations for a solution to Europe's debt
crisis and weak German growth data renewed worries about the
world economic outlook.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel agreed to float proposals in September for a tax
on financial transactions and to push for closer joint
governance of the euro zone's economic policy. For details see:
[ID:nL5E7JG0IH]
 But the two leaders, meeting in Paris, said there was no
need to increase the size of the euro zone rescue fund and that
they saw no immediate need for joint euro zone bonds.
 ""Investors were looking for some big-picture solution to
the euro zone debt crisis. Looking at these headlines, I don't
think much has been achieved,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior
market analyst at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich,
Connecticut.
 German Bund futures  wiped out earlier losses and
rose, and prices of U.S. Treasuries advanced further. While the
euro briefly recouped losses against the dollar after Sarkozy
said he and Merkel are determined to defend the euro, it later
gave up those gains.
 The euro  fell 0.26 percent to $1.4407 as the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose 26/32 in
price, driving its yield down to 2.22 percent.
 Weak economic growth in Germany clouded the global economic
outlook before the Franco-German meeting ended. Germany
reported that growth in gross domestic product slowed to a mere
0.1 percent between April and June, the weakest quarterly rate
since 2009.
 The data from the euro zone fueled concerns about a Europe
already weakened by a fiscal crisis, an issue Merkel and
Sarkozy tried to address with wide-reaching plans.
 ""Overall there are a lot of question marks coming out of
this summit,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""This does not
seem to be a game-changer or a show-stopper.""
 Risky assets such as stocks and commodities have been hit
hard in recent weeks. Bank exposure to Greek and Italian debt
has raised short-term borrowing costs for European institutions
as well as the cost of insuring their debt against default.
 U.S. stocks fell after three days of gains and global
stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, were off 0.9 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 114.28
points, or 1.00 percent, at 11,368.62. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 15.98 points, or 1.33 percent, at
1,188.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 42.43
points, or 1.66 percent, at 2,512.77.
 Wall Street extended losses after news of the
Sarkozy-Merkel meeting.
 Earlier, Wall Street had pared some declines after a
better-than-forecast U.S. industrial output report for July and
Fitch's affirmation of its top credit rating for the United
States with a stable outlook.
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.17 percent at 73.962.

failed to calm concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro dropped against the
dollar on Tuesday as highly anticipated proposals from French
and German leaders failed to shore up investor confidence in
the euro zone.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel proposed a tax on financial transactions and
closer joint governance of economic policy to stop the debt
crisis in Europe. They did not propose an increase to the euro
zone bailout fund or selling euro zone bonds. For story
[ID:nLDE77F0SN] Highlights [ID:nL5E7JG1YQ]
 The proposals disappointed as they did not address problems
in France, nor the fact the European Financial Stability
Facility does not have enough resources to buy debt, or ways to
rekindle growth, said Marc Chandler, global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""This does not seem to be a game-changer or a
show-stopper,"" he said. ""Market participants went into this
summit with low expectations and they certainly met those low
expectations.""
 In early afternoon New York trade, the euro was trading at
$1.4392 , down 0.4 percent, with support at its 100-day
moving average around $1.43511. The euro hit a nearly
three-week high of $1.44779 on Monday.
 Not all in the market were so hard on the proposals.
 The press conference laid the groundwork for a European
Fiscal Union, according to Douglas Borthwick, managing director
at Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""The ingredients must be gathered before the pie is baked,
and this is exactly what France and Germany are lining up with
their discussions,"" he said. ""While the market may be less
excited about the comments, we are.""
 ""Europe is moving towards Fiscal Union, that we can be
assured of.""
 The euro had earlier traded above $1.44 while the greenback
rose to session highs versus the yen after Fitch Ratings
maintained the United States' AAA credit rating, with a stable
outlook. [ID:nN1E77F0FW].
 Dismal economic data weighed on the euro. Data released on
Tuesday showed gross domestic product in Germany -- the euro
zone's largest economy with standout performance among
industrialized nations -- grew marginally in the second quarter
and well below the consensus forecast. [ID:nLDE77F03P]
 GDP data from the euro zone also painted a bleak picture.
[ID:nLDE77F0DU]
 The euro gained against the Swiss franc to trade up 0.6
percent at 1.1398 francs . The Swiss National Bank was
earlier rumored to be checking rates in the currency forward
market; it later declined to comment.[ID:nWEA0783]
 The Swiss franc slid against the dollar and euro the last
few sessions on speculation the Swiss National Bank may take
drastic measures to curb gains in the currency by setting a cap
on the franc and pegging it to the euro. [ID:nL5E7JE04T]
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent against the yen to 76.72 yen
, near levels seen before Japan's yen-selling
intervention on Aug. 4 and hovering near a record low of 76.25
yen hit in March. The greenback earlier hit session highs after
the Fitch news.

NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped and the
euro slid on Tuesday after weak German and euro zone growth
data rekindled concerns about the world economy and boosted
demand for safe-haven assets like government bonds and gold.
 Concerns over the financial health of the euro zone
resurfaced as President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Paris to discuss ways of
restoring investor confidence in the euro zone. For details

 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell across the board
on Tuesday as weak German and euro-zone growth data sparked
concerns about a slowdown, damping risk appetite and boosting
demand for the safe-haven Swiss franc, yen and dollar.
 Investors are also focused on a summit where French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel
will discuss the region's debt crisis. Few analysts, however,
are counting on a credible solution to the euro zone's fiscal
problems.
 Ahead of the meeting of the two leaders, data showed
Germany's gross domestic product growth slowed to 0.1 percent
in the second quarter, below the consensus forecast of 0.5
percent. [ID:nLDE77F03P] That pushed the euro down more than 1
percent against the Swiss franc.
 GDP data from the euro zone showed the region's economy
grew by just 0.2 percent over the same period, adding to
pessimism about the currency bloc already struggling with an
escalating sovereign debt crisis. [ID:nLDE77F0DU]
 These concerns are likely to make investors wary about the
euro in the coming days.
 ""Weaker-than-expected euro zone data has cast a pall on the
market and raised risk aversion levels,"" said George Davis,
chief technical strategist, at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""As a result we've seen the euro come off and commodities
down as well. We're also seeing a bid in the U.S. dollar,""
 In early New York trading, the euro was down 0.4 percent
versus the dollar at $1.43830 , with support at its
100-day moving average around $1.43511. Subsequent buy attempts
have been tempered by Eastern European selling below $1.4400,
traders said.
 Sell-stops are cited below $1.4320, while on the topside
there is talk of option barriers at $1.45. The euro reached a
nearly three-week high of $1.44779 on Monday.
 Analysts said the euro-dollar trade is a technical
downtrend channel, with selling pressure expected above
$1.44-$1.45.
 SARKOZY-MERKEL MEETING
 Sarkozy and Merkel will meet in Paris from 1400 GMT and a
joint news conference is expected at 1600 GMT. Investors will
be keen for any sign of progress on the issuance of common euro
zone bonds, even though officials in Paris and Berlin said that
issue will not be addressed in Tuesday's talks.
[ID:nLDE77E0Q3]
 Germany, along with the Dutch government coalition party,
has voiced its objection to a euro bond issuance.
 Analysts said while the summit would be closely scrutinize
the meeting could be a disappointment, with no concrete or
long-lasting solution to a debt crisis that has spread from the
euro zone's periphery to the core economies of Italy, Spain,
and most recently, France.
 But some are not ruling out a positive outcome.
 ""There is potential for surprise after the attempt to lower
expectations. At the very least, some discussion of a
tightening of the enforcement of EU budget rules and some
increased coordination efforts,"" analysts at Brown Brothers
wrote in a research note.
 The euro fell to 1.12020 francs , down 1.1
percent in the wake of the German GDP data, giving back most of
Monday's gains. It trimmed losses on talk the Swiss National
Bank was checking currency forward rates. The SNB later
declined to comment.[ID:nWEA0783]
 The Swiss franc slid against the dollar and euro the last
few sessions on speculation the SNB may take drastic measures
to curb gains in the currency by setting a cap on the franc and
pegging it to the euro. [ID:nL5E7JE04T]
 Uncertainty on potential SNB action has showed up in the
options market, with implied volatilities, a measure of a
future movements, staying elevated. On Tuesday, euro/Swiss
franc one-month implied volatilities were trading at 20.35
percent . In April, volatilities were down at 8.5
percent.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 76.80 yen ,
dropping back to levels seen before Japan's record yen-selling
intervention on August 4, and hovering near a record low of
76.25 yen hit in March.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Stagnant growth in Europe's
powerhouse Germany knocked stocks lower on Tuesday and hit the
euro, fuelling investor fears that the global economy is slowing
more than expected.	
 Wall Street also looked set for losses at the open. 
 The German data sharpened market focus on Tuesday's meeting
in Paris between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, with investors looking for any signs
of new measures to contain the spreading euro zone debt crisis.	
 Germany's gross domestic product expanded just 0.1 percent
in April-June from the previous quarter, missing forecasts for
0.5 percent and knocking regional growth figures below
expectations too. 
 ""The global slowdown is gradually reaching Germany,"" said
Andreas Scheuerle, economist at Dekabank.	
 The data showed Germany grew more slowly than battered,
debt-ridden Spain, which expanded by 0.2 percent.	
 Germany's slowdown sent European stocks lower, dragging
world equities with them, and later figures showing the euro
zone as a whole grew a slower than expected 0.2 percent did
nothing to improve sentiment.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.4 percent and
MSCI's all-country world stock index lost half a percent.	
 Stocks had been rebounding somewhat from a battering that
last week took the MSCI index down as much as 20 percent from a
three-year high in May.	
 The U.S. S&P 500 index gained 2.18 percent on Monday.
Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.23 percent on Tuesday.	
 
 EURO ANGST	
 The euro was down, extending losses after the German data.
It fell 1 percent against the Swiss franc at 1.1219 francs
and half a percent against the dollar at
$1.4366.	
 The franc has been a key safe haven for investors during
recent market turmoil.	
Gold , the other major risk-off choice and one of the
best performing assets this year, was up around 0.6 percent at
$1,775 an ounce.	
 German government bond prices firmed after the growth data.	
 Investors were meanwhile hoping the Franco-German meeting
later in the day would come up with ways to improve euro zone
governance. 
 Talk of common euro zone bonds -- increasingly seen as a
powerful tool against the region's debt hurdles -- in some of
the German media in recent days has lifted hopes, but both
countries said euro bonds were not on Tuesday's agenda.

 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Stagnant growth in Europe's
powerhouse Germany knocked stocks lower on Tuesday and hit the
euro, adding to investor fears that the world economy is slowing
more than expected.	
 Focus was also on a meeting in Paris between French

April-June from the previous quarter, below market expectations

 The data showed Germany was actually growing at a slower
pace than battered, debt-ridden Spain, where gross domestic
product grew by 0.2 percent in the second quarter.	
 Germany's slowdown sent European stocks lower, dragging
world equities with them.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was down more than 1 percent
and MSCI's all-country world stock index lost a third of a

Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.23 percent on Tuesday.	
 
 EURO ANGST	
 The euro was down against both the Swiss franc and the
dollar, extending losses after the German data.	
 It was down 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc at 1.1232
francs and 0.4 percent against the dollar at
$1.4301.	
 The Swiss franc has been a key safe haven for investors
during recent market turmoil.	
Gold , the other major choice and one of the

 German government bonds firmed after the growth data, with
short-dated paper outperforming.	
 Some investors were hoping the Franco-German meeting later

Talk of common euro zone bonds -- increasingly seen as a

meeting in Paris.	
 Both countries have said, however, that euro bonds are not

 By Daniel Magnowski	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro slipped further
on Tuesday and European stock futures fell after data showed
Germany's economy hardly grew in the second quarter, adding to
global uncertainties ahead of French-German talks on the euro
zone's worsening debt crisis. 
 U.S. stock futures  also extended early losses to
0.8 percent and Asian shares pared gains after the report that
Germany's gross domestic product grew just 0.1 percent in
April-June from the previous quarter, below market expectations
for an expansion of 0.5 percent. 
 European stock index futures  fell 0.7 percent
while German DAX futures  slid 0.9 percent. Before the
report, major European markets had been expected to open
slightly higher following strong gains on Wall Street overnight.

 The euro fell further after the German data,
hitting $1.4385 on the EBS trading platform and taking its
losses to about 0.4 percent on the day. 
 It had risen 1.4 percent in the previous session ahead
of a meeting between the leaders of France and Germany on
Tuesday (1400 GMT), and was already looking vulnerable to a
pullback. 
 Most in the market do not expect the meeting
between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel to lead to substantial progress in solving the
euro zone's debt troubles.	
 The German government sees no major breakthrough
at the Paris talks, a spokesman said on Monday, while the French
president's office said the creation of common euro zone bonds
will not be on the agenda.	
 ""Sovereign debt concerns remain a persistent negative for
the (euro), as the EU's latest attempt at delivering a
comprehensive solution to the region's vulnerabilities has
disappointed investors,"" analysts at Standard Chartered said in
a research note. 
 Traders were also awaiting euro zone second-quarter GDP
data at 0900 GMT.

 
 EURO 
 Many experts say the only way to ensure affordable financing
for the euro zone's most struggling, debt-laden countries would
be for the bloc to issue joint eurobonds.	
 But even if a common euro zone bond were issued, it would
not end the euro zone's debt woes at a stroke. 
""There still hasn't been debate about just how much issuance
would be possible and just how much issuance the German public
would be okay with,"" said Makoto Noji, senior bond and currency
strategist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. 
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies
edged up 0.2 percent.	
 Against the yen, the dollar traded around 76.84 , down
from more than 80 yen earlier in August. 
 
 EQUITIES	
 Asian shares initially drew succour on Tuesday
from news that Google has offered to buy Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc for about $12.5 billion. The deal
helped push up major Wall Street indexes by as much as 2.2
percent. 
 But most Asian markets later pared gains, with Australia and
Hong Kong felling into negative territory, following
weakness in S&P futures and in Europe. 
 Japan's Nikkei struggled to close 0.2 percent
higher , while MSCI's index of Asia ex-Japan stocks
rose 1 percent, but the gain was largely due to a
sharp jump in Korean shares which were catching up to regional
gains on Monday, when Seoul markets were closed for a holiday.	
The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index had lost around 14 percent over
the past two weeks, part of a global market rout in which
billions of dollars were wiped off share indexes.	
Pranay Gupta, chief investment officer Asia Pacific
at ING Investment Management, said Asia's corporate sector is
struggling despite the region's strong economic fundamentals,
due to debt woes in the United States and Europe, and the
appreciation of Asian currencies. 
 ""The anomaly that we have today is that companies in Asia
are facing a much more uphill struggle both on the sales front
and on the margins front given that demand from the West is
waning,"" he said.	
 He said that the ING Investors Dashboard Pan-Asia (ex-Japan)
Sentiment Index, a measure of private investor confidence in the
region, had dropped 11 percent in the second quarter compared to
last year's third quarter.	
 The S&P 500 last week hit its lowest in nearly a year after
the first-ever downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit ratings, but
have since rebounded almost as sharply . 
 Gold , seen by many as a safe store of value in
turbulent financial markets, is one of the best-performing
assets this year. It traded at $ 1,767 per ounce on
Tuesday, little changed from Monday's close and around $50 off
its peak. 
 U.S. crude oil futures  slipped 75 cents to
$ 87.16 per barrel after a $2 rise on Monday.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro dipped against
the dollar on Tuesday, having eased off the previous day's
three-week high, with the focus on whether a Franco-German
summit will lay the groundwork for further measures to help
quell the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.	
 The euro clung to much of the gains it made on Monday ,
when it rose roughly 1.3 percent, cheered by news the
European Central Bank spent a record 22 billion euros on
government debt last week, and signs of stabilisation in equity
markets.	
 The single currency faces a crucial test on charts
at levels just under $1.45. Trendline resistance drawn off peaks
hit in early June and late July comes in roughly around $1.4470
to $1.4480.	
 A breach of those levels may set the euro up for more gains,
but a failure to break above the resistance could bode ill for
the single currency. 
 The next key event for the euro is Tuesday's summit between
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel. The two leaders will meet in Paris from 1400 GMT and a
joint news conference is expected at 1600 GMT. 
 A focal point is whether there will be any signs of progress
toward the issuance of joint eurobonds, although officials in
Paris and Berlin have said Tuesday's talks would not address
that possibility. 
 Market players said the euro could draw support if Sarkozy
and Merkel hint at the possibility of eurobond issuance. Still,
even such a plan may not be a panacea for the euro zone's
sovereign debt woes.	
 ""Some further clarification on the eurobond issue would
undoubtedly be positive for the euro, but that's still about the
safety net, and not the fundamental reasons behind the debt
crisis,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.	
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.4418 . It had risen
to a high near $1.4477 on Monday, its highest in nearly three
weeks.	
 Traders cited stop-loss euro sell orders at $1.4400. There
was also talk of more stop-loss offers below that level. On the
upside, stop-loss euro bids were said to be lurking near $1.4500
and $1.4550.	
 Market players were sceptical that any major
initiatives would be announced at Tuesday's summit.	
 ""I think the whole eurobond issue is something that, even if
it is being discussed, is going to take time. I think it's
pretty unlikely to be announced at this meeting,"" said Adarsh
Sinha, Asia-Pacific G10 FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch in Hong Kong. 
 The summit may focus on fleshing out some details regarding
""economic governance"", said Rob Ryan, FX strategist at BNP
Paribas in Singapore.	
 ""If Germany is going to eventually end up supporting a
eurobond it will have to be in conjunction with a very strong
framework to ensure effective control of other countries' fiscal
spending so that its commitment does not become open-ended,""
Ryan said.	
 
 SWISS FRANC	
 The euro dipped 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.1280 , giving back some of the gains it made on
Monday, when it surged roughly 2.3 percent.	
 The Swiss franc had slid against the dollar and the euro on
Monday on speculation the Swiss National Bank may soon take
further action to curb gains in the currency by setting an
exchange-rate target.	
 Such speculation gained ground after Swiss newspaper
SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday the central bank was poised
to set a target at a little over 1.10 francs per euro.

 The dollar fell 0.3 percent against the Swiss
franc to 0.7822 franc , but remained well above a record
low of 0.70676 hit last week on trading platform EBS.	
 The heightened speculation that the Swiss National
Bank could set a target level for the Swiss franc versus the
euro comes after the SNB surprised markets earlier in August by
cutting its interest rate target down close to zero.	
 The efforts by Swiss authorities to stem the Swiss franc's
rise and speculation about the potential for more action have
stirred talk that the yen may end up becoming the safe haven
currency of choice, if market tensions flare up again.	
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 76.88 yen ,
having dropped back to levels seen before Japan's record
yen-selling intervention on Aug. 4, and hovering near a record
low of 76.25 yen hit in March.

In early Asian trade USD/JPY hit 76.76, the pair’s lowest since August 1; the pair subsequently consolidated at 76.88, addling 0.04%.  
 
The pair was likely to find support at 76.31, last Thursday’s low, and resistance at 77.22, Thursday’s high.
 
Markets were greeted Monday by a report from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York that its index of manufacturing conditions declined in August, falling 3.9 points to minus 7.7. July’s figure came in at 3.8.
 
The New York Fed’s Empire State manufacturing index, which measures economic health in the manufacturing sector by surveying about 200 manufacturers in New York State, had been expected to improve slightly to minus 0.4.
 
Despite the figures, Wall Street posted its third straight winning session, boosted by merger news and an 8% jump in shares from Dow Jones component Bank of America. 
 
The Dow closed up up 1.9%, to close at 11,182.90. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.9% to 2,555.20, and the S&P 500 gained 2.1% to 1,204.49.
 
Meanwhile, Japan’s gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% in the quarter ending June, according to figures released over the weekend by the Japanese Census Bureau. Economists forecasts were for Japan’s GDP to fall by twice that rate at 0.6% due to the lingering effects of the March 11 earthquake and tsunamis.
 
The Japanese economy contracted by 3.6% in the January to March quarter.
 
The yen has strengthened from its level on August 4 when the Bank of Japan intervened in the market to weaken the currency. Japanese exporters see diminished profits when the yen gains against its counterparts as earnings must be repatriated back into local currency.
 
Meanwhile the yen moved lower against the euro but gained against the British pound with EUR/JPY up 0.03% to hit 111.03, and GBP/JPY falling 0.07% to hit 125.83.
 
Japan’s Finance Ministry was to release its latest trade balance numbers on Wednesday, an indication of export conditions and domestic demand.

453,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2011 07:43PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD weakens in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro eased slightly against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, as European leaders prepared to meet over details on a bailout fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
 
 
EUR/USD hit 1.4453 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since August 1; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4442, falling 0.02%.
 
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4105, last Thursday’s low, and resistance at 1.4475, the day’s high.
 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were scheduled to meet Tuesday in Paris, to hammer out details on a European rescue fund to aid euro-zone countries in danger of debt insolvency.
 
The meeting had been arranged last week as rumors of a French credit rating downgrade rattled markets and sent French financial institution shares tumbling on European bourses. 
 
Germany’s Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, has been openly critical of the euro-zone rescue fund details saying that he opposed unlimited aid to debt-threatened  countries.
 
The European Central Bank began recently buying Spanish and Italian government bonds in order to strengthen those country’s financial standings in return for a tightening of adherence to EU budget rules.
 
France, Italy, Belgium and Spain introduced new bans on short-positions last Friday, in hopes that the moratorium on the practice would ""restrict the benefits that can be achieved from spreading false rumors"" following recent volatility in European markets, according to the European Securities and Marketing Authority.
 
U.S. financial issues, in Monday trade, led a surge on Wall Street, boosted by an 8% leap by Dow Jones component Bank of America Corp., which reported closing a deal to sell off its USD 8.6 billion Canadian credit card portfolio.
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.9%, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.9%, and the S&P 500 gained 2.1%.

In early Asian trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.03% to hit 1.4440.
 
Earlier in the day, a report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank showed that its index of manufacturing conditions worsened in August, falling 3.9 points to minus 7.7, following a minus 3.8 figure in July.
 
Economists had forecast the so-called Empire State manufacturing index, which measures economic health in the manufacturing sector by surveying about 200 manufacturers in New York State, to improve slightly since July to minus 0.4.
 
Wall Street posted its third straight winning session, boosted by merger news and an 8% jump in shares from Dow Jones component Bank of America. 
 
Market players greeted warmly the news that Google Inc would buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for USD12.5 billion.

Providing some optimism for improvement in global economic growth, Japan reported that its gross domestic product fell by 0.3% in the April to June quarter, from minus 0.9 the previous quarter. Although Japan’s GDP remained in negative territory, the quarterly figure was only half of analyst’s expectations of a minus 0.6% fall.
 
The Japanese economy contracted by 3.6% in the January to March quarter, the period during which the country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunamis.

 NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street rose
with oil prices on Monday as acquisition news and
stronger-than-expected economic data in Japan led markets to
steadily forge ahead after last week's wild swings.
 News that Google Inc  offered to buy Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc  for about $12.5 billion in cash

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc dropped to
two-week lows against the euro and dollar on Monday on
speculation the Swiss National Bank could further act to curb
strength in the currency by setting an exchange-rate target as
early as this week.
 The euro, meanwhile, rose to nearly three-week highs
against the dollar, boosted by some expectations of a positive
outcome of Tuesday's meeting between French President Nicolas
Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the
debt crisis.
 ""It's a 'risk-on' day, with the euro taking the lead.
Sarkozy's and Merkel's meeting tomorrow has calmed European
contagion fears a little bit,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior
vice president for capital markets at Tempus in Washington.
 The euro's gains, however, could be capped by persistent
worries about euro-zone bank stocks and the perceived risk to
France's credit rating.
 ""Of course, the other story of the day is the weakness in
the Swiss franc, although you've got to look at the issue
exclusively of what's happening in the dollar. I think right
now, euro/Swiss is trading within the range that Swiss
authorities want them to be.""
 Analysts, however, said unless the rumors and rhetoric
were backed by direct action from the SNB, the franc's losses
could be limited as economic uncertainty in both the United
States and Europe should keep it supported as a safe-haven
currency.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 1.6 percent at
1.12730 francs , though it was off a high of
1.14584 hit earlier on trading platform EBS, the euro's
strongest level since late July. Current levels were way above
last week's record low around 1.0075 francs.
 Speculation about a target level against the euro gained
ground after Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on
Sunday the SNB would soon set a limit for the euro/Swiss
pair.[ID:nL5E7JE04T]
 Talk about the peg intensified ahead of a government
meeting on Wednesday, with the SNB having key backing from
Switzerland's largest political party. [ID:nL6E7JC0KW]
 FRANC PEG IN 1.10-15 RANGE?
 Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities
in Toronto, said the fact that the euro/Swiss franc rally has
stalled after two days of aggressive short covering reflected
investors' belief that the SNB may consider the 1.10- to
1.15-franc area as the central point of a potential ""fixed""
trading band.
 In the options markets, implied volatility in euro/Swiss,
a a gauge of a currency pair's future movements, remained
elevated in the shorter dates, with one-month vols
 trading around 24 percent on Monday. That was
near last week's record level of around 32 percent, mirroring
the market's nervousness about potential sharp swings in the
spot rate.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 0.78020 franc ,
way above last week's record low of 0.70676.
 The euro rose sharply against the dollar, helped by the
single currency's gains versus the franc and a weak New York
manufacturing index, which slipped to -7.72 in August. See
[ID:nN1E77E0EK]
 In midday York trading, the euro was up 1.4 percent at
$1.44501 . Markets blew past an options barrier at
$1.44 and stops in the $1.4450-60 region to trade at $1.44779,
its strongest level since July 27 on trading platform EBS.
 Analysts said any signs Germany might be softening its
stance against a euro-zone bond was likely to support the
euro. Markets were also keen on the outcome of Tuesday's
meeting between Sarkozy and Merkel on the euro-zone debt
situation.
 Tempus' Salvaggio thinks Merkel will likely place the
""full might of Germany behind any bail-out package to stem the
European contagion.""
 The euro also benefited from news that the European
Central Bank spent 22 billion euros on government debt last
week, as it restarted a bond-buying program to stem the spread
of the euro zone debt crisis to Spain and Italy. The amount of
the ECB's purchase was the most the ECB has spent in any week
since it began buying debt in May of last year. See
[ID:nEAP50OF35].
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 76.710
yen , not far from a record low of 76.250 hit in
mid-March. Investors are reluctant to push the yen higher
because of the threat of Japanese intervention to weaken it,
but are equally loath to sell it against the dollar while the
magnitude of the current U.S. slowdown remains uncertain.

 NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened higher on
Monday, defying an unexpected drop in New York state's key
manufacturing index, as investors made a beeline for assets
cheapened by last week's rout, including commodities.
 World stocks climbed further out of their August hole,
after Japan's economy shrank less than anticipated in the
second quarter after companies made strides in restoring output
following a devastating earthquake and tsunami.
 ""The Japanese news, while not overly encouraging, was

 The S&P 500 hit near a one-year low last week as markets
tumbled initially on the first-ever U.S. credit ratings
downgrade and fears that Europe's debt woes may get out of
hand, before rebounding with almost equal force on the notion
the selloff was overdone.
 Monday's rebound was fueled partly by news that Google Inc
 had offered to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc

2 percent while Motorola Mobility jumped nearly 60 percent.

 In the United States, a gauge of manufacturing in New York
State showed the sector contracted for the third month in a row

 Among commodities, U.S. crude oil rose up to 2 percent,
touching a session peak of nearly $87 per barrel, after
trailing equity markets higher.
 The dollar's drop against the euro , to a one week
low of $1.42550, lent further support to commodities.
 On the euro zone crisis front, Italian economy minister
Giulio Tremonti's call for common euro zone debt issuance was

currency by weakening fiscal discipline among member states.

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc slumped to
two-week lows against the euro and the dollar on Monday on
speculation the Swiss National Bank would act further to counter
strength in the currency by setting an exchange rate target.	
 Speculation of a target level against the euro gained ground
after Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday a lower
limit for the euro/Swiss pair was poised to be set.

 But dealers said the sell-off in the franc was being driven
by speculation ahead of a government meeting on Wednesday, with
the SNB now having key backing from Switzerland's largest
political party, easing one of the barriers to direct selling to
weaken the franc. 
 ""The market now sees the possibility that the SNB has a plan
and this is making people nervous about the Swiss franc,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS.	
 ""There is also some speculation that they may target a rate
of 1.20 francs which seems to be driving today's moves, but as
yet the SNB hasn't mentioned a level and we have to wait until
the outcome of Wednesday's government meeting,"" he added.	
 The euro soared as high as 1.1458 Swiss francs on trading
platform EBS, and was last up 2.5 percent on the day at 1.1363
francs. Last week, the euro hit a record low around
1.0075 francs.	
 Implied volatility in euro/Swiss remained near historic
highs in the short-dates, with one-month vol trading around 24
percent, near last week's record level of around 27 percent,
showing the market is nervous over potential for further sharp
swings in the spot rate. 
 The dollar jumped 2.1 percent to 0.7938 francs , off an
early European high of 0.7998.	
 Some market players questioned whether implementing a target
level for euro/Swiss would be effective, given the nature of the
flows which have driven strength in the franc.	
 ""We are skeptical of the idea of targeting a level as Swiss
strength is being driven by savings deposits and other
real-money flows out of the euro zone and into Switzerland,
rather than speculators,"" said Kiran Kowshik, currency
strategist at BNP Paribas.	
 ""These flows are unlikely to reverse unless and until the
underlying drivers of those flows become less relevant,"" he
said, adding the sheer size of the forex market would make
sustaining a target level difficult for the SNB.	
 Turbulence in equity markets amid risk aversion following a
downgrade to the U.S. sovereign rating and an ongoing euro zone
debt crisis have seen the safe-haven Swiss franc rocket to
record highs, prompting the SNB to slash interest rates to near
zero and threaten to weaken its currency. 
 There was some semblance of normality in markets however,
with Wall Street ending higher on Friday after
stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data. European markets
were also in positive territory on Monday after last week's
introduction of a short-selling ban in France, Italy, Spain and
Belgium. 
 
 U.S. RETAIL DATA SUPPORTS DOLLAR 
 The dollar regained some footing against the yen after
retail sales posted the biggest gains in four months in July.
[ID:ID:nN1E77B08W] 
 The dollar last exchanged hands at 76.80 , up 0.2
percent for the day. It briefly rose to a session high of 77.10
yen. 
 The sharp rise in euro/Swiss helped the euro to rise 0.3
percent against the dollar to $1.4309 . 
 Analysts said the euro could gain further amid signs Germany
might be softening its stance against a euro zone bond. 
 Conservative newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported on Sunday
the German government no longer rules out agreeing to the
issuance of euro zone bonds as a measure of last resort to save
the single currency. 
 Just Friday, the German finance minister had rejected the
idea, saying this would undermine the basis for the single
currency by weakening fiscal discipline among member states.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed further out
of their August hole on Monday, lifted by signs of
earlier-than-expected recovery in Japan and a growing belief
that shares may now be cheap.	
 Wall Street looked set to add more gains at the open, but
European shares were flat, weakened by worries over euro zone
politics.	
 Gold and the Swiss franc, two of the main beneficiaries of
recent global risk aversion, fell.	
 Investors were weighing calls by Italian Economy Minister
Giulio Tremonti for a more coordinated response to the euro zone
debt crisis, including the creation of joint euro bonds, against
an immediate rejection of the idea from Germany.	
 France and Germany also squelched any idea of a new
initiative coming out of a meeting to be held by their leaders
on Tuesday.	
 MSCI's all-country world stock index , a
broad measure of global equity health, was up 0.6 percent,
ratcheting up roughly a six percent gain since hitting an
11-month low last Thursday.	
 ""The markets have been technically very oversold and on that
basis alone, they are due for a period of remission from the
selling,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at wealth manager
Brewin Dolphin.	
 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said a ""buy"" signal had been
triggered last week as flows out of risky assets hit significant
levels.	
 ""Since 2004, global equities have rallied an average 6.7
percent (in the four weeks that followed such a trigger)"", the
bank's strategists wrote in a note.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index was
up half a percent.	
 Shares in Asia were boosted by data showing Japan's economy
shrank less than expected in April-June following March's
earthquake and tsunami.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.37 percent.	
 
 SPILL OVER	
 The albeit tentative rise in confidence spilled into other
assets.	
 The euro gained 1.5 percent against the Swiss franc after a
Swiss newspaper report said the central bank was poised to set a
limit for the euro-franc exchange rate and will use all means to
defend it.	
 The dollar also rallied against the franc, rising 1.3
percent.	
 Otherwise the U.S. currency was down around 0.4 percent
against a basket of major currencies .	
 On the euro zone crisis front, Tremonti's call for common
euro zone debt issuance was rejected by German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble, who said such euro bonds would undermine the
basis for the single currency by weakening fiscal discipline
among member states. 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy are due to meet in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the
crisis. Germany said not to expect any breakthrough agreement;
France said euro bonds were not on the agenda.	
U.S. and core euro zone debt yields were flat.

 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares bounced
on Monday and European stocks looked set to follow as investors
returned to pick up bargains, while havens like gold and the
Swiss franc lost appeal.	
 But broader markets remained fragile ahead of a key
Franco-German summit that may offer a solution out of the
spreading debt crisis.	
 A 0.8 percent rise in U.S. stock futures  encouraged
selective buying in Asian equities, but all eyes were on the
summit and euro zone second-quarter GDP data , both on
Tuesday, for more clues on the global economic outlook and the
policy response needed to tackle Europe's debt quagmire.	
 Japan's Nikkei rose 1.4 percent after main Wall
Street indices advanced on Friday, but without the wild
intra-day swings that marked trading last week when the S&P 500
moved at least 4 percent up or down for four consecutive days.	
 This was only the third time such volatility had rocked
markets since the Great Depression in the 1930s, according to
research by BofA-Merrill Lynch.	
 European shares were also expected to open higher and extend
their rebound to three straight sessions. Financial
spreadbetters saw Britain's FTSE opening 0.5 percent
higher and Germany's DAX opening up 0.8 percent.

 Japanese shares were also boosted by data showing Japan's
economy shrank less than expected in April-June following a
devastating earthquake and tsunami in March. 
 Asian stocks outside of Japan rose by 2.1
percent, after tumbling nearly 4 percent last week, with key
indexes in Hong Kong and Australia up over 2 percent.	
 Frances Cheung, senior strategist at Credit Agricole in Hong
Kong, said the meeting between the leaders of France and Germany
on Tuesday would be crucial to determining whether any
longer-term solution to the euro zone's debt crisis is in the
works.	
 ""There is still a huge focus on money markets ... and
looking at them shows not everything is solved,"" she said.

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy are due to meet in Paris to hammer out a solution to the
debt crisis which has shown signs of engulfing the big economies
of Italy and Spain and heightened strains in money markets to
levels not seen during the 2008 crisis. 
 While dollar funding costs evident from cross currency basis
swap rates in dollar/yen and dollar/euros have cooled from last
week's peaks, they are still at elevated levels. 
 On a valuation basis, the MSCI index of Asia stocks outside
Japan trades at 11.5 times forward 12-month earnings, according
to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, above the 7.9 times seen during the
depths of the 2008 financial crisis.	
 That suggests investors may still not be in a hurry to buy
despite the 13 percent decline over the last two weeks.	
 Markets also remain vulnerable to declines as debt cutting
plans in Europe and the United States threaten to act as a
further drag on already weak economic growth at a time when
latest data has been patchy. 
 U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to its lowest level since
1980 in early August, data showed on Friday, though July retail
sales rose 0.5 percent.	
 
 FRANC TUMBLES	
 Adrian Foster, head of markets research for the Asia-Pacific
region at Rabobank International, said markets would start
focusing again on fundamentals such as corporate balance sheets
and consumer spending after the volatility in recent weeks. 
 Signs that equities might have marked a temporary bottom
after last week's volatile moves and persistent chatter that
Swiss authorities may peg the franc against the euro to battle
its surge sent the safe-haven currency tumbling by 2 percent
against the euro and the dollar. 
 The euro, which plumbed a record low around 1.0075 francs
last week, climbed to a high of 1.1351 francs , up
from 1.1079 late in New York on Friday.	
 But Barclays Capital analysts warned expectations of a peg
seemed overdone, believing the franc would rally once again this
week if markets started to change their view on its probability.

 ""We remain CHF bears in the medium run - we agree with the
SNB's view that it is ""massively overvalued"" - but, this week,
we are not expecting the recent appreciation of EUR/CHF to
hold,"" said Paul Robinson, strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 The drop in the franc rippled over into gold markets
with the precious metal slipping more than 1 percent in early
trade after a 1.5 percent slide in the previous session. 
 Gold, which had gained 9 percent so far this month
before Friday's slide, later pared most of its losses and stood
at $1,740 an ounce by mid-afternoon.	
 U.S. crude futures  were steady around $85.40 a barrel
after settling down slightly on Friday.

 By Saikat Chatterjee and Frederik Richter	
 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Asian equities
bounced on Monday and safe-haven assets like gold and the Swiss
franc fell as market players cautiously returned to pick up
bargains after last's week wild ride, though concerns over the
weak global economic outlook may keep gains in check.	
 A modest 0.4 percent rise in U.S. stock futures  also
encouraged some bargain hunting in Asian markets, but investors
may be more likely to sell into rallies than buy into any dips
ahead of fresh readings on the U.S. and euro zone economies this
week.	
 Japan's Nikkei rose 1.5 percent after main Wall
Street indices advanced on Friday but without the wild
intra-day swings that marked the first few days of trading last
week after the U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Standard and
Poor's.	
 Japanese shares were also boosted by data showing Japan's
economy shrank less than expected in April-June following a
devastating earthquake and tsunami in March. 
 Asian stocks outside of Japan rose by a similar margin
, after tumbling nearly 4 percent last week, with
key indexes in Hong Kong and Australia up nearly 2 percent.	
 Frances Cheung, senior strategist at Credit Agricole in Hong
Kong, said a meeting between the leaders of France and Germany
on Tuesday would be crucial to determining whether any longer
term solution to the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis is in the
works.	
 ""There is still a huge focus on money markets ... and
looking at them shows not everything is solved,"" she said.

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy are due to meet in Paris to hammer out a solution to the
sovereign debt crisis which has shown signs of ensnaring the big
euro zone economies like Italy and Spain and heightened strains
in money markets to levels not seen during the 2008
crisis. 
 In recent days, France itself has come under attack from the
markets.	
 While dollar funding costs evident from cross currency basis
swap rates in dollar/yen and dollar/euros have cooled from last
week's peaks, they are still at elevated levels. 
 On a valuation basis, the MSCI index of Asia stocks outside
Japan trades at 11.5 times forward 12-month earnings, according

sales rose 0.5 percent.	
 
 FRANC TUMBLES 
 Still, signs that equities might have marked a temporary
bottom after last week's volatile moves and persistent chatter
that Swiss authorities may peg the franc against the euro to
battle its surge sent the safe-haven currency tumbling by two
percent against the euro and the dollar. 
 The euro, which plumbed a record low around 1.0075 francs
last week, climbed to a high of 1.1294 francs in
morning trade, up from 1.1079 late in New York on Friday.	
 But Barclays Capital analysts warned expectations of a peg
seemed overdone, believing the franc would rally once again this
week if markets started to change their view on its probability.

 ""We remain CHF bears in the medium run - we agree with the
SNB's view that it is ""massively overvalued"" - but, this week,

 The drop in the franc rippled over into gold markets
with the precious metal slipping after a 1.5 percent slide in
the previous session. Before Friday's slide, gold had gained 9
percent so far this month.	
 U.S. crude futures  were steady around $85.50 a barrel
after settling down slightly on Friday. 
 Trading activity is expected to be thin with Korea and India
out and Japan's summer ""obon"" holidays this week.	
 Gold fell more than 1 percent in early trade before
paring most of its losses. By late morning it was at $1,744 an
ounce, little changed from late Friday U.S. levels.

 (Updates prices, adds quote)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The euro and dollar looked to
extend gains against the Swiss franc in the upcoming week as
investors remained cautious about potential Swiss National Bank
action to slow the pace of the franc's rise.
 Both the euro and dollar have racked up gains of roughly
seven percent the last two sessions. On Thursday, the SNB said
it could peg the franc against the euro, propelling both
currencies to their best one-day gains ever.
 The approval by the Italian cabinet of the country's
austerity plan did contribute to bids in the euro as well late
in the session. The single currency rose as much as 2 percent
on the day versus the Swiss franc. See [ID:nR1E7J601X]
 The yen, meanwhile, hovered in a tight range near a record
high versus the dollar on Friday, as markets remained alert for
possible Japanese intervention to halt its rally.
 The Japanese currency is expected to remain wedged in tight
ranges next week, with investors unwilling to test Japan's
resolve to keep the yen lower.
 Investors though remained transfixed on price action in the
Swiss franc crosses given the size of the moves.
 Pablo Frei, portfolio manager and senior market analyst, at
Quaesta Capital in Zurich, Switzerland said investors have
become a little more cautious about driving the Swiss franc
higher given the SNB's recent statements.
 Quaesta Capital is a currency fund of funds with assets
under management of about $3.5 billion.
 ""They're asking themselves whether the franc is trading at
a level that would still make sense for investors to buy.""
 Overall, Frei said news from either the United States or
Europe could drive the foreign exchange market next week,
adding that currency managers tracked by Quaesta have remained
generally risk-averse with short positions on the euro and
Australian dollar and longs on the yen.
 ""Investors are hoping things will improve in both the U.S.
and Europe so they don't have to think about the Swiss franc
anymore,"" Frei said.
 OVERVALUATION IN SWISS FRANC
 In late afternoon trading, the euro rose 2.0 percent to
1.10780 francs , rebounding from a record low of
1.0075 set on trading platform EBS on Tuesday. Despite the
latest move, the euro was still down 11.3 percent this year and
about 2.6 percent lower this month.
 The Swiss franc has become the most overvalued currency,
even more expensive than the Brazilian real, according to
Goldman Sachs estimates. At one stage this week, the franc was
overvalued by as much as 71 percent.
 Implied volatility on euro/Swiss franc, a gauge of the
market's expectations of future movements, slipped on Friday in
choppy trading as the pair swung from negative to positive
territory. One-month euro/franc implied vols 
closed at 22.65 percent from 22.25 percent on Thursday. These
levels though were below the record of 32 percent hit on
Tuesday.
 DOUBTS ABOUT THE FX PEG
 As the market digested the possibility of a currency peg in
the Swiss franc, most market participants have expressed doubts
about its viability.
 A peg -- essentially placing a ceiling on the franc --
could open the SNB to unlimited selling in the Swiss currency
and reserve accumulation and analysts considered the move
unlikely for now. Traders have cited speculation that the
euro/Swiss peg could be fixed at 1.15 francs.
 ""If the SNB commits to a peg, whether at current levels or
higher, their intervention commitment has to be unlimited. And,
presumably, the higher the level they choose to peg, the more
intervention may be required to hold it,"" said Ray Attrill,
senior currency strategist, at BNP Paribas in New York.
 The dollar rose 2.0 percent as well to 0.77740 franc
, but was 16.7 percent lower on the year and 1.8
percent weaker in the month of August.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 76.820 yen
, not far from an all-time low of 76.250 set on EBS in
mid-March. Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on
Friday he will consider various options if one-sided moves in
the yen continue. [ID:nT9E7J800K]
 BNP's Attrill said there is a very high risk dollar/yen
could break lower given little evidence of coordinated
intervention. ""Unilateral BoJ intervention would likely
struggle to effectively arrest"" a sharp fall in the dollar.
 The euro was little changed at $1.42489 , erasing
gains as data showing U.S. consumer sentiment worsened in early
August weighed on risk appetite. [ID:nN1E77B08W].
 Speculative investors have turned bearish on the euro, with
net short contracts of 8,273. See [IMM/FX].

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street on Friday strung
together two consecutive days of gains for the first time since
mid-July, while European stock markets rallied as a ban on
short-selling of financial shares threw the battered sector a
lifeline.
 Equities markets ended a whipsaw week on a relatively calm
note after a spike in volatility prompted by Standard & Poor's
downgrading of the U.S. credit rating.
 But markets did not escape the week unscathed. Credit
tightened in a reminder of the tensions seen in 2008 as
investors grew concerned that banks are too exposed to euro
zone debt. Key short-term funding measures showed costs rising
for banks to borrow money to cover obligations.
 The market turmoil sent fund investors out of both stocks
and bonds and into money markets and precious metals in the
week ended Aug. 10, data from EPFR Global showed. For details,
see [ID:nN1E77B0X8]
 World shares as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> lost 1.6 percent for the week, though they were
up 1.1 percent for the day. U.S. stocks recorded their worst
three-week decline since March of 2009, when they hit 12-year
lows.
 Composite volume on Wall Street was about 9 billion shares
on Friday, far below the almost 16 billion shares traded daily
on average this week.
 ""Today's slowdown in volume is clearly indicative of people
getting a little bit more comfortable about where the market
is,"" said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in
New York.
 The search for safety pushed benchmark U.S. Treasuries to
their largest one-week gain in two-and-a-half years. Ten-year
note yields plunged 30 basis points this week and at one point
tested record lows set in December 2008.
 Ten-year notes  were last up 25/32 in price to
yield 2.28 percent, down from 2.56 basis points a week ago.
 U.S. stocks ended modestly higher as investors took comfort
from U.S. retail sales that rose in July for the biggest gain
since March. That was tempered somewhat by a separate report
that showed consumer sentiment in early August fell to the
lowest since May 1980. [ID:nN1E77B08W] [ID:nN1E77A0H0]
 European shares <.FTEU3> closed up 3.6 percent. Bank
shares, which have fallen sharply in recent days, led the move
higher after the ban on short selling imposed by France, Italy,
Spain and Belgium.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 125.71
points, or 1.13 percent, to 11,269.02. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> added 6.17 points, or 0.53 percent, to
1,178.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 15.30 points,
or 0.61 percent, to 2,507.98.
 EURO ZONE WOES
 The four countries banned short selling -- borrowing shares
and selling them in expectation the price will fall -- of a
group of banks and financial institutions after a flurry of
rumors knocked a third of the value off some European bank
shares this month. [ID:nL3E7JC19I]
 Traders said the measure would provide temporary relief to
jittery investors. But concerns about euro zone debt problems
and a deteriorating outlook for the global economy are likely
to keep trading erratic.
 ""Data from various regulators of late have shown there is
no short-selling activity out of the norm,"" said Davide Burani,
financial analyst at Italian fund manager Horatius.
 Troubles in the euro zone were not very far from investors'
minds as the Italian government passed a sweeping package of
measures aimed at balancing the budget in 2013, a government
source said. [ID:nR1E7J601X]
 The strain in the dollar funding market, however, remains
high, as investors are skittish to lend their dollars due to
doubts that European authorities could solve the debt crisis.
 The benchmark London interbank offered rate on three-month
dollars  hit four-month highs of 0.29006 percent
versus 0.28617 percent on Thursday. The rate is a gauge of how
willing banks are to lend to one another.[MMT/]
 The Swiss franc  fell sharply for a second
session, a day after the Swiss National Bank said it may peg
the franc to halt its surge and as investors covered their
short positions.
 Safe-haven gold extended the previous session's retreat
from record highs. US gold futures for December delivery 
were down 3.6 percent at $1,747.80 an ounce.

 Investors also took comfort from U.S. retail sales that
rose in July for the biggest gain since March. That was
tempered somewhat by a separate report that showed consumer
sentiment in early August fell to the lowest since May 1980.
 Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity, and the retail sales data indicated the third quarter
was off to a promising start. For details, see [ID:nN1E77B08W]
[ID:nN1E77A0H0]
 Analysts said the sentiment report was disappointing, but
the drop was not too shocking, given recent political wrangling
over the U.S. deficit and declines in the stock market.
 Equities markets were relatively calm at the end of a
whipsaw week sparked by Standard & Poor's downgrading the U.S.
credit rating. Wall Street remains on track for its worst
three-week decline since March of 2009 when stocks hit 12-year
lows.
 U.S. stocks were up about 1 percent, while European shares
<.FTEU3> closed up 3.6 percent. Bank shares, which have fallen
sharply in recent days, led the move higher in Europe after the
ban on short selling imposed by France, Italy, Spain and
Belgium.
 ""Markets have stabilized a little bit after the
short-selling ban,"" said Colin McLean, managing director at SVM
Asset Management in Edinburgh. ""But banks have fallen pretty
far and most are oversold and are just bouncing off low
levels.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.3
percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 160.45
points, or 1.44 percent, to 11,303.76. The Standard & Poor's

shares this month. [ID:nL3E7JC19I]
 Traders said the measure would provide temporary relief to
jittery investors. But concerns about euro zone debt problems
and a deteriorating outlook for the global economy would keep
trading erratic.
 ""Data from various regulators of late have shown there is
no short-selling activity out of the norm,"" said Davide Burani,
financial analyst at Italian fund manager Horatius.
 Troubles in the euro zone were not very far from investors'
minds as the Italian government was set to pass a sweeping
package of spending cuts and tax increases as it scrambles to
meet European Central Bank demands for action to shore up
confidence in its public finances. [ID:nLDE77B0OP]
 ""Investors are selling in Italy from fear. Italian banks
are holding around 200 billion euros of Italian bonds,"" said
Burani. For a factbox, see [ID:nLDE77B0UO]
 The strain in the dollar funding market, however, remains
high, as investors are skittish to lend their dollars due to
doubts that European authorities could solve the debt crisis.
 The benchmark London interbank offered rate on three-month
dollars  hit four-month highs of 0.29006 percent
versus 0.28617 percent on Thursday. The rate is a gauge of how
willing banks are to lend to one another.[MMT/]
 The Swiss franc  fell sharply against the euro for
a second session, a day after the Swiss National Bank said it
may peg the franc to halt its rally, though many analysts said
such a move was unlikely.
 Safe-haven gold extended the previous session's retreat
from record highs. Spot gold  was down 1.7 percent at
$1,735.64 an ounce. It is still on track to rise more than 4
percent this week, and has risen 22 percent so far this year on
a potent mix of concerns over U.S. and euro zone debt levels
and economic growth.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was last
trading 25/32 higher in price and yielding 2.26 percent, down
from 2.35 percent late on Thursday.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - European stock markets
rallied on Friday as a ban on bearish bets in financial shares
tempted investors back into the battered sector, but world
shares trimmed gains after U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to
its lowest point in more than three decades.
 That data tempered earlier optimism after U.S. retail sales
rose in July to rack up their biggest gain since March.
Consumer spending accounts for two thirds of U.S. economic
activity, and the data indicated the third quarter was off to a
decent start. For details, see [ID:nN1E77B08W]
 ""The confidence was guaranteed to go down given all the
upsets in the market. Hopefully this won't be the precursor of
consumers' action in August,"" said Kurt Karl, chief U.S.

 But the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's

sentiment came in at 54.9, the lowest since May 1980.

 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell sharply
against the euro for a second session on Friday a day after the
Swiss National Bank said it may peg the franc to halt its
rally, though many analysts said such a move was unlikely.
 The yen hovered near a record high versus the dollar,
trading in a tight range as markets remained on alert for the
possibility of intervention by Japanese officials.
 The Swiss currency posted its worst day against the euro
and dollar on Thursday after an SNB official said the central
bank could ease monetary policy further and declined to rule
out the possibility of pegging the franc to the euro.
 A peg -- essentially put a ceiling on the franc -- could
open the SNB to unlimited franc selling and reserve
accumulation and most analysts considered the move unlikely for
now. Anchoring the franc on the euro, which is plagued by debt
problems in peripheral economies, could also risk destabilizing
the franc itself.
 ""We expect the SNB to continue with its less aggressive
tactics of targeting the interest rate through its target rate,
the money market and even bank account interest in an attempt
to create negative carry,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""Should this fail we would expect official intervention
would come well before the announcement of a peg.""
 The euro was last up 1.4 percent at 1.1007 Swiss francs
, moving further away from a record low of 1.0075
set on trading platform EBS on Tuesday. Despite the latest
move, the euro is still down about 12 percent against the franc
so far on the year.
 The dollar rose 1.2 percent to 0.7716 franc , but
was still 17 percent lower on the year.
 Gains in stock markets also put pressure on the safe-haven
franc. U.S. stock index futures added to gains after government
data showed retail sales in July posted their biggest gain
since March. For details, see [ID:nCAT005492]
 An increase in risk appetite boosted the euro, which last
traded up 0.2 percent at $1.4261 . The euro also drew
support from a rally in European shares sparked a short-selling
ban on financial shares, and data showing European banks were
not rushing to the European Central Bank for overnight funds.
 ""It's been a very hectic week with extreme volatility so
the market is now looking for calmer signals,"" said Audrey
Childe-Freeman, EMEA head of currency strategy at JP Morgan
Private Bank.
 ""From a risk sentiment perspective it will be interesting
to see if U.S. markets manage to post another positive session
after the rally yesterday. But in the euro zone there is still
wide range of uncertain factors, and that leaves a risk premium
in place.""
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 76.67
, not far from an all-time low of 76.25 set on EBS in
mid-March.
 Traders cited option barriers at 76.25 yen and 76.00 yen,
which could cushion the dollar's fall. Some said there was
strong demand for short-dated dollar call options with strike
prices around 78 yen to 79 yen, in case Tokyo does intervene.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Friday he
will consider various options if one-sided moves in the yen
continue. [ID:nT9E7J800K]

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - European stock markets rallied on
Friday as a ban on the short-selling of financial shares tempted
investors back into the battered banking sector, although
concerns over the health of French banks kept the mood edgy and
trading remained volatile.	
 Bank shares, which have fallen sharply in recent days, led
the move higher after the ban imposed by France, Italy, Spain
and Belgium.	
 World shares edged up, and the stocks rally boosted the euro
against the dollar and the safe-haven Swiss franc, but jitters
about the euro zone debt crisis were reflected in tense money
markets, where dollar funding costs rose.	
 Despite Friday's gains stock prices were still poised to end
another week in the red with investors unconvinced the selective
short-selling ban on its own would do much to ease broader
concerns that the euro zone debt crisis is spreading to stronger
economies. 
 The four countries banned short selling -- borrowing shares
and selling them in expectation the price will fall -- of a
group of banks and financial institutions, after a flurry of
rumours helped knock a third of the value off some European bank
shares this month. 
 Traders said the measure would provide temporary relief to
jittery investors, but concerns about euro zone debt problems
and a deteriorating outlook for the global economy were set to
keep trading erratic.	
 ""Something needed to be done, the rumours were silly and the
market was full of emotion and fear. So this provides a break in
that, so not bad,"" a London-based fund manager said. 
 ""I don't think it works long term but should buy some time.""	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
rallied 2 percent, clawing back after falling more than 1
percent in early trade. 
 European shares extended Thursday's sharp rise, but were set
to end the week around 2 percent lower, having tumbled more than
11 percent this month due to escalating doubts about the health
of the region's financial sector.	
 The MSCI world equity index rose 0.5
percent, although it remained on track to lose roughly 2 percent
on the week.	
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banks index rallied as much as
3 percent. Societe Generale rose 3 percent, clawing
back ground after a fall in its shares of more than 30 percent
this month as the French bank bore the brunt of the banking
sector sell-off.	
 Despite Friday's gains, market participants say the
short-selling ban may not enough to convince investors, and that
European banks may be vulnerable to more selling.

 SWISSIE SLIPS	
 Rumours about the health of European banks, questions about
the stability of money markets and growing fears that the U.S.
economy may tip back into recession or a prolonged period of
tepid growth have made markets extremely volatile. 
 The rise in share markets drove the euro to a session high
against the dollar although traders said it remained at
risk of renewed selling. Against a basket of currencies, the
dollar was down 0.3 percent on the day at 74.447.	
 Dollar funding costs rose as investors and banks continue to
hoard funds to protect themselves against more market
volatility.	
 The LIBOR interbank cost for three-month dollars rose to
0.29006 percent, rising from 0.28617 percent on Thursday,
according to the British Bankers Association. 
Traders have said that European banks have access to dollar
borrowings in short-term tenors of one night up to a week, but
after that point other banks are getting more selective about
who they lend to. 
 As a result, European banks desperate for longer-dated funds
are turning to FX forwards and swaps for their needs, causing a
sharp widening of the dollar premium in FX swaps -- especially
in the euro and yen markets.	
 German Bund futures  fell in volatile trade,
tracking the rise in stocks, but losses were limited as
investors unnerved by the escalation in the euro zone debt
crisis were expected to keep buying the bloc's safest debt.	
 Stronger equities also boosted oil prices, with Brent crude
 rising 0.5 percent on the day, although concerns about
oil demand in industrialised nations kept a lid on gains.	
 The safe-haven Swiss franc extended losses as
rising share prices stoked some demand for riskier assets, while
investors dumped the safe-haven currency on the possibility the
Swiss central bank may step up measures to stem its strength.	
 ""The downward pressure on the franc is partly due to
rebounding stock markets, talk of deeper negative rates on the
Swiss deposits and speculation of a peg,"" said Simon Derrick,
head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures slid 1
percent on Friday, pulling Asian shares off early highs, as
sentiment remained cautious on concerns over the European debt
crisis, which will probably keep supporting safe havens like
gold and Swiss franc.	
 Wall Street jumped 4 percent overnight in high volume, with
relatively low valuations and short-term oversold conditions
attracting buyers, though the see-saw moves this week appear to
be continuing with U.S. equity markets set for a weaker open.

 However, European shares were seen extending the previous
sessions gains, with investors seen focusing again on
macroeconomic fundamentals and bargain-hunters looking at
beaten-down stocks. 
 ""Markets are still trying to build a bit of a bottom and it
still needs to be proved that this is the bottom,"" said Shane
Oliver, head of investment strategy at Sydney-based AMP Capital,
which has more than $100 billion in assets under management.	
 ""For the next three months we are probably going to remain
volatile. Markets may not be as messy as the last two weeks but
I suspect the debt problems in U.S. and Europe will continue and
concerns over a U.S recession will linger for some time"".	
 Volatility across financial markets has spiked over the past
few weeks, with rumours flying about the health of European
banks, questions mounting about the stability of money markets
and growing fears that the U.S. economy may tip back into
recesion or a prolonged period of tepid growth.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
was roughly unchanged on the day, trimming
earlier gains as U.S. stock futures  sagged. 
 The index lost around 3.6 percent on the week,
underperforming the world index and taking Asia
ex-Japan year-to-date losses to more than 11 percent.	


 NAPPING BEARS	
 ""The risk-averse sentiment has not gone away really. For
today, the bears are resting,"" said Kumar Rachapudi, a fixed
income strategist at Barclays Capital in Singapore.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average reversed early gains to
end 0.2 percent lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
rose 1 percent and Australia advanced 0.8 percent.	
 Some fund managers in Asia with long-term horizons have been
slowly shifting their portfolios by buying more cyclical stocks,
which are more sensitive to changes in business cycles, and
reducing exposure to so-called defensive sectors. 
 ""As prices come down and correct, we add to our current
positions. We're not changing the basic strategy that we have
which is commodities and consumers,"" Mark Mobius, executive
chairman of Franklin Templeton's emerging markets group, told
Reuters Television.	
 ""We're looking for good consumer stocks and stocks in the
commodities area particularly oil that can benefit from what's
going on."" 
 Similar strategies may have more to do with valuations and
positioning than a call on global economic prospects.	
 For example, in some Asian markets, stocks in a defensive
sector such as consumer staples are running a bit expensive
relative to growth prospects compared with a cyclical sector
such as industrials. 
 A look at the ratio of price-to-earnings over estimated
earnings growth next year indicates Indonesia's consumer staples
are trading at 1.3 times versus 0.5 times among industrials,
Thomson Reuters Starmine showed. In Korea, staples are trading
at 1.0 time versus the 0.3 times of industrials.	
 That investors in U.S. stocks focused more on value
overnight despite the clear and present risks to economic growth
is not so surprising considering the S&P 500 index is trading
around 11.7 times forecast earnings in 12 months, well below the
10-year average of 16.2 times.	
 ""For now, we believe that picking the EM equity markets with
solid fundamentals remains a good strategy for global equity
managers in this current environment,"" Win Thin, Global Head of
Emerging Markets Strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a
note.	
 
 SAFE HAVENS TO STAY IN FOCUS	
 The safe-haven Swiss franc rebounded in Asia on Friday,
after posting record one-day falls against the euro and dollar
overnight after the Swiss National Bank threatened to step up
its fight to curb the franc's strength. 
 The euro was down 0.4 percent to $1.4190, though
global focus would likely be on how the single currency fares
against the Swiss franc.	
 The euro surged a record 5 percent against the franc
overnight, but was trading down 0.8 percent at 1.0761 francs in
Asian trading .	
 ""Market reaction was probably a reflection of how long
participants are of the Swiss franc,"" said Richard Grace, chief
currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank. 
 Gold prices were down marginally at $1,765.19 an ounce
, some 2.7 percent below a record high of $1,813.79 hit on
Thursday. Still the metal was up 6.2 percent this week, on
course for the biggest weekly gain since January 2009.	
 Oil  also snapped a two-day rising streak, falling 1.2
percent, after having gained 6.4 percent over the last two days.

 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss

previous session after the Swiss National Bank threatened to
step up its fight to curb the franc's strength.

to 1.0792 , after having tumbled by as much as 6
percent on Thursday. Euro/Swiss, which hit a record low of
1.0075 on Tuesday on trading platform EBS, is still down 1.4
percent on the week. 
 Much of the previous day's slide in the Swiss franc was
sparked by a Swiss newspaper report, which quoted SNB Vice
Chairman Thomas Jordan as saying the central bank could ease
monetary policy further.	
 He also declined to rule out the possibility of pegging the
franc to the euro. 
 Still, there was scepticism toward the idea of pegging the
Swiss franc to the euro , and analysts said the Swiss
franc is likely to stay supported as long as worries about a
global slowdown and debt problems in the United States and euro
zone persisted.	
 ""If they were to introduce a peg, there would rightly be
some questions as to their commitment to defending it, because
it wouldn't be a structural decision to align their economy with
Europe,"" said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in
Singapore.	
 ""You run the risk of the SNB facing a lot of pressure from
the market, which means they might have to sell a quite large
amount of Swiss (francs) to defend it and it's not clear that
there is the appetite among Swiss authorities to do so,"" he
added.	
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc
to 0.7602 , some ways off from a record low of 0.70676
struck on Tuesday. 
 A drop in U.S. stock index futures dampened risk
appetite and lent support to the Swiss franc and the yen,
another currency highly sought in times of market distress. 
 U.S. S&P futures fell about 0.8 percent  ,
taking some of the shine off of the previous day's
bargain-hunting rally on Wall Street. 
 The euro dipped 0.3 percent against the dollar to
$1.4196 . 
 
TALK OF OPTION BARRIERS 
 The yen remained near a record high on the dollar
despite recent intervention by Japan to weaken it. 
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 76.82 yen
, near an all-time low of 76.25 yen set in mid-March. 
 There has been talk of option barriers at 76.25 yen and
76.00 yen. That suggests that dollar-buying by options players
could emerge near such levels and cushion the dollar's fall, but
it also means the dollar's drop could gain steam if such
barriers are breached.	
 Given the dollar's recent drop down close to its record low
against the yen, jitters and speculation about the potential for
Japanese yen-selling intervention have been high. 
 In a sign of such market sentiment, traders have cited
heightened demand recently for short-dated dollar call options
with strike prices roughly around 78 yen to 79 yen.	
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Friday
he will consider various options if one-sided moves in the yen
continue. 
 Societe Generale strategists said they were ""highly
distrustful"" of bounces by 'higher-beta' currencies and favour
the currencies of economies with the biggest current account
surpluses, namely Norway, Sweden, Singapore and China. 
 ""Of course, Japan and Switzerland score well on that simple
metric,"" they wrote in a note. ""By contrast, we are much warier
of currencies propped up by high rates (Brazilian Real,
Australian dollar) and which have current account deficits. If
growth slows, their rates can fall, and higher volatility eats
into the attraction of these rates anyway.""

(Updates prices, adds valuations, quotes)	
 By Kevin Plumberg and Swati Bhat	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on
Friday, as investors chased value picks after recent sharp
volatility, though concerns over the European crisis may
continue to fuel buying into safe havens like gold and
government bonds.	
 Wall Street rose 4 percent overnight on high trading volume,
with relatively low valuations and short-term oversold
conditions attracting buyers, though a slide in U.S. stock
futures in early Asian trade kept the region's climb modest.	
 Intraday volatility across financial markets has spiked over
the past few weeks, with rumours flying about the health of
European banks, questions mounting about the stability of
funding markets and authorities struggling to solve a crisis of
confidence in Europe.	
 A European regulator ban on short-selling in four countries'
financial stocks would take effect on Friday, a coordinated
attempt to ease panic whose effectiveness was immediately called
into question by market participants. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 0.2 percent, boosted by a
4.7 percent jump in Canon Inc shares, which were propelled by a
stock buyback plan. 
 ""The rebound is a little lukewarm as investors want to
lighten their positions and take profits ahead of the weekend
after a very turbulent week,"" said Mitsuo Shimizu, deputy
general manager at Cosmo Securities in Tokyo.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1.3 percent on the day but still looking at a
decline of around 3 percent on the week, in line
with the MSCI world stock index . 
 The benchmark's 14-day RSI, a measure of momentum that is
used to indicate overbought or oversold conditions, was at 30.6,
poised to snap a six-session string of readings below 30 -- the
oversold threshold. That is the longest string of days below 30
since May 2010.	
 Even as equity prices dropped in the past few weeks, some
fund managers in Asia with long-term horizons have been slowly
shifting their portfolios by buying more cyclical stocks, which
are more sensitive to changes in business cycles, and reducing
exposure to so-called defensive sectors.	
 
 VALUE PICKS	
 The strategy may have more to do with valuations and
positioning than a call on global economic prospects.	
 For example, in some Asian markets, stocks in a defensive
sector such as consumer staples are running a bit expensive
relative to growth prospects compared with a cyclical sector
such as industrials. 
 A look at the ratio of price-to-earnings over estimated
earnings growth next year shows Indonesia's consumer staples are
trading at 1.3 times versus 0.5 times among industrials, Thomson
Reuters Starmine showed. In Korea, staples are trading at 1.0
time versus the 0.3 times of industrials.	
 That investors in U.S. stocks focused more on value
overnight despite the clear and present risks to economic growth
is not so surprising considering the S&P 500 index is trading
around 11.7 times forecast earnings in 12 months, well below the
10-year average of 16.2 times.	
 ""We remain optimistic that risk assets (including
emerging markets) will continue to bounce back after the current
period of turmoil ebbs. For now, we believe that picking the EM
equity markets with solid fundamentals remains a good strategy
for global equity managers in this current environment,"" Win
Thin, Global Head of Emerging Markets Strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman, wrote in a note. 
 In currency markets, the euro was down 0.3 percent
to $1.4201 , though global focus would likely be on how
the single currency fares against the Swiss franc.	
 The euro surged a record 5 percent against the franc
overnight on speculation the Swiss central bank may be
considering other measures to curb currency strength, including
a peg to the euro. The euro was down 0.4 percent at 1.0801
francs in Asian trading .	
 ""Market reaction was probably a reflection of how long
participants are of the Swiss franc,"" said Richard Grace, chief
currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank. 
 Gold prices were down 0.34 percent to $1,759.65 an ounce
, some 3.4 percent below a record high of $1,813.79 hit on
Thursday. Still the metal was up 5.9 percent this week, on
course for the biggest weekly gain since February 2009.	
 Oil  also snapped a two-day rising streak,
falling 0.6 percent, after having gained 6.4 percent over the
last two days.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Investors swooped back into
world stocks on Thursday, picking up beaten-down shares after a
mildly encouraging U.S. jobs report dulled fears of recession,
although credit markets faced strains similar to those that
preceded the 2008 credit crisis.
 U.S. stocks rallied more than 4 percent, picking up steam
late in the day and reversing the previous day's losses. Shares
have whip-sawed all week and the Dow traded in a range of more
than 400 points for a sixth straight day.
 The broad S&P 500 is still down about 14 percent from its
2011 closing high set on April 29.
 ""It's a bungee cord market. We've fallen off of a small
bridge, the bungee cord bounced us up, and oscillations will
diminish, but we're still bouncing around,"" said Fred Dickson,
chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego,
Oregon.
 Gold and the Swiss franc -- which have soared as investors
shied away from risk -- both fell. However, each had additional
factors influencing their lack of appeal.
 Gold faced its biggest daily loss in over a year on
profit-taking and an increase in trading margins. Gold futures
 fell 2 percent to $1,748 an ounce.
 The Swiss franc tumbled after the Swiss National Bank said
it could ease monetary policy further. Markets focused on the
possibility of a temporary peg between the franc and the euro
to rein in the soaring Swiss currency. [ID:nL6E7JB026]
 The sanguine view in the equity market contrasted with
nervousness in the short-term funding markets.
 The London interbank offered rate, LIBOR, on three-month
dollars , the benchmark rate for $350 trillion worth
of financial products worldwide, reached fresh four-month
highs. For details, see [ID:nN1E77A162]
 ""That is purely a reflection of interbank funding, so it
reflects sentiment on whether or not there could be a potential
crisis in the funding markets. Every time there's a crisis
that's usually what people look at first,"" said Kenneth
Silliman, head of U.S. short-term rates trading with TD
Securities in New York.
 The U.S. Treasury sold $16 billion worth of 30-year long
bonds at a poorly received auction, with investors showing the
weakest overall demand in 2-1/2 years and foreigners largely
steering clear.
 In the open market, the 30-year bond  lost 5
points in price immediately after the auction results. The
benchmark 10-year note  suffered along with 30-year
bonds. It last yielded 2.32 percent, up from 2.14 at
Wednesday's 10-year auction.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 2.9
percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 423.37
points, or 3.95 percent, at 11,143.31. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 51.88 points, or 4.63 percent, at
1,172.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 111.63
points, or 4.69 percent, at 2,492.68.
 U.S. financial shares led the way up after taking a beating
in the previous session on rumors of trouble at French banks. A
16 percent surge in Cisco Systems  also helped
sentiment. [ID:nSGE77A03E]
 Legendary investor Warren Buffett told Fortune magazine he
has been buying during this week's sharp market declines and
has not yet seen anything that suggests another economic
downturn. [ID:nN1E77A0YU]
 TEMPORARY COMFORT
 The spike in the LIBOR rate, a key measure of the cost for
banks to borrow from one another, raises the question of
whether the current funding difficulties may foretell a repeat
of the 2008 credit crisis, when vital arteries of global
finance seized up.
 In the credit markets, the cost of insuring French bank
debt hit new records, a sharp contrast to the upbeat stock
market picture. [ID:nLDE77A05U]
 Stock markets were comforted as U.S. initial claims for
state unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level
since early April. Analysts said one week was not enough to
show definitive improvement in the struggling labor market, but
the better-than-expected data was a welcome surprise.
[ID:nN1E77A099]
 ""Had we seen a jump (in claims) it would have reinforced
recession fears. What we've seen here is not anything to allay
those fears, but just to set them aside temporarily,"" said
Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management
in Birmingham, Alabama.
 The anemic pace of U.S. first-half growth has fueled
worries of another recession, and analysts are watching for
signs the recovery could pick up steam in the rest of 2011.
 Oil prices rose for a second day in a row, gaining
alongside equities. U.S. September crude  settled up
$2.83 at $85.72 a barrel.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar and euro posted
their best days ever against the Swiss franc on Thursday,
jumping as much as 6 percent after falling to record lows this
week, as the Swiss National Bank said it could peg the franc to
the euro to rein in a soaring currency.
 SNB Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan, when asked about
temporarily pegging the franc, said the bank was open to
measures consistent with long-term price stability. Traders
said the euro/Swiss pair could be fixed at 1.15 francs.
 A proposed peg of the Swiss currency, however, drew
criticism from most market participants.
 ""This is very short term. Intervention or these types of
programs where you try to subsidize and try to move a market
don't work as the Japanese found out in March when they
intervened,"" said Rodney Johnson, co-portfolio manager at Dent
Tactical ETF in Tampa Florida.
 ""It may have a short-term impact, but it won't change the
direction. People would still buy the Swiss franc especially if
uncertainty in Europe continues,"" he added.
 Johnson said given the volatility in the market he has
moved 70 percent of his portfolio into cash, with the remaining
30 percent invested in the euro and commodities.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro was up 5.3 percent at
1.08580 francs , compared with a record low of
1.00750 hit on Tuesday. It rose as high as 1.09220 francs on
Thursday, up more than 6 percent, its best trading day.
 The euro though was still down 0.2 percent this week and
13.1 percent lower so far this year.
 Implied volatility, a measure of the market's expectations
of future movements, slid on Thursday after the plunge in the
Swiss franc, with one-month euro/franc implied vols
 at 23.40 percent. The currency pair's one-month
vols surged to a record 32 percent on Tuesday.
 The dollar was last up 4.9 percent to 0.76260 franc
, also its best one-day gain, after hitting a high of
0.76895. Earlier in the week, the dollar plunged to a record
low of 0.70676 on trading platform EBS.
 Deutsche Bank's global head of G10 FX strategy Alan Ruskin
said anchoring a currency on a fairly unstable euro, which is
currently beset by the euro zone's fiscal crisis, could end up
destabilizing the Swiss franc itself.
 If the SNB were to do the peg, it would be like ""jumping
into the old exchange rate mechanism in the midst of
unprecedented turmoil, while probably being left to defend the
band by itself, with limited solidarity from the others, in
this case the European Central Bank,"" he added.
 Sharp gains in the euro versus the Swiss franc further
helped lift the euro zone common currency against the dollar.
The euro last traded up 0.4 percent at $1.42247.
 SWISS PEG, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES
 Other analysts said there may be no need to do the peg
after all. Credit Suisse said Swiss franc Libor futures are
already trading in negative territory. Spot Libors may also go
negative as Swiss banks try to discourage foreign wholesale
deposits, the bank added.
 Negative interest rates, essentially forcing banks to
charge clients to hold their money, could dissuade some
investors from buying the safe-haven franc, although the peg
could be limited.
 ""Markets are not holding Swiss francs for their return,
they're holding them for insurance,"" said Vassili Serebriakov,
senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. ""So a
slight negative interest rate may not discourage too much
demand for the currency.""
 The yen, meanwhile, hovered near a record high against the
dollar as investors continued to sell riskier assets, fueling
speculation Japan may step in to stem the yen's gains.
 The dollar fell as low as 76.302 yen on trading platform
EBS, within striking distance of an all-time trough of 76.25
yen set in mid-March. It last traded little changed on the day
at 76.830.
 Earlier in London, the dollar briefly jumped above 77 yen
from 76.30 yen, after dealers cited talk that the Bank of Japan
was in the market checking the exchange rate for dollar/yen.
That is usually an indication Japan is getting ready to buy
more dollars to weaken the yen.
 The greenback, however, soon fell back after traders said
they had not seen any yen-selling intervention by Japanese
authorities. A finance ministry official declined to comment.

 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Investors swooped back into
beaten-down global stocks on Thursday, encouraged by a surprise
dip in the number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits,
but credit markets tightened and a 30-year U.S. bond auction
met poor demand.
 U.S. and European stocks climbed more than 3 percent,
reversing course after steep losses the previous day. The U.S.
data and corporate results provided a respite from overnight
fears about the health of the euro zone banking system.
 But the sanguine view in the equity market contrasted with
nervousness in the short-term funding markets, where there were

 That means it would cost 342,000 euros per year for five
years to insure 10 million euros in debt. This cost has more
than doubled in the past two weeks.
 BNP Paribas'  CDS costs were little changed on the
day at 236 basis points, after earlier rising to 256 basis

 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Firmer U.S. stocks pulled
world shares higher on Thursday as strong U.S. jobs data took
some of the focus away from renewed fears about the health of
the euro zone banking system.

 The U.S. economy created 117,000 jobs in July.
 The anemic pace of U.S. growth in the first half of the
year has fueled worries of another recession and the
improvement in the labor market could help allay those fears.
Even so, the optimism generated by the claims report was
dampened somewhat by a surprise widening in the trade deficit
in June.
 U.S. stocks rose more more than 2.0 percent in early trade,

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar and euro soared
more than 5 percent versus the Swiss franc on Thursday after
the Swiss National Bank said it could ease monetary policy
further and possibly peg the franc to the euro to rein in a
soaring currency.
 Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan was quoted by the local press
as saying the SNB could make monetary policy more expansive
without intervening in foreign exchange markets. His comments
fueled speculation that Switzerland could be considering
introducing negative interest rates.
 When asked about temporarily pegging the franc to the euro
-- which the SNB would have to defend through interventions --
Jordan said: ""Temporary measures that influence the exchange
rate are part of our mandate so long as they are compatible
with long-term price stability."" See [ID:nL6E7JB026]
 ""I think the market respects the Swiss National Bank's move
recently to weaken the currency,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior
currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. ""There have been
numerous comments over the past 24 hours about the need to hold
currency strength, including the possibility of fixing the
Swiss franc to the euro, which is a remarkable comment.""
 The euro was last up 5.7 percent at 1.0889 francs, compared
with a record low of 1.0075 set as recently as Tuesday.
 Analysts said the SNB could choose to peg euro/franc around
the 1.15 level.
 The dollar rose 5.6 percent to 0.7671 franc.
 Negative lending rates ""could dissuade investors from
holding Swiss franc-denominated assets as a safe harbor from
euro zone and global economic uncertainty,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief markets analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 The yen hovered near a record high against the dollar as
investors continued to sell riskier assets, fueling speculation
that Japanese authorities may step in to stem the yen's gains.
 The dollar fell as low as 76.302 yen  on trading
platform EBS, within striking distance of a record low of 76.25
yen set in mid-March. It was last down 0.2 percent at 76.673.
 Traders cited option barriers around 76.25 yen, with large
option expiries at 76.00 yen later on Thursday.
 Earlier in London trading, the dollar briefly jumped above
77 yen from 76.30 yen, but soon fell back after traders said
they had not seen any yen-selling intervention by Japanese
authorities. A finance ministry official declined to comment.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent at $1.4202 , reversing
early losses as euro/franc soared.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro fell
back on Thursday, prompting a rush to safe-haven government
bonds as concerns resurfaced about the euro zone banking system
and signs of funding stress.	
 In a nervous, fast-moving market, the euro fell to a near
five-month low against the low-yielding yen and oil tumbled,
while renewed buying by the European Central Bank pushed Italian
and Spanish government bonds higher. 
 Banking sources told Reuters that one bank in Asia had cut
credit lines to major French lenders while others in the region
were reviewing trades and counterparty risks due to concerns
about the exposure of French banks to peripheral euro zone bonds

 European banks sought to secure dollar funding beyond one
week in the currency derivatives market, pushing one gauge of
funding costs to its highest levels since the 2008 crisis as
investors and banks hoarded funds to protect themselves from
further market volatility .	
 Societe Generale , which suffered a share price
rout on Wednesday, and French banking peer BNP Paribas
both fell around 8 percent at one point while trading in some
Italian banks was suspended for excessive volatility.	
 Concerns have been intensifying about the health of French
and Italian banks, which are heavily exposed to troubled euro
zone sovereign debt.	
 ""It just goes to show how quickly confidence can evaporate.
Markets are incredibly volatile at the moment,"" said Angus
Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads. 
 ""Just because you see a bounce early on, does not mean it is
going to be maintained. There are concerns, despite what central
banks and ratings agencies, say that French banks are over
exposed to the peripheries."" 
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.6
percent, having dropped in 11 of the past 13 sessions.	
 The benchmark index slipped into bear market territory
earlier this week by falling more than 20 percent from its
three-year high in May.	
 European stocks were down 1.1 percent while
emerging stocks lost 0.7 percent.	
 On Wednesday, a stream of rumours about a sovereign rating
downgrade of France and concerns about the health of French
banks caused the biggest widening in the benchmark index of
European credit default swaps since 2008. 
 All three major rating agencies later reaffirmed France's
AAA rating, and said its outlook was stable, but markets remain
concerned that French banks are among the most exposed to a
worsening of Europe's government debt crisis.	
 U.S. stock futures  also erased early gains, falling
more than 1 percent and indicating a weaker open on Wall Street
later.	
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.3 percent to $81.77 a barrel.	
 The euro fell as low as 108.14 yen . It lost 0.1
percent at $1.4151 .

 MONEY MARKET STRESS	
 Investors are extremely sensitive about any sign of funding
stress in the interbank market, one of the first areas to
deteriorate at the onset of the credit crisis in 2007.	
 On Thursday, the one-year yen-dollar cross-currency basis
-- which reflects the premium for swapping yen
LIBOR into dollar LIBOR -- briefly extended its rise to 56 basis
points, the highest since November 2008.	
 Bund futures  were up 12 ticks in volatile trading,
with traders saying the European Central Bank was buying Italian
and Spanish government bonds in small amounts to protect the two
markets from contagion fears.	
 ""The risk is clearly still that we could see this crisis
continue to destabilise the euro,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
strategist at BTM UFJ. 
 ""We think there's an increasing risk of recession not just
in the periphery but spreading through to the core."" 
 Italian 10-year bond yields were 4 basis
points lower on the day at 5.068 percent, while their Spanish
equivalents were 3.4 bps down at 5.004 percent. 
 The dollar was steady against a basket of major
currencies. The U.S. currency had been under pressure from
speculation the Federal Reserve may launch a third bond-buying
programme to bolster the economy. It has pledged to keep
interest rates near zero for two more years.	
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 76.58 yen, having earlier
jumped above 77.00 . Dealers reported no intervention by
Japanese monetary authorities.	
 Investors are wary of possible coordinated intervention
after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said he would
work closely with the global community to maintain market
stability.

 By Ian Chua and Chikafumi Hodo	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The euro edged up from lows
against major currencies in Asia on Thursday but was seen
vulnerable to renewed selling pressure as worries about the euro
zone sovereign debt crisis spread to the region's banking
sector.	
 A storm of market rumours questioning the
financial solidity of a major French bank and talk of an
impending downgrade of France's credit rating, all denied by
authorities, rattled already shaky market confidence.

 The U.S. dollar stayed on the defensive as
investors were reluctant to hold on to longs after the Federal
Reserve pledged to keep interest rates near zero for two years
and left the door open to adding more stimulus if needed.	
 The greenback also came under pressure in Asia
after a record high fix in the Chinese yuan.	
 ""The ongoing sovereign debt problems are making
investors extremely nervous about taking exposure to risk
assets. You can't buy the dollar or the euro, so investors are
shifting into the Swiss franc, the yen and gold for safety,""
said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan Securities.	
 ""I feel further stronger measures by the Fed, the
BOJ and other monetary authorities are needed. They need to show
their determination to change this risk adverse mood,"" Soma
said.	
 Investors scrambling for cover in traditional safe
havens, lifted gold  to record highs and sent the
10-year U.S. Treasury note yield to a record low
around 2.04 percent, last seen during the 2008/2009 global
financial crisis.	
 The currency market had a tougher time looking for a safe
harbour after the Swiss National Bank took fresh steps to bring
down a soaring franc and with recent intervention to weaken the
yen by Japan still fresh in investors' mind. 
 Still, both the yen and Swiss franc remained buoyed.	
 ""The market is in a bit of heat-seeking missile mode looking
for vulnerabilities around the world, and Europe is obviously in
its sights at this point in time,"" said Grant Turley, senior
strategist at ANZ in Sydney.	
 
 NOT CONVINCED	
 The euro rebounded broadly off recent lows due to corrective
short-covering as share prices in the Asian region recovered,
though market participants were not convinced about the single
currency's outlook.	
 ""Especially after the U.S. sovereign debt downgrade,
investors and funds in general are avoiding taking risks,
prompting heavy flows into safer currencies and assets, while
the dollar and the euro are being hit,"" said Makoto Noji, a
senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.	
 The euro last traded up 0.1 percent at 109.05 yen
after falling to a five-month low of 108.27 yen.	
 The single currency also reclaimed some ground against the
Swiss franc and the dollar , rising by 0.4
percent to 1.0343 francs and advancing 0.3 percent to $1.4216.	
 Euro/franc reached an all-time low around 1.0075 francs
earlier in the week.	
 The dollar rose to a session high of 77.23 yen , but
it quickly ran out of steam. Dollar/yen fell on talk that China
was selling the U.S. currency against Asian currencies, dealers
said.	
 The dollar was also weighed down by market talk on
the possibility of China widening the yuan trading band or
allowing the currency to appreciate faster, dealers said.	
 The greenback was down 0.3 percent at 76.64 yen , not
far from an all-time low around 76.25.	
 Wariness over possible intervention and the underlying
downward trend in the dollar kept the dollar/yen rate in a tight
range in the afternoon in Asia.	
 ""Intervention expectations are keeping the pair range-bound
in Tokyo in the upper 76-range, but there is a high probability
the record low of 76.25 can be broken later depending on the
direction of stock markets and yen crosses,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.	
 ""If the record low were to break, with no sign of
intervention, the dollar could fall to the upper 75-yen range"",
he said.	
 The yen briefly fell on comments by Japanese Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda that he would work closely with the
global community to maintain market stability. 
 Some dealers said Noda's comments were somewhat
stronger, and could signal possible joint action by
international authorities, though most traders doubted that
would happen.	
 ""It looks unlikely that we will see any concerted
intervention from the way the G7 statement sounded earlier in
the week. Japan will intervene on any sharp moves to smooth the
yen's steep appreciation, but Japan may not step in if the yen
is rising gradually,"" Nikko's Noji said. 
 The Australian dollar rebounded against the U.S dollar as
traders cited Asian central bank buying and the U.S. dollar
coming under pressure after the record high fix in the Chinese
yuan.	
 The Aussie climbed to $1.0235 , up 0.8 percent on
the day, completely recovering from a dip to $1.0110 in the wake
of disappointing local jobs data. 
 It was well off a five-month low of $0.9927 marked on
Tuesday.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures rose 2
percent on Thursday after a sharp drop on Wall Street overnight,
limiting losses in Asian shares, though sustained gains depended
on how Europe reacts to a sovereign debt crisis that is
threatening its banking system.	
 Major European markets also were poised to draw some comfort
from the U.S. futures bounce, with futures markets predicting
British, French and German stocks would open as much as 2.0
percent higher. 
 The euro crept higher, but Europe's evolving crisis was too
complex and disturbing to make any long-term bets. Trading was
whippy and positions in currency and stock markets were built,
slashed and then rebuilt within an hour. 
 Fast-moving rumours about a sovereign debt downgrade of
France as well as talk doubting the health of French banks
swirled in Europe caused the biggest widening in the benchmark
index of European credit default swaps on Wednesday since the
credit crunch in 2008. 
 The three major rating agencies later reaffirmed France's
AAA rating, and said its outlook was stable, but markets remain
concerned that French banks are among the most exposed to a
worsening of Europe's government debt crisis.	


 European policymakers have been struggling to keep the euro
zone's government bond markets from being savaged, but
Wednesday's price action suggested the problems may be rapidly
spreading to the private sector.	
 ""The market is in a bit of heat-seeking missile mode looking
for vulnerabilities around the world, and Europe is obviously in
its sights at this point in time,"" said Grant Turley, senior
strategist at ANZ in Sydney. 
 
 STAYING DEFENSIVE	
 As S&P 500 futures  firmed, Asian stocks pulled up
from their lows and some markets such as Korea and China turned
positive. 
 The Australian dollar, often a measure of investors'
willingness to take risks, bounced above $1.02, suggesting
traders and investors were being nimble rather than selling with
blinders on in the face of risks to global growth. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average trimmed initial losses of 2.2
percent and was down 0.6 percent by midday , but still
not far from a five-month low hit on Tuesday.	
 Carmakers and machinery makers fell as investors continued
their shift into domestic-demand related and defensive sectors
such as pharmaceuticals and retail from cyclicals, on worries
over the state of the global economy and the strong yen.	
 Expectations the Bank of Japan would continue to step into
the market to buy Nikkei exchange traded funds also limited the
selloff in Tokyo. 
 S&P futures were up 1.9 percent  after the cash index
tumbled 4.4 percent overnight on Europe's crisis and
fears that the U.S. economy could slide back into recession.	
 Tuesday's intraday low at 1,101 is major support for the
index since it is also the 38.2 percent retracement of the
2009-2011 rally.	
 The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks index also
pared early losses and was down 0.1 percent mid afternoon
, though the outperformance of defensive sectors
such as telecommunications and utilities suggested investors
were fortifying their portfolios. 
 The index has fallen 13 percent so far in August, in line
with the all-country world index , suggesting
investors had not been discriminating in the equity sell-down.	
 Institutional fund managers were mostly confident about
Asian assets and some have been trying to position their
portfolios to gain when equities bounce and bond yield spreads
over Treasuries tighten.	
 Khiem Do, head of Asian multi-asset with Baring Asset
Management in Hong Kong, said some Asian mutual funds were
seeing redemptions but nothing significant. 
 ""From the perspective of long-term institutional investors,
if anything there are more people on the buy side than on the
sell side. Valuations are very attractive at the moment
especially in the case of Asia,"" Do said.

 AUSSIE BOUNCE	
 The euro bounced as equities recovered from their
lows, and found room to rise especially against the Swiss franc
.	
 The Swiss National Bank increased its efforts to cap its
currency overnight and promised more measures if needed.

 The euro was at $1.4240, up 0.4 percent on the day ,
though locked within a tight trading range by the debt crisis in
Europe and the U.S. economic slowdown.	
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro rose 1 percent to 1.0405
, off its record low just below 1.01 hit on Tuesday.	
 ""I think the EU debt problem is far bigger a concern for
Asia than the U.S. downgrade as investors are continuing to buy
U.S. Treasuries anyways,"" said Francis Cheung, senior strategist
with Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.	
 ""I think we can see some rebounds here and there, but
overall the sentiment is still very cautious.""	
 High-yielding currencies were popular, with the Australian
dollar up 1.1 percent to $1.0270 , holding above
Tuesday's drop to below parity but well below $1.10 where the
currency started the month. 
 Commodities were a mixed bag, with copper prices jumping and
oil slipping, while precious metals slid after a margin increase
by the CME Group on gold futures and the equities comeback.	
 Spot gold prices were down 0.4 percent to $1,787.79
an ounce after earlier hitting an all-time high of $1,813.79.
The undisputed safe haven has risen 10 percent so far this month
and is up 26 percent in 2011.	
 The CME Group raised maintenance margins for trading Comex
100 Gold Futures <0#GC:> by 22.2 percent, effective after the
close of business on Thursday. The margin hike was not expected
to be a big obstacle to further gold gains.	
 ""It's difficult to see a great deal of selling, because we
are in very, very volatile and uncertain times when markets are
moving very violently. Gold has proven too much of an attraction
as an alternative investment and the margins may not have as
much influence,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of
trading at Investec Australia. 
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose
3.1 percent to $8,860 a tonne, after losing 1.6 percent in the
last session. 
 Oil futures slipped, with U.S. crude for September delivery
down 0.1 percent at $82.78 a barrel , though well above
Tuesday's intraday low of $75.71. Prices had jumped overnight
after an unexpected decline in U.S. oil inventories.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell 1-2 percent
on Thursday as the fallout from Wall Street's 4 percent drop
overnight limited by a rise in U.S. stock futures, while gold
climbed above $1,800 an ounce to a new record, reflecting fears
over Europe's worsening financial crisis.	
 The Australian dollar, often a measure of investors'
willingness to take risks, rose toward $1.02 as Asian equities
pulled back from their lows, suggesting traders and investors
were being nimble rather than selling with blinders on. 
 Fast-moving rumours about a sovereign debt downgrade of
France as well as talk doubting the health of French bank
swirled in Europe, causing the biggest widening in the benchmark
index of European credit default swaps since the credit crunch
in 2008. 
 ""The market is in a bit of heat-seeking missile mode
looking for vulnerabilities around the world, and Europe is
obviously in its sights at this point in time,"" said Grant
Turley, senior strategist at ANZ in Sydney. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.5 percent in early trade
, still not far from the five-month low hit on Tuesday. 
 The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks index fell
1.2 percent , with commodity-related stocks hit
hardest. The index has fallen 13 percent so far in August, in
line with the all-country world index ,
suggesting investors are not being so discriminating in the
equity sell-down.	
 The euro was still vulnerable, especially against the yen
and Swiss franc, but recovered some ground as Asian equities
edged up from their lows.	
 The euro was at $1.4175 , largely unchanged on the day
and locked within a tight trading range by a debt crisis in
Europe and a U.S. slowdown.	
 The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent to $1.0190
, holding above Tuesday's drop to below parity but well
off from $1.10 where the currency started the month. 
 Spot gold prices were up 0.5 percent to $1,802.89 an ounce
after earlier hitting an all-time high of $1,813.79. 
 The undisputed safe haven has risen 11 percent so far this
month and is up 27 percent in 2011.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Fear of risk drove investors
out of global stocks on Wednesday as rumors about the health of
French banks sparked concern that the euro zone's debt crisis
could claim new victims.
 The rumors tapped into investors' worst fears of contagion.
French bank stocks tumbled and led European markets lower. U.S.
stocks fell more than 4 percent, while safe-haven gold hit
another record.
 ""What we're seeing here is the fear and rumor-mongering
that's coming out of Europe. It eerily reminds me of the fall
of 2008, where you would see one financial institution after
another be lined up in the cross-hairs of the traders,"" said
Cliff Draughn, chief investment officer at Excelsia Investment
Advisors in Savannah, Georgia.
 Shares of Societe Generale  plummeted as much as
23 percent before trimming some losses to close almost 15
percent lower. BNP Paribas  ended down 9.5 percent.
 Societe Generale denied market rumors about the bank. It
also asked France's stock market regulator to open an
investigation. For details, see [ID:nLDE77912I]
 The intensification of worries over the reach of the euro
zone debt crisis took some of the comfort out of Tuesday's
promise from the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates
low for at least another two years.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 519.83
points, or 4.62 percent, at 10,719.94. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> lost 51.77 points, or 4.42 percent, at
1,120.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 101.47
points, or 4.09 percent, at 2,381.05.
 The MSCI all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down
2.6 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> of leading
European shares closed down 4 percent.
 Gold racked up a third record in a row, extending its best
rally since 2008. Spot gold  rose near 3 percent to hit a
high of $1,796.86. The euro fell more than 1 percent against
the dollar, and Treasury prices also rose.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell against most
major currencies on Wednesday, while commodity currencies
dropped on persistent global economic uncertainty and worries
about French banks with large exposure to peripheral euro zone
debt.
 French bank stocks were hit hard in Paris trading, with
Societe Generale  shares closing down 15 percent. A
Societe Generale spokeswoman denied all market rumors about the
bank. It also asked France's stock market regulator to launch
an investigation into the source of the rumors.
 Sharp losses in the French banking sector spilled over to
the U.S. stock market, which has yet to recover from Friday's
U.S. credit rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's.
 ""The sell-off in the euro appears to be a risk-related move
in general,' said Bob Lynch, global head of G10 currency
strategy, at HSBC in New York.
 ""U.S. stocks were quite weak at the open. They have
stabilized to lower levels since then and that has been the
pattern as well for euro/dollar.""
 The euro last traded down 1.0 percent at $1.42310, after
sliding to a session low of $1.41620 on trading platform EBS
. It lost 1.4 percent against the yen to 109.19 yen
, after sliding to a roughly five-month low at
108.300.
 It was the euro's worst performance against the yen in a
month.
 The euro zone common currency also came under pressure on
earlier market talk of a possible downgrade of France's AAA
credit rating. The country is seen as vulnerable after Standard
& Poor's cut the United States' credit rating by one notch to
AA-plus last Friday.
 But those concerns faded after all three major ratings
agencies -- Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's -- reaffirmed
their AAA ratings on France with a stable outlook.
 SWISS FRANC PULLS BACK
 The euro dropped 0.2 percent to 1.03630 Swiss francs
. The franc soared as high as 1.00750 per euro on
Tuesday, edging close to parity.
 Implied volatility, a measure of the market's expectations
of future movements, remained at extreme levels, with one-month
euro/Swiss franc implied vols  rising above 29
percent.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 76.760 yen. It hit a session
low of 76.347 on EBS , close to its record low hit in
March of 76.25 and keeping investors wary that Japanese
authorities may step in again to stem gains in the currency.
 Traders said there doesn't seem to be much action in
dollar/yen as investors on Wednesday preferred to go long the
Japanese currency versus the euro. The single euro zone still
has a long way to go before it hits record lows seen in
mid-March.
 The dollar jumped 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.72825 franc  after the Swiss National Bank said it
would significantly boost franc supply in the coming days in a
bid to stem the currency's rally to record highs and is still
looking at a whole range of measures to slow the franc's surge.
For details, see [ID:nL6E7JA1VK] [ID:nL6E7JA0BI]
 The dollar plunged more than 5 percent against the franc at
one point on Tuesday, its worst trading day ever.
 Analysts, however, said the SNB's measures would do little
to halt exceptionally strong demand for the safe-haven franc
after the Federal Reserve on Tuesday underlined the state of
the struggling U.S. economy and promised to hold interest rates
low for at least two years. [ID:nL6E7JA0BI] [ID:nN1E7781WQ]
 Goldman Sachs said it expects dollar-negative forces to
strengthen and recommends that clients go short on the U.S.
dollar on additional easing from the Fed.
 ""The Fed yesterday shifted to a more dovish stance,""
Goldman wrote in a note to clients. ""The Fed also said it
stands ready to increase its balance sheet further, leading our
U.S. economists to think (a third round of quantitative easing)
now has a more than even chance of becoming reality.""
 ""All this suggests the dollar will likely continue to
weaken on a broad basis,"" the bank said.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar  dropped 0.8
percent against the U.S. currency, while the New Zealand dollar
 slumped 2.4 percent.

England cut its growth and inflation forecasts .

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Global stocks slumped on
Wednesday as risk appetite evaporated on speculation about the
strength of French banks holding troubled Greek and Italian
debt.
 The rumors tapped into investors' worst fears of contagion
from euro zone debt troubles and led European markets lower.
French bank stocks were hit hard.
 The turnaround in equities followed a morning of gains in
Europe and Asia prompted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish
promise on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates low for
another two years.
 Shares of Societe Generale  plummeted as much as
23 percent before trimming some losses to trade down 14.7
percent. BNP Paribas  dove 9.5 percent.
 A Societe Generale spokeswoman denied all market rumors
about the bank. It also asked France's stock market regulator
to open an investigation into the source of the rumors. For
details, see [ID:nLDE77912I]
 Losses in bank shares also sent Wall Street lower following
two days of extreme volatility that included the sharpest drop
in nearly three years on Monday after Standard & Poor's
downgraded its AAA credit rating for the United States.
 U.S. and European indexes <.FTEU3> tumbled by more than 3
percent. The euro dropped more than 1 percent against the
dollar.
 ""Memories are fresh. I think people who during the last
financial crisis did not sell right away, next time around are
ready to sell quick and ask questions later,"" said Ed Crotty,
chief investment officer at Davidson Investment Advisors in
Great Falls, Montana.
 Wall Street's favorite fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility
index <.VIX>, jumped 13.2 percent after earlier rising more
than 20 percent. It was the third session in the last five the
index has seen a jump of at least 20 percent.
 Speculation France's AAA rating may be at risk initially
rattled markets, though the three major agencies reaffirmed the
top-tier rating. [ID:nL6E7JA1EQ]
 ""I think there's concern about just how much Greek debt
French banks really do hold and how much the European Central
Bank is willing to backstop all this,"" said Bret Barker,
portfolio manager at TCW in Los Angeles, which has $65 billion
in fixed-income assets under management.
 Recent selling has followed attempts by politicians and
central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to prevent or
contain debt crises.
 Not surprisingly, the relief rally sparked by Tuesday's Fed
comments turned out to be short lived.
 Investors saw the Fed message as double edged. The central
bank signaled it was willing to keep the U.S. economy afloat.
At the same time, it acknowledged just how much trouble the
world's largest economy was in. [ID:nN1E7781WQ]
 By mid afternoon Wednesday indexes had given up a chunk of
Tuesday's gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 203.70
points, or 1.81 percent, to 11,036.07. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> lost 15.83 points, or 1.35 percent, to
1,156.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was off 24.45
points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,458.07.
 The MSCI all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which
has fallen as much as 20 percent from a May high, was down 1.4
percent after earlier gains. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> of
leading European shares closed down 4 percent.
 The euro traded down 1.2 percent at $1.4190, after sliding
to a session low of $1.41620 on trading platform EBS .
It lost 2.1 percent to 108.42 yen .
 The search for safety drove investors into U.S. Treasuries
and gold. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was
up 23/32 in price after briefly posting a full point gain, its
yield falling to 2.16 percent, down from 2.24 percent late on
Tuesday.
 The 30-year Treasury bond  was up 2-3/32 in
price to yield 3.53 percent, down from 3.68 percent at
Tuesday's close.
 Gold racked up a third record in a row, extending its best
rally since 2008. Spot gold  rose near 3 percent to hit a
high of $1,796.86.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Global shares turned
lower and the euro dropped on Wednesday as the selling of risky
assets resumed on speculation that France's AAA rating may be
at risk.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> retreated 1.5 percent, led lower
by French banks. Credit ratings firms Moody's Investors Service
and Fitch reiterated their AAA rating for the sovereign,
echoing a comment from Standard & Poor's the day before. For

 ""There is talk of a possible downgrade for France. The
market is quite jittery and France seems to be the next one on
everyone's radar, hence there are selling in French banks,"" a
London-based trader said.
 The turnaround followed a morning of gains in Europe and

promise on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates low for
another two years. U.S. stocks opened sharply lower, reversing
some of Tuesday's bounce-back rally.
 The Fed's unprecedented commitment was double-edged. It

 ""At this point of time, investors' heads are spinning,""
said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial
Services in Suffern, New York.
 ""We anticipate further volatility,"" he said. ""I even think
we are going to retest the lows that were set on Monday.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 248.58
points, or 2.21 percent, to 10,991.19. The Standard & Poor's

1,148.65. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 57.21 points,

 The euro tumbled against the U.S. dollar on increasing
concerns that Standard & Poor's could initiate ratings action
on sovereign debt in Europe after downgrading U.S. debt last
week. The euro fell to a session low of $1.4243  and last
traded at $1.4246, down 0.9 percent on the day.
 Switzerland's central bank, meanwhile, said it was
expanding measures to fight against the Swiss franc's strength.

 * U.S. dollar weak as Fed vows to keep rates low for two
years
 * Swiss franc falls after SNB measures but traders sceptical
 * Dollar index falls 1 pct
 * Dlr/yen close to record lows as yen and Swissie stay in

 By Jessica Mortimer and Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday
after the U.S. Federal Reserve's pledge to keep rates near zero
for two years, while the Swiss franc staged only a limited fall
after more official steps to try to stem its rapid ascent to
record highs.	
 Traders said the Swiss National Bank's measures to boost
Swiss franc supply would do little to halt exceptionally strong
demand for the safe-haven currency, while confirmation of a long
period of low rates would keep the dollar weak.

 The franc stayed on course to scale parity with the euro and
make further records against the dollar due to concerns about
U.S. and euro zone debt and worries about global growth, while
the safe-haven yen also neared a record high versus the dollar.	
 The SNB stopped short of direct intervention and the euro
traded up just 0.6 percent at 1.0424 francs , after
tumbling to a record low of 1.0075 francs the previous day.
Euro/Swiss has shed roughly 16 percent since the beginning of
the year.	
 ""This is just a short-term measure and even if the SNB does
eventually intervene directly to weaken the franc, the foreign
exchange market is bigger than any one country. In the long-term
intervention won't work for them,"" said Dennis Van Den Bosch,
currency manager at Henderson Global Investors, which has 76
billion pounds ($123.5 bln) in assets under management. 
 Implied volatility, a measure of the market's estimation of
future movements in a currency, remained at extreme levels in
the Swiss franc, which has hit a series of record highs against
a number of currencies.	
 One-month euro/Swiss franc implied vols rose as
high as 27 percent, well above the highs of around 20 percent
hit after the Lehman crisis.	
 ""The SNB is playing a dangerous game. The closer to parity
euro/Swiss gets, the harder it will be to defend against more
franc strength,"" said Peter Kinsella, currency strategist at

 FED DENTS DOLLAR	
 The Fed's unusual commitment on Tuesday to keep rates low
for at least two more years weakened the dollar, pushing it down
1 percent against a basket of currencies to 73.86, not
far from its late July low of 73.421.	
 The Fed's statement sparked a rebound in riskier currencies
such as the Australian dollar from recent steep falls, but
concerns the U.S. economy would stay fragile despite the pledge
on rates also kept demand firm for the Swiss franc and yen.	
 ""Search as it may, the market cannot find alternative 'safe
havens' apart from Swissie and yen so they will stay bid, but
you need to be cautious as there may be comments which will
cause nasty spikes,"" said Richard Wiltshire, chief FX
broker at ETX Capital.	
 Against the yen the dollar was down 0.7 percent at
76.50 yen, hovering perilously close to its record low hit in
March of 76.25 and keeping investors wary that Japanese
authorities may step in again to stem gains in the Japanese
currency.	
 The dollar edged up 0.5 percent against the Swiss franc
to 0.7262 francs but it was expected that it would
soon test the previous day's record low of 0.7068 francs.	
 The euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at
$1.4382. The Australian dollar was steady at $1.0362,
well above a low of $0.9927 hit the previous day before
rebounding on the Fed's statement to spike as high as $1.0418.	
 Sterling fell after the Bank of England cut its growth and
inflation forecasts in its latest inflation report but it was
off worst levels of the day at $1.6260 in late morning trade,
down 0.3 percent for the day.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - World shares clawed back some
ground on Wednesday as investors took comfort from the Federal
Reserve's pledge to keep interest rates near zero for two more
years, but losses on Wall Street loomed.	
 European stocks fell 0.7 percent on renewed
concerns about bank exposure to euro zone debt, and as U.S.
stock index futures fell.	
 The turnaround overshadowed a morning of gains in Europe and
Asia prompted by the Fed's dovish announcement on Tuesday.	
 Investors were also lifted earlier by data showing China's
export growth accelerating in July, calming fears that weak
demand from Europe and the United States would hit the world's
second-biggest economy. 
 The MSCI all-country world index , which has
fallen as much as 20 percent from a May high, was up half a
percent and emerging market shares gained 1.8 percent.
Both were off their highs.	
 The Fed's unprecedented commitment to keep rates
extraordinarily low until 2013 was double-edged.
It sent the message to markets that the Fed is willing to keep
things afloat, but it also acknowledges how much the U.S.
economy has weakened.	
 ""Low interest rates support equity markets, but it is just a
relief rally. There are too many uncertainties out there,""
Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners, said. 
 ""Markets are so badly beaten up any piece of good news is an
excuse to rally. Yes, markets do look cheap, however, we could
have years and years of low growth to pay back our debts.""	
 Goldman Sachs said a third round of asset-buying
quantitative easing from the U.S. central bank was likely.	
 ""We now see a greater-than-even chance that (it) will resume
quantitative easing later this year or in early 2012. We have
changed our call because (the) statement suggests that the
committee's reaction function to incoming economic news is more
dovish than we had previously thought,"" Jan Hatzius, chief
economist at the firm, said in a note.	
 
 DOLLAR FALLS, EURO VULNERABLE	
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent against major currencies
as prospects for minimal dollar-interest rates sent buyers
elsewhere.	
 The euro also fell on concerns about the euro zone's now
broad-based debt crisis, despite the European Central Bank's
move to ease some of the pressure by buying peripheral debt.	
 Switzerland's central bank, meanwhile, said it was expanding
measures to fight against the Swiss franc's strength. Investors
have been pouring into the currency as a safe haven during
recent market and economic weakness. 
 Gold and oil rebounded after the Fed's announcement, making
up ground after falls the previous session. 
 German government bonds climbed, tracking moves in U.S.
Treasuries overnight after the Fed's move.	
 ""There's a fear that the outlook is very bad if they're
committing until 2013,"" a bond trader said.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up
against the Australian dollar on Wednesday but its bounce was
limited after the U.S. Federal Reserve vowed to keep rates near
zero for two years, reaffirming the greenback's status as a
funding currency of choice for carry trades.	
 The Fed's extraordinary pledge sparked a rebound in risky
assets the previous day, boosting U.S. equities and helping the
Australian dollar recoup some of its steep falls seen recently. 
 
 The Fed's decision is good news for carry traders who use
the U.S. dollar as a funding currency, said Philip Marey, an
analyst at Rabobank.	
 ""Once volatility eases, they should be in business until at
least mid-2013,"" he wrote in a report.	
 Wall Street posted its best one-day gain in more than
two years, and Asian shares rose after the unprecedented
step by the Fed, with MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan rising 3.1 percent . 
 Some analysts said the tone of the statement left open the
possibility of a third round of bond buying, referred to as
quantitative easing.	
 The move came amid a global financial market turmoil
reminiscent of the 2008 bear market, fuelled by fears of a
double-dip recession in the United States and Europe as both
regions battled to contain their debt problems.	
 ""Volatility is calming down from an extreme level. Clearly
there's going to be considerable concerns still, but the market
had got seriously carried away and gone to an extreme of fear,""
said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.5 percent to $1.0335
. At one point on Tuesday it had soared roughly five
full U.S. cents from an intraday low, to above $1.0400
. 
 
 
 On the Japanese currency, the greenback held steady at
76.97 yen , not far from the all-time trough of 76.25 yen
hit in mid-March on trading platform EBS. 
 Traders said selling in cross/yen pairs weighed on the
dollar against the yen, with sterling dipping 0.7 percent to
125.20 yen and Aussie/yen slipping 0.9 percent to
79.50 yen . 
 The dollar is likely to fall toward its record low
against the yen, as market players test Japanese authorities'
commitment to curb yen strength, said Tsutomu Soma, senior
manager at Okasan Securities.	
 The market is watching to see whether the Bank of Japan can
intervene to buy dollars against the yen after Asian central
banks, such as South Korea, stepped in to sell dollars the
previous day, Soma said. 
 ""The market is highly likely to push down the dollar towards
the record low 76.25 yen to test the determination of Japanese
authorities,"" Soma said.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its
performance against a basket of major currencies, last traded at
74.062, well off a recent high around 75.424. 
 Daisuke Karakama, market economist for Mizuho
Corporate Bank in Tokyo, said market players were likely to
continue to favour the yen and Swiss franc over the dollar.	
 ""Unless we see very positive U.S. economic data...dollar
buying is unlikely to emerge,"" Karakama said.	
 ""For dollar/yen to really start rising, I think we need to
see moves toward fiscal stimulus in the United States,"" he
added. 
 One factor that may weigh on the dollar against the yen
is a narrowing of its yield advantage. The yield spread of U.S.
five-year Treasuries over five-year Japanese government bonds
dipped to 65.5 basis points , the lowest
since late 2008, during the global financial crisis. 
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 0.6 percent to
0.7254 francs , after having plunged 6 percent at one
stage on Tuesday to a record low around 0.7067. That move
will not please the Swiss National Bank which last week vowed to
do all it can to restrain the franc.	
 The euro rose 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.0404 , pulling away from a record low around 1.0075
hit the previous day. 
 The single currency dipped 0.2 percent against the
dollar to $1.4346 , clinging to much of its gains from
Tuesday, when the euro climbed 1.4 percent against the
dollar.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Asian stocks clawed back some
lost ground on Wednesday, following a rebound in U.S. shares,
after the Federal Reserve made an unprecedented pledge to keep
interest rates near zero for at least two years, stemming a
global equity rout for the time being.	
 In Europe, Eurostoxx 50 futures  rose 1.2
percent and financial bookmakers were calling the FTSE 100
up 0.8 percent , but S&P 500 futures 
fell 0.2 percent , suggesting at least a pause in Wall
Street's sharp rally.	
 ""It's possible the bottom has been met but it is too early
to say so,"" said Albert Hung, chief investment officer at
Sydney-based Alleron Investment Management. 
 ""Normally when you see this sort of movement you need
another two weeks to be sure the bottom has been found.""	
 Investors remained wary about the implication of the Fed's
move -- that it expects the U.S. economy to remain weak far
longer than previously forecast -- and this supported demand for
safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.	
 ""Volatility is calming down from an extreme level. Clearly
there's going to be considerable concerns still, but the market
had gotten seriously carried away and gone to an extreme of
fear,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 
 World stock markets had been tumbling since the start of
August on fears of a slide back into recession for the United
States, reinforced by a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on
Friday, and the ever-expanding euro zone debt crisis.	
 MSCI's all-country world stock index
remained about 16 percent below its May peak on Wednesday, after
slipping as far as 20 percent, the generally accepted definition
of a bear market, on Tuesday.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei r ose 1.1 percent and
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
gained 2.9 percent , led by the
materials sector, which jumped more than 3.5 percent
. The benchmark has fallen around 12 percent in
August.	
 Wall Street shares posted their biggest one-day gain in more
than two years on Tuesday, when the S&P 500 index leapt
4.7 percent. 
 ""I doubt share prices will keep rising from current levels
as central banks' policies are not helping to lift the real
economy, they are simply pumping liquidity by purchasing bonds
and keeping rates low,"" said Jun Fukashiro, chief fund manager
at Toyota Asset management.	
 Australia's resource-heavy index gained 2.8 percent
. Commodities such as oil and industrial metals,
whose demand is related to economic growth, also rose. 
 
 CONFIDENCE SHAKEN	
 While the U.S. downgrade from Standard & Poor's was a big
symbolic blow, investor confidence has also been shaken by data
suggesting the world's biggest economy was stalling and even
second-ranked China was facing headwinds.	
 There was some reassurance from China on Wednesday, with
data showing export growth accelerated in July, outpacing
analysts' consensus forecasts. 
 But whilst the numbers demonstrated that China is not
dependent just on demand from the United States, few doubt that
a ""double dip"" in the developed world would hit Asia.	
 ""The economic reality is that if the U.S. enters into a
recession, then no matter how strong growth in China is, China
will be negatively impacted,"" said Victor Shum, an analyst at
energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz.	
 A Reuters poll showed Wall Street economists shortening the
odds on the United States lapsing back into recession to around
one-in-three, heightening expectations the Federal Reserve may
launch another round of unconventional credit easing.

 
 CARRY TRADE BACK	
 The Fed said on Tuesday that U.S. growth was proving
considerably weaker than expected, suggesting inflation will
remain contained for the foreseeable future. 
 The central bank's decision on rates is likely to be good
news for the so-called carry trade, in which traders use cheap
dollar loans to fund buying riskier, higher-yielding assets.	
 ""Once volatility eases, they should be in business until at
least mid-2013,"" wrote Rabobank analyst Philip Marey in a
report.	
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose about 0.5
percent to around 0.7250 francs , having plunged 6
percent at one stage on Tuesday to a record low around 0.7067.

 The dollar dipped to around 76.90 yen , not far from
the all-time trough of 76.15 reached in mid-March. 
The euro eased a little to around $1.4345, but
remained well above last week's trough around $1.4054. 
 Continued strength in the Swiss franc and yen keeps alive
the prospect of further intervention by the Swiss and Japanese
authorities, after both took steps to weaken their currencies
last week.	
 Japanese government bonds rose broadly after the Fed
statement pushed U.S. Treasury yields to new lows. 
 Gold was steady around $1,744 an ounce,
after striking the latest in a string of records around
$1,778 on Tuesday. 
 U.S. crude oil climbed back above $80 a barrel, rising about
3 percent to trade around $81.65 , while London metal
exchange three-month copper rose around 2 percent,
climbing back towards $9,000 a tonne. [ O/R]

 ""The Fed statement will give a boost to overall commodity
markets as it is more like injecting confidence into the
markets,"" said Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures in
Singapore. ""But there are uncertainties over U.S. economic
growth and China.""

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks clawed back most of
Monday's losses as a U.S. Federal Reserve promise of at least
two more years of near-zero interest rates overshadowed its
warning about slowing economic growth.
 The Fed's statement gave markets a glimmer of hope, with
stocks' gains accelerating into Tuesday's close.
 In a sign investors were not entirely convinced of the
Fed's ability to stave off another recession, they sought safer
bets, including the Swiss franc and gold. Gold  pared its
early gain to record levels but was still up about 1 percent at
just above $1,728 an ounce.
 But Wall Street still almost reversed Monday's meltdown --
the steepest fall in nearly three years. However, the S&P 500
is down 14 percent from its April peak, with the bulk of
selling coming after a downgrade to U.S. debt and festering
concern about the euro zone's inability to solve its own
persistent credit problems.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
2.1 percent.
 Short-term Treasury bond yields hit record lows as
investors speculated that the central bank would soon return to
the bond market, little more than a month after the end of its
last big program of purchases.
 The Fed said it would keep its existing monetary stimulus
on track and offered a long two-year timeframe for rates to
stay low. Although it offered no new monetary initiatives, it
said it was prepared to do more if necessary.
 ""It's basically giving more credence to the fact that they
are going to be accommodative for a much longer period of time,
which in general has been a positive for equities,"" said
Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management
LLC, a hedge fund in New York.
 The Fed also said U.S. economic growth was proving
considerably weaker than expected, suggesting inflation, which
has already moderated recently, will remain contained for the
foreseeable future. For details, see [ID:nN1E7780FW]
 Some investors hoping for action from the Fed had
acknowledged the cental bank's options to be limited because
the current crisis is not liquidity-driven, as it was in 2008.
 ""All they did was extended the period that they are going
to be on hold - that is meaningless here,"" said Paul
Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial
Services in Charlotte, Vermont. ""Where does (Fed Chairman Ben)
Bernanke go next?""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 429.92
points, or 3.98 percent, to 11,239.77. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> jumped 53.07 points, or 4.74 percent, to
1,172.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 124.83
points, or 5.29 percent, to 2,482.52.
 U.S.-dollar denominated Nikkei futures <.NKc1> edged up 0.6
percent.
 The dollar tumbled against the Swiss franc ,
yen  and euro . The dollar fell 4.6 percent
to 0.7198 Swiss franc after hitting a record low of 0.70676.
The franc also climbed to a record high of 1.0075 against the
euro , before retreating.
 Two-year Treasury notes  were last up 4/32 in
price to yield 0.20 percent, and three-year notes 
rose 10/32 in price, with yields dropping to 0.32 percent.
 Five-year notes  rose 12/32 in price, with yields
falling to 1.00 percent, while 10-year notes  were
last up 10/32 in price to yield 2.28 percent. Thirty-year bonds
 were last up 4/32 in price to yield 3.65 percent,
after earlier falling as low as 3.46 percent.
 In London, Brent crude oil futures turned positive
post-settlement as stocks jumped late in the day, while U.S.
oil finished lower.
 ICE Brent crude for September delivery  rose 47 cents
to $104.21 a barrel by 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT). It had settled
earlier at a five-month low of $102.57, down $1.17, or 1.13
percent, after trading between $98.74 and $105.95.
 U.S. September crude  pared losses, but was still
down 70 cents at $80.61 a barrel post-settlement. It settled at
$79.30, down $2.01, having reached $83.05 after falling to
$75.71, the lowest since September 2010.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly,
plunging more than 5 percent against the Swiss franc at one
point on Tuesday, as the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep
rates near zero for another two years further diminished its
allure to global investors.
 It was a volatile trading day, with the dollar initially
rising versus commodity currencies such as the Aussie and New
Zealand dollars after the Fed's statement and the euro
trimming gains. But that reversed in late trading as U.S.
stocks rallied sharply.
 Analysts said it was once again an affirmation to sell the
dollar. See Fed wrapup [ID:nN1E7780FW].
 ""We view the (Fed) statement as aggressively dovish, even
beyond our expectations,"" said Dan Dorrow, head of research at
Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""This is euro/dollar positive and equity-positive because
the explicit two-year period, until mid-2013, for 'on
rock-bottom-hold' will anchor the short-end of the dollar
yield curve and impact euro/dollar interest-rate
differentials.""
 Global investors were initially disappointed that the Fed
offered no new ideas to stop the U.S. economy from sliding
back into recession. They were hoping for more aggressive bond
purchases to boost a flagging economy.
 ""What surprised me about the Fed statement was how
negative it was. There was a contingent of people that were
hoping that the Fed will pull out some sort of magic bullet to
stimulate the economy,"" said Jeffrey Sica, president and chief
investment Officer of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown,
New Jersey, which has $1 billion of assets under management.
 ""Investors sold off because they're hit with the fact that
'Wow, we are really in a recession' and there may be no
overnight cure.""
 The dollar fell to an all-time low of 0.70676 franc
 on trading platform EBS after the Fed statement and
was last at 0.71955, down 4.7 percent. The greenback has lost
nearly 23 percent of its value against the franc so far this
year and there seems to be no let-up in selling.
 It was the worst trading day ever for the dollar against
the Swiss franc.
 The euro dropped to its lowest on record as well at
1.00750 francs  and last changed hands at 1.03380
francs, down 3.4 percent for the day.
 Investors are now on high alert for any intervention from
the Swiss National Bank to slow the surging Swiss currency.
 The SNB, though, may be reluctant to intervene after
attempts to weaken the franc when the euro fell below 1.50 in
the wake of the Lehman crisis left the central bank sitting
with heavy losses.
 One-month implied volatility in euro/Swiss -- a measure of
the market's expectations of future movements in the currency
pair -- hit record levels of more than 32 percent
.
 The euro has fallen about 15 percent versus the franc IN
2011. Analysts said the euro could reach parity with the
franc, despite the SNB's recent move to cut interest rates and
warnings over the franc's strength.
 The euro, however, gained 1.3 percent against the dollar
to $1.42600 .
 The dollar fell as low as 76.700 yen on EBS , not
far from a record low of 76.15 yen reached in mid-March. It
last traded at 76.980, down 0.9 percent. Last week, Japan
intervened when dollar/yen was trading around 77.10 yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on
several occasions that he was watching markets closely, but
said authorities would wait to see market reaction to the U.S.
Fed decision before deciding whether to act again.
 ""Once the dust settles on this latest global panic, the
dollar is going to be the lead funding currency (in carry
trades) with no interest-rate risk through next year,"" said
Jay Meisler, co-founder of Global-View.com, a forex discussion
site.
 ""This is a big assumption, but if things stabilize, it is
hard to make a case for holding dollars.""

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks seesawed higher on
Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve promised to hold
interest rates low for at least two years, clawing back from
knee-jerk disappointment the central bank did not have a new
trump card up its sleeve.
 Wall Street pushed higher for most of the session after
Monday's rout -- the steepest fall in nearly three years -- on
hopes the central bank would come to the markets' rescue, as it
has in the past. Indexes trimmed gains before the Fed's
statement and subsequently dropped briefly into negative
territory.
 The Fed said it would keep its existing monetary stimulus
on track and offered a long two-year timeframe for rates to
stay low. But it offered no new monetary initiatives.
 The Fed said U.S. economic growth was proving considerably
weaker than expected, suggesting inflation, which has already
moderated recently, will remain contained for the foreseeable
future. For details, see [ID:nN1E7780FW]
 It also signaled that it was prepared to do more if
necessary, noting that it still has tools available for
spurring growth and will use them if necessary.
 Even some investors hoping for action from the Fed
acknowledged the cental bank's options were limited because the
current crisis is not liquidity-driven, as it was in 2008.
 ""If they have to act they will. They didn't act today
because they didn't want to send a specific message of panic,""
said Alberto Bernal, head of emerging markets fixed income
research at Bulltick Capital Markets in Florida.
 Safe-haven investments remained in favor and the U.S.
dollar plunged more than 5 percent against the Swiss franc,
hitting record lows for the third session in a row.
 U.S. Treasuries prices pared their gains as stocks
recovered. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  last
traded up 37/32 in price with a yield of 2.19 percent.
 ""The statement was extremely negative in its outlook on the
economy,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""This is definitely a negative for risk appetite and that's
why we're seeing the yen and Swiss franc at new highs.""

 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gave up gains but
held in positive territory on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal
Reserve failed to offer more than a 2-year promise of low
interest rates, coupled with a warning the economy had
weakened.
 Wall Street had pushed higher for most of the session after
Monday's rout on hopes the central bank would come to the
markets' rescue, as it has in the past.
 However, the cental bank's options appeared to be limited
because the current crisis is not liquidity-driven, as it was
in 2008. The Fed said it would keep its existing monetary
stimulus on track and offered a long two-year timeframe for
rates to stay low. But it offered no new monetary initiatives.
 The Fed said U.S. economic growth was proving considerably
weaker than expected, suggesting inflation, which has already
moderated recently, will remain contained for the foreseeable
future. For details, see [ID:nN1E7780FW]
 ""This is a lame way for the Fed to try to help the
marketplace,"" said Cary Leahey, managing director and senior
economist at Decision Economics in New York.
 ""The market needs a sense that the Fed is willing to do
more today, rather than merely say that they're not going to
tighten in mid-2012 versus 2013. Nobody really cares.""
 Safe-haven investments remained in favor. The Swiss franc
hit a fresh record high against the euro and 30-year Treasury
bond prices turned positive, erasing previous losses. The
30-year bond  last traded up 78/32 in price with a
yield of 3.53 percent.
 ""The statement was extremely negative in its outlook on the
economy,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared gains in
volatile trade on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said
it would keep interest rates low for at least another two
years.
 Investors had been hoping for action from the Fed to
alleviate worries the economy could fall back into recession,
which had pushed Wall Street higher for most of the day. For

 However, the cental bank's options appeared to be limited
because the current crisis is not liquidity-driven, as it was

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - World stocks rebounded from a
10-day rout on Tuesday as investors looked to the U.S. Federal
Reserve to calm markets, though rallies in gold and the Swiss
franc showed some were clinging to safe assets.
 The Federal Reserve has rescued world markets in the past,
which may explain why some investors were pulling back from the
recent gloom. But such expectation also leave markets open to
disappointment should the statement after the Fed's meeting on
Tuesday be deemed inadequate.
 The Fed may have limited options because the current crisis
is not liquidity-driven, as it was in 2008. The meltdown across
assets instead reflects worries about faltering economic growth
and paralysis at the highest levels of government -- on both
sides of the Atlantic -- in dealing with economic problems.
 ""Short term, the market will hinge on what the Fed has to
say, but we think the next few months will remain volatile and
it is difficult to say whether now is the right time to buy,""
said Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at
Rathbones Brothers plc in London.
 In a sign of hesitation that the equity-market rebound
could be cut short, safe-haven bets were still favored as gold
hit another record and investors pushed into the Swiss franc.
 Fears of a new global economic downturn, reinforced by a
downgrade of the United States' credit rating last Friday and
the debt crisis in the euro zone, had sent world shares down as
much as 20 percent from May's peak.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> recovered
from early losses and was up 1.1 percent. The earlier drop put
it on track for a 10th straight day of declines, which is
extremely rare. The record is 13, back in the 1990s.
 U.S. stocks were up more than 2.0 percent at midday
following Monday's biggest drop in almost three years. European
shares <.FTEU3> also bounced to close up 1.3 percent.
 ""You had a cataclysmic sell-off in the marketplace,"" said
Cliff Draughn, president and chief investment officer at
Excelsia Investment Advisors in Savannah, Georgia.
 ""You are technically way oversold and secondly, this whole
thing has been political.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 173.66
points, or 1.61 percent, at 10,983.51. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 25.34 points, or 2.26 percent, at
1,144.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 71.94
points, or 3.05 percent, at 2,429.63.
 The Fed statement is due at 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT). It is
unclear, however, what the Fed's options are, with interest
rates already near zero and the central bank's latest round of
bond purchases having failed to stimulate credit demand. For
details, see [ID:nN1E77724B]
 SAFETY FIRST
 The saving grace for markets now is that the main arteries
of the financial system -- short-term funding markets and
clearing and processing operations -- are not imperiled, as
they were in 2008. Standard & Poor's downgraded major clearing
companies on Monday but it has not affected their operations.
 There were no signs of distress in overnight repurchasing
markets, where institutions borrow money from one another using
U.S. Treasury securities as collateral.
 Treasuries, which soared on Monday, gave back some of those
gains in active trading.
 The 10-year Treasury note  was down 11/32, its
yield rising to 2.35 percent, erasing about 1/3 of the previous
day's gain.
 The 30-year bond  was down 26/32, yielding 3.69
percent. It touched 3.75 percent in overseas trading and
hovered near its lowest levels since Sept. 2010.
 Higher-than-expected inflation data from China added to
concerns about the global economy. The country's industrial
output also grew at a slower pace in July, with the central
bank trying to keep prices in check without dragging down the
economy. [ID:nL3E7J91PZ]
 A Reuters poll found the United States faces one-in-four
odds of slipping back into recession, and a weaker economic
outlook is raising the likelihood the Federal Reserve will soon
do more to boost growth. [ID:nL9E7I401E]
 Gold  hit a record $1,778 an ounce in its biggest
three-day rally since the financial crisis in late 2008. It
gained more than 3 percent on Monday.
 Spot prices retreated from the highs but were still up 1.4
percent.
 The Swiss franc surged to record highs for the third day in
a row against the euro and the U.S. dollar.
 The euro dropped to a fresh low against the franc at
1.03550 Swiss francs  on trading platform EBS. It
was last at 1.03880, down 3.0 percent for the day. The euro was
on track for its biggest one day loss against the franc since
December 2008.
 The Japanese yen, which also tends to benefit in times of
market stress, breached 77 yen per dollar, above levels that
triggered official intervention from Tokyo last week.

 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc soared on
Tuesday to record highs for a third straight day against the
euro and dollar as concerns about the global economic outlook
and a rout in stock markets drove investors to safety.
 Analysts said focus is now on Tuesday's meeting of the U.S.
Federal Reserve's policy committee, with investors likely to
scour for hints about any new monetary stimulus program with
fears of a new global downturn growing. [ID:nN1E77723B]
 The Japanese yen, which also tends to benefit in times of
market stress, breached 77 yen per dollar, above levels that
triggered official intervention from Tokyo last week. The
growth-sensitive Australian dollar briefly fell below parity
against the U.S. currency but recovered.
 Fears of a new global downturn and the perception that
global policymakers lack the tools to stop it pushed world
equities <.MIWD00000PUS> down for a 10th consecutive day. The
sell-off accelerated this week after the U.S. debt rating cut.
 ""There are global growth concerns that are resonating
throughout the markets. It's more than just what we saw in
terms of the S&P downgrade,"" said Mary Nicola, currency
strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 The Fed is slated to make its interest-rate decision and
release the accompanying statement around 2:15 p.m. (1815
GMT).
 ""With central bankers around the world recently carrying
out various forms of intervention...one wonders what tricks are
left,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 ""Such are the forces in motion that any action can only be
seen as being consigned to stemming powerful moves without
addressing underlying problems.""
 The United States faces one-in-four odds of slipping back

 The euro dropped to its lowest on record at 1.0475 Swiss
francs  on trading platform EBS. It was last at
1.0528 in volatile trade, down 1.7 percent for the day.
 The franc also rose to an all-time high versus the dollar
 on EBS of 0.73592 before easing to 0.7394, with the
dollar down 2.1 percent.
 FRANC AT PARITY?
 The euro has fallen about 15 percent versus the franc so
far this year. Analysts said the franc could reach parity with
the euro, despite the Swiss National Bank's recent move to cut
interest rates and warnings over the franc's strength.
 ""Parity looks pretty likely for euro/Swiss as long as there
is heightened risk aversion,"" said Tom Levinson, currency
strategist at ING. ""The SNB has been threatening but they had
a terrible time with intervention last time and the market is
taking them on.""
 The SNB may be reluctant to intervene in currency markets
after attempts to weaken the franc when the euro fell below
1.50 in the wake of the Lehman crisis left the central bank
sitting with heavy losses.
 One-month implied volatility in the euro/Swiss -- a measure
of the market's expectations of future movements in the
currency pair -- hit record levels of around 26 percent
.
 Against the yen , the dollar fell as low as 76.98
on EBS, not far from a record low of 76.15 yen reached in
mid-March. It last traded at 77.20 yen, down 0.7 percent. Japan
intervened to stem yen strength last week when the dollar/yen
was trading around 77.10 yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on
several occasions that he was watching markets closely, but
said that authorities would wait to see market reaction to the
U.S. Fed decision before deciding whether to act again.
 The dollar briefly spiked against the yen in Asia, fueling
speculation that Tokyo authorities had stepped into the market
to follow up on last week's massive yen selling intervention,
but there were no sightings of official action on Tuesday.
 The Australian dollar earlier fell below parity against the
U.S. dollar, sliding to $0.9927 , its lowest in
about five months, but later recovered to $1.0165, still down
0.3 percent on the day.
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.4259  after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the ECB was
actively buying government bonds. Traders said the ECB was
buying Spanish and Italian bonds for the second day running.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for a 10th
session running on Tuesday, racking up a ""bear market"" 20
percent loss since early May, but potential gains on Wall Street
looked set to break the chain.	
 European shares pared back their losses as U.S. stock index
futures pointed to a solid open after a six percent rout on
Monday.  
 Fuelled by fears of a new global downturn, world shares have
shed some 16 percent since late July. Ten days of losses are
extremely rare. The record is 13, back in the 1990s.	
 Gold hit another record high and the Swiss franc was in
demand as money fled to whatever was seen as a safer harbour.	
 Focus was on a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve later in
day, with investors likely to scour for hints about any new
monetary stimulus programme with fears of a new global downturn
growing. 
 Higher-than-expected inflation data from China added to
investor concerns, with the United States slowing and its credit
rating downgraded, and Europe reeling under a debt crisis.	
 There was some easing of the latter, however, with Italian
and Spanish government bond yields falling and traders saying
they were seeing more buying by the European Central Bank.

 MSCI's all-country world index was down 0.4
percent, well off its lows when its losses reached 20 percent
since peaking in May. The market rule of thumb is that a fall of
that magnitude constitutes a ""bear market"".	
 Emerging market stocks lost 3 percent and are down
more than 16 percent for 2011.	
 ""It looks like the market is massively overdone on the
downside,"" said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital. ""A
few value investors are there seeing the asset prices have gone
down to extreme levels. Markets are oversold.""	
 European bourses fell steeply but later recovered. The
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
0.4 percent on the day, a minor fall in the recent context.	
 Some long-term investors are starting to see opportunities
in the rout. 
 BlackRock, a leading U.S. investment house, said it was
going to use profits from its gold and bond portfolios to seek
out stock bargains.	
 
 SAFETY FIRST	
 Gold posted another record high as investors sought
some haven for their money. It was up about 2 percent at around
$1,752 an ounce. It gained more than three percent on Monday.	
 ""Markets are now worried about another global recession. Out
of Europe, French bond yields have widened on expectations of
sovereign debt downgrade because of the country's exposure to
peripheral European debt,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities
strategist at ANZ.	
 German business daily Handelsblatt quoted Moritz Kraemer,
head of the European sovereign unit of Standard & Poor's as
saying the rating outlook for Britain and France was stable and
he did not expect to downgrade them within the next two years.	
 The dollar fell 1.7 percent on the day against the Swiss
franc, extending losses to hit a record trough as the U.S.
currency tumbled against currencies perceived to be safe havens.	
 It fell 0.8 percent on the day versus the yen and was
down half a percent against a basket of currencies .	
 Over time, analysts expect currencies with deeper liquidity
to stay in favour in a predominantly risk-off environment. 
 ""Liquidity matters in the current environment so the Swiss
franc, the yen, the dollar and to some extent the euro will
remain well supported, They are large and liquid and don't have
the stretched positioning associated with carry currencies such
as the Aussie, Kiwi and the Nordics,"" said Raghav Subbarao,
currency strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 On bond markets, Italian and Spanish government yields fell.
Italian 5-year government bond yields were 20 basis
points lower at 4.3 percent, with 10-year yields
18 bps lower at 5.1 percent. 
Spanish 10-year yields were 16 basis points
lower at 5.04 percent.

 By Ian Chua and Chikafumi Hodo	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc surged to an
all-time high against the euro on Tuesday as investors'
confidence was shattered by extended falls in share prices,
prompting them to flock to safe haven currencies.	
 The yen advanced while the dollar strengthened versus
commodity currencies as Wall Street's biggest sell-off since
December 2008 prompted a massive flight to safety, but wariness
over possible intervention made investors cautious about testing
the yen to record high levels.	
 Risk-related currencies found some respite after Asian
bourses bounced off intraday lows with Tokyo's stock market
trimming losses to 1.7 percent from more than 4 percent
and Seoul shares recouping more than a half of more than
8 percent intraday falls.	
 ""The yen and the Swiss franc are drawing extremely strong
demand as plunges in global shares are having a major
psychological impact, forcing investors to refrain from holding
risk assets,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 0.7514 Swiss franc
, edging higher after coming close to an all-time low
around 0.7483 reached the previous day.	
 The euro plunged to a record low on trading platform EBS of
1.0605 francs , then traded flat at 1.0700.	
 ""The dollar, the Swissy and the yen are being bought today
and that's why we're seeing relatively less volatility in those
crosses,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange
research at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 ""Dollar/yen isn't being sold most aggressively because the
dollar is also supported by safe-haven demand, thus both the yen
and the dollar are in the same basket, limiting the volatility
between them.""	
 Still, at one point the dollar drifted to 77.051 ,
below levels where Japanese authorities intervened heavily on
Aug. 4. and not far off the record low of 76.25 yen reached in
mid-March. It was down 0.6 percent at 77.25 yen.	
 The dollar briefly spiked against the yen as large stop loss
orders were triggered in the South African rand ,
prompting the dollar towards an intraday high of 77.86 yen and
fuelling speculation that Tokyo authorities had stepped into the
market, but the dollar's subsequent decline eased market
jitters.	
 ""The market is wary of buying the yen too aggressively,
particularly after intervention last week. It will be a bit
difficult to sell dollar/yen from current levels,"" Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi's Ino said.	
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday he
is closely watching markets with a sense of urgency after share
prices tumbled due to uncertainty over the global economic
outlook. 
 
 EURO DRIFTS, AUSSIE BELOW PARITY	
 Despite trading up 0.3 percent at $1.4226 the euro stayed
below its recent highs on the dollar, having touched around
$1.4400 on Monday.	
 The euro's softness came even as traders said the European
Central Bank bought Spanish and Italian debt early in the
European session, putting into action its vow to ""actively
implement"" its bond-buying programme.	
 The euro was at $1.4224 , up 0.3 percent from late
U.S. levels the previous day.	
 Commodities currencies were hit as oil, grains and metal
prices extended their losses in Asia. 
 ""We are seeing strong net selling of especially the
Australian and Canadian dollars as commodity-linked currencies
lose ground amid renewed concerns about global growth stalling,""
said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy
at BNY Mellon in Boston.	
 At one point the Australian dollar fell below parity against
the U.S. dollar, sliding to $0.9927 , its lowest in
about five months, but later recovered to $1.0139.	
 The Aussie has lost about 10 cents from a 29-year peak of
$1.1081 set just two weeks ago.	
 The market's next focus is squarely on Federal Reserve
policymakers, who are due to meet on Tuesday. 
 There has been talk that the Fed will discuss options for
more measures to help the economy, but the common view on Wall
Street is that it will refrain from any fresh moves after having
completed a $600 billion bond programme known as QE2 in June.	
 Still, given the magnitude of the recent declines on Wall
Street, the Fed will be under intense pressure to offer some
sort of assistance, if only verbal.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Asian shares tumbled on Tuesday
as investors scrambled to adjust to a rapid downgrade in the
outlook for U.S. and global economic growth, but later staged a
sharp rebound from early lows, helping cushion expected losses
in Europe.	
 U.S. S&P 500 index futures  pulled back sharply from
earlier lows and crept into positive territory, while European
index futures <.STXEc1> also pared early losses and were trading
down around 0.5 percent.	
 Major indexes in Asia slumped in early trade
following a drop of more than 6 percent on Wall Street on Monday
in the first trading session since the historic downgrade of the
United States' AAA credit rating by Standard & Poor's.	
 Many market weatchers fear the move will exacerbate the U.S.
economic slowdown by further undermining business and consumer
confidence, possibly tipping the country back into recession.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei closed down 1.7 percent, having been
down more than 4 percent at one stage, and MSCI's broadest index
of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was down
1.9 percent, after tumbling more than 6 percent earlier.	
 Australia's benchmark staged the most dramatic
comeback and was up 1.2 percent after being more than 5 percent
in the red. Elsewhere, buying by state pension funds helped pare
heavy initial losses in South Korea and Taiwan .	
 ""Not even in the global financial crisis did we see this
extraordinary volatility,"" said RBS Australia's head of Sydney
sales trading, Justin Gallagher.	
 The market turmoil of recent days puts significant pressure
on the U.S. Federal Reserve at its regular policy meeting on
Tuesday to announce some fresh measures of support for a damaged
U.S. economy, though its options are limited. 
 Market players cited short-covering ahead of the Fed meeting
as one factor for the rebound in Asia, while bargain hunting and
the fading of early margin selling were also cited.	
 Traders said a rumour had been circulating in markets that
the Federal Reserve might make an emergency statement before
Wall Street opened, but most analysts dismissed the prospect as
highly unlikely.	
 
 World stocks had touched 11-month lows on Tuesday, while
gold struck a new record as investors dumped riskier assets amid
fears that political leaders are failing to tackle debt crises
in Europe and the United States.	
 MSCI's All-Country World Index has
fallen about 14 percent so far this month, wiping around $3.8
trillion off company values, to its lowest levels since last
August. 
 
 FLIGHT-TO-SAFETY	
 The flight-to-safety lifted gold to the latest in a string
of record highs and boosted the Swiss franc and the yen.	
 ""The breadth and the discipline of the selling is the most
troubling factor,"" said Keith Ducker, chief investment officer
at ""dark pool operator Tora.	
 ""Panic selling is generally followed by quick recoveries
however the past two days have been driven more from thoughtful
risk aversion ... indicating that this downturn may be more
cyclical and potentially long-term in nature.""	
 While the U.S. downgrade late on Friday was the most obvious
blow to confidence, investors have also been spooked by data
suggesting the U.S. economy was stalling and Europe's
ever-worsening sovereign debt crisis.	
 There are also concerns about China's inflation rate, which
analysts fear could curb Beijing's ability to stimulate demand
to offset a global slowdown.	
 ""The macroeconomic picture outside of Asia is bleak and
Asia's ability to remain immune is doubtful in the extreme,""
said Alex Hill, co-founder of Singapore-based hedge fund
Tantallon Capital, which manages more than $300 million.	
 Chinese data on Tuesday failed to offer respite, showing
consumer price inflation hugging three-year highs in July.	
 ""This is the type of data that should have prompted the PBoC
to hike interest rates, but given the current turmoil in
financial markets, we expect them to delay it,"" said Wei Yao, an
economist with Societe Generale in Hong Kong.	
 The main index in South Korea , an economy
particularly vulnerable to global capital outflows that was hard
hit in 2008, was down almost 10 percent at one stage, but was
supported by state pension fund buying and ended down 3.6
percent.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 2.8 percent, pulling
back from initial losses of more than 7 percent.	
 ""It's very emotive trading,"" said Simon Burge, chief
investment officer at ATI Asset Management in Australia.
""Fundamentals would have to deteriorate quite significantly to
catch up with where share prices are.""	
 The dollar traded around 0.7545 Swiss franc , edging
higher after coming close to an all-time low around 0.7483
reached the previous day. 
The euro plunged to a record low on trading platform EBS of
1.0605 francs , then traded flat at 1.0700.	
 ""The yen and the Swiss franc are drawing extremely strong
demand as plunges in global shares are having a major
psychological impact, forcing investors to refrain from holding
risk assets,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 Gold , a traditional refuge from financial storms, hit
a record above $1,770 an ounce, and was later trading around
$1,748. 
 JP Morgan said on Monday it expected spot gold to
climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher by year-end, following the
downgrade of U.S. debt. The U.S. bank said its previous estimate
of $1,800 was ""too conservative"". 
 U.S. crude oil futures  fell around $1.50 by
mid-afternoon, or about 1.8 percent, to below $80 a barrel, but
were well off session lows. 
 
 TIME OF OPPORTUNITY?	
 Whilst traders in Asian markets such as South Korea and
Japan reported foreign money bailing out of local stocks, many
asset managers maintained that the region still offers the best
prospects.	
 ""From a macro, top-down perspective, we expect the relative
strength of the region's fundamentals to continue to attract
incremental foreign capital,"" said RBS Asia Pacific equity
strategists in a note.	
 ""From a sector standpoint, it still appears that the one
sector standing above any other for the delicate trade-off
between risk and reward is telecoms. Valuations or expectations
cannot be said to be anywhere near excessive levels."" 
 While the steepling falls in equities reminded many of the
shockwaves that swept through markets in the wake of Lehman
Brother's collapse, money and corporate credit markets are not
yet seeing a repeat of the strains witnessed three years ago.	
 ""We are not seeing a replica of Lehman in terms of a
systemic failure of the global banking system, most of the bank
markets are still functioning reasonably, in terms of funding
markets, commercial paper markets,"" said Warren Hogan, chief
economist at ANZ Banking Corporation	
 And as many traders hit the sell button, Anthony
Bolton, one of Britain's best known equity fund managers who now
runs the firm's China Special Situations Fund , saw a
buying opportunity.	
 ""History shows that normally extreme equity market
volatility as we are now experiencing should be seen as a time
of opportunity rather than a time to become more defensive,"" he
said in a statement.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Monday,
racking up their biggest losses in almost three years as
investors fled to the safety of gold and bonds after the
downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's stoked
fears the country is powerless to stop another recession.
 Wall Street ended down more than 6 percent while European
stocks hit a two-year low as investors saw no solution to the
twin debt crises on both sides of the Atlantic.
 A favored gauge of investor anxiety spiked to its biggest
one-day gain since February 2007, a sign investors are afraid
of more declines to come. The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX>
surged 50 percent to end at 48.
 The selling came in heavy trading, with volume of 17.5
billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and
Nasdaq, the busiest since the day after last year's ""flash
crash.""
 Ironically, investors took shelter in the one asset that
was directly affected by the downgrade -- U.S. government
bonds. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, held widely for their
perceived high quality, rallied, the yield dropping to 2.32
percent.
 Investors struggled to discern the effects of the U.S.
credit rating downgrade to AA-plus from AAA, which could hit
various components of the vast U.S. financial sector, from
mortgage lenders to municipal issuers and insurers.
 ""It is a panic, and almost by definition it doesn't have an
issue. It wouldn't matter what it was,"" said James Paulsen,
chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, with
over $340 billion in assets under management.
 The downgrade -- and threats of subsequent moves by S&P or
other rating agencies -- adds to concern about the credibility
of the United States as the leader in the global economy, as
well as the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency.
 Central to S&P's argument was that political paralysis in
Washington has reached a point where the government would be
unable to deal with worsening deficits and sagging economic
growth. This burdens a stock market already skittish after last
week's outbreak of fear.
 ""In many ways this is not about the downgrade. I think it's
about the underlying fundamentals and issues that are embodied
in the downgrade itself,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S.
equity strategist at UBS in New York.
 This was underlined when selling accelerated during
comments from U.S. President Barack Obama, after he blamed the
downgrade on political gridlock in Washington. He said he would
offer more recommendations on how to reduce federal deficits,
but detailed no new proposals.For details, see [ID:nN1E7771BR]
 ""Almost universally my clients are blaming this on the
government, this lack of confidence -- and that is what this
is,"" said William Suplee, a certified financial planner at
Structured Asset Management in Paoli, Pennsylvania, who said he
had received several calls from clients on Monday.
 ""This sell-off is uniformly blamed by my clients on the
government's inability to act rationally.""
 MSCI's all-country world stock index dropped 5.1 percent to
its lowest level since September 2010.
 Monday's global stock market sell-off wiped out more than
$1.35 trillion in investor wealth worldwide, according to the
5.2 percent drop in the MSCI World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>. The
index entered the week with a value of $26.42 trillion.
 Monday's rush for the exits extinguished any relief from
news the European Central Bank was buying Italian and Spanish
government bonds in the latest move to staunch the euro zone
debt crisis.[ID:nLDE7770NM]
 SEARCH FOR SAFETY
 Several major brokerages have in recent days lowered their
expectations for U.S. economic growth and share appreciation
for 2011 and 2012.
 Moody's repeated a warning it could downgrade the United
States before 2013 if the fiscal or economic outlook weakened
significantly. It said it saw the potential for a new deal in
Washington to cut the budget deficit before then.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 634.76
points, or 5.55 percent, to 10,809.85. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index<.SPX> slumped 79.92 points, or 6.66 percent, to
1,119.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index<.IXIC> skidded 174.72
points, or 6.90 percent, to 2,357.69.
 The S&P 500 lost $729.3 billion in value with its drop of
6.66 percent, the biggest since December 2008.
 Investors looking for a place to park their money pushed
into gold, U.S. Treasuries and some safe-haven currencies.
 Gold  ran up to a record high above $1,700 an ounce.
Benchmark 10-year notes at one point soared over two
points in price, with yields falling as low as 2.33 percent,
the lowest level since February 2009.
 ""Treasuries are still a comparatively low-risk asset. I
think there's no doubt about that,"" said Michael Schumacher, a
strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The euro slumped to a record low of 1.0640 Swiss francs
 and last traded down 2.3 percent at 1.07220. It
also lost 2 percent versus the yen.
 The dollar fell 0.9 percent to 77.68 yen, having
slipped to around 77.45 on EBS. It was down 1.5 percent at
0.7557 Swiss franc, after falling to 0.7480 earlier,
also a record low.
 European shares closed down 4 percent after registering
gains on the ECB action. The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
has lost about 21 percent since a peak in mid-February, putting
it in bear market territory.

 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Monday
and investors fled to the safety of gold and bonds after the
downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's stoked
fears the United States is slipping into recession.
 Wall Street slumped as much as 6 percent by mid-afternoon
and European stocks hit a two-year low. A favored gauge of

 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Monday
as investors fled to the safety of gold and bonds the first
trading day after Standard & Poor's downgraded the United
States.
 U.S. stocks lost as much as 5 percent by mid-afternoon and
European stocks hit a two-year low. Wall Street's favored gauge
of investor anxiety spiked well above 40, a sign investors are
afraid of more declines to come. The CBOE Volatility Index
<.VIX> was up 39.4 percent at 44.60.
 Investors were struggling to discern the effects of the
U.S. credit rating downgrade, which could hit various
components of the vast U.S. financial sector, from mortgage
lenders to municipal issuers and insurers.
 ""When you get this kind of panic and fear into the market,
it goes beyond any realistic or sensible level. I wouldn't put
all my money in stocks right now. I'd hold some back,"" said
Mike Gibbs, chief market strategist at Morgan Keegan in
Memphis, Tennessee.
 Investors took shelter in the asset that was downgraded --
choosing U.S. government bonds for their liquidity and
perceived high quality.
 The downgrade -- and the threats of subsequent moves by S&P

credibility of the United States in the global economy as

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc and
the yen soared on Monday after Standard & Poor's cut the U.S.
credit rating and on fears euro zone debt troubles could worsen
into a global crisis despite efforts to contain it.
 The euro fell against the U.S. dollar, retracing early
gains after European Central Bank purchases of Spanish and
Italian debt did little to alleviate concern the region's debt
crisis is moving into core countries.
 The fallout from Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United
States on Friday pushed world stocks to their lowest level in
nearly a year, hitting investors already nervous about a
slowing global economy.
 The world's industrial powers pledged on Sunday to take
whatever actions were needed to steady financial markets.
 ""The perception in markets is increasingly that central
banks do not have the tools to solve the problems the advanced
economies face and that worse, the responses to date might have
caused more harm than good,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The euro slumped to a record low of 1.0640 Swiss francs
 and last traded down 2.5 percent at 1.06991. It
also lost 2 percent versus the yen .
 The dollar  fell 0.6 percent to 77.62 yen, having
slipped to around 77.60 on EBS. It was down 1.8 percent at
0.7538 Swiss franc , after falling to 0.7480 earlier,
also a record low.
 Traders said the European Central Bank bought Spanish and
Italian debt early in the European session after it said on
Sunday it would ""actively implement"" its bond-buying program.
The euro climbed to a high of $1.4432 before falling back to
trade at $1.4196, down 0.6 percent. For more, see
[ID:nL6E7J704K]
 The next downside target for the euro/dollar is seen around
Friday's low at $1.4055. Support lies around $1.4030, the
euro/dollar's 200-week moving average, strategists said.
 ""The complete unwind of the euro/dollar rally speaks
volumes about the currency market's fear of the euro zone
credit crisis,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency
research at GFT in New York.
 ""Today's price action is shaping up as a battle of
confidence between central banks and the bond vigilantes which
continue to press the credit markets in Spain, Italy and
perhaps France next,"" he added.
 Five-year credit default swaps on U.S. government debt were
little changed at 57 basis points, while the price on 5-year
French sovereign CS rose 15.5 basis points to 160 basis points
-- a record high -- according to data monitor Markit.
 INTERVENTION THREAT
 Demand for the franc and the yen kept alive the threat of
intervention by Swiss and Japanese authorities to weaken their
currencies, whose strength eats into export competitiveness.
 Market participants expect Japanese authorities will
re-enter the market if the dollar falls to 77.10 yen -- the
level at which it sold yen for dollars last week.
 Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo
in New York, said the U.S. downgrade will spur continued market
volatility and perhaps counter-intuitively, the U.S. dollar
could gain in the coming weeks, along with the Swiss franc and
Japanese yen as risk aversion continues.
 Investors will also turn their attention to a Federal
Reserve policy meeting on Tuesday.
 ""We expect (the Fed) to move closer to, or even announce
that maturing Treasury securities will be invested in the
middle of the yield curve. That should overwhelm the S&P
headlines in the short term, causing dollar weakness across the
board,"" said Axel Merk, president of Merk Investments in Palo
Alto, California.

 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday on
fears the European Central Bank's buying of Spanish and Italian
debt would not stem the spreading debt crisis, while the dollar
dropped against the Swiss franc and yen after the U.S. debt
rating cut.
 Traders said the ECB bought Spanish and Italian debt early
in the European session after it said on Sunday it would
""actively implement"" its bond-buying program. That helped lift
the euro to a high above $1.44 earlier. See [ID:nL6E7J704K]
 But the ECB purchases did little to alleviate concerns that
the euro zone's debt crisis is spreading to core countries.
Nervousness in global financial markets after Standard & Poor's
cut the United States's AAA sovereign rating on Friday also
prompted investors to shed risk and pressured the euro.
 ""The complete unwind of the euro/dollar rally before the
open of North American trade speaks volumes about the currency
market's fear of the euro zone credit crisis,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 ""Today's price action is shaping up as a battle of
confidence between central banks and the bond vigilantes which
continue to press the credit markets in Spain, Italy and
perhaps France next,"" he added.
 Five-year credit default swaps on French government debt
rose 15.5 basis points to 160 basis points -- a record high --
according to data monitor Markit. This means it costs 160,000
euros to protect 10 million euros of exposure to French bonds.
 The euro  last traded at $1.4174, near a session
low of $1.4150 on trading platform EBS and well off a session
peak of $1.44320. Traders see the next downside target around
Friday's low at $1.4055. Support is seen around $1.4030, the
euro/dollar's 200-week moving average.
 The euro fell 1.2 percent against the safe-haven Swiss
franc , near a record low. It also lost 1.7 percent
versus the yen .
 Trading in the euro remained volatile, with one-month
euro/dollar implied vol  rising to 14.25, while
one-month risk reversals , which track the skew
between options to buy or sell the currency, remained strongly
in favor of selling euros.
 RISK AVERSION
 The dollar  fell 0.8 percent to 77.79 yen, having
slipped to around 77.45 on EBS. It was down 0.5 percent at
0.7635 Swiss francs , in sight of a record low around
0.7480 plumbed earlier in the day.
 Wall Street stocks tumbled after the U.S. debt downgrade
rattled investors already nervous a global economic slump. Gold
hit a new record high above $1,700 an ounce.
 The world's industrial powers pledged on Sunday to take
whatever actions were needed to steady financial markets.
 ""The perception in markets is increasingly that central
banks do not have the tools to solve the problems the advanced
economies face and that worse the response to date might have
caused more harm than good,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Some analysts said the S&P downgrade highlighted the view
that the dollar will remain weak and that they saw room for the
U.S. currency to depreciate more than the euro versus a range
of currencies.
 ""Our hunch is that the external pressure on the euro is a
lot less than the external pressures on the dollar,"" said
Thomas Stolper, currency strategist at Goldman Sachs.
 ""As soon as there is a loss of confidence (in the U.S.),
foreigners stop buying U.S. assets. It's also the same as in
Europe, but the U.S. has a large current account deficit to
fund, whereas Europe doesn't.""
 Goldman held its euro/dollar forecast at $1.45 for the next
three months, while it expects the pair to hit $1.50 in six
months. It lowered its three-month dollar/yen forecast to 77
yen from 82, and sees the dollar falling to 74 yen in a year.
 Demand for the franc and the yen kept alive the threat of
intervention by Swiss and Japanese authorities to weaken their
currencies, whose strength eats into their exports.
 Market participants expect Japanese authorities will
re-enter the market if the dollar falls to 77.10 yen -- the
level at which it sold yen for dollars last week.

 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - World stocks slid to their
lowest level in nearly a year on Monday, overshadowing relief
that the European Central Bank was buying Italian and Spanish
government bonds in the latest move to staunch the euro zone
debt crisis.
 U.S. stocks extended losses in early trading, falling more
than 3.0 percent on the heels of its worst week in more than
two years. MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
dropped 3.8 percent. The index was at its lowest level since
September 2010.
 Despite Standard & Poor's downgrading the U.S. government's
long-term credit rating on Friday night, safe-haven U.S.
Treasury debt was higher in price. The 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond posted a full-point gain, its yield at 3.73
percent.
 Investors continued to seek safe haven in gold, which
vaulted above $1,700 an ounce for the first time after
respective pledges by the G7 and the European Central Bank
failed to quell turbulence in the financial markets and did
nothing to put investors at ease.
 ""What's concerning us and holding us back from buying what
we think is value is that the ferocity of the momentum of the
downside is still quite strong,"" said Paul Zemsky, head of
asset allocation at ING in New York.
 After an hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> dropped 368.28 points, or 3.22 percent, at 11,076.33.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 45.55 points,
or 3.80 percent, at 1,153.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index
<.IXIC> was down 105.68 points, or 4.17 percent, at 2,426.73.
 ECB BOND BUYING
 Even the European Central Bank's dramatic intervention in
bond markets, which pushed down yields on Spanish and Italian
bonds, was not enough to stem selling in stocks. For details,
see [nLDE7770NM]
 European shares <.FTEU3> were down 3.3 percent after
earlier registering gains on the ECB action, intended to take
the heat out of the spreading euro zone debt crisis. The
FTSEurofirst 300 index is nearing bear market territory,
characterized by a drop of 20 percent from the peak.
 ""The markets don't believe that the situation in Europe is
under control,"" a trader said. ""This market is very difficult
to make money. In fact, this past two weeks have been the
hardest in 10 years.""
 The euro fell against the U.S. dollar after gaining
initially on the ECB action.
 Investors were seemingly unimpressed by weekend talks among
industrialized countries aimed at safeguarding the smooth
functioning of financial markets following S&P's downgrade of
the U.S. government long-term rating to AA-plus from AAA.
[ID:nL3E7J80LZ]
 ""It won't be long now before other ratings agencies follow
suit, considering the state of the U.S.' finances. One thing is
for certain, and that's that volatility will continue to remain
high, making trading conditions difficult,"" said Angus
Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads.
 Moody's repeated a warning on Monday that it could
downgrade the United States before 2013 if the fiscal or
economic outlook weakened significantly. But it said it saw the
potential for a new deal in Washington to cut the budget
deficit before then. [ID:nN1E77700L]

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The euro shed early gains against
the dollar and fell versus other currencies on Monday as initial
relief over European Central Bank purchases of Spanish and
Italian government bonds fizzled out in the face of a further
selloff of risky assets.	
 The U.S. currency hovered near record lows against the
safe-haven Swiss franc and yen after Standard & Poor's cut
Washington's AAA sovereign rating on Friday, bolstering the view
that political wrangling may tarnish the ultra-secure status of
U.S. assets.	
 Traders said the ECB bought Spanish and Italian debt early
in the European session after it said on Sunday it would
""actively implement"" its bond-buying programme. 
 But the purchases did little to lift the negative sentiment
that has enveloped financial markets on concerns the euro zone's
debt crisis is spreading to core countries, and analysts said
they see more room for the euro to fall.	
 ""There's a recognition that just buying Italian or Spanish
bonds isn't in itself enough to alleviate the structural
problems of either economy,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency
strategist at CIBC Markets.	
 The single currency broke below reported stop loss
orders at $1.4230 to hit a session low around $1.4205, reversing
an early rally to $1.4400 as European shares fell 1.6 percent
. 
 The euro also broke below support at its 21-day moving
average around $1.4245 and further falls could see it target
Friday's low around $1.4054. 
 ""The bias continues to remain for a move lower whilst in the
$1.4000/1.4500 range of the past few weeks; however the support
just above the 200-week moving average at $1.4030 remains a
tough nut to crack,"" said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets.	
 A hit to higher-yielding currencies and gold soaring to a
record high also showed investors were selling risky
assets for safer ones.	
 Trading in the euro remained volatile, with one-month
euro/dollar implied vol rising to its highest of the
year, while one-month risk reversals , which track
the skew between options to buy or sell the currency, remained
strongly in favour of selling euros. 
 The euro fell more than 1 percent on the day versus the
safe-haven franc and the yen , hovering
within range of a lifetime low versus the Swiss currency. 
 
 FRANC, YEN RALLY	
 Some analysts said the S&P downgrade highlighted their view
that the dollar will remain weak, adding that they saw room for
the U.S. currency to depreciate more than the euro versus a
range of currencies.	
 The dollar index was steady at 74.634.	
 ""Our hunch is that the external pressure on the euro is a
lot less than the external pressures on the dollar,"" said Thomas
Stolper, currency strategist at Goldman Sachs.	
 ""As soon as there is a loss of confidence (in the U.S.),
foreigners stop buying U.S. assets. It's also the same as in
Europe, but the U.S. has a large current account deficit to
fund, whereas Europe doesn't.	
 Goldman held its euro/dollar forecast at $1.45 for the next
three months, while it sees the pair rising to $1.50 in six
months.	
 It sees more dollar weakness versus the yen, lowering its
three-month dollar/yen forecast to 77.00 yen from 82.00, and
sees the U.S. currency falling to 74.00 yen in a year's time.

 The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 77.84 yen on Monday,
having slipped to around 77.45 on the EBS trading platform in
early Asian trade. It was down roughly the same amount at 0.7620
Swiss francs , in sight of a record low around 0.7480
plumbed earlier in the day.	
 The U.S. currency has shed more than 9 percent against the
Swiss franc since the start of July and about 4 percent against
the yen as investors have ploughed into those currencies on the
view they offer the most security from a darkening economic
outlook and worries over U.S. and European sovereign debt.	
 Demand for the franc and the yen kept alive the threat of
intervention by Swiss and Japanese authorities to weaken their
currencies, whose strength eats into their exports.	
 Market participants expect Japanese authorities will
re-enter the market if the dollar falls to 77.10 yen -- the
level at which it sold yen for dollar last week.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Deep-rooted jitters about the U.S.
debt rating cut sent world stocks tumbling to near 11-month lows
on Monday, overshadowing relief that the European Central Bank
was buying bonds of euro zone strugglers Italy and Spain.	
 Having seen some $2.5 trillion wiped off its global share
values last week, MSCI's all-country world stock index
was down a further 1.4 percent, its lowest level
since late September last year.	
 Emerging market stocks fell 3.3 percent.	
 Wall Street, meanwhile, looked set to add to the rout with
S&P 500 futures down around 2.5 percent.	
 European share measured by the FTSEurofirst 300 index
were down 2 percent after earlier registering gains on
the ECB action, intended to take the heat out of the spreading
euro zone debt crisis.	
 Since July 29, European shares as measured by MSCI have lost
$932 billion, more than the combined economies of Greece,
Ireland and Portugal.	
 ECB buying was lifting some peripheral bond prices. Yields
on five-year Italian and Spanish bonds were down around 80 basis
points, spreads against German debt narrowed and the cost of
insuring Spain and Italy against default dropped.	
 But safe-haven buying sent gold soaring to a new record
above $1,700 an ounce.	
 Investors were seemingly unimpressed by weekend talks
between industrialised countries aimed at safeguarding the
smooth functioning of financial markets following agency S&P's
cut in its U.S. rating late on Friday to AA-plus from AAA.	
 ""It won't be long now before other ratings agencies follow
suit, considering the state of the U.S.' finances. One thing is
for certain, and that's that volatility will continue to remain
high, making trading conditions difficult,"" said Angus Campbell,
head of sales at Capital Spreads. 
 Moody's repeated a warning on Monday it could downgrade the
United States before 2013 if the fiscal or economic outlook
weakened significantly, but said it saw the potential for a new
deal in Washington to cut the budget deficit before then.

 
 EASING PAIN	
 The ECB's bond moves followed criticism that the bank had
not addressed pressure on Spain and Italy when it bought
Portuguese and Irish debt last week.	
 Indeed, some of Monday's stock weakness was blamed on fears
of growing domestic opposition in Germany over Chancellor Angela
Merkel's policy towards resolving the debt crisis. 
 Traders said Monday's buying was focused on the 5-year
sector of the curve, where Italian yields and
Spanish equivalents dropped to around 4.6 percent.	
 ""They're doing 20 to 25 million (euro) clips and they're
spreading it around the market,"" said a trader. ""We expect them
to do billions today.""	
 The euro fell against a dollar that recovered some of its
earlier losses against a basket of major currencies . 
 Some analysts said the euro would struggle ahead as the ECB
bond purchases, while adding temporary liquidity to stressed
debt markets, would do little to improve the fiscal problems in
the region.	
 ""Even if the ECB buys Italian bonds, private investors will
just sell and offload their Italian risk ... The ECB will have
to buy those bonds constantly just to keep yields stable,"" said
Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.

 By Ian Chua and Antoni Slodkowski	
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The euro jumped on Monday
after the European Central Bank announced steps to ease tensions
in the euro zone debt market, while the Group of Seven major
industrial nations reaffirmed their vow to support financial
market stability and growth.	
 But the dollar wallowed not far from its record low against
the Swiss franc after Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating last Friday, with dollar-funding pressure
emerging.	
 Commodity currencies gained some respite after Asian stocks
fell less than initially feared, but they remained under
pressure as traders said they wanted to see how European markets
react after the European central bank's statement.	
 The ECB said it would ""actively implement"" a bond buying
programme, signalling it would buy Italian and Spanish bonds to
halt financial market contagion.	
 Hoping to soothe market jitters following one of the worst
routs since the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
2008, G7 finance leaders agreed to offer ample liquidity to
stabilise markets if needed. 
 ""The G7 statement mentions coordinated action and I think it
will succeed in giving some support to the market for now,"" said
Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange research at
Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 Fukaya said that despite sharp falls overall the dollar was
still holding up relatively steady and many investors awaited
the Fed's meeting on Tuesday to trade the greenback more
aggressively. 
 ""They (the G7 leaders) are working against pretty bearish
market sentiment generated over the last couple of weeks and
culminating in the historic nature of the events over the
weekend,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 
 The euro briefly climbed as high as $1.4432, up more
than a cent from late New York levels on Friday and a long way
from last week's lows around $1.4055.	
 Traders in Tokyo also said that as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars struggled against the greenback investors
scooped up the euro, encouraged by the stance of the ECB and G7.
The common currency was up 0.6 percent at $1.4353.	
 Against the yen it edged up to 112.51 yen from
New York's 112.16, before reversing direction to stand at
112.05. It weakened against the Swiss franc, falling to 1.0921
francs , but held above an all-time low around 1.0719
plumbed last Friday.	
 Both the franc and yen remained underpinned by safe-haven
flows, keeping alive the threat of intervention by Swiss and
Japanese authorities to weaken their currencies.	
 ""We'll likely see intervention again should speculative
moves push the yen up sharply. Japanese authorities probably
would want to keep (the dollar) above 77.10 yen, the level where
they initially stepped in to intervene (on Thursday),"" said
Yunosuke Ikeda, a senior forex strategist at Nomura Securities.	
 The dollar fell as low as 77.94 yen and touched a
record low versus the Swiss franc under 0.7500 . Over the
past month it has shed 6 percent against the Swiss franc
and about 4 percent against the yen .	
 The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 78.05 yen.	
 Underscoring lingering anxiety in the market, gold ,
another safe haven, hit a record high around $1,689 an ounce,
while commodities tied to economic growth fell, with U.S. crude
oil futures  down 2.6 percent. 
 ""There are few places you can obviously hide ... and the
ones that you can hide in are doing very well. Gold is the
beneficiary because there is no central bank to sell it,"" Gibbs
added.	
 
 RISK AVERSION 
 The greenback stayed under pressure against a basket of
major currencies , weighed down by S&P's downgrade of the
United States by one notch to AA-plus from the top notch AAA
level on concerns about growing budget deficits. 
 Compounding the dollar's woes, moves in dollar/yen forward
contracts suggested a rise in demand for dollar funding.
The bid rate on dollar/yen 1-month forwards was quoted at -5.06
forward points at one time on Monday morning, the
widest dollar discount since December. 
 Investors also gave commodity currencies a wide berth,
prompting further declines in the likes of the Australian
dollar. The Aussie dipped to a four-month trough of
$1.0375 before recouping most of its losses to trade down 0.2
percent at $1.0416.	
 ""S&P's move can only add to the sense of risk aversion. The
Aussie is looking increasingly vulnerable and heading towards
and through parity in the short term,"" said Robert Rennie, chief
currency strategist at Westpac Bank.	
 ""But there are a number of firebreaks out there. What the
ECB does at the open of the European bond market, what the Fed
does tomorrow, those are going to be very significant.""	
 The Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting on Tuesday and
there is much talk it could discuss the possibility of yet
another round of quantitative easing.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Shares tumbled on Monday
despite efforts by global policymakers to stem a collapse in
investor confidence after S&P downgraded the U.S. credit rating,
but the euro firmed on hopes the ECB will act to stop Europe's
debt crisis from engulfing Italy and Spain.	
 Major Asian equity markets fell by 2-5 percent, while
S&P 500 futures  shed 2.8 percent , indicating no
respite for Wall Street.	
 European stock index futures fell around 2 percent 
  before paring some losses. Financial bookmakers
predicted the FTSE 100 would open down 2.1 percent.

 ""The notion of risk-free investment has been shattered. All
the big asset managers and insurers will have to rebalance their
portfolios,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales
trading at Paris-based Global Equities.	
 Fears that the world's largest economy may be sliding back
into recession, worries about a downgrade of America's prized
AAA rating and Europe's debt woes combined to pummel financial
markets last week in one of the worst routs since the dark days
following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.	
 World stocks turned negative for the year on Aug. 1, as weak
manufacturing data from the United States, Europe and even China
had economists hurriedly downgrading their growth estimates.
Equity markets have fallen more than 8 percent further since
then.

 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut the U.S. long-term
rating by one notch from AAA on Friday, capping a week that saw
$2.5 trillion wiped off companies' values amid worries the U.S.
economy was stalling.	
 Investors sought shelter in assets traditionally viewed as
safe havens in times of financial turmoil, driving the Swiss
franc to a record against the dollar and pushing gold to a new
high above $1,714 an ounce. 
 ""There are few places you can obviously hide ... and the
ones that you can hide in are doing very well. Gold is the
beneficiary because there is no central bank to sell it,"" said
Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney. 
 Finance chiefs from the G7 group of major industrial powers
pledged to take whatever action was needed to stabilise markets
that have been losing faith in political leaders' ability to
tackle the twin debt crises in Europe and the United States.	
 In a statement issued after an emergency conference call, G7
countries said they were ""ready to take action to ensure
stability and liquidity in financial markets"", adding that
senior officials would remain in close contact. 
 
 STOCK MARKETS FALL	
 Despite the G7 statement, equity markets continued to slide
on Monday, following on from last week when the MSCI All-Country
World Index saw its biggest weekly price fall
since early October 2008, according to Thomson Reuters
Datastream.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei closed down 2.2 percent and
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 4.2 percent, taking its losses for the
month so far to more than 12 percent. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell around 4 percent
and Singapore's Straits Times Index lost
nearly 5 percent . South Korea's KOSPI tumbled as
much as 7.3 percent, prompting the stock exchange operator to
briefly suspend programme trading, before closing down 3.8
percent .	
 Traders said attention was turning to the Federal Reserve's
next policy-setting meeting on Tuesday, which may signal renewed
efforts to support the beleaguered U.S. economy.	
 ""Selling is not done yet,"" said Toshio Sumitani, a senior
strategist at Tokai Tokyo. ""Investors are focusing on whether
the Fed may hint at easing such as quantitative easing.""	
 The dollar remained under pressure, touching a record low
versus the Swiss franc below 0.7500 before pulling back to
around 0.7545 . Against a basket of major currencies
, the dollar was down 0.4 percent. 
 But late maturity U.S. Treasuries were higher despite the
downgrade, with the 10-year note up 13/32 to yield 2.52 percent
, off the 10-month low of 2.34 percent hit on
Friday but well below the high for the year of 3.77 percent.	
 ""It's strange that whenever there's a crisis, the money goes
back to the United States, it doesn't make much sense, but
that's how money managers operate,"" said Francis Cheung,
managing director of China-Hong Kong strategy at CLSA.	
 Over the longer run, however, some fund managers like
Aberdeen's Kenneth Akintewe, who helps manage $6.8 billion in
Asian fixed income, see a shift in capital allocation to Asia.	
 ""Whenever we see bouts of market weakness, investors will be
very keen to use those as opportunities to get their capital
into these markets,"" he said.

 EURO ZONE CRISIS	
 While the loss of the prized AAA credit rating the United
States has held with S&P since 1941 was a huge symbolic blow,
the crisis in the euro zone has presented an even bigger
immediate concern for investors.	
 Yields on Italian and Spanish debt soared to 14-year highs
last week on political wrangling and doubts over the vigour of
budget cuts, raising fears that the euro zone's bailout fund for
struggling members could be overwhelmed.	
 ""Clearly, the S&P downgrade is a very symbolic and historic
event,"" Nomura Chief Global Economist Paul Sheard told Reuters
Insider TV.	
 ""But really, the epicentre of this crisis, unlike 2008, is
very much in the euro zone. So I think the markets will be
focusing very much on what the euro area policymakers will do
over the coming weeks.""	
 Following a rare Sunday conference call by the ECB's
governing council, a euro zone monetary source said the central
bank would intervene ""significantly"" to protect Italy and Spain
from the debt crisis, indicating it would buy government bonds
of the euro zone's third and fourth biggest economies. 
 A statement from the ECB said it would ""actively implement""
its bond-buying programmes. 
 Yields on Spanish and Italian 10-year government bonds fell
in early Monday trade.	
 The euro briefly climbed as high as $1.4432 on the
news, up more than a cent from late New York levels on Friday
and a long way from last week's lows around $1.4055, and was
later trading around $1.4320. 
 ""The G7 and the ECB didn't prevent investors from pulling
out from riskier assets, but I think the ECB will buy
substantial amounts of Italian and Spanish debt, providing some
confidence to the jittery markets,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief
FX analyst at Citibank.	
 Gold , which has risen around 20 percent so
far this year, notching up a succession of records along the
way, hit another all-time high of $1,714.79 an ounce.

 But commodities tied to economic growth fell, with
London copper falling below $9,000 a tonne and U.S.
crude oil futures  falling 4 percent to $83.45 a
barrel . 
 ""Troubles in Europe are also undermining markets. Progress
in dealing with Europe sovereign debt issues is painfully slow,""
said Natalie Robertson, a commodities strategist at ANZ.

 By Ryan Vlastelica and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. assets fell sharply in
early electronic trading on Sunday in response to a downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, while the euro
rose on expectations of further bond purchases by the European
Central Bank to deal with the euro zone's debt crisis.
 S&P 500 stock futures  fell 2.7 percent to 1,165.90,
suggesting that in spite of the Standard & Poor's downgrade
being rumored in markets last week, investors hadn't entirely
priced it in. The rumors had contributed to the market's worst
week since November 2008.
 ""We're set up for a pretty substantial selloff, with
further erosion of the market as time goes on,"" said Jeffrey
Sica, president and chief investment officer at SICA Wealth
Management in Morristown, New Jersey. ""There's a real decline
in confidence right now.""
 Among other assets, crude oil slumped 3.6 percent while
gold -- typically viewed as a safe-haven investment -- climbed
2.5 percent. The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.3 percent
while the euro jumped.
 Reaction in the U.S. government bond market was mild, with
30-year long bond futures down moderately at the start of
electronic trade in Asia and 10-year futures up slightly.
 The 30-year T-bond future  fell 12/32 in price at the
open to 131-26/32. The 10-year T-note future  rose 5/32
to 127-6/32.
 Following a conference call held by the European Central
Bank on Sunday, a euro zone monetary source said the ECB will

 The U.S. dollar took a further beating against the
safe-haven Swiss franc and Japanese yen, though markets were
aware of the possibility of intervention by the Bank of Japan
and Swiss National Bank to stem their surging currencies.
 The dollar fell against the Swiss franc to 0.7570 franc
from 0.7671 on Friday. It also lost ground against the yen to
78.01 yen from 78.38 on Friday.
 The move by S&P drew criticism from some of the world's
largest investors. For the S&P story, click on [ID:nLDE77500Z]
 ""Obviously, we're going to get freaked out a little bit and
the dollar will get hit, but it's only going to be for a couple
of days,"" said John Taylor, chairman and chief executive
officer of FX Concepts, the world's largest currency hedge
fund.
 ""This downgrade is not that important and if you ask me,
too silly. The U.S. is in a much better position than any, I
repeat, any European country,"" Taylor added.
 While the downgrade was seen as compounding uncertainty in
Europe, it was not yet clear whether European policymakers
would be able to come up with measures to allay concerns about
their own region's crisis. However, all the signs were that
they were keenly aware of the importance of reassuring
markets.
 Germany and France on Sunday reiterated their commitment to
implementing the decisions of last month's emergency EU summit.

 One ECB source said that if the ECB council opted to
intervene on Italy, the ECB and national central banks would
start buying Italian bonds when markets open on Monday.
 The ECB last week resumed its purchases of government bonds
in the secondary market after an 18-week hiatus, but its
decision to restrict such purchases to Irish and Portuguese
bonds led to sharp declines in Italian and Spanish bond prices,
and borrowing costs soared to 14-year highs.
 Any ECB buying would offer relief to beaten-down Italian
and Spanish bonds, although the extent of any rally in these
bonds will depend on the size and persistence of the bank's
bond purchases.
 U.S. RECESSION FEARS
 Worries of another U.S. recession and concern about the
euro zone crisis have sparked a global stock market slump that
wiped $2.5 trillion off companies' values in the past week.
 The fall in global share prices, as measured by the MSCI
All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, was the biggest weekly
decline since early October 2008, according to Thomson Reuters
Datastream.
 Some expressed doubts about the S&P decision as they are
well aware of questions on the S&P's calculations of the
projected U.S. fiscal deficits. [ID:nN1E774236]
 ""The U.S. track record -- over the past 200 years -- on its
ability and willingness to fully service its debt is impeccable
and the debt statistics should be interpreted not in isolation
but in conjunction with the flawless track record of the U.S.,""
said Stephen Jen, managing director of SLJ Macro Partners in
London, a global macro hedge fund.
 ""This will have no lasting effects on financial asset
prices,"" he added.

take a further beating against the Swiss franc and Japanese
yen on Monday, while global stocks could tumble after the

 Losses against the euro, however, could be tempered by the

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise	
 LONDON, Aug 7(Reuters) - The dollar may fall and Treasury
yields rise on Monday in response to the United States losing
its top-tier credit rating from Standard & Poor's but any
selling is likely to be tempered by the euro zone's escalating
debt crisis.	
 Equity markets' likely reaction was indicated by a drop of
more than six percent on Sunday in Tel Aviv stocks, one of the
first to open globally after S&P on Friday cut the U.S.
long-term credit rating by a notch to AA-plus from AAA.

 Investors will be all the more likely to withdraw to safe
havens, such as the Swiss franc, the yen and gold, if euro zone
officials cannot stem concern that their debt crisis risks
engulfing Italy, the bloc's third largest economy, whose
government bond yields have soared to 14-year highs.	
 ""The real effects of this (U.S. credit rating downgrade)
will take time to show through but a weaker U.S. dollar and
marginally higher yields are likely,"" said Charles Diebel, a
strategist at Lloyds Bank.	
 ""The irony here is that in the context of the price action
last week, the equity market response could be quite negative
and thereby we may actually see U.S. Treasuries supported by
safe-haven flows,"" he said in a note.	
 Worries of another U.S. recession and concern about the euro
zone crisis have already sparked a global stock market slump
that wiped $2.5 trillion off company values in the past week. 
The fall in global share prices, as measured by the MSCI
All-country World Index, was the biggest weekly decline since
early October 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.	
 Consumer discretionary shares of firms dependent on external
demand are likely to be singled out for more punishment.	
 On Friday, yields on benchmark U.S. ten-year treasury notes
were about half a percentage point away from a
record lows near two percent hit during the throes of the global
financial crisis.	
 
 
 ""IRRATIONAL DEPRESSION""	
 The sharp swings in financial markets have piled pressure on
policymakers.	
 Finance ministers from the Group of Seven most developed
economies were due to discuss on Monday the U.S. sovereign
rating downgrade and Europe's debt woes, Japanese news agency
Kyodo reported on Sunday. 
 Analysts warned the U.S. downgrade was likely to heighten
investors' risk aversion and further bolster the Japanese yen
and the Swiss Franc , even though the authorities
of both countries took steps last week to staunch the
export-denting strength of their currencies.	
 ""Be wary tomorrow of irrational depression as markets take
flight,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, a director at Seven
Investment Management in London. ""We are dealing with the knowns
and not the unknowns but what we have a shortage of at the
moment is political leadership.""	
 It was not yet clear whether European policymakers would be
able to come up with measures to allay such concern, though all
the signs were that they were keenly aware of the importance of
reassuring markets.	
 Central bank sources said the European Central Bank would
hold a conference call at 1700 GMT to decide whether to buy
Italian government bonds in the secondary market.

 The ECB last week resumed its purchases of government bonds
in the secondary market after an 18-week hiatus but its decision
to restrict such purchases to Irish and Portuguese bonds led to
sharp declines in Italian and Spanish bond prices.

 ""There is no reason why the ECB cannot simply go ahead and
imply that they are going to support the Italians and the
Spanish,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin
in London. ""It is better that they don't say anything but go in
and show there is another side to the market."" 
 Any such ECB buying would offer relief to beaten-down
Italian and Spanish bonds. 
 That would in turn offer a respite to European stock
markets. Banks' exposure to Italian sovereign debt and Italian
banks have forced equity traders to focus on the rising cost of
Italian borrowing and the widening premium that Italian bonds
offer over German government bonds, known as Bunds.	
 Without ECB action, the reverse would be true.	
 ""The fact that Italian 10-year BTP risk premia over Bunds
closed near 400 basis points following (Thursday's) ECB press
conference, reaching the level of Greece's risk premium before
the ECB launched the (bond buying programme) back in May 2010,
means that the time to intervene in Italian bond markets is
now,"" said Lena Komileva, head of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman.	
 Even so, the extent of any rally in these bonds will depend
on how the size and persistence of any ECB bond purchases given
investors have been disappointed before by such moves.	
 Moreover, any ECB bond buying would not address
international investors' other major concern at the moment --
the risk of an economic slowdown in the United States.	
 Goldman Sachs strategists said there was a one-in-three
probability of a U.S. recession due to the worsening European
crisis, the possible failure to extend payroll tax cuts and
elevated levels of joblessness, despite a slight dip in the U.S.
unemployment rate in July.	
 That would bode ill for the benchmark MSCI all-country world
stocks index , which last week hit its lowest
since September 2010 and has accumulated losses of more than 12
percent since late July.	
""Market sentiment appears acutely vulnerable given the
build-up of concern on a sharper U.S. slowdown and speculation
on the appropriate policy response and lingering fears stemming
from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe,"" Citigroup strategists
said in a note.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Aug 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar may weaken and
Treasury yields rise when Asian markets reopen on Monday, though
any selling in response to ratings agency S&P's downgrade of the
United States is likely to be tempered by the escalating crisis
in the euro zone.	
 The S&P cut in the U.S. long-term credit rating by a notch
to AA-plus is an unprecedented blow and results from concerns
about the nation's budget deficits and climbing debt burden. It
called the outlook ""negative,"" signalling another downgrade is
possible in the next 12 to 18 months. 
 ""The initial reaction will be a high degree of uncertainty
and thus volatility since investors will not know where to turn
for safety,"" said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton
Emerging Markets group, in an email to Reuters.	
 ""During the sub-prime crisis safety was in U.S. Dollars and
U.S. Treasuries. Now that anchor to the global community is
deteriorating,"" added Mobius, whose unit oversees $50 billion in
emerging market assets.	
 Fears of a slide back into recession for the world's biggest
economy prompted a global sell-off that wiped $2.5 trillion off
company values over the past week, with consumer discretionary
shares of firms dependent on external demand likely to be
singled out for more punishment.	
 The fall in global share prices, as measured by the MSCI
All-country World Index, was the biggest weekly decline since
early October 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.	
 
 Market players warned the U.S. downgrade was likely to
exacerbate a sharp contraction in risk appetite, and could see
investors shift to the low-yielding Japanese yen and the
Swiss Franc , despite market interventions from their
respective authorities to weaken the currencies last week.	
 But they said fears that Europe's debt crisis could engulf
core economies Spain and Italy, where sovereign debt yields have
soared to 14-year highs, meant investors may still seek a
safe-haven in the dollar, despite the U.S. woes.	
 Goldman Sachs strategists said there was a one-in-three
probability of a U.S. recession due to the worsening European
crisis, the possible failure to extend payroll tax cuts and
elevated levels of joblessness, despite a slight dip in the U.S.
unemployment rate in July.	
 ""Simply put, market sentiment appears acutely vulnerable
given the build-up of concern on a sharper U.S. slowdown and
speculation on the appropriate policy response and lingering
fears stemming from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe,""
Citigroup strategists said in a note.	
 The benchmark MSCI all-country world stocks index
fell to its lowest level since September 2010
last week, and has slumped more than 12 percent since late July.
 
 The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks
fell 8.7 percent last week .	
 Meanwhile, global leaders scrambled to discuss the U.S.
sovereign rating downgrade and Europe's debt woes, and may issue
a statement after a conference call, a Japanese government
source said on Sunday. 
 Yields on benchmark U.S. ten-year treasury notes
rebounded smartly to 2.56 percent on Friday but were not far
away from a record low of near two percent hit during the throes
of the global financial crisis.	
 In a sign of how nervous investors have become, data from
Lipper showed investors pulled nearly $66 billion from money
market funds in the week ended August 3, the second-largest
weekly net outflow on record. The record outflow was seen during
the week ended September 17, 2008.

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for an eighth
day on Friday, with around $2.5 trillion wiped off the value of
global equities this week, but hopes the European Central Bank
will buy the bonds of Italy's heavily indebted government
helped lift markets off the lows of the day.
 Better than expected U.S. monthly employment data also
provided some Wall Street stocks with some support in a heavily
traded session a day after indexes posted their worst losses in
two years. The MSCI's All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
fell 1.3 percent on the day.
 The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a small gain,
rising 0.5 percent. Composite trading volume was the highest
since the day after the U.S. ""flash crash"" in May 2010, when
U.S. equity markets plummeted 9 percent in a single day.
 World leaders moved to address the financial market
volatility which has been driven by fears the global economy is
slipping back into recession and by the inability of
policymakers in Europe to extinguish the debt crisis engulfing
the region.
 Italy, under pressure to help halt the market rout that is
endangering the global economy, pledged to speed up austerity
measures and social reforms in return for European Central Bank
help with funding.
 ""That was the real thing that got us started (off the
lows),"" said Rick Klingman, managing director of Treasury
trading at BNP Paribas in New York. That ""may clear the way for
the ECB to start buying some Italian bonds.""

 ALL EYES ON EUROPE
 Apart from signs that the U.S. and global economies are
weakening, despite record low interest rates and the pumping of
liquidity into the system, the focus was clearly on Europe this
week, where bond yields in Spain and Italy have been rising,
threatening the same kind of refinancing problems that have
already hit Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
 The European Central Bank disappointed investors on
Thursday by buying Irish and Portuguese bonds but not Italian
or Spanish debt but by Friday appeared to be getting closer to
action. Sources told Reuters the ECB is willing to support the
Italian bond market if the government carries out reforms.
[ID:nL3E7J5149].
 ""The apparent quid-pro-quo between the ECB and Italy for
the latter to bring forward austerity and structural reform in
return for ECB Italian bond purchases, is the most desirable
outcome for the markets available,"" said Alan Ruskin, global
head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> posted their biggest weekly
decline in nearly three years and hit their lowest in a year.
The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.8 percent to end at 975.02 on
Friday.
 China and Japan called for global cooperation. French
President Nicolas Sarkozy was to discuss the financial markets
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
 Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the world
economy ""is in a situation of stress"" and South American
nations must work together to create mechanisms to protect
their economies from turmoil.
 BETTER US NEWS
 News of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in July
relieved some of financial markets' worst fears, but that was
not enough to spur sustained buying after an early bounce.
 Rumors also circulated in jittery markets that a U.S.
government downgrade from credit ratings agency Standard&Poor's
could come as early as Friday night. The agency declined to
comment on the rumor.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 60.93
points, or 0.54 percent, to 11,444.61. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> dropped 0.69 point, or 0.06 percent, to
1,199.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 23.98 points,
or 0.94 percent, to 2,532.41.
 By the end of the week S&P 500 had fallen 7.2 percent, its
largest weekly percentage drop since November 2008.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after the jobs data,
reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's panic of
risk-averse trading. The 10-year Treasury note  lost
1-13/32 to yield 2.56 percent.
 The week was a tumultuous one for markets. The Swiss
government cut interest rates on Wednesday after investors
looking for a safe-haven bid its currency to a record high
against the dollar, while Japan sold yen on Thursday to try and
stem the rise in its currency.
 The euro last traded up 1.3 percent at $1.4278  on
trading platform EBS. The U.S. dollar fell broadly, reversing
some of the prior day's sharp gains, as traders feared a
downgrade to the United States' credit rating was imminent.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global
commodities benchmark, fell to a seven-month low as raw
materials markets experienced one of their biggest sell-offs
since the financial crisis.

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for an eighth
day on Friday in a dizzying descent that has wiped around $2.5
trillion off the value of global equities this week, but hopes
the European Central Bank will buy bonds of crisis-hit Italy
helped lift markets off the lows of the day.
 Wall Street stocks swung violently between gains and losses
in a heavily traded session a day after indexes posted their
worst losses in two years. The MSCI's All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.3 percent on the day.

 The ECB's reluctance to buy Italian bonds and ease pressure
on markets has frustrated investors. Sources with knowledge of
the matter said earlier on Friday that the bank is willing to
take that step only if the country carries out reforms.

 ALL EYES ON EUROPE
 Apart from signs that the U.S. and global economies are

where bond yields in Spain and Italy have been blowing out,
threatening the same kind of refinancing problems that have

 The European Central Bank disappointed investors on
Thursday by buying Irish and Portuguese bonds but not Italian
or Spanish debt.
 ""Would the ECB please get serious?"" Berenberg private bank
said in a note. ""We need a circuit breaker to stop the vicious
circle in which fear feeds on fear.""
 Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, said,
""The Swiss National Bank is caught between a rock and a hard
place. It's difficult to see the franc being anything but well
bid in the current environment.""
 The ECB bought Portuguese and Irish government bonds,
slightly easing pressure on Italian and other euro-zone
peripheral debt, which had earlier offered euro-era high
premiums over less risky Germany.
 But Italian 10-year government bond yields rose above their
Spanish equivalent.
 Italy has emerged as the market's major concern after a
rescue deal that was intended to stop the spread of the crisis
failed to convince investors it had the firepower to ease
pressure on the vast Italian bond market.

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly on
Friday, reversing some of the prior day's sharp gains, as Wall
Street stocks rebounded and traders feared a downgrade to the
United States' credit rating was imminent.
 The euro got an added boost after Italy's Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi pledged to speed up austerity measures and
bring the country's budget into balance by 2013. For details,
see [ID:nR1E7IF02F]
 The news helped temporarily calm markets a day after U.S.
stock indexes posted their worst losses in two years. The
dollar rallied on Thursday after Japan intervened to curb yen
strength and on worries the euro zone debt crisis was
spreading.
 A report showing stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in
July assuaged some concerns the economy was slipping back into
a recession, but investors remained jittery.
 ""We're seeing a retracement from yesterday, as opposed to
everything is just fine,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The euro last traded up 1.2 percent at $1.4278 ,
after climbing to a session high of $1.42987 on trading
platform EBS. The common currency also gained 0.3 percent to
111.98 yen .

 As frustration grows at what investors see as the European
Central Bank's ineffectual response to the crisis, sources said
the bank is demanding that Italy commit to fast-track specific
welfare reforms and a constitutional amendment enshrining a
fiscal rule before it will buy Italian bonds.
 On Thursday, traders were disappointed that the ECB were
buying Portuguese and Irish bonds instead of Italian and
Spanish debt.
 Adding to weigh on the dollar, rumors circulated that
ratings agency Standard & Poor's would downgrade the U.S.
credit rating after the market's close. S&P said it would not
comment on the rumors.
 ""The strong jobs report was followed by a lot of chatter
about an S&P downgrade and that has weighed on the dollar,""
said Andrew Cox, G10 strategist at CitiFX, a division of
Citigroup in New York. ""While the market lacks conviction, we
are definitely in risk-off mode.""
 Against the yen , the dollar was last at 78.40, down
0.8 percent on the day. Support was seen around 78.27 yen, a 50
percent retracement of the dollar's rise from its four-month
low of 76.29 to Thursday's high of around 80.25 yen.
 The dollar was last at 0.7667  francs, up 0.3
percent, after sliding to a fresh record low of 0.75776.
 The franc also rose to a record high against the euro
 of 1.0710 francs, before retreating. The euro last
traded at 1.0952 franc, up 1.5 percent on the day.
 The Swiss National Bank announced a surprise interest rate
cut this week to stem the franc's rally. The Bank of Japan
followed a day later by selling yen in the currency market.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said he was
closely watching yen moves on Friday, signaling a readiness to
continue selling the currency. [ID:nL3E7J467X]
 ""There is a good likelihood they will intervene again as
they will want to make it clear to the markets that they will
not be tested and they were not one-off interventions,"" Cox
said.
 Comments from SNB Chairman Phillip Hildebrand that the SNB
would not accept a further appreciation in the franc without
acting fanned fears of official action. [ID:nL6E7J503E]
 But with worries about a global economic slowdown, analysts
doubted actions by central banks will spark a trend reversal.

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for an
eighth day but were off their lows on Friday after a dizzying
descent that has wiped $2.5 trillion off the value of global
equities this week and brought back memories of the 2008
financial crisis.
 Wall Street stocks were volatile, recovering from losses
of more than 2 percent to trade mostly higher in the
afternoon, a day after indexes posted their worst losses in
two years. The MSCI's All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
pared losses, but was still down 1.1 percent on the day.
 ""What you had was a crisis-of-confidence move down,
unjustified by the fundamentals,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief
investment strategist of Raymond James Financial, in St.
Petersburg, Florida. ""It's like pushing down on a spring. You
can only press down so far.""
 World leaders moved to address the turmoil, which has been
driven by fears the global economy is slipping back into
recession and by the inability of policy-makers in Europe to
extinguish the debt crisis engulfing the region.
 As frustration grows at what investors see as the European
Central Bank's ineffectual response to the crisis, sources
said the bank is demanding that Italy commit to fast-track
specific welfare reforms and a constitutional amendment
enshrining a fiscal rule before it will buy Italian bonds.
 Jittery markets took the comments as a sign a move may be
near. The euro jumped to a session high against the dollar and
helped reverse the greenback's slump against the Swiss franc
after it hit a fresh record low to the Swiss currency earlier
in the day on safe-haven buying.
 The euro rose as high as $1.42470  and was last
at $1.42137, up 0.8 percent.
 China and Japan called for global cooperation. French
President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to discuss the financial
markets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
 Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the world
economy ""is in a situation of stress"" and South American
nations must work together to create mechanisms to protect
their economies from turmoil.
 Rumors circulated that ratings agency Standard & Poor's
would downgrade the U.S. debt rating after the close, but S&P
said it would not comment on the rumors.
 News of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in July
relieved some of the financial markets' worst fears, but that
was not enough to spur sustained buying after an early
bounce.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after the data, reversing
some of the gains made in Thursday's panic of risk-averse
trading. The 10-year Treasury note  lost 1-16/32,
or 1-1/2 points, to yield 2.52 percent, up from 2.41 percent
at Thursday's close.

 ALL EYES ON EUROPE
 Apart from signs that the U.S. and global economies are
weakening despite record low interest rates and the pumping of
liquidity into the system, the focus was clearly on Europe,
where bond yields in Spain and Italy have been blowing out,
threatening the same kind of refinancing problems that have
already slammed Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
 The European Central Bank disappointed investors on
Thursday by buying Irish and Portuguese bonds but not Italian
or Spanish debt.
 ""Would the ECB please get serious?"" Berenberg private bank
said in a note. ""We need a circuit breaker to stop the vicious
circle in which fear feeds on fear.""
 Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, said,
""The Swiss National Bank is caught between a rock and a hard
place. It's difficult to see the franc being anything but well
bid in the current environment.""
 The ECB bought Portuguese and Irish government bonds,
slightly easing pressure on Italian and other euro-zone
peripheral debt, which had earlier offered euro-era high
premiums over less risky Germany.
 But Italian 10-year government bond yields rose above
their Spanish equivalent.
 Italy has emerged as the market's major concern after a
rescue deal that was intended to stop the spread of the crisis
failed to convince investors it had the firepower to ease
pressure on the vast Italian bond market.

 By Edward Krudy and Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Equity markets fell sharply for
an eighth day on Friday in a dizzying descent that has wiped
$2.5 trillion off the value of world stocks this week and
brought back memories of the 2008 financial crisis.
 World leaders moved to address the turmoil, which has been
driven by fears the world economy is slipping back into
recession and by the inability of policy makers in Europe to
extinguish the debt crisis engulfing the region.
 As equity markets slid, the dollar extended losses against
the Swiss franc to a fresh record low as investors sought
safety in the Swiss currency. The dollar fell as low as 0.75776
 Swiss francs on trading platform EBS, before pulling
back slightly to 0.7589, down 0.8 percent on the day.
 China and Japan called for global cooperation and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to discuss the financial
markets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
 Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the world
economy ""is in a situation of stress"" and South American
nations must work together to create mechanisms to protect
their economies from turmoil.
 News of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in July
assuaged some of the worst fears in markets but was not enough
to spur sustained buying after an early bounce.
 The dollar fell against the euro and yen, helping the euro
recover from a fresh three-week low of $1.4055  hit
earlier in the session.
 Analysts said deep-rooted economic problems both in the
United States and globally were eclipsing the jobs report.
 ""(It) doesn't solve anything. View it more as a selling
opportunity rather than a reason to get back involved on the
long side,"" said Michael Marrale, managing director and head of
sales trading at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after the data, reversing
some of the gains made in Thursday's panicked, risk-averse
trade. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  fell
13/32 in price, its yield rising to 2.45 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 176.30
points, or 1.55 percent, to 11,207.38. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> dropped 25.47 points, or 2.12 percent, to
1,174.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 76.90
points, or 3.01 percent, to 2,479.49.
 MSCI's All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.7
percent, while European stocks <.FTEU3> fell 1.7 percent.
 European shares saw their biggest weekly decline in nearly
three years on Friday and hit their lowest in a year.
 Industrial commodities were also hit. Three-month copper
 fell 3.6 percent to $9,022 a tonne, the lowest since
June 29. It lost 1.9 percent in the last session.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global
commodities benchmark, fell to a seven-month low on Friday as
raw materials markets saw one of their biggest sell-offs since

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for an eighth
session on Friday though better-than-expected U.S. jobs data
limited losses and the euro gained as the European Central Bank
bought Portuguese and Irish government bonds.
 U.S. Treasuries prices cut some losses as Wall Street
steadied in early trade, but remained down as the jobs data
reduced the need for a safe-haven.
 The U.S. Labor Department said payrolls increased 117,000
and the unemployment rate dipped to 9.1 percent from 9.2
percent in June. A Reuters survey ahead of the report showed
expectations for a rise of 85,000 with the unemployment rate at
9.2 percent.
 While the job snumbers were better than expected by many,
they were seen by stock investors ""more as a selling
opportunity rather than a reason to get back involved on the

 MSCI's All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.85

after the open but traded slightly higher later.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 17.79

 * Jobs data offers some relief after market rout

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Improved U.S. jobs numbers gave
world stocks some relief in an eighth straight session of losses
on Friday which had wiped almost $2.5 trillion off values on the
week and brought back memories of the 2008 crisis.	
 Ballooning concern over the slowing global economy and the
spread of debt anguish into Italy and Spain weighed heavily on
investors.	
 Wall Street, however, looked set to open higher, gaining
back at least some of the previous session's sharp losses, after
a U.S. report showed the U.S. economy creating more jobs than
expected in July.	
 The U.S. Labor Department said payrolls increased 117,000
and the unemployment rate dipped to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent
in June. A Reuters survey ahead of the report showed
expectations for a rise of 85,000 with the unemployment rate at
9.2 percent.	
 ""We obviously sold off so much that they're just looking for
anything that's not that bad,"" said Dennis Dick of Bright
Trading LLC.	
 ""I'd be scared to dip my toes in here yet. It's a little
early to predict."" 
 There remained widespread demand for policymakers to beef up
plans to tackle the euro zone's crisis and prevent the U.S.
economy in particular from sliding back into recession.	
 One investment firm called for a ""shock and awe"" approach in
Europe, a reference to the U.S.-led aerial assault on Iraq.	
 Global equities were down 1 percent on the
day for a more than 8 percent loss this week. Emerging market
shares stumbled 3 percent on the day.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 fell around 0.3
percent. It had lost more than 2 percent before the report.	
 ""The economic outlook is stressing investors to a great
degree and sentiment is likely to remain extremely fragile,""
said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
""The U.S. economy has been slowing and is moving into a phase
where we are going to see spending cuts enforced. Investors are
concerned as to where future growth will come from with this
backdrop of debt for so many governments."" 
 China and Japan called for global cooperation and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy was to discuss the financial markets
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.

 The Swiss franc -- which the Swiss central bank has tried to
weaken this week -- hovered near record highs against the euro
and dollar, while the yen rose. Both are considered safe haven
currencies. 
 The franc rose to a record high against the euro
of 1.0710 francs in early Asian trade but retreated to 1.0863 in
European dealing on fears of official action to weaken the
currency.	
 ""The Swiss National Bank is caught between a rock and a hard

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc pulled back from a
record high against the euro on Friday as nervous traders cut
long positions in thin trade, but mounting fears of an economic
quagmire in the United States and Europe were likely to keep
safe-haven currencies in demand.	
 The yen edged higher and bounced away from a three-week low
hit the previous day after Japan's massive yen-selling
intervention, but concerns that the Japanese could intervene
again limited the currency's rebound.	
 A strongly risk-averse mood has been boosting the franc and
the yen as mounting fears over the euro zone debt crisis
spreading to Spain and Italy and a global growth slowdown have
spooked investors and prompted sharp falls in equity markets and
commodities and a flight to safety. 
 ""The Swiss franc sold off this morning as the market is very
jumpy and wondering whether intervention may be on the cards,""
said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.	
 ""But the Swiss National Bank is caught between a rock and a
hard place. It's difficult to see the franc being anything but
well bid in the current environment.""	
 The franc rose to a record high against the euro
of 1.0710 francs in early Asian trade but retreated to 1.0880 in
European dealing on fears of official action to weaken the
currency after comments from Swiss National Bank Chairman
Phillip Hildebrand.	
 He was quoted as saying the SNB would not accept a further
appreciation in the franc without acting, having already cut
interest rates this week in an attempt to stem the currency's
strength. Traders, however, reported no sightings of the SNB in
currency markets so far. 
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the franc to 0.7688
but remained within touching distance of a record low of
0.7610 hit on Wednesday.	
 
 YEN BOUNCES BACK	
 The yen retraced some of Thursday's heavy losses when
massive selling intervention from the Bank of Japan pushed it
sharply lower against the dollar , with market players
eyeing further official action ahead.	
 ""I think they're certain to face international opposition to
any protracted intervention,"" said Todd Elmer, a currency
strategist at Citi in Singapore.	
 ""But if they want to be successful in introducing two-way
risk into the market I think we're going to need to see further
action,"" Elmer said.	
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said he was closely
watching yen moves on Friday, signalling a readiness to continue
selling the currency. 
 A brief spike in the dollar against the yen from around
78.50 yen to an intraday high near 79.40 yen in Asia initially
stirred talk that Japan may have intervened again.	
 But the dollar later pared its gains and traders played down
the talk of possible intervention, with U.S. and European banks
cited as dollar buyers during the spike higher. 
 The dollar dipped 0.5 percent against the yen from late U.S.
trade on Thursday to 78.44 yen . The euro was down around
0.5 percent at 111.16 yen having risen above 114 yen
the previous day.	
 Support was at 78.27 yen, a 50 percent retracement of the
dollar's rise from its four-month low to Thursday's high. 
 The dollar had risen as high as around 80.25 yen on Thursday
after Japan's intervention, which Japan's Nikkei business daily
said totalled a record 4 trillion yen. [ID: nT9E7IB01Q]	
 Japan's solo yen-selling intervention came in the wake of
the dollar's drop to a four-month low of 76.29 yen earlier this
week, right near a record low of 76.25 yen struck in March.

 A focal point on Friday is U.S. jobs data due at 1230 GMT. 
 Many market players feel that a weak reading there could fan
speculation that the Federal Reserve may signal the need to take
additional easing measures after its policy meeting next week
after the Swiss, Japanese and the European central banks took
easing steps this week.	
 The euro recovered from a fresh three-week low of $1.4055
as Spanish and Italian government bond yield spreads
tightened off their widest levels in volatile trading .
The single currency was last up around 0.4 percent at $1.4160.	
 The European Central Bank surprised many market players on
Thursday by broadening its liquidity operations as it revived
its bond buying programme in the secondary market by purchasing
Portuguese and Irish bonds. 
 But some market players said those measures, coupled with
comments from ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet that there were high
levels of uncertainties, only made investors think that economic
conditions in Europe may be deteriorating more quickly than they
had anticipated.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - - World stock markets fell for
the eighth straight session on Friday to the lowest since late
2010, with more losses feared if policymakers do not come to the
rescue soon to stabilise the euro zone's debt crisis and prevent
the U.S. economy from sliding back into recession. 
 After panic overnight triggered the worst sell-off on Wall
Street since the global financial crisis, investors in Asia
slashed positions in equities and commodities and scrambled for
the safety of cash and government bonds.	
 Some Asian stocks markets fell by more than 5 percent. 
 Major European stock markets were expected to open as much
as 2.2 percent lower while U.S. stock futures  eased 0.2
percent, with investors worldwide waiting for U.S. employment
figures due later in the day that could trigger further selling
if the jobs picture disappoints. 
 ""Equity valuations are already pretty low but sentiment
keeps deteriorating, so why come in and buy now?"" said Shane
Oliver, head of investment strategy at Sydney-based AMP Capital,
which has more than $100 billion in assets under management.	
 Investors are looking for stronger U.S. and European policy
responses, but it may be a while until they see another dose of
quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve or a stop-gap
measure in Europe, Oliver said, adding the firm had spent the
past month neutralising its overweight positions.	
 Complicating matters was that Japan and Switzerland have
intervened this week to knock down their currencies, which were
considered the safest in the developed world. That has caused
some safety-seeking investors to think twice about stashing
money there when financial market volatility is spiking.	
 So far, retail investors were participating in the heavy
selling but institutional equity investors in Asia were not
completely liquidating their positions, instead continuing to
cut riskier bets and protect their portfolios.	
 The benchmark MSCI all-country world stocks index
fell 1 percent to the lowest since Dec. 1, 2010.
The index has slumped nearly 11 percent since late July.

 RISK REDUCTION	
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 3.7 percent to the
lowest since the week following the country's massive earthquake
and tsunami in March. 
 An institutional fund manager overseeing 400 billion yen in
Japanese equities, who could not be identified as he was not
authorised to speak to media, said he was trying to reduce
exposure to stocks which were dependent on external demand.	
 The asset manager was selling shares of carmakers, traders
and electric machinery stocks, and buying retailers and textile
manufacturers.	
 The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside
Japan fell 4.6 percent , with investors selling
across the sectors, whether they are defensive or cyclical. The
index is on course for the biggest weekly drop since November
2008, when the global financial crisis was rippling through
markets.	
 ""Clearly, it's just a knee-jerk reaction to what's going
on,"" said Michael Heffernan, senior client advisor with Austock
Group in Australia. ""We're going down simply on the fear that
Italy can't pay its debts."" 
 Within Asia, markets with high trade exposure to the West
and reliance on commodities looked particularly vulnerable.	
 Taiwan, where the technology sector makes up about half of
the equity market capitalisation and depends heavily on exports
to developed countries, is a weak point in Asia.	
 The benchmark stock index in Taiwan led Asia, falling 5.1
percent . 
 
 EUROPE, LIQUIDITY AND WIDENING SPREADS	
 Europe, where overloaded national balance sheets have
bedeviled politicians struggling to grasp the implications, is
currently in the eye of the storm. 
 Italian and Spanish bond yields have kept rising and German
bond yields are falling, widening spreads the most since the
euro was born and causing deep-seated fears that realistic
options for policymakers to keep the euro zone together are few.	
 The European Central Bank on Thursday resumed buying
government bonds after a four-month break and announced new
longer-term funding for liquidity-starved banks, but investors
kept selling peripheral European bonds.	
 Traders who had went warily back to the yen and Swiss franc
were tested.	
 The dollar whipsawed in Asian trading against the yen on
talk of additional Japanese intervention, trading slightly lower
on the day at 78.59 yen , a day after Japan reportedly
spent a record 4 trillion yen ($50.6 billion) to weaken its
currency and bolster its export competitiveness. 
 
 U.S. 10-year Treasury futures ticked up 9.5/32 to 128-9.5/32
, just below the Thursday high of 128-12/32, which was the
highest since December 2008. The cash yield was at 2.39 percent
, matching the lowest since October 2010.	
 The yield has sank nearly 40 basis points so far in August,
as a wall of worry sends investors to the most liquid bond
market in the world despite worries about Washington's ability
to cut spending and rein in longer-term debt.	
 Commodity markets extended heavy overnight losses on fears
of slowing demand.	
 U.S. crude for September delivery  fell 1.1 percent to
$85.54 a barrel, the lowest since February 2011.	
 Spot gold prices edged up $6.74 an ounce to $1,654.84
after hitting a record around $1,681 an ounce on Thursday before
losing some of the gains. 
 In an ominous sign, gold prices in the past 24 hours were
soft despite the spiralling fears hurting risky markets.
Investors were having to sell gold positions to cover losses
elsewhere in their portfolios. 
 ""This will not be a quiet day. Liquidity will be at a
premium,"" a sales trader with a European bank said.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - - Asian stocks tumbled as much
as 5 percent on Friday after panic triggered the worst sell-off
on Wall Street since the global financial crisis, prompting
investors to slash positions and scramble for cash and
government bonds.	
 Fears that the U.S. economy is sliding back toward recession
and a recent jumpe in Italian and Spanish bond yields towards
danger levels have driven investors to seek cover.	
 U.S. stock futures  were slightly higher after major
U.S. markets fell by 4-5 percent overnight, but employment
figures due later in the day could trigger further selling if
the jobs picture disappoints. 
 Complicating matters was that Japan and Switzerland have

 ""That could still happen but with the losses that people

Japan was down 3.8 percent , with investors
selling across the sectors, whether they are defensive or
cyclical. The index is on course for the biggest weekly drop
since May 2010, when the European debt crisis was flaring up. 
 ""Clearly, it's just a knee-jerk reaction to what's going
on,"" said Michael Heffernan, senior client advisor with Austock
Group in Australia. ""We're going down simply on the fear that
Italy can't pay its debts."" 
 Within Asia, markets with high trade exposure to the West
and reliance on commodities looked particularly vulnerable.	
 Taiwan, where the technology sector makes up about half of
the equity market capitalisation and depends heavily on exports
to developed countries, is a weak point in Asia.	
 The benchmark stock index in Taiwan led Asia, falling 5
percent . 
 Europe, where overloaded national balance sheets have
bedeviled politicians struggling to grasp the implications, is
currently in the eye of the storm. 
 Italian and Spanish bond yields have kept rising and German
bond yields falling, widening spreads the most since the euro
was born and causing deep-seated fears about what else
policymakers can do to keep the euro zone together.	
 The European Central Bank resumed buying government bonds
after a four-month break and announced new longer-term funding
for liquidity-starved banks, investors kept selling peripheral
European bonds.	
 Traders went warily back to the yen. The dollar was down 0.4
percent to 78.83 yen , a day after Japan reportedly spent
a record 4 trillion yen ($50.6 billion) to weaken its currency
and bolster its export competitiveness. 
 U.S. 10-year Treasury futures ticked up 6/32 to 128-6/32
, just below the Thursday high of 128-12/32, which was the

 SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - - Asian stocks dropped 3 to 4
percent on Friday after panic triggered the worst sell-off on
Wall Street since the global financial crisis, sending investors
slashing positions and scrambling for cash and government bonds.	
 Complicating matters was that Japan and Switzerland have
intervened this week to weaken their currencies, which were
considered the safest in the developed world. That has caused
some safety-seeking investors to look elsewhere when financial
market volatility is spiking.	
 So far though, institutional equity investors in Asia were
not liquidating their positions, instead continuing to cut
riskier bets and protect their portfolios.	
 ""What you're seeing is a shakeout of all the money that was
put to work in the hope that 2011 turns out like last year,
where you saw a nice bounce around the same time,"" said a Hong
Kong-based multi-strategy hedge fund manager. 
 ""That could still happen but with the losses that people
have already taken this year, looks like no wants to take the
risk. It's about preserving capital now."" 
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 3.6 percent to the
lowest since the week following the country's massive earthquake
and tsunami in March. 
 The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside
Japan was down 1.8 percent , with the sharpest
decline in the commodity-related sector. The index is on course
for the biggest weekly drop since May 2010, when the European
debt crisis was flaring up. 
 Europe, where overloaded national balance sheets have
bedeviled politicians struggling to grasp the implications, is

a basis point higher than late New York on Thursday when the
10-year yield hit the lowest since October 2010.	
 The yield has sank 37 basis points so far in August, as a
wall of worry sends investors to the most liquid bond market in
the world.	
 Commodity markets were eerily quiet. 
 U.S. crude for September delivery was roughly unchanged at
$86.57 a barrel after falling as much as 6 percent on Thursday
and closing at the lowest since February 2011.	
 In an ominous sign, gold prices were soft despite the
spiralling fears hurting risky markets. Investors were having to
sell gold positions to cover losses elsewhere in their
portfolios.	
 Spot gold prices eased $3.71 an ounce to $1,644.19 after

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Investors around the world
dumped stocks and commodities on Thursday and rushed to the
security of cash and government bonds, hammering equity indexes
to their lowest levels of the year on fears of a spreading debt
crisis and slowing growth.
 Worries the euro-zone debt crisis was spiraling out of
control sent blue chip European stocks to levels not seen since
markets recovered from the financial crisis in mid-2009.
Italian equities pushed further into bear market territory --
down nearly 30 percent since February.
 Major U.S. indexes fell more than 4 percent, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq down 5 percent, erasing gains for the
year as the broad-based S&P 500 entered a correction of more
than 10 percent from a peak in May.
 Intense selling this week reflects frustration with
politicians to address pressing concerns over high public debt
levels in Europe and the United States as large industrial
economies show signs of running aground.
 The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E>,
which measures the performance of 50 big European stocks, fell
3.4 percent to a two-year low, wiping out much of its gains
since the end of the financial crisis.
 ""The big catalyst was fear,"" said Matt Rubin, director of
investment strategy at Neuberger Berman in New York, which
manages $199 billion in assets.
 ""People are selling in anticipation of a lousy jobs number
and a double-dip recession,"" he said, referring to Friday's
closely watched U.S. payrolls report, which is expected to show
another month of subpar growth in the labor market.
 With investors caught in a perfect storm, officials around
the world moved to calm markets. The boldest step came from
Tokyo, where the government spent an estimated 1 trillion yen
($13 billion) to stem the strength of its currency.
 The yen-selling pushed the dollar up roughly 4 percent to a
session high of 80.25 yen on trading platform EBS, well off a
low of 76.29 set on Monday. The dollar traded on Thursday
afternoon at 79.08 yen , up 2.6 percent on the day, while
the euro gained 1 percent to 111.70 yen .
 The Japanese intervention came a day after Switzerland
unexpectedly cut rates to weaken the franc, which has spiked in
recent days as investors sought safe havens. The currency edged
slightly higher in New York trade on Thursday.
 Even gold, which has raced to a series of highs near $1,700
an ounce amid the gathering uncertainty, fell as deepening
losses on Wall Street prompted investors to sell the metal to
raise cash.
 The exodus from stocks pushed the broad Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> down nearly 5 percent, while the clamor for
safe-haven investments drove the yield on the 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  below 2.5 percent, the lowest since
early November 2010.
 The CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, or VIX, known as Wall
Street's fear gauge, jumped 35.4 percent to 31.7, its highest
in more than a year. The move was the biggest jump since
February 2007, which came during the U.S. subprime mortgage
meltdown.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 512.76
points, or 4.31 percent, to end at 11,383.68. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 60.27 points, or 4.78 percent, to
1,200.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 136.68
points, or 5.08 percent, to 2,556.39.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down 4.3
percent for the day, its largest daily fall in over two years,
and hit a fresh 2011 low.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> lost 3.3 percent.
 Safe-haven assets like the Swiss franc, the yen and gold
have spiked this week on investor fears that governments around
the world are planning spending cuts at a time of slowing
global economic growth.
 The latest spate of economic data points to slowing demand
in the United States, while the euro zone grapples with the
spread of its debt crisis to Spain and Italy, where borrowing
costs have increased sharply.
 The European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged on
Thursday, but traders said the bank has been buying bonds of
peripheral euro-zone countries in an effort to keep rates
down.
 German Bunds gained, while Italian and Spanish government
bond yields rose in volatile trade after a euro- zone monetary
source said the European Central Bank was planning to buy only
Portuguese and Irish bonds. For more see [ID:nR1E7IF024].
 Markets were unconvinced the ECB bond buying will be
effective in stopping contagion. some were disappointed that
Italian and Spanish bonds, whose yields climbed above 6 percent
recently, were not the target of the purchases.
 ""It wasn't a unanimous decision to (buy bonds). (ECB
President Jean-Claude) Trichet looked really uncomfortable
saying it,"" one trader said.
 ""The market, obviously, dismissed it pretty rapidly,""
another trader said.
 Brent  fell more than 5 percent and U.S. crude
 slid nearly 6 percent, or $5.47, to $86.46 a barrel.
Copper prices  dropped 2 percent.

 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Widespread capitulation hit
global equity markets on Thursday as growing anxiety over the
global economic outlook spurred a flight to safe-haven bonds
and sent stocks crashing to fresh lows for the year.
 European stocks tumbled to a level not seen since after the
financial crisis in mid-2009, with Italy's equity market firmly
in bear market territory -- down nearly 30 percent since
February -- as investors worried the euro-zone debt crisis was
spreading.
 Italy's blue-chip FTSE MIB index <.FTMIB>was suspended
about 30 minutes before the close. The index tumbled slightly
more than 5 percent.
 Major U.S. indexes fell more than 3 percent, erasing gains
for the year as the broad-based S&P 500 entered a corrective
phase, down more than 10 percent from its peak in May.
 Intense selling this week reflects a frustration with
politicians to address pressing concerns over high public debt
levels in Europe and the United States as large industrial
economies show signs of running aground.
 ""People are throwing in the towel because they can't find
relief on any front,"" said Milton Ezrati, market strategist at
Lord AbbettCo in Jersey City, New Jersey, which manages $110
billion in assets.
 With investors seemingly caught in a perfect storm,
officials around the world moved to calm markets. The boldest
step came from Tokyo, where the government spent an estimated 1
trillion yen ($13 billion) to stem the strength of its
currency.
 The yen-selling pushed the dollar roughly 4 percent higher
to 80.25 yen on trading platform EBS, well off a low of 76.29

currency edged slightly higher in New York trade on Thursday.
 Even gold, which has raced to a series of highs near $1,700
an ounce amid the gathering uncertainty, fell as deepening
losses on Wall Street prompted investors to sell the metal and
cover losses to meet margin calls outside of the commodity
sector.
 The exodus from stocks pushed the broad Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> down as much as 3.7 percent, while the clamor
for safe-haven investments drove the yield on the 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  below 2.5 percent, the lowest since
early November 2010.
 Less than an hour before the close, the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> dropped 379.71 points, or 3.19
percent, at 11,516.73. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was down 43.84 points, or 3.48 percent, at 1,216.50. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 97.98 points, or 3.64 percent,
at 2,595.09.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down 3.7

 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - World stocks plunged to new
lows for the year on Thursday with a sell-off in markets
accelerating sharply as investors fretted about the outlook
for the global economy and piled into safe-haven bonds.
 European stocks tumbled to a level not seen since after
the financial crisis in mid-2009, with Italy's equity market
firmly in bear market territory, down nearly 30 percent since

the commodity sector.
 ""When you get outside markets down significantly, some
investors liquidate their winning positions in the gold and
silver market longs to raise margins and support their losing
trades,"" Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with
Chicago-based futures broker MF Global.
 The selling ""is across market segments in terms of
institutions, individuals, and traders,"" said Peter Kenny,
managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New
Jersey. ""Everyone is leaning into it. It's a classic
capitulation.""
 The exodus from stocks pushed the broad Standard & Poor's

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The yen slid on Thursday after
Japan intervened to curb its strength to support the country's
export-led economy, a move that should have a fleeting impact
as global economic concerns keep demand for the safe-haven
currency high.
 Japan's intervention came one day after the Swiss National
Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to cap a soaring Swiss
franc. While the yen tumbled during the Asian and European
session, losses were later pared as risk-aversion reigned.
 Constant yen selling versus the dollar by Japanese
authorities during the European session briefly pushed the
dollar above the psychologically key 80 yen level, traders
said. Tokyo had been steady yen sellers in the Asian market.
 ""Japan and Switzerland can do all they want to slow
appreciation, but they will not be able to stop it,"" said Peter
Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, based in Westport,
Connecticut.
 ""Japan and Switzerland should not intervene because
economic growth and a strong currency go hand-in-hand and
history shows that,"" he said. ""When America was a mighty
industrial power, it also had the strongest currency in the
world.""
 Euro Pacific Capital has $3 billion in client assets under
advisement.
 A voracious appetite for safety ensued as investors fret
about sluggish global growth and peripheral debt woes, causing
European and U.S. stocks to plunge and U.S. Treasuries to
soar.
 ""It is a stupid thing when policymakers try to weaken their
currency,"" Schiff said.
 Japan's move had pushed the U.S. currency  roughly
4 percent higher to a three-week high of 80.25 yen, according
to electronic trading platform EBS. Gains were later sharply
pared and it last traded at 78.98 yen, up 2.5 percent.
 On Monday, the dollar hit a four-month low of 76.29 yen,
close to its record trough of 76.25 yen hit in March after the
earthquake.
 Euro gains were also curbed and last traded at 111.74
 yen, up 1.3 percent. Yen selling had earlier sent the
euro zone single currency more than 3 percent higher against
the yen.
 Japan sold one trillion yen, or $12.5 billion. For more see
[ID:nL3E7J41YW]. Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda confirmed
Tokyo had intervened, saying Japan had acted alone but was
communicating with other countries on the move.
[ID:nT9E7IP021]
 ""Japan is being very aggressive in their intervention and
the process has been more aggressive than usual,"" said Brad
Bechtel, managing director and head of sales at Faros Trading
in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""Japan was not only looking at the pace of appreciation of
the dollar/yen, but also the cross rates with China and Korea
as they are their biggest competitors.""
 The BOJ conducts intervention on behalf of the Ministry of
Finance, which is in charge of currency policy.
 Japan's intervention was its first since March 18 when the
BOJ and other major central banks jointly intervened after the
yen surged to a record high versus the greenback.

[ID:nL6E7J411S]
 After a brief bounce, the euro fell below $1.42

disappointed that the ECB bought smaller amounts of peripheral
bonds. It last traded at $1.4154, down 1.2 percent.
 European traders had earlier said the ECB was in the market
buying Portuguese and Irish sovereign debt.

 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - World stocks plunged to new
2011 lows on Thursday as worries about a global slowdown
intensified and investors piled more money into safe-haven
assets like bonds.
 As Wall Street's losses deepened, gold turned negative
after touching another record high near $1,700 an ounce.
 The exodus from stocks pushed the broad Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> down 3 percent, while the clamor for
safe-haven investments drove the yield of the 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  below 2.5 percent, the lowest since
early November 2010.
 Officials moved to calm markets and ease volatility around
the world, with the largest move coming from Tokyo, where the

 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - World stocks had their worst
day in a year on Thursday as worries about a global slowdown
intensified and investors piled more money into safe-haven
assets like bonds and gold, which hit another record.
 Officials moved to calm markets and ease volatility around
the world, with the largest move coming from Tokyo, where the
government spent an estimated 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) to
stem the strength of its currency.
 The intervention comes a day after an unexpected interest

 * Japan finmin confirms solo intervention

 * Euro jumps 1 percent against Swiss franc

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Aug 4(Reuters) - The yen fell sharply on Thursday as
Japan intervened to curb the currency's strength to support its
export-led economy, a day after Switzerland's central bank
unexpectedly cut interest rates to cap a soaring Swiss franc.	
 The euro also rose more than 3 percent against the yen to
113.80 yen and, reflecting anxiety about more Swiss
action, jumped 1 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1140
francs , the other safe-haven currency bought during
the latest bout of financial stress.	
 But analysts said the Japanese authorities' intervention
and easing of monetary policy were unlikely to have a lasting
impact, given investors' desire to buy safe-haven currencies
like the franc and yen on growing worries about global growth, a
euro zone debt crisis and expectations of easier U.S. policy.	
 London traders cited yen selling by Japanese authorities
early in the European session, which pushed the dollar to 80
yen. The dollar's initial spike against the yen started from
around 77.15 yen in Asia.	
 ""It seems a fresh chapter is opening up in the currency
wars, with both Japanese and Swiss officials trying to draw
lines in the sand regarding the strength in their currencies
they are prepared to tolerate,"" said Chris Turner, chief
currency strategist at ING in a note. 
 ""This is going to be a long and drawn-out campaign, since
for Japan the Fed is more likely to cut than hike interest rates
and thus the dollar remains pressured, and for the Swiss there
seems no resolution to the (euro zone) debt crisis.""	
 Earlier this week, the dollar hit a four-month low of 76.29
yen, close to its record trough of 76.25 yen hit in March after
the earthquake. That strengthening worried Japanese exporters.	
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda confirmed Tokyo had
intervened, adding that Japan had acted alone and was
communicating with other countries on the move. 
 Noda did not provide details, but currency market sources
said the Bank of Japan was intervening repeatedly to push down
the yen. Recent yen gains have sparked fears that the strong
currency could weigh on Japan's economic recovery.	
 Traders estimated the size of intervention so far at more
than 1 trillion yen, and some players speculated that Japan's
action could end up rivalling the 2.1 trillion yen in
intervention it conducted on Sept. 15, 2010 -- the biggest
one-day yen-selling intervention ever. 
 The BOJ conducts intervention on behalf of the Ministry of
Finance, which is in charge of currency policy.	
 Analysts said the yen's upward trend was unlikely to change
and the dollar could come under pressure soon.	
 ""The combination of monetary easing and intervention has
initially increased the yen weakening impact, but the steps
alone are unlikely to be enough to derail the yen strengthening
trend,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi.	
 
 
 BOJ BOOSTS ASSET BUYING	
 In a policy decision reached a day earlier than initially
planned, the BOJ boosted the size of its asset-buying programme
to 15 trillion yen from 10 trillion yen, and topped up by 5
trillion yen a 30 trillion yen programme for offering fixed rate
fund injections into the money market. 
 On Wednesday, the Swiss National Bank announced a shock cut
in interest rates and threatened more action to cap a soaring
Swiss franc.	
 Analysts said the size of the asset increases by the BOJ was
in line with market expectations. While some market players
lauded the BOJ for easing monetary policy in coordination with
the government's currency intervention, others were unimpressed.	
 Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan for Barclays
Capital in Tokyo, noted the BOJ's increased asset buying was due
to be completed by around end-2012. Even though the total amount
of the BOJ's asset buying would increase, the schedule suggested
there would be no pick-up in the pace of its purchases, he said.	
 The yen slid broadly and traders said a variety of market
players sold into the greenback's rally, including Asian central
banks, Japanese exporters and Japanese retail investors.	
 There was also talk of active selling of the Australian
dollar against the yen by Japanese retail margin traders, who
had recently raised their combined net long positions in
dollar/yen and major cross/yen pairs to a record high.	
 Japan's intervention was its first since March 18 when the
BOJ and other major central banks jointly intervened after the
yen surged to the record high versus the greenback. 
 Later on Thursday, the Bank of England and the European
Central Bank will announce rate decisions and both are widely
expected to keep interest rates unchanged.

 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled from near record
highs on Thursday after Japan intervened to curb the currency's
export-damaging strength, while concerns about slowing global
economic growth pushed world stocks towards the previous day's
2011 low.	
 Japan spent an estimated 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) to
sell the yen in Tokyo and London trading hours and is likely to
leave extra liquidity from the intervention in the system. The
Bank of Japan pledged to ease monetary policy further to bolster
growth by buying assets such as stocks and bonds.	
 Japan's action follows an unexpected interest rate cut by
Switzerland to weaken its currency on Wednesday.	
 Investors anticipate the Federal Reserve and the Bank of
England may need to adopt fresh rounds of quantitative easing. 
 Speculation that the European Central Bank may resume its
bond buying provided only a brief support for the market as the
focus quickly shifted back to concerns about peripheral euro
zone countries. 
 ""This is going to be a long and drawn out campaign, since,
for Japan, the Fed is more likely to cut than hike interest
rates and thus the dollar remains pressured and for the Swiss
there seems no resolution to the euro zone debt crisis,"" said
Chris Turner, chief currency strategist at ING. 
 The dollar rose more than 4 percent to 80.24 yen ,
having fallen as low as 76.29 on Monday.	
 The MSCI world equity index was down 1
percent on the day, although it stayed above the previous day's
2011 low. The index is on track for its biggest weekly gain in a
year.	
 European stocks lost 0.9 percent while emerging
stocks fell 1.2 percent. U.S. stock futures were down
1 percent , pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street.	
 Speculation the Fed may buy Treasuries again
contributed to a turnaround on Wall Street on Wednesday
as the previous round involving $600 billion bond buying which
ended in June supported risky assets. 
 Last year's Japanese FX intervention and easing by the
Federal Reserve led to Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantega
to declare a ""currency war"" was erupting as developed economies
sought to weaken their currencies to support export growth.	
 This in turn boosted hot money inflows to emerging
countries, fanning inflation and helping trigger interest rate
rises by some central banks. 
 There were signs that some emerging economies were joining
the developed world's attempt to guide their currencies weaker.
Turkey surprised investors by cutting interest rates on
Thursday, while Russia refrained from raising the cost of
borrowing this week, both citing economic risks.	
 ""It seems a fresh chapter is opening up in the currency
wars, with both Japanese and Swiss officials trying to draw
lines in the sand regarding the strength in their currencies
they are prepared to tolerate,"" Turner said.	
 U.S. crude oil  lost 1.1 percent to $90.87 a barrel.	
 The dollar rose 1.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies. The euro was down 0.7 percent at $1.4233.	
 
 EUROPE DEBT WORRIES	
 Speculation that the ECB may resume its bond buying provided
a brief support for the market before the focus quickly shifted
to fears that peripheral euro zone governments may have
difficulty in funding their deficits especially when the global
economy is slowing.	
 Italy's 10-year government bond yield was
above 6 percent while Bund futures  erased early losses
to gain 10 ticks.	
 Italy and Spain have been under increased pressure in recent
weeks as markets feel the size of the euro zone's bailout fund
is too small to protect larger economies if contagion from the
Greek crisis cannot be stopped.	
 ""It's just the fear factor and worries over both
euro zone debt and the U.S. economy. I think sentiment is
definitely on that ilk at the moment and it's hard to see any
justification at the moment to step in to halt the rot,"" Martin
Dobson, head of trading at Westhouse Securities, said.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled on Thursday as
Japanese authorities intervened to curb its recent gains, though
gold stayed near a record high on uncertainty over whether the
European Central Bank would join the fray by resuming bond
purchases to fight a crisis of confidence.	
 A day after the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly cut rates
to weaken its currency, the yen skidded around 3.0 percent
against the dollar on the back of repeated yen selling by
Japan, which fears a stronger yen will impede its economic
recovery.	
 The Bank of Japan later in the day said it would ease policy
further to bolster growth, pledging to buy more assets such as
stocks and bonds.	
 The weaker yen buoyed shares of big Japanese exporters,
driving the Nikkei share average up 0.2 percent, on a
day when the rest of the region fell around 1.4 percent, weighed
down by worries that the U.S. economy is stalling and may even
be in danger of slipping back into recession.	
 European shares were seen likely to open higher as well,
though the focus will be squarely on the outcome of the ECB's
policy meeting due at 1145 GMT and ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet's news conference at 1230 GMT. 
 Interventions by the Swiss and Japanese ""may increase
pressure on them (the ECB) a little, and indeed on the EU too,""
said Christopher Gothard, head of FX for Brown Brothers Harriman
in Hong Kong.	
 ""The ECB however has been marching to its own tune of
concerns about inflation pressures and we don't expect a huge
turnaround in posture from them just yet.""	
 The global economic slowdown and debt market turmoil meant
the ECB would probably hit the pause button on further interest
rate increases, but it might signal a readiness to buy bonds
again. 
 Increased activity by authorities in the past 24 hours to
curb gains in what were considered the safest currencies in the
G10 has made traders nervous that policymakers were cracking
down simultaneously in markets.	
 The New Zealand dollar dropped further from a
30-year peak set on Monday after the country's finance minister
said he preferred the currency to be weaker. 
 Other Asian authorities were also seen likely to continue
intervening to slow gains in their currencies.	
 ""The uncoordinated move risks competitive intervention,
especially in Asia,"" said Andy Ji, Asian currency strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Singapore.	
 The dollar rallied to a high of 79.40 yen , from near
77.00 before the intervention, while the euro surged to 113.36
yen , from around 110.70.	
 
 WARY	
 Reports of a merger between two Japanese industrial giants,
Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd
, to create one of the world's largest infrastructure
firms further supported Japanese stocks. 
 But other stock markets in the region struggled as worries
about slowing global growth sapped investor enthusiasm.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
shed more than 1 percent, taking losses to more
than 5 percent in three days.	
 South Korea's KOSPI was among the biggest losers,
falling about 2.4 percent to well below its 200-day moving
average for the first time in over a year. Foreign sellers
dominated for a third session.	
 Markets are also awaiting results of a Spanish bond auction
after yields on Spanish and Italian bonds jumped in recent
sessions on fears those economies would be engulfed by debt
problems.	
 The BOJ noted tensions in Europe's debt markets and ongoing
worries about the U.S. debt problem as it eased monetary policy
by boosting its asset buying scheme. 
 Latest U.S. figures continued to paint a sombre picture for
the U.S. economy with the pace of growth in the services sector
falling in July to its lowest since February 2010, while new
U.S. factory orders also fell in June. 
 The reports followed poor figures on U.S. consumer spending
and factory activity. That, along with the festering European
debt crisis, is likely to keep buyers cautious.	
 Still, with the SNB and BOJ injecting a fresh round of
liquidity into markets and talk of possibly more quantitative
easing (QE) from the Fed, this could set the stage for a rebound
in riskier assets in coming weeks.	
 Former top Fed officials were quoted in a Wall Street
Journal article saying the Fed should consider a third round of
bond purchases if inflation slowed from recent elevated levels
and if the economy continued to underperform. 
 ""I don't think QE3 is quite on the table yet in the United
States, but the market will be thinking it's possible if
required. All those things do suggest we shouldn't be getting
too risk negative,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS.	
 Among other commodities, copper climbed 0.2 percent
to $9,556 a tonne, while U.S. crude  slipped 0.4 percent
to $91.57 a barrel.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Thursday after
intervention by Japanese authorities, though investors steered
clear of riskier assets, uncertain if the European Central Bank
would join the fray by increasing bond purchases to fight a
crisis of confidence.	
 A day after the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly cut rates
to weaken its currency, the yen tumbled around 2.5 percent
against the dollar after repeated yen selling by the Bank of
Japan.	
 Japan's intervention buoyed shares of big exporters in
Tokyo, pushing the Nikkei share average up 1.1 percent,
outperforming the rest of the region.	
 Increased activity by authorities in the past 24 hours to
curb gains in what were considered the safest currencies in the
G10 has made traders nervous that policymakers were cracking
down simultaneously in markets, with the New Zealand dollar
dropping further from a post-float high after the country's
finance minister said he preferred the currency to be weaker.

 The surge in safe-haven gold paused at $1,662 an
ounce as riskier assets made a tentative comeback, but other
stock markets in the region struggled for momentum with worries
about slowing global growth dampening investor enthusiasm.	
 The global economic slowdown and debt market turmoil means
the European Central Bank will probably hit the pause button on
further interest rate increases at a meeting later on Thursday,
but it may signal a readiness to buy bonds again.

 Markets are also awaiting results of a Spanish bond auction
after yields on Spanish and Italian bonds jumped in recent
sessions on fears those economies would be engulfed by debt
problems.	
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan intervened
unilaterally on Thursday, while the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said it
would end a policy meeting a day early to announce new easing
measures. 
 ""It's worthy of note the BOJ is bringing the end of the
two-day meeting forward, that tells us that you should expect
further developments on the BOJ's asset purchase programme and
certainly at a minimum a commitment on the part of the BOJ to
leave intervention unsterilised,"" said Robert Rennie, chief
currency strategist at Westpac Bank in Sydney. 
 The dollar rallied to a high of 78.90 yen , from near
77.00 before the intervention. The euro surged to 112.97 yen
, from around 110.70.	
 After two days of steep losses, Japan's Nikkei share average
jumped.	
 Reports of a merger between two Japanese industrial giants,
Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd
, to create one of the world's largest infrastructure
firms further supported Japanese stocks. 
 Investors also took heart after Wall Street ended a
seven-day losing streak on Wednesday. 
 Traders said the bounce was sparked by comments from former
top Fed officials in a Wall Street Journal article, saying the
Fed should consider a third round of bond purchases if inflation
slowed from recent elevated levels and if the economy continued
to underperform. 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
put on 0.04 percent, steadying from a 4-percent
drop in the last two sessions.	
 
 CAUTION	
 Still, market bulls were kept on a tight leash as worries
about the health of the global economy persisted. Australia's
S&P/ASX 200 index drifted in and out of positive
territory, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index inched up
just 0.17 percent.	
 The latest figures continued to paint a sombre picture for
the U.S. economy with the pace of growth in the services sector
falling in July to its lowest since February 2010, while new
U.S. factory orders also fell in June. 
 The reports followed poor figures on U.S. consumer spending
and factory activity. That, along with the festering European
debt crisis, is likely to keep buyers cautious.	
 But with the SNB injecting a fresh round of liquidity into
markets and talk of possibly more quantitative easing (QE) from
the Fed, this could once again shore up riskier assets.	
 ""I don't think QE3 is quite on the table yet in the United
States, but the market will be thinking it's possible if
required. All those things do suggest we shouldn't be getting
too risk negative,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS.	
 Among other commodities, copper climbed 0.5 percent
to $9,582 a tonne, while U.S. crude  gained 0.2 percent to
$92.09 a barrel.

 TOKYO, Aug 4(Reuters) - The yen slid 2 percent versus the
dollar on Thursday as Japan intervened to curb yen strength to
support its export-led economy, one day after the Swiss central
bank unveiled a shock cut in interest rates to cap a soaring
Swiss franc. 
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda confirmed that
Tokyo had intervened in the currency market, adding that Japan
had intervened by itself and that Japan was communicating with
other countries on the move. 
 Noda did not provide details, such as levels and the scale
of the intervention, but currency market sources said the Bank
of Japan was intervening in the market repeatedly to push down
the yen. Recent gains in the yen have sparked fears that it
could weigh on the country's economic recovery.	
 ""The BOJ is intervening continuously, lifting the dollar
versus the yen. We can see its willingness to keep the dollar
above 78 yen,"" one foreign exchange market source in Tokyo said.	
 The Bank of Japan said it would end its monetary policy
meeting on Thursday, a day ahead of schedule, and a source
familiar with the BOJ's thinking said it is expected to ease
monetary policy at the policy review. 
 The dollar surged 2.2 percent versus the yen to 78.81 yen
. The dollar had hit a four-month low of 76.29 yen earlier
in the week, close to its record trough of 76.25 yen hit in
March.	
 One resistance level for the dollar lies at 79.50 yen, a
61.8 percent retracement of the dollar's drop from an early July
peak near 81.50 yen down to this week's four-month low.	
 ""History suggests that the BOJ action will support USD/JPY
for a few days at most but won't alter the overall trend. The
Sept. 15, 2010 solo intervention was very large scale but
USD/JPY started to reverse within a matter of days,"" said Sean
Callow, senior currency strategist for Westpac Institutional
Bank in Sydney.	
 Japanese retail investors and exporters were detected
selling dollars against the yen after the dollar spiked up,
dealers said. There was also talk of active selling of the
Australian dollar against the yen by Japanese retail margin
traders. 
 The yen-selling intervention took place for the first time
since March 18 when the Bank of Japan and other central banks
jointly intervened after the yen surged to the record high
versus the greenback after the quake.	
 The dollar has been under pressure against the yen after a
series of weak U.S. indicators raised concerns about the U.S.
economy's outlook.	
 The Swiss National Bank on Wednesday announced a shock cut
in interest rates and threatened more action to cap a soaring
Swiss franc. The SNB said it would cut its target rate to ""as
close to zero as possible"" from an already rock-bottom 0.25
percent, and said it would very significantly increase the
supply of francs to the money market over the next few days.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Asian stocks struggled to follow a
positive lead from Wall Street on Thursday as worries about
global growth persisted, while news of a merger between two
Japanese industrial giants helped the Nikkei steady from a
two-day drop.	
 The surge in safe-haven gold also paused at $1,662 an
ounce as riskier assets made a tentative comeback on hopes the
U.S. Federal Reserve will inject more stimulus to shore up a
faltering economy.	
 The Swiss franc, normally sought in times of heightened
market stress, slipped after the Swiss National Bank (SNB)
shocked markets by cutting interest rates and threatening more
action to cap a soaring currency.	
 Helping end Wall Street's seven-day losing streak were
comments from former top Fed officials in a Wall Street Journal
article, saying the Fed should consider a third round of bond
purchases if inflation slowed from recent elevated levels and if
the economy continued to underperform. 
 After two days of steep losses, Japan's Nikkei share average
edged up 0.13 percent, while MSCI's broadest index of
Asia Pacific shares outside Japan put on 0.24
percent.	
 Australian shares inched up 0.23 percent and South
Korea's KOSPI index was little changed. 
 Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities, said a
strong rebound in the Nikkei was unlikely.	
 ""We had some mixed data from the U.S. overnight, so
investors want to wait for the non-farm payroll report on Friday
to find out more about the state of the U.S. economy,"" Hiroki
said.	
 Among the biggest gainers, both Hitachi and
Mitsubishi Heavy stormed higher after the Nikkei
business daily reported that the firms may merge to create one
of the world's largest infrastructure firms. 
 
 CAUTION	
 Latest data continued to paint a somber picture for the U.S.
economy with the pace of growth in the services sector falling
in July to its lowest since February 2010, while new U.S.
factory orders also fell in June. 
 The reports followed poor figures on U.S. consumer spending
and factory activity. That, along with the festering European
debt crisis, is likely to keep buyers cautious.	
 This means that the SNB's effort to weaken the Swiss franc
will prove to have only a fleeting effect.	
 ""I am skeptical that the SNB actions will have more than a
transitory 'psychological' negative impact on the Swissie if we
remain in a risk-averse world,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of
G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York. 
""With the U.S. dollar not playing its traditional role as
flight-to-quality vehicle, the flight from a wide array of risky
assets is being funneled and concentrated into very few
alternatives,"" he said.	
 The dollar last traded at 0.7700 Swiss francs , having
climbed off a record low around 0.7608 set this week, while the
euro jumped to 1.1049 francs from a trough of 1.0786.	
 This move helped the euro gain on the dollar as well,
despite persistent worries about the euro zone debt crisis.	
 The euro edged up to $1.4352 , putting more distance
from a two-week low around $1.4142 set on Wednesday.	
 All eyes are on the outcome of the European Central Bank
policy-setting meeting on Thursday. The ECB is expected to put
its tightening cycle on ice for several months due to the
economic slowdown and debt market turmoil. 
 It may even signal a readiness to buy bonds again, a move
that could ease pressures in European debt markets and perhaps
help the common currency.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks hit a five-month
low while gold prices posted a new high on Wednesday as
investors fretted about government spending cuts at a time of
slowing global economic growth.
 But investors saw value in the S&P 500 <.SPX> after it hit
its lowest level since December, and the benchmark U.S. index
finished higher to cap a seven-day losing streak.
 Data showed the U.S. service sector growth slowed in July,
just days after manufacturing data pointed to a slowing
expansion. For details see [ID:nN1E77208M]
 Investors sought the safety of long-term U.S. bonds and
gold, while a move to curb the Swiss franc's recent strength
was seen working only temporarily. Fears about the U.S. and
global economies have pushed benchmark Treasury yields to
levels not seen since early November.
 Wednesday's weak service sector data from Asia, Europe and
the United States followed evidence of slowing growth in
manufacturing in many countries on Monday. [ID:nL6E7J30NB]
 ""It's not just (the U.S.), it's the whole world. I'm having
trouble now remembering the last good data point,"" said Uri
Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York.
 Investors worry that fiscal cutbacks in Europe and the
United States at a time of stagnating global output endanger an
already flagging global recovery.
 Gold hit a record for a second straight day, driven by
deepening fears over the spread of the European debt crisis and
its impact on regional growth, while data showed a number of
central banks bought the precious metal in June.
 Spot gold  was last quoted at $1,659.30 an ounce,
having earlier hit a record $1,672.65 per ounce.
 The U.S. 30-year bond  rose 12/32 in price to
yield 3.89 percent, a day after falling below 4 percent for the
first time since November. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
note  was unchanged, with its yield at 2.6130
percent.
 While the flight to safety caused U.S. bonds to rise,
markets gave little respite to Italian bonds as the escalating
debt crisis pushed the region's largest government bond market
toward a tipping point. [GVD/EUR]
 The Italian 10-year benchmark bond price edged up but
yields were still above 6 percent.
 At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> gained 29.82 points, or 0.25 percent,
to 11,896.44. The S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 6.29 points, or 0.50
percent, to 1,260.34. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> gained 23.83
points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,693.07.
 Composite volume, above 10.5 billion shares, was the
highest since March.
 Equities erased most of their losses after two former top
officials at the Federal Reserve conditionally endorsed a
further round of bond buying by the U.S. central bank to spur a
flagging economic recovery, according to the Wall Street
Journal. [ID:nN1E7721BY].
 The previous round, known as QE2, was seen as a main driver
of a spike in equity and commodity prices in late 2010 and the
first half of this year.
 MSCI's world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.7 percent
to its weakest since mid March, down for a sixth straight
session. European stocks <.FTEU3> fell 2 percent to their
lowest closing level in almost a year and U.S.
dollar-denominated Nikkei futures  were flat.
 Energy and industrial metals prices fell as the economic
view darkened. Brent  fell 2.7 percent and U.S. crude
prices  dropped 1.9 percent while copper  lost 1.4
percent. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodities index <.CRB>
lost 1.3 percent.
 Data showing a build-up in U.S. oil stockpiles pressured
crude oil prices further.
 In foreign exchange markets, the Swiss franc retreated from
record highs after the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly cut
interest rates to counter its rise. Declines are seen
temporary, though, as global growth concerns drive investors
toward the perceived safety of the Swiss currency.
 ""I am skeptical that the SNB actions will have more than a

platform EBS just before the SNB's move. It last traded at
1.11022 francs , up 1.66 percent, slightly off the
session high of 1.1146.
 The SNB said the franc was ""massively overvalued,"" keeping
alive the prospect of intervention. [ID:nL6E7J30C0]
 That also sharpened the focus on Japanese authorities who
warned again they were uncomfortable with the rising yen.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell from
record highs on Wednesday after the Swiss National Bank shocked
the market with an interest rate cut, but the retreat should
prove fleeting given mounting concerns about global growth.
 The SNB said the franc was ""massively overvalued,"" keeping
alive the prospect of intervention. For more, see:
[ID:nWEA8468] That also sharpened the focus on Japanese
authorities, who warned again they were uncomfortable with the
rising yen [ID:nL3E7J24NW].
 The safe-haven franc has repeatedly hit record highs
against the dollar and euro in recent sessions after weak
manufacturing data stoked fears of a global economic slowdown.
Concerns about fiscal health in the United States and Europe
added to the allure of the Swiss currency.
 ""I am skeptical that the SNB actions will have more than a
transitory 'psychological' negative impact on the Swissie if we
remain in a risk-averse world,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head
of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
 ""With the U.S. dollar not playing its traditional role as
flight-to-quality vehicle, the flight from a wide array of
risky assets is being funneled and concentrated into very few
alternatives,"" he said. ""In the world of fiat currency, the
list of risk-aversion beneficiaries includes only one currency,
the Swissie.""
 The euro had hit a record low of 1.07946 francs on trading
platform EBS just before the SNB's move. It then rebounded
sharply to last trade 1.5 percent higher at 1.0998.
 The dollar also recovered from a record low of 0.7610 franc
, last trading at 0.7673, up 0.6 percent on the day.
 Analysts said the SNB will be wary of intervention to
weaken the franc, having spent nearly $21 billion trying to
check the currency's gains between March 2009 and June 2010.
 ""The SNB will be reluctant to intervene in the currency
markets again after their intervention at 1.50 francs, which
was perceived as being unsuccessful,"" said Adrian Schmidt,
currency strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.

 ECONOMIC WORRIES
 Hopes for a pickup in economic activity in the second half
of the year were dealt another blow after reports on Wednesday
showed the pace of growth in the U.S. services sector ticked
down unexpectedly in July and the number of jobs created by the
private sector slowed. [ID:nN1E77208M]
 ""The U.S. economy is stagnating. Clearly the job outlook is
deteriorating right now,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice
president at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""So we are seeing
the market very, very risk averse for the time being.""
 The U.S. Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report, a key
market factor every month. will be released on Friday.
Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a July increase of
85,000 jobs and a steady unemployment rate at 9.2 percent.
[ECI/US]
 The euro gained against the dollar, rising 0.9 percent to
$1.4322 . Analysts cautioned that persistent pressure on
peripheral debt markets, especially in Italy and Spain, is
likely to limit the euro's rise. [GVD/EUR]
 Bond yields on Italian and Spanish debt are both rising to
levels where the countries can no longer afford to raise money
from capital markets.
 The dollar hit a session low of 76.78 yen  and
last traded at 76.85, down 0.3 percent. It hit a
more-than-four-month low of 76.29 yen on Monday, just shy of
its trough of 76.25 set in March, which triggered coordinated
intervention by major central banks.
 Attention is turning to the Bank of Japan, which could ease
monetary policy at a meeting later this week. One possible step
may be to expand the size of the BOJ's asset-buying scheme,
which stands at 10 trillion yen. [ID:nL3E7J301W]

 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks as measured by

fretted about the pace of economic growth.

 * Swiss franc falls after hitting record high vs dollar and

dominate

 By Anirban Nag and Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc retreated from
record highs on Wednesday after the Swiss National Bank
unexpectedly cut interest rates to counter its rise, though
concerns about global growth may lead to further gains for the
safe-haven currency.	
 The SNB said the franc was massively over-valued, keeping
alive the prospect of intervention. That also
sharpened the focus on Japanese authorities who warned again
they were uncomfortable with the rising yen .	
 The yen, considered another investor bolt-hole in times of
financial stress, held steady against the dollar, with investors
increasingly wary of intervention.	
 The euro rose over 1 percent against the dollar to
$1.4345, helped mainly by gains against the franc and after
better-than-expected euro zone retail sales. But widening
peripheral bond yields were likely to cap the common currency's
rise. 
 The euro rose more than 2 percent on the day to a session
high of 1.1149 francs . It had hit a record low of
1.0794 on trading platform EBS just before the SNB's move to cut
its target rate to ""as close to zero as possible"" was announced.	
 The euro was on course for its biggest daily percentage gain
against the franc since mid-March 2009. The dollar also rose, by
around 1.8 percent, to a session high of 0.7788 francs from
around 0.7630.	
 But analysts said the SNB move was unlikely to stave off
further franc gains, and any drop in the currency was probably a
good time to buy it.	
 ""These measures will at best slow the pace of appreciation
in the Swiss franc, as real money is seeking the franc and it's
not just speculative flows,"" said Neil Mellor, currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.	
 ""These will resonate for a bit but in light of developments
... around the world and trend reversals taking place in some
stock markets, investors have made up their minds and it's going
to be a long and hard-fought battle for the SNB.""	
 The euro has lost roughly 11 percent against the franc so
far this year and the dollar 17 percent.	
 The SNB will be wary of intervention to weaken the franc,
however, having spent nearly $21 billion trying the check the
currency's gains between March 2009 and June 2010.	
 ""The SNB will be reluctant to intervene in the currency
markets again after their intervention at 1.50 francs which was
perceived as being unsuccessful,"" said Adrian Schmidt, currency
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.	
 ""However, maybe the threat of intervention will force people
to look for other potential safe havens.""

 FOCUS ON BOJ	
 The sharp retreat in the Swiss franc versus the euro
saw implied volatilities fall. One-month implied
euro/Swiss vols were trading at 16.10 percent
versus 18.70 beforehand.	
 But risk reversals, a measure of the premium required to
hold a put or a call option in a currency pair, continued to
show a bearish bias towards the dollar and the euro versus the
franc.	
 The dollar was steady against the yen, with
investors cautious about pushing lower given the risks of
intervention. The dollar was flat at 77.13 yen , having
hit a four-month low of 76.29 yen earlier this week, close to
March's record low of 76.25 yen.	
 Attention is turning to the Bank of Japan which could ease
monetary policy at a meeting later this week. One possible step
may be to expand the size of the BOJ's asset-buying scheme,
which stands at 10 trillion yen. 
 Analysts said despite these measures, investors will
continue to seek safe-haven currencies like the franc and the
yen and sell growth-linked currencies like the Australian dollar
amid debt market jitters and worries about global growth.	
 Even Moody's affirmation of the United States' triple-A
credit rating, following congressional approval of a
deficit-cutting plan, failed to ease tensions. 
 Instead, markets focused on more data in the run-up to the
crucial U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers on Friday. Latest figures
showed U.S. consumer spending dropped in June for the first time
in nearly two years and incomes barely rose. 
 That data followed a batch of dour manufacturing surveys on
Monday with markets' immediate focus switching to U.S. ADP
employment data due at 1215 GMT.

 LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - World stocks fell towards
five-month lows on Wednesday as worries grew that fiscal
cutbacks and stagnating output would prolong a global economic
slowdown and aggravate Europe's debt crisis.	
 Wall Street, however, looked set to bounce back after steep
losses in the previous session.	
 Tuesday's last-minute budget deal to avoid a U.S. default
brought only short-term relief as the focus moved to the impact
of tighter fiscal policy on the already slowing economy,
illustrated by poor manufacturing data this week. Weak services
sector figures on Wednesday for the euro zone and China
accentuated the fragile outlook.	
 Disappointing results from European banks -- Societe
Generale becoming the latest -- also highlighted concerns the
bloc's current rescue fund (EFSF) may be insufficient to stop
peripheral debt problems from spreading to other countries,
especially Italy and Spain.	
 ""Disappointing economic data on both sides of the Atlantic,
as well as surging Italian and Spanish bond yields, has seen
risk appetite plummet as pessimism about the global recovery
starts to take hold with a vengeance,"" CMC Markets analyst
Michael Hewson said.	
 ""The steam is slowly building in the sovereign debt pressure
cooker as the realisation slowly dawns that the EFSF doesn't
have the funds to prevent a full-scale financial meltdown, which
would only leave the European Central Bank as the last line of
defence.""	
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.5
percent, off lows that took it to its lowest since mid-March.
The index is down 1.2 percent year-to-date.	
 European stocks fell more than 1 percent but later
recovered to lose around 0.4 percent.	
 Societe Generale fell 6.9 percent after warning it
would struggle to reach its 2012 profit target as its exposure
to Greece and a tougher economic backdrop took its toll on
second-quarter earnings. 
 Emerging stocks fell 1.5 percent.	
 U.S. crude oil  fell 0.8 percent to $93.02 a barrel.	
 Bund futures  were flat.	
 The premium investors demand to hold Italian and Spanish
10-year government bonds over German Bunds widened further.	
 Worries about Italy's huge public debt sent bond yields to
14-year highs on Tuesday and brought the euro zone's third
largest economy closer to a full-scale financial crisis less
than two weeks after euro zone policymakers agreed a deal aimed
at preventing contagion.	
 The dollar fell 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies while the euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.429 .	
 The U.S. currency fell 0.3 percent to 77.08 yen but
kept a distance from its record low near 76.25 on speculation
about possible intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 The euro rose 2 percent against the Swiss franc
after the Swiss National Bank announced easing measures to try
to counter a recent sharp appreciation in the Swiss currency.	
 Investors have used the franc, backed by Switzerland's solid
growth and well-balanced economy, as a safe haven against the
debt problems of the euro zone and United States.

 * Aussie hit as markets dump risk assets

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit record
highs and the Australian dollar fell on Wednesday as investors
scrambled for a safe haven on renewed tensions in the euro zone
debt market and worries about a global slowdown.	
 The yen held steady against the U.S. dollar, with investors
wary of intervention to weaken the yen after recent jawboning
from Japanese authorities. 
 Even Moody's affirmation of the United States' prized
triple-A credit rating failed to calm jittery markets. Moody's
announcement followed congressional approval of a
deficit-cutting plan. 
 Instead, markets focused on Tuesday's announcement of more
weak U.S. data, following a batch of dour manufacturing surveys
on Monday. Latest figures showed U.S. consumer spending dropped
in June for the first time in nearly two years and incomes
barely rose.	
 Adding to market jitters was a sell-off in peripheral euro
zone bonds, which drove Italian bond yields to a 14-year high on
Tuesday.	
 The souring mood saw investors make a beeline for safe-haven
assets including the Swiss franc and gold, which also hit a
record high .	
 ""Given what we're seeing at the moment is safe haven demand,
further Swiss franc strength is conceivable,"" said Gareth Berry,
associate director of G10 FX strategy for UBS in Singapore.	
 
 CAPITAL PRESERVATION	
 ""When it's all about capital preservation rather than
yields, strange things can happen in the currency space, and
currencies like the Swiss franc can be pushed well beyond levels
that are compatible with what economic fundamentals suggest,""
Berry added.	
 Earlier on Wednesday, the euro hit a record low of 1.0797
versus the Swiss franc on trading platform EBS. The euro later
trimmed its losses and was last up 0.5 percent from late U.S.
trading on Tuesday at 1.0889 francs .	
 The dollar also trimmed losses against the Swiss franc after
hitting a record low of 0.7610 francs earlier on Wednesday. The
dollar last stood at 0.7659 versus the Swiss franc, up 0.5
percent on the day.	
 The dollar took a breather against the yen in the
wake of its recent drop close to a record low.	
 ""The market looks overly short in dollar/yen so it is
difficult for the market to sell further. The market is
particularly watching U.S. jobs data on Friday to see whether to
sell further,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for Okasan
Securities in Tokyo.	
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 77.16
yen . The dollar had hit a four-month low of
76.29 yen earlier this week , right near a record low
of 76.25 yen in March, stirring jitters that Japanese
authorities may intervene to curb the yen's rise.	
 Another focal point is whether the Bank of Japan will ease
monetary policy at a policy meeting later this week. One
possible step may be to expand the size of the BOJ's
asset-buying scheme, which now stands at 10 trillion yen.

 There is scepticism, however, about how effective Japanese
solo intervention would be and also regarding the potential
impact of any BOJ monetary easing. 
 ""The market is turning suspicious about seeing an effective
yen-selling intervention as the Bank of Japan may not be able to
come up with strong monetary easing measures,"" said Soma at
Okasan Securities.	
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the dollar
to $1.4214 .	
 
 TOLL ON RISKIER ASSETS	
 Heightened risk aversion took a heavy toll on riskier
assets, with stocks and commodity currencies coming under
pressure.	
 ""There certainly has been weaker numbers globally,
particularly out of the U.S. There is already a high level of
uncertainty in global markets and that's another layer which is
impacting on sentiment,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in
Sydney.	
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.0747
, pulling away from a 29-year high of $1.1081 hit
last week, with some investors wagering that interest rates
would have to be cut in Australia to avoid recession.	
 Traders said a daily close below the $1.0775 area will
signal yet another failure at $1.1032-1.1083 major long-term
resistance, a negative signal for the currency.	
 The Australian dollar's drop came a day after the Reserve
Bank of Australia sounded less certain about the global economy
and left interest rates unchanged.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell more than 2
percent and gold sat near a record above $1,660 an ounce on
Wednesday, with fears increasing that Washington's efforts to
cut spending will slow growth at a time when global factory
output is already stagnating.	
 Completion of a last-gasp deal to avoid a U.S. default
failed to bring any relief, as investors focused instead on how
tighter fiscal policy could constrict U.S. growth and Europe's
debt crisis was still worsening.	
 ""I think the conditions have completely changed this week,""
said Koichi Ono, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities Capital
Markets in Tokyo. ""Until last week, people have been saying the
U.S. debt ceiling was the problem. Now they talk about worries
about the health of the economy.""	
 In Europe, financial spreadbetters were calling the major
share indexes to open down 1.3-1.4 percent. 
 
 Views on the economic outlook were rapidly being revised,
with JPMorgan cutting its forecast on 2012 U.S. growth to 1
percent and markets reflecting expectations of more than 80
basis points of rate cuts in Australia -- 60 basis points more
than a day ago -- contributing to the Australian dollar's slide
below $1.07. 
 U.S. consumer spending fell in June for the first time in
nearly two years and incomes barely rose, signs that the economy
lacked momentum as the second quarter drew to a close, data on
Tuesday showed. 
 That followed Monday's manufacturing data from the United
States, Europe and China showing growth near a standstill and
last week's disappointing second-quarter U.S. GDP estimate. A
series of U.S. employment data releases from Wednesday through
Friday will be closely watched. 
 ""The market is standing on the edge of the cliff. U.S.
manufacturing activity, growth rate, employment data are all
close to a critical point,"" said Kim Se-jung, a strategist at
Shinyoung Securities in Seoul. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 2.2 percent and
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 2.4 percent, slipping below its 200-day
moving average, an indicator of the medium-term trend. 
 Australian shares fell 2.1 percent and South Korean
stocks dropped more than 2.5 percent. 
 
 EARNINGS DOWNGRADES	
 Asia equity markets that are particularly exposed to swings
in global business cycles and commodities prices have been
seeing earnings downgrades.	
 Taiwan, where about half of the equity market cap is in the
technology sector, has been the biggest target of downward EPS
revisions in Asia Pacific, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine
SmartEstimates, which gives a greater weighting to the more
accurate forecasters.	
 Analysts have in the past 30 days cut their EPS estimates
for Taiwanese companies this year by an average 5.5 percent,
more than twice the next market with the biggest downgrades,
Australia at 2.4 percent, the SmartEstimates show.	
 On the flip side, frontier markets such as Vietnam and
Pakistan as well as markets with companies that depend mostly on
domestic demand, such as Indonesia, have seen upgrades of
earnings forecasts. 
 On Tuesday, the S&P 500 , Wall Street's benchmark
index, lost 2.6 percent while global stocks, as measured by
MSCI's world equity index , slipped into negative
territory for the year to date. 
 Companies, especially in the West, have spent the better
part of the past three years cutting debt and improving their
profit margins. With the second quarter U.S. earnings season so
far showing eight in 10 companies in the S&P 500 meeting or
beating estimates, the profit outlook may hold up and margins
may even improve further. 
 ""With so many heightened risks right now in the market and
so many of them coming from policymakers' comments, the markets
are climbing a wall of worry,"" said Adrian Foster, head of
financial markets research, Asia Pacific at Rabobank
International in Hong Kong. 
 ""Yet we think that businesses had already battened down
their hatches and earnings look reasonably good. So if anything,
the risks out there will cause companies to cut costs further.""	
 
 DEBT CRISIS	
 Investors who had initially cheered a deal in Washington to
raise the debt ceiling quickly realised that the spending cuts
called for under the plan would place a fiscal drag on an
already struggling economy.	
 Europe's sovereign debt crisis also contributed to the gloom
-- Italian bond yields hit their highest in the euro's 11-year
lifetime on Tuesday.	
 Italy and Spain have been under increased pressure in recent
weeks due to concerns that the euro zone's bailout fund is too
small to protect larger peripheral economies if the contagion
from the Greek crisis cannot be contained.	
 ""The implications for the Italian market and economy going
through something similar to Greece is pretty frightening.
People are suggesting it's not bailout-able,"" said Justin
Gallagher, head of Sydney sales trading at RBS.	
 The gloom sent investors scurrying towards assets seen as
offering safety in times of financial turbulence.	
 The Swiss franc traded around 0.7670 after rocketing
to a record high around 0.7610 per dollar on Tuesday, but
commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar
slipped as investors shed riskier assets. 
 The euro lost ground against the dollar, trading around
$1.4200 , after falling as low as $1.4149.	
 ""It is abundantly clear that market participants have little
confidence in the success of the patchwork of solutions that
have been discussed by euro zone policymakers thus far,"" said
Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global foreign exchange
strategy at BNY Mellon.	
 Traditional safe haven gold touched a record high at
$1,661.14 an ounce, while oil , demand for which is
influenced by growth expectations, slipped around 0.6 percent.
 
 Japanese government debt, another safe haven, was in demand,
with 10-year futures <2JGBv1> rising 0.24 point to 142.16, the
highest since November, while the benchmark 10-year yield
slipped 2.5 basis points to 1.015 percent.

 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Major stock indexes around the
world lost all of their gains on the year and gold hit a record
on Tuesday after a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling gave no
comfort to investors preoccupied with sluggish global growth.
 On Wall Street, the broad S&P 500 index <.SPX> fell for a
seventh day, its worst streak since October 2008, giving up the
year's gains, on worry that the debt ceiling agreement will not
stave off a downgrade of the United States' prized triple-A
credit rating.
 Making matters worse, data pointing to a sluggish recovery
continues to pile up around the globe. The sovereign debt
crisis in Europe has not been corralled and is starting to
engulf the large euro-zone economies of Italy and Spain.
 Investors, focused on slowing global growth and the euro
zone's spreading credit problems, opted for the relative safety
of the Swiss franc, U.S. government bonds and gold, which hit
its ninth record this year.
 ""The debt ceiling distraction may now be behind the
markets, but the damage has been done,"" said John Kilduff,
partner at hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York.
 ""We are witnessing a quickly deteriorating economic
backdrop that will pressure all asset classes.""
 U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law a measure
approving a rise in the U.S. statutory borrowing limit and cuts
in government spending.
 Reduced government spending could further decelerate growth

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks tumbled into the
red for the year while safe-haven assets rallied on Tuesday as
fear of a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and rising yields
in Europe stoked worries of higher borrowing costs in a soft
global economy.
 Investors, focused on slower global growth and the euro
zone's spreading credit problems, opted for the relative safety
of the Swiss franc, U.S. government bonds and bullion, which
hit its ninth record this year.
 U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law a measure
approving a rise in the U.S. statutory borrowing limit. Despite
soothing comments on the deal from rating agency Fitch, fears
that the United States could still lose its triple-A credit
rating persisted. For details see [ID:nUSBUDGET] and
[ID:nWNA5563].
 ""Today's passing of the bill has already been priced into
the market as investors now look ahead to a possible downgrade
for the U.S. debt rating following the vote,"" said Chris
Jarvis, senior analyst at Caprock Risk Management in Hampton
Falls, New Hampshire.
 U.S. consumer spending dropped in June for the first time
in nearly two years, adding to worries the world's largest
economy would remain stagnant in the third quarter.
[ID:nN1E7710A7]
 ""The combination of the two worst storms -- retreating
fundamentals and the fears going around in both the United
States and Europe -- is going to put a lot of volatility in the
market,"" said Jonathan Xiong, managing director and global
investment strategist at Mellon Capital Management in San
Francisco. Xiong is part of a team that oversees $30 billion in
assets.
 The preference for safe-haven assets helped lift gold to a
fresh high. Spot gold  was at $1,646.12 an ounce, having
touched an all-time high of $1,647.02 earlier in the day.
 U.S. Treasuries rallied after rating agency Fitch said the
debt agreement was ""commensurate with 'AAA' rating."" Treasuries
were up for a fourth straight day, with the benchmark 10-year
note  up 35/32 to yield 2.625 percent.
 On Wall Street, the broad S&P 500 index <.SPX> fell sharply
and broke through key technical support on economic fears and
worry that the debt ceiling agreement does not do enough to
satisfy the top credit rating agencies. A credit downgrade

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc vaulted to
record highs against the dollar and euro on Tuesday as
sluggish global growth, fresh concerns about the euro-zone
debt crisis and fears about a possible downgrade of the United
States' coveted triple-A credit rating led investors to bet in
favor of the safe-haven currency.
 While Congress buried the specter of a U.S. debt default
by finally passing a deficit-cutting package, the shadow
lingered of a possible painful downgrade of the top-notch
American credit rating. [ID:nN1E77111G]
 Fitch Ratings said the agreement to raise the borrowing
capacity of the United States means the risk of a sovereign
default is ""extremely low"" and commensurate with a AAA rating.
[ID:nWNA5563]
 ""A U.S. credit rating downgrade is strangely enough
supportive of Treasury debt in the longer term,"" said
Christopher Sebald, chief investment officer of Advantus
Capital Management in St. Paul, Minnesota.
 A downgrade would reflect poorly on the U.S.' fiscal
position, meaning steps to reclaim a top-notch rating would be
a likely drag on U.S. economic growth, and making safe-haven
Treasury debt more appealing.
 ""It is more about the economy's trajectory and less about
the risk premium associated with the perceived credit
quality,"" he said. ""While good for Treasuries, a downgrade is
bad for the dollar simply because slower growth will keep
rates low for a longer period of time.""
 The dollar fell to 0.7703 Swiss francs , its seventh
straight intraday record low. Support levels are few and far
between, with chartists at Barclays highlighting a 33-year
trendline which comes in around 0.7580.
 The euro  was last down 0.4 percent at $1.4198 after
having slumped to $1.41576, its weakest since July 21.
 Sebald, who oversees $22 billion in assets under
management, said while he has been buying Treasuries, he
remains underweighted the sector, favoring U.S. investment-
grade corporate bonds from the industrial and utility sectors,
given expectations of outperformance.
 ""If there is a U.S. credit rating downgrade, the immediate
reaction will be risk-off, but I fully expect the market to
swiftly come back,"" he said.
 New evidence that the U.S. economy has hit a rough patch
emerged from a report that showed consumer spending, which
accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity,
unexpectedly fell in June to show the first decline in nearly
two years. For details, see [ID:nCAT005484]
 The report came a day after data showed sluggish U.S. and
global manufacturing. [ID:nN1E770107] [ID:nL6E7J10Q9]

 Italy and Spain have been under increased pressure in
recent weeks as markets feel that the euro zone's EFSF bailout
fund is too small to protect larger fringe economies if
contagion from the Greek crisis cannot be stopped.
 Meanwhile, the yen's strength drew warnings from Japanese
officials of possible action to stem its rise and nudged the

March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc rose to a record
high against the euro and held close to a record versus the
dollar on Tuesday as concerns about euro zone sovereign debt
problems and a slowdown in the global economy boosted demand for
the safe-haven currency.	
 Fears of intervention capped gains in the safe-haven yen,
however, as the currency's strength drew warnings from Japanese
officials of possible action to stem its rise and nudged the
Bank of Japan closer to a further easing in policy.

 Still, the yen advanced against the euro as worries about
the euro zone debt crisis spreading to larger countries despite
last month's bailout deal for Greece propelled Italian and
Spanish bond yields to 14-year highs. 
 The euro fell 1.5 percent against the Swiss franc
to a record low of 1.0985 francs on the EBS trading platform,
taking it through reported significant option barriers at 1.1000
before it recovered to trade at 1.1074 francs.	
 Analysts said the franc, as the safe haven of choice, was
poised to set further record highs, with the yen and -- to a
lesser extent -- the dollar also benefiting.	
 They said very low liquidity was exacerbating moves, though
traders said euro demand from sovereigns looking to diversify
their dollar holdings helped to limit falls in the single
currency.	
 ""Liquidity is atrocious and is causing some exaggerated
moves, especially in the Swiss franc,"" said Sebastien Galy,
currency strategist at Societe Generale.	
 He added, however, that central bank demand was likely to
keep the euro in a range above $1.40 against the dollar. 
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.4175, having hit
$1.41576, its weakest since July 21, with analysts saying
investors were concerned a global slowdown could hit indebted
euro zone peripheral countries badly. 
 Data on Monday showing U.S. manufacturing grew at its
slowest pace in two years in July heightened concerns about the
global economic outlook as it followed weak surveys out of the
euro zone and the UK. 
 ""Investors remain cautious and are becoming increasingly
concerned by the recent soft patch of data releases from around
the world,"" said Chris Walker, currency strategist at UBS. ""The
euro zone periphery fixed incone markets came under pressure
again and risk currencies generally suffered.""

 
 A last-gasp deal by lawmakers in the United States to raise
the debt ceiling and avert a default brought little relief to
markets, with investors wary that ratings agencies may still
downgrade the country's triple A rating. 
 The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 0.7790 Swiss francs
, close to an all-time low around 0.7730 hit on Monday.
With support levels few and far between, chartists at Barclays
highlighted a 33-year trendline which comes in around 0.7580
franc.	
 The Swiss franc also outperformed against the yen, rising to
its highest in nearly three years .	
 
 INTERVENTION JITTERS	
 The dollar was marginally higher at 77.43 yen , off a
four-month low of 76.29 yen hit on Monday on EBS -- which was
only just shy of its record trough of 76.25 hit after the March
11 earthquake.	
 ""If dollar/yen were to break below 76 yen it could trigger a
rather fast move lower and I would expect the BOJ to step in,""
said Neils Christensen, currncy strategist at Nordea. He added
that the fears of intervention meant the yen's rise for now was
""orderly"".	
 Other analysts said a break of the record low in dollar/yen,
would be the trigger for the Japanese to step in. 
 Implied volatility in dollar/yen picked up as the spot price
approached all-time lows and due to intervention worries. 
 One-month implied volatility was around 10.90
percent versus 10.30 on Monday, though well below a level around
20 seen in March when coordinated G7 intervention drove the yen
lower.	
 Finance Minster Yoshihiko Noda said he was closely
communicating with the Bank of Japan and other countries on how
to address the yen's recent rise. Tokyo dealers said the dollar
saw demand from speculators who were detected building up dollar
long positions in anticipation of possible intervention.	
 Elsewhere, the Australian dollar lost 1 percent to $1.0875
after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates
at 4.25 percent, disappointing some in the market who were
speculating about a possible hike.

 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a one-month low
on Tuesday and the euro fell broadly as investor focus shifted
back to weak global growth prospects and the euro zone debt
crisis after a U.S. budget deal that will lead to spending cuts
of over $2 trillion.	
 Sluggish U.S. and global manufacturing data on Monday added
to concerns about the world economic recovery, while concerns
that Spain and Italy will be the next victims of the euro zone
crisis drove benchmark government bond yields to 14-year highs.	
 An 11th-hour deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling cleared its
biggest hurdle in the House of Representatives, staving off the
prospect of a default. But fears persisted that Washington could
still lose its triple-A credit rating. 
 Figures on Monday showing U.S. manufacturing grew at its
slowest pace in two years in July prompted investors to unwind
risky positions and buy safe-haven assets including German
government bonds, the yen and Swiss franc.	
 ""It looks like investors have just forgotten about the debt
ceiling deal in Washington and instead are focusing on the
economic data, which was clearly weaker than anticipated,"" said
Bill McNamara, analyst at Charles Stanley. 
 ""The uptrend is clearly over.""	
 MSCI's world equity index fell 0.7 percent
on the day, to its weakest since June 28. The benchmark index is
almost flat since January.	
 European stocks hit a 10-month low while Italian
shares fell to 27-month troughs.	
 ""The fear of the market is that the world is going into
recession again... and in the euro zone the peripheral markets
are the ones that will suffer most,"" said Alessandro Giansanti,
strategist at ING in Amsterdam.	
 Emerging stocks dropped 1.3 percent, while U.S.
stock futures were down around 0.4 percent , pointing to a
weaker opening on Wall Street later.	
 U.S. crude oil  fell 0.7 percent to $94.17 a barrel.
Bund futures  rose 50 ticks.	
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies while the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.4197.	
 The U.S. currency lost 0.1 percent to 77.31 yen ,
having come within a few ticks of its record low on Monday. The
yen's strength drew warnings from Japanese officials of possible
action to stem its rise and nudged the Bank of Japan closer to a
further easing in monetary policy .	
 The 10-year Spanish government bond yield rose
to 6.47 percent, its highest since 1997, pushing its yield
premium over benchmark German Bunds out to 403 bps. 
 The Italian 10-year BTP yield was up by a similar amount at
6.27 percent . 
 The two countries have been under increased pressure in
recent weeks as markets feel the size of the euro zone's EFSF
bailout fund is too small to protect larger fringe economies if
contagion from the Greek crisis cannot be stopped.	
 Weakening global recovery momentum could also make it harder
for peripheral countries to service their debt.	
 ""The positive tone seems to have evaporated after the ISM
figures yesterday ... and 6 percent was seen as a line in the
sand for Italian yields and now that that's gone people don't
want any risk apart from Germany,"" a euro zone bond trader said.

 By Ian Chua and Chikafumi Hodo	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc
gained on Tuesday on worries about the global economy even as
the U.S. looked to have averted a debt default after the House
of Representatives approved an 11th hour deal to raise the
government's borrowing limit.	
 Strength in the yen also drew more warnings from Japanese
officials about possible intervention and nudged the Bank of
Japan closer to a further easing in policy. 
 The U.S. debt bill will now need to clear the Senate, which
is expected to approve the $2.1 trillion deficit-cutting plan.

 ""While the political cloud of uncertainty may lift somewhat,
the economic storm clouds are darkening,"" Yelena Shulyatyeva, an
economist at BNP Paribas wrote in a client note.	
 The Swiss franc held near record highs against the euro and
dollar, having risen strongly overnight after reports on Monday
showed the world's manufacturing sector expanded at its weakest
pace in two years last month. .	
 ""Clearly, the report raises worries that the sector, which
has been a key engine of growth during the current recovery, is
losing steam reflecting a weakening around the globe in
manufacturing,"" Shulyatyeva said.	
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 0.7815 Swiss francs ,
having plumbed an all-time low around 0.7730 overnight. The euro
also slipped 0.3 percent to 1.1130 francs , not far
off a record low near 1.1025.	
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 77.44 yen having set a
four-month low of 76.29 yen the previous day on EBS, close to
its record trough of 76.25 yen hit after the March 11
earthquake.	
Masanari Takada, a forex strategist at Nomura Securities,
said there is a chance Japanese authorities could intervene
should the dollar approach its all-time low, a level where a
slew of option-related sell orders are rumoured to be placed.	
 ""Coupled with the Bank of Japan's monetary measures, Japan
will be able to intervene to push up the dollar against the
yen,"" Takada said.	
 ""Still, it may be difficult to keep the dollar bolstered for
long as it is under downward pressure because of caution towards
the outlook for the U.S. economy and falling in U.S. Treasury
yields,"" he said.	
 
 BACKING OFF	
 Sellers backed off due to caution over possible yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 Finance Minster Yoshihiko Noda said he was closely
communicating with the Bank of Japan and other countries on how
to address the yen's recent rise.	
 ""If the strong yen continues, it will unmistakably impact
some industries. I want to closely analyse the potential
impact,"" Noda told reporters after a cabinet meeting.

 The dollar drew demand from speculators who were detected
building up dollar long positions in anticipation of possible
intervention by the Bank of Japan, Tokyo dealers said.	
 A series of stop-loss buy orders was cited at 77.70-78.20
yen, but Japanese exporters were expected to sell strongly
between 79 and 80 yen, dealers said.	
 Tension over intervention would increase should the dollar
dip below 77 yen, with stop-loss sell orders rumoured at 76.80
yen and major stops around 76.25 yen and 76.10 yen, they said. 
 Sources familiar with the central bank's thinking said it is
expected to ease monetary policy this week to support a fragile
economic recovery if the yen continues to rise quickly enough to
trigger currency intervention. 
 ""Intervention is really only successful when it's
coordinated and I can't see central banks getting together in
the current environment to do a coordinated intervention to
weaken the yen,"" said Joseph Capurso, a strategist at
Commonwealth Bank in Sydney.	
 The dollar managed to hang on to most of the gains it made
overnight against the euro, which is hampered by the euro zone
debt problems.	
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4241 . It was
still near two-week lows around $1.4184 plumbed overnight.	
 The Australian dollar dropped after the Reserve Bank of
Australia kept its interest rates steady at 4.25 percent,
disappointing some market participants who had expected a credit
tightening by the central bank.	
 Still, the RBA warned it had considered tightening and was
concerned about the outlook for inflation, leaving the door wide
open to a hike in coming months. 
 The Aussie last changed hands at $1.0925 , down 0.4
percent from late U.S. trade on Monday.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Tuesday as
sluggish U.S. and global manufacturing data added to concerns
about the health of the world economy, while a strengthening yen
prompted speculation that Tokyo may intervene in the markets to
curb the currency.	
 An 11th-hour deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling cleared its
biggest hurdle in the House of Representatives, staving off the
prospect of a possibly calamitous default but failing to allay
fears Washington could still lose its coveted triple-A credit
rating. 
 U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years in
July as new orders contracted, and the economic concerns coupled
with uncertainty over the U.S. debt deal boosted demand for
safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and
weighed on riskier assets such as oil and stocks.	
 European stock markets were expected to extend a week-long
slide, with financial bookmakers calling London's FTSE
to open flat and France's CAC-40 and Germany's DAX
down 0.2 percent. 
 S&P 500 index futures  fell 0.4 percent, pointing to a
weaker start on Wall Street. 
 Japan's Nikkei fell 1.3 percent, while MSCI's
broadest measure of Asian shares outside Japan
slipped 1.6 percent.	
 ""While in the short term they've avoided global financial
crisis mark two, they're likely to need more budget cuts,""
Joseph Capurso, strategist at Commonwealth Bank in Sydney, said
about the U.S. debt deal.	
 ""When you put that together with very soft U.S. economic
data, that raises the odds that the Fed will need to introduce
more quantitative easing. I can see the U.S. dollar becoming
weaker.""	
 U.S. stocks eased on Monday, with the S&P 500 closing
down 0.4 percent as the weak manufacturing report offset relief
that a debt default had been averted. 
 
 Compounding pessimism about the anaemic state of the economy
were concerns about the fiscal drag on growth as a result of
spending cuts in the U.S. debt deal, which calls for a special
Congressional panel to find $1.5 trillion in budget savings by
late November.	
 ""While the political cloud of uncertainty may lift somewhat,
the economic storm clouds are darkening,"" Yelena Shulyatyeva, an
economist at BNP Paribas wrote in a client note.	
 ""Today's fall is not a big surprise as the market has been
concerned about the U.S. economy's long-term outlook, although
the country was able to avoid a default,"" said Naoki Fujiwara, a
fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management in Tokyo.	
 The world's manufacturing sector expanded at its weakest
pace in two years last month, surveys showed, as factories
reported shrinking orders for the first time since major
economies emerged from the banking crisis and recession of 2008.

 The dollar traded around 0.7805 Swiss francs on
Tuesday, having plumbed a record low around 0.7730 on Monday.	
 Against the yen, the dollar stood near 77.40 ,
recovering from a low of 76.29 on electronic trading platform
EBS on Monday, its weakest since the coordinated intervention by
major central banks in mid-March to slow the surging yen.	
 
 POSSIBLE INTERVENTION	
 Japanese officials said the yen, which has gained nearly 5
percent this month, was too strong and could hurt an economy
struggling to recover from a massive earthquake in March --
putting markets on alert for possible intervention.	
 ""Coupled with the Bank of Japan's monetary measures, Japan
will be able to intervene to push up the dollar against the
yen,"" said Masanari Takada, forex strategist at Nomura
Securities. 
 ""Still, it may be difficult to keep the dollar bolstered for
long as it is under downward pressure because of caution towards
the outlook for the U.S. economy and falling in U.S. Treasury
yields"".	
 Others were less convinced that Tokyo would act, however,
given that past interventions have only really succeeded when
the action has been co-ordinated with other central banks.	
 ""I don't think Japan will intervene,"" Richard Yetsenga,
global head of FX strategy at ANZ Research, told Reuters Insider
TV.	
 ""I think what's driving the yen are really global forces
rather than domestic forces. It's really about the weakness of
the U.S. dollar rather than the strength of the yen.""	
 Gold edged up, supported by news that South Korea's central
bank had bought 25 tonnes in recent months to diversify its
foreign exchange reserves. Spot gold traded around
$1,623.26 an ounce. 
 ""This news reiterates the fundamental view that most
investors, asset managers, and even central banks hold true --
that gold remains the quintessential currency hedge, a
stabilizing asset for portfolios, and a safe haven in uncertain
economic times,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at
Vision Financial Markets, a futures broker based in Chicago.	
 Oil slipped, with U.S. crude  shedding around a
quarter of a percent to $94.66 a barrel, after trading as low as
$93.42 on Monday, its weakest since late June. 
 The economic uncertainty boosted demand for government debt,
with 10-year Japanese government bond futures rising 0.25 point
to 142.02, while the benchmark 10-year yield slipped 3.5 basis
points to 1.04 percent, its lowest in nearly 9 months.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Stocks and commodities fell on
Monday as weak global factory data added to already sour news
on the global economy, along with concern lawmakers in
Washington may not approve a rise in the U.S. debt ceiling in
time.
 The Swiss franc soared and the U.S. dollar rallied against
the euro, with demand for safe-haven currencies set to continue
on concerns about a slowing economy and a possible cut of the
United States' triple-A credit rating.
 U.S. stocks swung from a 1 percent gain at the open to a 1
percent slide before paring some losses, reflecting the
market's uncertainty, after the Institute for Supply
Management's July manufacturing index hit its lowest in two
years.
 The slow pace of growth cast doubt on expectations the
faltering recovery would quickly regain steam in the second
half of the year.
 Data also pointed to stagnant factory growth in China and
the euro zone.
 U.S. oil prices  fell 0.6 percent while copper
 dropped 1.5 percent on the weak ISM data and a firmer
dollar.
 U.S. congressional leaders rushed to line up Republican and
Democratic votes for a White House-backed deal to raise the
U.S. borrowing limit and avert an unprecedented debt default.
No time for a vote has been announced, but Vice President Joe
Biden predicted passage. For details, see [ID:nUSBUDGET]
 The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed that
the debt deal would reduce budget deficits by at least $2.1
trillion over 10 years.
 The deal ""doesn't help the economy, and if we have a
continued slowdown the deficit will be larger,"" said Carl
Kaufman, who helps manage nearly $2 billion at the Osterweis
Strategic Income fund in San Francisco. ""Add to that the fact
that it isn't a certainty this goes through, and it's not a
certainty we won't get downgraded.""
 With less than an hour of trading left in the session, the
Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 24.67 points, or
0.20 percent, at 12,118.57. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 6.32 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,285.96. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 18.88 points, or 0.68
percent, at 2,737.50.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.5
percent with emerging market shares <.MSCIEF> up 0.9 percent.
 U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures  dipped 0.15
percent.
 The plan to avert a U.S. default must be passed by both
houses of Congress and will still face some opposition. The
Treasury faces a Tuesday deadline after which it would have to
stop paying some of its bills.
 There remained widespread assumption that ratings agencies
could downgrade U.S. Treasuries from their vaunted triple-A
status, a move that would impact the valuation of numerous
other assets.
 ""The risk of a possible credit downgrade remains on the
table as the spending cuts may not go far enough to convince
rating agencies that Washington is serious about getting its
fiscal house in order,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Still, the cost of insuring U.S. debt with credit default
swaps fell.
 SWISS FRANC RALLIES, EURO SLIDES
 The dollar and euro hit record lows against the Swiss
franc, while the single currency lost 0.7 percent versus the
greenback. Against the yen , the U.S. currency was last
down 0.4 percent at 77.08 after earlier hitting a
more-than-4-month low that heightened fears of intervention
from Tokyo.
 ""The markets are unsure about how this will play out and it
is down to the wire, so the market is cautious right now,"" said
Jessica Hoversen, FX analyst at MF Global in New York.
 Gold futures  edged 0.5 percent lower to $1,620.70 an
ounce.
 In bond markets, benchmark U.S. Treasuries  rose
14/32 in price to yield 2.74 percent after the weak data, down
from 2.82 percent earlier Monday and 2.80 percent late on
Friday.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc soared on
Monday and dollar rallied against the euro, with demand for
safe-haven currencies set to continue on concerns about a
slowing economy and a possible cut of the United States' credit
rating.
 U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years in
July, the Institute for Supply Management said, casting doubt
on expectations the faltering recovery would quickly regain
steam. For details, see [ID:nN1E770107]
 Initial euphoria about a debt deal in Washington quickly
faded as investors worried that the country might still lose
its triple-A rating even though the risk of a default appeared
to be off the table. See [ID:nN1E76U0F5]
 ""The undercurrents of risk aversion still remain very
strong,"" said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX
strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston. ""Existing riskier positions
that were funded in the yen, Swiss franc and dollars are being
unwound, which is why all three currencies have been gaining
relative to the others.""
 The Swiss franc climbed to record highs against both the
euro and dollar, continuing a recent trend as investors fretted
about sovereign debt crises on both sides of the Atlantic.
 ""The Swiss franc still stands out head and shoulders above
the other so-called safe-haven currencies,"" Shankar said.
 The euro plumbed a record low at 1.1030 Swiss francs
 on trading platform EBS, and last traded down 1.6
percent at 1.1133 francs.
 The dollar hit as low as 0.77323 Swiss franc ,
before pulling back to 0.7821, down 0.4 percent on the day.
 In Washington, the Democratic-led Senate was expected to
pass the $2.1 trillion deficit-cutting plan later on Monday,
just one day before the deadline to lift the government's
borrowing limit. But uncertainty about its fate in the more
fractious Republican-controlled House of Representatives kept
markets nervous.
 The cuts proposed over the next ten years also fall short
of the $4 trillion set by some ratings agencies as the
threshold needed to avert a U.S. ratings downgrade.
 ""The markets are unsure about how this will play out and it
is down to the wire, so the market is cautious right now,"" said
Jessica Hoversen, FX analyst at MF Global in New York.

 YEN INTERVENTION RISK
 The euro  fell to $1.41847 and last traded at
$1.4239, down 1.1 percent on the day.
 Yields on Italian and Spanish bonds continued to rise,
suggesting persistent worries about the risk of contagion in
the euro zone crisis and adding to risk aversion the market.
 The dollar fell as low as 76.29 yen  on EBS, its
weakest since coordinated intervention by major central banks
in mid-March to weaken the surging Japanese currency. The
record low for the pair was at 76.25 set in mid-March.
 The U.S. currency briefly surged against the yen in morning
New York trade, though traders said the move did not appear to
be related to intervention by Japanese authorities.
 A trader said the jump in the pair was partly due to a big
order from a large Japanese bank under 76.50 yen and was part
of the normal flow of the market.
 An official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance in Tokyo
said that while the office is aware of currency movements, he
cannot comment on the dollar/yen move. See [ID:nN1E7700XS]
 Still, the intraday spike heightened the market's alertness
for potential official yen selling, helping the dollar rebound
to 77.20 yen, up 0.6 percent on the day.
 ""There is underlying expectation in the market that
Japanese authorities might be forced to act if dollar/yen goes
much lower later this week,"" Shankar said.

the debt deal would reduce budget deficits by at least $2.1
trillion over 10 years.
 ""The main reason for the reversal is people are waking up
to the fact that this isn't a great deal,"" said Carl Kaufman,
who helps manage nearly $2 billion at the Osterweis Strategic
Income fund in San Francisco.
 ""It doesn't help the economy, and if we have a continued
slowdown the deficit will be larger,"" he said. ""Add to that the
fact that it isn't a certainty this goes through, and it's not
a certainty we won't get downgraded.""
 There remained a widespread assumption that ratings
agencies could downgrade U.S. Treasuries from their vaunted
triple-A status, a move that would impact the valuation of
numerous other assets.
 Still, the cost of insuring U.S. debt with credit default
swaps fell, with short-dated swaps dropping the most, as
investors regained confidence the United States would avoid a
near-term debt default.
 Shortly before 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), the Dow Jones

 DOLLAR TUMBLES, EURO SLIDES
 The plan to avert a U.S. default must be passed by both
houses of Congress and will still face some opposition. But it
is expected to allow the debt ceiling to be raised, avoiding
the prospect of Washington not being able to pay its bills.
 ""The risk of a possible credit downgrade remains on the
table as the spending cuts may not go far enough to convince
rating agencies that Washington is serious about getting its
fiscal house in order,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 The dollar hit a record low of 0.77525 Swiss franc
 and last traded down 0.6 percent at 0.7808. Against
the yen , the greenback was last down 1.1 percent at

 NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - A stocks rally fizzled and U.S.
Trasury prices gained on Monday as lawmakers in Washington
prepared to approve a hike to the U.S. debt ceiling and avoid a
technical default, but fear of a downgrade lingered.
 The U.S. dollar fell to a more-than-4-month low below 77
against the yen, heightening the risk of monetary moves from
Tokyo. The greenback briefly pared its losses and turned
positive but traders said there was no sign of intervention.
 U.S. stocks turned negative after rising more than 1

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low
against the safe-haven Swiss franc on Monday, reversing earlier
gains on investor concerns that a deal to raise the U.S.
borrowing limit would not be enough to avoid a downgrade to the
country's triple-A credit rating.	
 After weeks of discord, U.S. lawmakers looked likely to pass
a deal to raise the debt ceiling, avoiding a default, and cut
about $2.4 trillion from the deficit over the next decade,
prompting many in the market to unwind bearish bets on the
dollar taken out in recent weeks. 
 However, investors resumed dollar selling on concerns that
ratings agencies may consider the planned deficit cuts would not
be sufficient for the United States to improve its fiscal
position.	
 ""The debt ceiling deal needed to be done, so this is not a
cause for rejoicing and it is not a win situation for the dollar
as there is still a good chance of a ratings downgrade,"" said
Steve Barrow, head of G10 currency research at Standard Bank.	
 After tepid second quarter U.S. growth figures on Friday,
concerns about the economic outlook also weighed on dollar
sentiment. 
 The dollar fell 0.5 percent versus the Swiss franc to
0.78153 francs on EBS trading platform, well below last week's
record low just above 0.7850 francs. 
 Traders cited selling by real money accounts, which pushed
it well off the day's high around 0.7954 francs, as well as
selling by a U.S. investment bank.	
 Broad demand for the Swiss currency also pushed the euro
to a fresh record low of 1.12628 on EBS.	
 Against the yen, the dollar traded 0.2 percent higher
at 76.88 yen, well below an earlier high of 78.05 yen and very
close to a four-month low of 76.70 yen hit last week. A move
below there would leave it poised to test its all-time trough of
76.25 yen.	
 Further yen appreciation would keep investors wary that
Japanese authorities -- which have argued against a rising
currency -- may take action to curb yen strength.

 The prospect of a deal to avoid a U.S. default helped
appetite for risk, however, prodding the euro up 0.1
percent against the dollar to $1.4412.	
 The growth-linked Australian dollar rose 0.6
percent on the day to $1.1053, close to a multi-year high of
$1.1081, while the New Zealand dollar hovered close to
a 30-year high hit in Asian trade.	
 
 'UNDERWEIGHT DOLLARS'	
 Despite the mild rally in the dollar versus safe-haven
currencies, traders pointed out that the greenback's recovery
had been relatively limited given that it fell nearly 7 percent
versus the franc and 3.5 percent against the yen last month.	
 The latest IMM data shows net short positions in the dollar
held by speculators jumped last week, to a value of $25.42
billion according to Reuters calculations. Analysts
said this was the biggest net short position since early May. 
 Some traders said that, if anything, the market was
positioned for the possibility of a U.S. downgrade.	
 Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency management at Investec
Asset Management, said he remained underweight on the dollar as
the United States will continue to struggle to get its fiscal
situation in order as the economy posts a slow recovery.	
 ""Even if this plan goes through, it won't change things
much,"" said Papasavvas, who is responsible for around $10
billion in assets under management.	
 ""(Because of) the structural story, the cyclical story, and
the reserves story, we have a pretty negative outlook on the
dollar,"" he said, adding he saw a ""decent"" possibility that
Washington would lose its triple-A status.	
 He said he remained overweight euros and Asian and emerging
currencies, and that he had largely stayed pat on currency
positions in the past weeks. 
 Demand for risky assets was dampened by sluggish
manufacturing purchasing managers' surveys for many euro zone
countries on Monday, which highlighted economic weakness in the
region as struggling periphery countries require more assistance
to help repay their debts.	
 Some traders said Spain's surprise announcement on Friday
that it would call an early general election ratcheted up
political uncertainty in the euro zone, which may ultimately
have some impact on how much more bailout funds countries
including Greece may receive.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Investors boosted stocks and sold
some safe-haven assets on Monday, betting that a last-minute
deal in Washington meant the U.S. economy would avoid default.	
 Wall Street looked set for significant gains but caution was
the watchword, with the dollar falling to a new record low
against the Swiss franc.	
 There remained a widespread assumption that ratings agencies
could downgrade U.S. Treasuries from their vaunted triple-A
status, a move that would impact the valuation of numerous other
assets.	
 Investors were also digesting data pointing to stagnant
growth in the global economy, with Chinese factory activity
slowing and euro zone manufacturing falling.	
 After a tense weekend spent in search of a compromise to
allow the U.S. borrowing limit to be lifted, U.S. President
Barack Obama said leaders from both parties reached a deal to
cut the budget deficit by $1 trillion over 10 years, with
additional savings of $1.4 trillion possible. 
 The plan must be passed by both houses of Congress and will
still face some opposition. But it is expected to allow the debt
ceiling to be raised, avoiding the prospect of Washington not
being able to pay its bills and defaulting.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI climbed 0.7
percent with emerging market shares up 1.3 percent.	
 There were large gains in Japan, where the Nikkei
rose 1.3 percent. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 rose
0.5 percent with banking shares enjoying a big boost.	
 But scepticism persisted about how long the rise in risk
sentiment might last, given the likely U.S. downgrade that some
believe could come this week. 
 ""It is a relief rally on the back of the parties coming
together, but it could only last for a couple of days as the
United States could now face a ratings downgrade,"" Manoj Ladwa,
senior trader at ETX Capital, said.	
 ""That would impact every part of the United States.""	
 It would also raise issues for other assets. Some large
pension funds, for example, will only hold triple-A debt,
meaning they may have to sell Treasuries and buy elsewhere,
crowding trades into German Bunds, for example.	
 The relative valuations of a number of assets, meanwhile,
are based on their divergence from supposedly risk-free
Treasuries.	
 
 UNWINDING	
 An unwinding of investor positions taken to protect against
U.S. default was short-lived.	
 Gold fell more than 1 percent before recovering to
stand just half a percent down. It was at $1,618 an ounce after
hitting all-time nominal highs last week.	
 Early dollar gains against the Swiss franc reversed,
leaving the U.S. currency at a new record low. The franc has
seen intense interest from investors as the twin euro zone and
U.S. debt crises have stirred markets this year.	
""The problems are not fully solved so I think we will see a
muted reaction,"" said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at
SEB in Stockholm.	
 ""You have the risk of ratings agency downgrades, and no
further fiscal stimulus in this deal,"" he said.	
 On bond markets, yields on U.S. Treasuries and core euro
zone debt rose, reflecting some selling to release money parked
in fixed income in the runup to the U.S. deal.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The dollar surged roughly one
percent against both the yen and Swiss franc on Monday,
extending its bounce after U.S President Barack Obama announced
that congressional leaders had reached an agreement to avert a
debt default.	
 Commodity currencies climbed with the New Zealand dollar
hitting a fresh post-float high against the U.S. dollar, adding
to gains made earlier on growing hopes that American lawmakers
were close to clinching a deal.	
 Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose to as high as
78.051 yen , rising more than a full yen from an intraday
low, and pulling away from a four-month low hit late last week.	
 ""This is likely to spur some unwinding of the excessive yen
buying positions that were built up,"" said Koji Fukaya, director
of global foreign exchange research at Credit Suisse Securities
in Tokyo.	
 ""We could see the dollar head back up close to 80 yen, but
after that its moves will hinge on forthcoming economic data,""
Fukaya said.	
 A key resistance zone for the dollar lies in the pivotal
78.60-70 area. Traders said only a break of the latter level
would signal that an interim base was in place.	
 After trimming some gains, the dollar stood at 77.79 yen, up
1.4 percent on the day. The dollar had hit a four-month low of
76.70 yen on Friday on trading platform EBS, bringing it
closer to a record low of 76.25 yen struck in March.	
 The yen came under broad pressure as a rally in U.S. stock
futures   and Asian shares supported
risk appetite, with the euro rising 1.3 percent against the yen
to 111.86 yen , and the Australian dollar climbing
about 1 percent versus the Japanese currency to 85.93 yen
.	
 In his announcement, Obama said the deal struck between
Democrats and Republican leaders would cut fiscal spending by
about $1 trillion over 10 years. 
 The dollar rose to as high as 0.7954 Swiss francs after
Obama's announcement, climbing more than 1 percent on the day.
It was last up 1 percent at 0.7935 francs , having
rebounded from a record low near 0.7850 struck on Friday.	
 The New Zealand dollar hit a post-float high of $0.8842
. It last stood at $0.8835, for a gain of 0.4 percent
from late U.S. trade on Friday.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Stocks rose while gold and the
yen dropped on Monday as investors cut safety trades after
Washington reached a last-minute deal to escape default, though
the top U.S. credit rating could still be downgraded.	
 After a tense weekend in which rival plans to lift the U.S.
borrowing limit were shot down in Congress, U.S. President
Barack Obama said leaders from both parties reached a deal to
cut the budget deficit by $1 trillion over 10 years, with
additional savings of $1.4 trillion possible. 
 U.S. S&P 500 stock futures bounced 1.5 percent  in a
relief rally that is expected to spill over into European
markets. 
 High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and
emerging Asian units strengthened, while U.S. Treasuries --
which have maintained their haven status despite being at the
centre of the debt ceiling impasse -- slid . 
 Investors were still on guard, though, since the plan, which
will likely come to a vote in Congress on Monday, may not
satisfy Standard & Poor's enough to keep the U.S. triple-A debt
rating and also begs the question of how the U.S. government
will meet its obligations over the long term.	
 ""For the rally to be durable, markets will need more than
this downpayment agreement,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief
investment officer of PIMCO in Newport Beach, California. 
 ""They will look to a more coherent fiscal reform to emerge
from the second step and, more generally, for additional
measures to remove structural impediments to growth and jobs.
Markets will also be asking whether this two-step agreement is
sufficient to remove the threat of an S&P downgrade."" 
 
 
 RELIEF OVER THE U.S. DEAL	
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.3 percent ,
inching back toward a four-month high hit in early July, as
investors bought back technology-related shares and the weaker
yen invited buyers to dive back into major exporters.	
 ""Obama's remarks may be enough for the Nikkei to regain the
last three days of losses, but today's gains will likely reflect
temporary relief, not solid confidence that all the negative
elements in the U.S. economy have been priced in,"" said Tsuyoshi
Kawata, a senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1.7 percent after falling for the past two
sessions, with gains spread out fairly evenly among the sectors
with the defensive utilities segment underperforming. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1.4 percent , led by a
1.5 percent rise in HSBC after Europe's largest bank
said it would sell nearly half of its underperforming U.S.
branch network. 
 The U.S. dollar index , which measures its value
against a basket of six other major currencies, was largely
unchanged on the day.	
 The euro weighs heavily in the basket, and so the index
reflects deep-seated fears about the fiscal unsustainability for
both the United States and the euro zone.	
 ""Avoiding default by the U.S. government is of paramount
importance, but investors also need to see a clear path toward
deficit reduction that encourages confidence in the U.S. dollar.
This is essential if we are to maintain America's AAA rating and
encourage long-term investment in the U.S,"" said U.S. fund
manager BlackRock Inc, which oversees $3.6 trillion in assets,
in a statement. 
 The dollar shot up against the yen, hitting 78.00 yen before
easing back to 77.63 yen, up 0.3 percent on the day .
Traders in Asia had been keeping a close eye on the yen, since
the dollar dropped below 77 yen to a four-month low of 76.70 yen
on Friday, raising fears of yen-selling intervention by Japanese
authorities. 
 
 ANXIETY OVER THE EURO ZONE	
 U.S. Treasury debt futures fell in electronic trading. The
10-year Treasury futures  were down 8.5/32 to 125 13.5/32,
and in the cash market, the benchmark 10-year yield rose five
basis points from late Friday in New York to 2.84 percent
. 
 Oil futures also rose along with other risky assets. U.S.
crude futures for September  were up $1.16 at $96.86 a
barrel, while Brent crude  gained $1.30 cents to $118.04.	
 Gold prices fell 0.8 percent to $1,611.89 an ounce, down
from a record high of $1,632.30 reached on Friday. 
 Many investors believe the market focus will shift to the
likelihood of a rating downgrade as well as to the structural
debt problems afflicting the euro zone. 
 Throughout last week's increasingly intense showdown in
Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling, the spreads of Italian
and Spanish bond yields over Germany have been widening sharply,
signifying persistent unease that Greece's problem may spread to
other European countries. 
 ""Don't forget there's Europe in the background with problems
in Italy and Spain,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities
analyst at ANZ. ""There is still heightened risk aversion in the
market and gold will probably be volatile in the next few days.""

 By David Gaffen
 NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures jumped and
the dollar rebounded in a sign of relief that U.S. lawmakers
were moving closer on Sunday to a deal that would allow the
country to continue to borrow money and head off a devastating
short-term default.
 The Swiss franc, the favored safety currency during this
crisis, pulled back from record highs against the dollar, and
gold slipped from all-time peaks.
 Markets were moving in anticipation of good news. The S&P
500 futures  bounced 15.5 points, or 1.2 percent, to
1,303.90. Gold , which has reached new heights during the
stalemate, lost $13.10 to $1,613.49 an ounce.
 ""At this point, the markets are perceiving that a deal and
a vote will be announced,"" said Quincy Krosby, market
strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
 With two days remaining until the United States exhausts
its ability to borrow money, legislators said a deal was
becoming more likely, but they had some way to go before
reaching agreement. For details, see [ID:nN1E76U08I]
 Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid had hoped to hold a
Senate vote on Sunday night on a deal to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling but a senior congressional aide told Reuters a vote was
""highly unlikely"" until Monday.
 U.S. Treasury debt futures fell slightly in electronic
trading. The 10-year Treasury futures  were down 4/32 to
125 18/32.
 Oil futures also rose. U.S. crude  rose $1.01 to
$96.71 a barrel, while Brent crude  gained 76 cents to
$117.50.
 The S&P 500 fell every day last week, losing 3.9 percent.
The CBOE Market Volatility Index <.VIX>, a gauge of investor
fear, jumped as much as 9 percent on Friday to its highest
level since mid-March before paring its rise.
 Even if U.S. lawmakers agree on a last-minute debt limit
deal, many investors believe that would not prevent credit
ratings agencies from downgrading the United States' triple-A
ratings.
 ""Even if the debt ceiling is raised, all of the heavy
lifting will be in front of us,"" said Peter Kenny, managing
director in institutional sales at Knight Capital Group in
Jersey City, New Jersey.
 ""I think it's an almost foregone conclusion that there is
going to be a downgrade at some point."" 
 The dollar rebounded against the Swiss franc to 0.7909. On
Friday, the U.S. currency hit an all-time low at 0.7853

 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - World stocks suffered their
biggest weekly loss in almost a year on Friday as investors
piled into safe-haven assets on worries about sovereign debt
crises on both sides of the Atlantic and data showing meager
growth in the U.S. economy.
 The Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven currency, rose to
record highs against both the dollar and the euro, and gold
soared to a record high above $1,630 per ounce.
 With four days remaining until the United States hits its
debt limit, President Barack Obama on Friday told deeply
divided Republicans and Democrats to find a way ""out of this
mess."" For details, see [ID:nN1E76S004]
 Fears that Europe's debt crisis was spreading grew after
Moody's Investors Service threatened to downgrade Spain's
credit rating. [ID:nN1E76S004]
 Adding to investor gloom, the government reported the U.S.
economy grew at a meager 1.3 percent annual rate in the second
quarter as consumer spending barely rose. The government also
said the economy came perilously close to flat-lining in the
first quarter, a sharp downward revision from its previous
estimate. [ID:nCAT005481]
 ""It's frustrating for investors and for U.S. citizens to
see this unfold in the way it has been,"" said Natalie Trunow,
chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment
Management in Bethesda, Maryland.
 ""From an overall asset allocation standpoint, in an
environment like this, you get bigger moves into cash and safe
havens.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 96.87
points, or 0.79 percent, at 12,143.24. The Standard & Poor's

 The dollar plunged to an all-time low against the Swiss
franc at 0.7853 . It also hit a four-month trough
against the yen of 76.85 on trading platform EBS ,
edging close to a record low of 76.25, and heightening worries
that Japanese authorities may step in to stem currency
strength.
 The dollar was on track for a monthly loss of about 4.5
percent against the yen, the biggest since December 2008. It
shed about 6.4 percent against the Swiss franc in July -- the
worst monthly performance since December 2010.
 Japan Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned about the
strong yen, saying he would consider how long Japan could
ignore current exchange rate moves without acting.
[ID:nT9E7IE01O]
 The euro  last traded at $1.4376, up 0.4 percent
after Moody's placed Spain's Aa2 credit rating on review for
possible downgrade. The move followed Thursday's disappointing
Italian debt auction, which saw 10-year bonds sold at the
highest yield in 11 years.
 The weak U.S. economic data raised the prospect of further
monetary accommodation, boosting demand for gold and U.S.
government debt.
 Spot gold  rose as high as $1,632.30 per ounce before
easing back to around $1,625. Ten-year Treasury notes
 were 1-11/32 higher in price, pushing yields to
2.79 percent, and 30-year bonds rose 2-10/32, with yields
easing to 4.12 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  settled down $1.74 at $95.70 a
barrel.
 Economic growth ""was much weaker than the government had
previously estimated and this opens the door for potentially
another round of quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve,""

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Lawmakers were still unable
to reach an agreement on the U.S. debt ceiling on Friday, but
there is no arguing that the dollar's safe-haven appeal should
remain trumped by the Swiss franc and Japanese yen.
 The dollar on Friday hit a record low against the Swiss
franc and a four-month trough against the yen, both traditional
safe-haven currencies, as weak data on U.S. economic growth
ignited fears the economy could slip into another recession.
 With four days left before the United States hits its debt
limit, Republicans pressed ahead with a deficit plan that
cannot pass Congress and President Barack Obama told lawmakers
to stop wasting time and find a way ""out of this mess."" For
details, see [ID:nN1E76S004]
 The U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a Republican
bill to raise the debt ceiling between 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT)
and 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT) on Friday, a Republican aide said.
[ID:nWNA5249]
 ""If the U.S. Treasury starts missing payments the FX market
will begin to freak out, volatility will spike and liquidity
will dry up,"" said Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at CitiFX, a
division of Citigroup in New York.
 If the debt ceiling is raised but the deficit reduction
measures are not big enough to avoid a ratings downgrade, this
is already priced into the market and will not necessarily
rattle the market, he said.
 ""A U.S. credit rating downgrade should lift the dollar
because people will want to cut their exposure to risk and
square their short dollar positions.""
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.78530 franc 
on trading platform EBS and was last at 0.78860, down 1.5
percent on the day. On the week, the dollar fell 2.8 percent
and in July 6.1 percent, its worst monthly showing since
December 2010.
 The euro slid to record lows against the Swiss unit as
well, to 1.12970 francs . It last traded at 1.1346
francs, down 1.2 percent. The euro fell 3.1 percent on the week
and 6.9 percent this month, its worst monthly performance since
June 2010.
 Barclays Capital said the immediate effect of a downgrade
should be supportive for the dollar.
 ""However, the fact that this is a U.S.-driven risk, the USD
will likely lag other safe-haven currencies (such as the JPY
and CHF),"" the firm said. ""Further out, we see fiscal
tightening weighing on growth and the USD weakening further, as
monetary policy is kept looser for longer than the market is
expecting.""
 Meanwhile, if the debt ceiling is raised and there is no
ratings action, the dollar should falter versus riskier
currencies such as the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand
dollars.
 The dollar was last down 1 percent against the yen at 76.94
yen , its lowest level since coordinated intervention
to weaken the Japanese currency in mid-March. The record low
for dollar/yen was 76.250.
 ""The dollar is looking less and less attractive from a
growth, fiscal and monetary perspective,"" said Kathy Lien.
director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York.
 ""The recovery has lost momentum, the U.S. is up to its neck
in debt and the Federal Reserve is considering more stimulus.""
 Government data earlier on Friday showed the U.S. economy
grew at a much weaker-than-expected rate in the second quarter.
First-quarter growth was also revised sharply lower.

 SAFE HAVENS IN VOGUE
 The dollar plunged to all-time lows against the Swiss franc
of 0.7853 . It also hit a four-month trough against
the yen of 77.01 on trading platform EBS , edging
close to a record low of 76.25, and heightening worries that
Japanese authorities may step in to stem currency strength.
 The dollar was on track for a monthly loss of about 4.2
percent against the yen, the biggest since December 2008. It
shed about 6.1 percent against the Swiss franc in July -- the
worst monthly performance since December 2010.
 Japan Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned about the
strong yen, saying he would consider how long Japan could
ignore current exchange rate moves without acting.
[ID:nT9E7IE01O]
 The euro  last traded at $1.4376, up 0.3 percent
after Moody's placed Spain's Aa2 credit rating on review for
possible downgrade. The move followed Thursday's disappointing
Italian debt auction, which saw 10-year bonds sold at the
highest yield in 11 years.
 The weak U.S. economic data raised the prospect of further
monetary accommodation, boosting demand for gold and U.S.
government debt.
 Spot gold  rose as high as $1,632.30 per ounce,
before easing back to around $1,627. Ten-year Treasury notes
 were up 31/32 in price, pushing yields to 2.84
percent, and 30-year bonds rose more than a point, with yields
easing to 4.17 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  fell $1.44 to $96.00 a barrel.
 Economic growth ""was much weaker than the government had
previously estimated and this opens the door for potentially
another round of quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve,""
said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo
Advisors in St. Louis.

 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - World stocks headed for their
biggest weekly loss in almost a year on Friday as investors
piled into safe havens on worries about sovereign debt crises
on both sides of the Atlantic and after data showed meager
growth in the U.S. economy.
 The Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven currency, rose to
record highs against both the dollar and the euro, and gold
prices soared to a record high above $1,630.
 U.S. Republican leaders scrambled on Friday to rescue their
budget deficit-cutting plan to stave off an unprecedented U.S.
default just three and a half days before an Aug. 2 deadline.
Fears the euro zone debt crisis was spreading also grew after
Moody's threatened to downgrade Spain's credit rating.
 Adding to investor gloom, the government reported the U.S.
economy grew at a meager 1.3 percent annual rate in the second
quarter as consumer spending barely rose. The government also
said the economy came perilously close to flat-lining in the
first quarter, in a sharp downward revision from its previous
estimate. For details, see [ID:nCAT005481]
 Stock markets pared some losses after President Barack
Obama said he was confident a solution could be reached on the
debt ceiling talks. Traders also cited talk of possible
amendments to the Republican version of a U.S. debt deal, which
could lead to an eventual agreement.
 ""The U.S. debt talks will remain front and center going
into the weekend, and the uncertain outcome will probably lead
to more deleveraging today, especially after weak U.S. data and
Moody's decision to put Spanish debt on negative watch,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 Wall Street stocks fell more than 1 percent before sharply
paring losses. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down
38.56 points, or 0.32 percent, at 12,201.55. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 1.31 points, or 0.10 percent,
at 1,299.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.78
points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,770.03.
 World equities as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.3 percent. The benchmark index has
fallen 2.7 percent this week, on track for its biggest weekly
loss since August 2010.
 European stocks closed out their worst week since March,
with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> finishing down
0.4 percent. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.7 percent.
 Even if U.S. lawmakers agree on a last-minute deal, many
investors believed that would not prevent ratings agencies from
downgrading the United States' credit rating.
 ""We're basically standing on the edge of an abyss, peeking
over, with the bottom nowhere to be seen. That's the situation
facing all financial markets heading into a weekend that could
prove to be one of the most crucial in history,"" said Ben
Potter, strategist at IG Markets.
 SAFE HAVENS IN FAVOR
 The euro extended gains against the dollar, while the
greenback trimmed losses versus the yen as U.S. stocks rallied
late in the morning session.
 The euro rose to session highs at $1.44140  on
trading platform EBS and last traded at $1.4387, up 0.4
percent.
 The dollar plunged to all-time lows against the Swiss franc
of 0.7853 . It also hit a four-month trough versus the

 The weak U.S. economic data boosted demand for safe-haven
U.S. debt and raised the prospect of further monetary
accommodation. Ten-year Treasury notes  were up
27/32, pushing yields to 2.86 percent, down from 2.95 percent
late on Thursday. Benchmark 30-year bonds  rose a
point, their yields easing to around 4.20.

 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - World stocks headed for their
biggest weekly loss in almost a year on Friday while the U.S.
dollar fell after efforts to stave off a U.S. debt default
suffered a new blow and data showed meager growth in the U.S.
economy.
 Investors piled into perceived safe-haven assets, pushing
the Swiss franc to record highs against both the dollar and
euro. Gold prices also rallied to a fresh record high above
$1,630.
 U.S. Republican leaders scrambled on Friday to rescue their
budget deficit-cutting plan after conservatives mounted a
rebellion that heaped uncertainty on efforts to avert a
catastrophic debt default. House Republicans were due to meet
at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) to discuss a way forward.
 Adding to investor gloom, the U.S. economy came perilously
close to flat-lining in the first quarter and grew at a meager
1.3 percent annual rate in the April-June period as consumer
spending barely rose. For details, see [ID:nCAT005481]
 ""Disappointing number, but I'm not surprised, considering
the uncertainty in the market over the debt ceiling,
regulations and so forth,"" said Matthew Keator, partner in the
Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox,
Massachusetts.
 ""Structurally, corporations are doing a good job, but on
the macro side, with all the uncertainty, it isn't surprising
that we're seeing this type of headwind.""
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was down 113.79 points, or 0.93
percent, at 12,126.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>

 World equities as measured by the MSCI world equity index

fallen more than 3 percent this week, on track for its biggest
weekly loss since August, 2010.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> lost 1.3 percent following a

 DOLLAR FALLS
 The dollar plunged to all-time lows against the Swiss franc
of 0.78749 . It also hit a four-month trough versus
the yen of 77.020 on trading platform EBS , edging
close to a record low of 76.25, and heightening worries that
Japanese authorities may step in to stem currency strength.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned about the
strong yen, saying he would consider how long Japan could

[ID:nT9E7IE01O]
 The euro  rose 0.4 percent against the dollar to
$1.4385, though it hit a record low of 1.1310 Swiss francs
.
 Fears of contagion arising from euro zone's debt crisis
grew after rating agency Moody's placed Spain's Aa2 credit
rating on review for possible downgrade. The move followed
Thursday's disappointing Italian auction which saw 10-year
bonds sold at the highest yield in 11 years.
 ""These sovereign debt problems are leading to a decent

 Ten-year Treasury notes  were up 23/32, pushing
yields to 2.87 percent, down from 2.95 percent late on
Thursday.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar plunged to
all-time lows against the Swiss franc and four-month troughs
versus the yen on Friday as data showing lackluster U.S. growth
and debt worries on both sides of the Atlantic prompted
investors to seek refuge in traditional safe havens.
 The greenback, however, gained against commodity-linked
currencies such as the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand
dollars, which typically struggle when there is heightened risk
aversion.
 Gains in the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen accelerated
after data was released showing the U.S. economy grew at a 1.3
percent annual rate in the second quarter, well below the
expected 1.8 percent pace. First-quarter growth was also
revised sharply lower, to 0.3 percent from 1.9 percent. See
[ID:nCAT005481].
 ""Today's disappointing U.S. GDP data confirms what we have
suspected for some time: the end of QE2 will do to the U.S.
economy what a lawnmower does to green shoots,"" said Douglas
Borthwick, managing director at Faros Trading in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 He was referring to the second round of 'quantitative
easing' or Treasury bond buying by the Federal Reserve to try
to stimulate the economy.
 Faros reiterated his view that with the end of quantitative
easing in June and government spending in check given the debt
negotiations, the U.S. economy could benefit from a weaker
dollar, at least until exports can recover and the U.S. fiscal
position can be put back on track.
 In early New York trading, the dollar fell to 0.78991 franc
 on trading platform EBS and was last at 0.79139, down
1.3 percent on the day.
 The euro slid to record lows against the Swiss unit as
well, to 1.13131 francs . It last traded at 1.13470
francs, down 1.2 percent.
 The dollar was down 0.7 percent against the yen at 77.200
yen , having fallen to a four-month low of 77.120.
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned about the
strong yen, saying he would consider how long Japan could
ignore current exchange rate moves without acting.
[ID:nT9E7IE01O]
 Expectations of possible intervention and position-squaring
ahead of the weekend prevented a further rise in the yen. The
record low for dollar/yen was 76.250.
 U.S. authorities appeared as far as ever from reaching a
cross-party compromise to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt
ceiling, while euro zone concerns grew on talk Greece might
miss its next loan tranche payment and a Moody's warning that
it might downgrade Spain. [ID:nL6E7IT0DR]
 A Dow Jones report that the euro zone's bailout fund may
not be in a position to lend to Greece in September also
weighed on the euro. A Eurogroup spokesman later said Greece
would get the money and the tranche would be paid from
bilateral loans rather than the EFSF. [ID:nL6E7IT0DR]
[ID:nLDE76S0VJ]
 In the United States, analysts have said that even if a
last-minute deal to lift the U.S. debt limit is struck before
the Aug. 2 deadline, a rating downgrade appears likely without
a comprehensive plan to cut the deficit. A cut would raise U.S.
borrowing costs, hurting an already weak economy, and rattle
investors.
 In the options market, dollar/yen implied volatilities
climbed. One-month vols  traded around 10.97 percent,
up from 10.10 percent on Thursday. Dollar/yen risk reversals, a
measure of the premium required to hold a put or a call option
in a currency pair, also edged out in favour of yen calls with
the one-month  at 1.9 vols versus 1.8 Thursday.

 * Dollar hits 4-month low vs safe-haven yen

 By Carolyn Cohn and Natsuko Waki	
 LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 1-1/2 week
low on Friday, on track for their biggest weekly loss since
August 2010, as a Moody's threat to downgrade Spain revived
fears the euro zone crisis is spreading, and investors eyed a
looming deadline for U.S. debt talks.	
 U.S. stock futures dropped, indicating a weaker open on Wall
Street, and the dollar hit a four-month low against the
safe-haven yen, as U.S. lawmakers made little progress in
breaking the deadlock over raising the debt ceiling and avoiding
a default.	
 An emergency meeting is scheduled for Friday to reach a deal
on raising the country's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by the Aug.
2 deadline to avoid running out of money.	
 Rating agency Moody's placed Spain's Aa2 credit rating on
review for possible downgrade, citing weak growth and funding
pressures. This followed Thursday's disappointing Italian
auction which saw 10-year bonds sold at the highest yield in 11
years.	
 Spain's prime minister Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero called
early elections for November, saying the move was to promote
stability. 
 ""These sovereign debt problems are leading to a decent
demand for safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss
franc,"" said Roberto Mialich, FX strategist at Unicredit. 
 ""How the dollar behaves in the near term will depend a lot
on ... whether the U.S. rating is cut."" 
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.5
percent. The benchmark index is down 6.5 percent since hitting a
three-year high in April and has fallen nearly 3 percent this
week.	
 Futures for the S&P 500 , for the Dow Jones  and
for the Nasdaq 100  were down 0.35 to 0.45 percent.	
 According to Thomson Reuters data, 51 percent of DJSTOXX 600
companies reporting second-quarter results have met or
beaten expectations.	
 European stocks lost 0.87 percent. A string of
disappointing corporate results in the euro zone encouraged
investors to cut back on risks ahead of the weekend.	
 Emerging stocks were down nearly 1 percent, though
analysts said flows into emerging debt have remained resilient.	
 The dollar hit a four-month low against the
safe-haven yen at 77.43 yen , approaching a record low
around 76.25, before trimming losses to 77.60. It fell 0.2
percent against the Swiss franc to 0.80 , just above
record lows.	
 The euro fell 0.57 percent to $1.4271, extending
losses as traders cited media reports saying Europe's rescue
fund may not be in a position to provide its second tranche of
loans for Greece. 
 The report is in line with what sources told Reuters earlier
this week. 
 U.S. crude oil  fell 0.25 percent. 
 Bund futures  rose 49 ticks. Spanish 10-year bond
yields were 5 basis points higher at 6.09 percent.	
 Italian 10-year yields were 8 basis points
higher at 5.92 percent, nearing the 6 pct line many see as
unsustainable in the long term.	
 In the United States, even if lawmakers agree on a
last-minute deal it was uncertain whether the country can retain
the riple-A rating that helps make U.S. debt a pillar of the
global financial system.	
 ""No one really thought we would ever get to this situation,""
Ben Potter, strategist at IG Markets, said. 
 ""We're basically standing on the edge of an abyss, peeking
over, with the bottom nowhere to be seen. That's the situation
facing all financial markets heading into a weekend that could
prove to be one of the most crucial in history.""

 * Australian dollar breaks key support levels vs yen

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - The dollar came under broad
pressure on Friday, sinking to a four-month low against the yen
while risk currencies faltered after the House of
Representatives delayed a vote on a Republican proposal to raise
the U.S. government's debt limit, adding to uncertainty ahead of
an Aug. 2 deadline.	
 The euro relinquished earlier gains and was down about 0.5
percent at a session low of $1.4265 after Moody's said it may
cut Spain's credit rating, fuelling fears about the euro zone's
debt problems and weighing further on the Australian
and New Zealand dollars .	
 Urgent efforts to avoid an unprecedented U.S. debt default
hit another snag when conservative rebel Republican lawmakers
refused to back a budget deficit plan proposed by their own
leaders, who put off a vote scheduled for Thursday night.

 ""People got scared and they're selling the dollar ... its
fall below 77.00 yen would pave the way to the record low of
76.25, heightening the possibility of the Bank of Japan stepping
in with solo intervention,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank
who did not want to be identified by name.	
 Before the dollar's fall to a fresh four-month low of 77.45
yen , Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda issued a strong
warning against the yen's strength, saying he would carefully
consider how long Tokyo could ignore current exchange-rate moves
without acting. 
 The fear of intervention and position tweaking ahead of the
weekend prevented players from offloading the dollar further, as
it found support having breached an option barrier reported to
stand at 77.50 yen, with traders pointing to semi-official bids.	
 ""This is a very serious situation. As long as the wrangling
over the U.S. debt ceiling continues, the dollar/yen will be
vulnerable to further falls,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief forex
strategist at Citibank in Tokyo.	
 The dollar remained in a precarious position with traders
talking about stop-loss orders lined up below the 77.50 level.
They also feared that a sharp fall in the dollar would trigger
heavy selling by Japanese margin traders who hold near-record
high dollar-long positions, aggravating its
decline. 
 Even with a deal to lift the debt limit, a downgrade of the
U.S. credit rating appears likely unless a big dent is made in
the deficit. A downgrade would raise U.S. borrowing costs,
hurting an already weak economy, and rattle global investors. 


 
 EURO DOWN ON SPAIN	
 Moody's placed Spain's AA2 credit rating under review for a
possible downgrade, citing funding pressures and the precedent
set by the euro zone's debt package for Greece. The euro's
decline brought some respite to the battered dollar, especially
against the yen and the Swiss franc .	
 The euro zone debt worries flared up on Thursday after Italy
sold 10-year bonds at the highest yields in 11 years and data
showed euro zone economic sentiment worsened more than expected
in June. 
 The euro's earlier bounce was supported by comments by the
French and German finance ministers in the Financial Times on
Friday, saying that dealing with the risks posed by Greece's
debt was crucial to preventing contagion to the rest of the euro
zone. 
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.4286.	
 With sentiment souring toward risk on the euro zone and U.S.
debt woes, the recently outperforming Aussie and New Zealand
dollars fell prey to profit-taking.	
 Both currencies, which this week hit multiyear highs,
hovered around session lows with the Aussie trading down 0.5
percent at $1.0947 and the kiwi 0.6 percent lower at $0.8654.	
 The Aussie sank back below key resistance levels at its
100-, 55- and 21-day moving averages with more downside pressure
expected by analysts.	
 Against the Swiss franc , the U.S. dollar hovered
above an all-time low of 0.7990 franc, last trading down 0.1
percent at 0.8005 franc.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 29 (Reuters) - Asian equities slipped on
Friday as investors braced for more volatility after lawmakers
failed to make progress in breaking a deadlock over raising the
debt ceiling and avoiding a default.	
 The euro tumbled after Moody's rating agency said it placed
Spain's ""AA2"" credit rating on review for possible downgrade,
aggravating euro debt worries especially after Italy sold
10-year bonds at the highest yields in 11 years on Thursday. 
 Urgent efforts to avoid an unprecedented debt default hit
yet another snag when some rebel Republican lawmakers refused to
back a budget deficit plan proposed by their own congressional
leaders, who put off a vote scheduled for Thursday night.

 U.S. stock futures  which fell as much as one percent
after the news, recovered somewhat to be down as much as 0.6
percent on the day, pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street.	
 Leading European indexes are expected to fall in opening
trades, with financial spreadbetters expecting major markets to
open between 1.2 to 1.4 percent lower. 
 The euro last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.4286, close to
an intraday low of $1.4281. The dollar fell to a four-month low
of 77.50 versus the Japanese yen. 
 In a sign that investors are reducing bets before the
weekend, commodity currencies like the Australian dollar
which have been an investor favorite in this volatile period
fell back from a 29-year high of 1.1080 hit earlier this week. 
 While investors believe that a ratings downgrade is unlikely
to lead to a stampede out of U.S. bonds -- given their dominance
in the world of high-grade debt -- markets may be in for a
choppy ride as money managers assess the impact of such a move
on their portfolios.	
 Erik Ristuben, chief investment officer for client
investment strategies with Russell Investments said in a call
that a U.S. downgrade would ""bring an emotional response"" in
equity markets and the 10-year Treasury yield could rise as much
as 50 basis points but then come back down over time.	
 Given the paucity of enough high quality assets in other
countries, there would not be a full-fledged flight out of U.S.
Treasuries, Ristuben, who helps handle over $163 billion in
assets said.	
 For now, equities buckled under some broad profit-taking. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
extended losses to nearly 1 percent after the
announcement, from a drop of 0.2 percent earlier. For the week
it is down about 1.5 percent.	
 Even Indonesia and Taiwan -- some markets within the region
which have held up relatively better than its peers so far this
year -- led declines with losses of a percent each.	
 
 MAKE LEHMAN LOOK LIKE A TEA PARTY 
 Strategists like John Woods, chief investment strategist at
Citi Private bank echo the broad consensus view that a last
minute deal will be reached to avert the U.S. debt default with
an insufficient long-term plan the most likely solution. 
 ""But should a default occur, it will make Lehman look like a
tea party,"" Woods told Reuters Television referring to the
aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers which sent global
financial markets in a tailspin. 
 Despite worries about a looming U.S. default, Treasuries
benefited from the spike in worries about euro zone assets, with
yields on ten-year notes stabilising at 2.95
percent, below this week's high of around 3 percent.	
 Gold consolidated gains after rising by about 10
percent this month to a record near $1,630 per ounce on
Wednesday.	
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings rose 1.5 percent to 1262.98
tonnes by July 28, from 1244.80 tonnes on July 27. 
 U.S. crude oil futures  eased to $97.10 a barrel,
while Brent crude futures  were little changed around
$117.50.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks turned lower and
bond prices rose on safe-haven demand on Thursday as investors
expressed skepticism that a key vote in Congress would lead to
a deal to avoid a U.S. default. [ID:nN1E76R1TY]
 A rally on Wall Street driven by surprisingly strong
economic data faded late in the session as buyers kept to the
sidelines while lawmakers in Washington tried to hash out an

 The vote was scheduled for after the markets' close.
 The Swiss franc had risen to a record high against the
dollar of 0.79900 franc , but the dollar gained and
last traded at 0.80180, up 0.1 percent.
 ""During the course of the day, it became clear that even if

the Senate is going to reject it,"" said Quincy Krosby, market
strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Thursday as lackluster European data and a jump in Italy's
borrowing costs fueled fears the euro zone debt crisis is
spreading.
 The euro's losses, however, could prove limited if U.S.
lawmakers fail to reach a compromise on a deficit reduction
plan that would head off a default.
 A Republican deficit reduction plan headed to a close vote
in the U.S. Congress on Thursday and the White House urged
divided lawmakers to clinch a compromise to head off the risk
of a debt default by the world's largest economy.
[ID:nN1E76R004]
 The euro is one of the few currencies not benefiting from
the threat of America losing its triple-A rating as investors
become increasingly doubtful last week's second bailout for
Greece will keep the crises from spreading to Italy and Spain.
 Italy sold 10-year bonds but only at the cost of yields
soaring to their highest in 11 years while data showed euro
zone economic sentiment worsened more than expected in June.
[ID:nL6E7IS0YS] [ID:nB5E7HM00R]
 ""Additional signs that last week's (Greece) plan may not be
implemented as expected will keep alive the risk of contagion
to economies like Italy, which are in fact too big to bailout
and keep the euro pressured, even against the otherwise
struggling dollar,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 The dollar, however, remains vulnerable as each day without
a deficit reduction deal means an increasing risk of default or
downgrade, Esiner said.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.4
percent at $1.4302 , with little support until around
$1.41850-$1.41870, the roughly 50 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the $1.38376/$1.45370 rally this month.

the market to stem the yen's strength.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Global equities and the euro
fell on Thursday as weak euro zone data and a lackluster
Italian bond auction heightened worries about debt contagion,
but surprisingly strong economic reports buoyed U.S. markets.
 Stocks on Wall Street trended higher after data showed the
number of Americans claiming new unemployment benefits last
week dropped below the 400,000 level for the first time since
early April, a hopeful sign for an anemic U.S. economy. For

 U.S. stocks briefly added to slight gains after pending
sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly rose in June from
May. [ID:nN1E76R0JI]
 But European data showing euro zone economic sentiment
worsened more than expected to 103.2 in July from 105.4 in
June, with business optimism falling in all sectors, weighed on
negative sentiment toward the euro. [ID:nB5E7HM00R]
 The euro  fell 0.42 percent to $1.4304 while the U.S.
dollar index <.DXY>, a basket of major trading currencies, rose
0.20 percent to 74.233.
 ""The euro seems to be the flavor du jour at the moment as
the market is trading on euro zone contagion issues and the
dollar is appreciating by default,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief
currency strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
 European shares fell for a fourth straight session, hitting
a one-week low as disappointing earnings and cautious comments
from major European companies raised concerns about corporate
profits. [ID:nL6E7IS13Y]
 Chemical shares bore the brunt of a broad sell-off after
BASF  reported weaker-than-expected profits and said
global economic growth was slowing. Europe's largest
engineering conglomerate Siemens  also said risks
were increasing to the global economy. [ID:nLDE76R03Y]
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
dropped 0.2 percent to 1,086.34 points.
 A bounce-back on Wall Street came after U.S. stocks
suffered their worst day in eight weeks on Wednesday. The S&P
lost 2 percent on weak earnings, lackluster economic data and
as U.S. politicians struggle to agree over the nation's debt
ceiling days before the deadline to avoid default.
 Prices on long-dated U.S. government bonds touched session
highs in early trading with the 30-year yield briefly dipping
below 4.25 percent. [ID:nNYE003081]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
7/32 in price to yield 2.96 percent.
 Brent oil rose above $118 as a storm heading toward the
Gulf of Mexico raised the threat of supply disruption and wary
traders waited to see whether the United States could break a
political deadlock over its debt limit. [ID:nL3E7IS0O1]
 Brent  gained 70 cents to $118.13 a barrel.
 U.S. crude  was up 48 cents to $97.88.
 Spot gold prices  fell 6 cents to $1,612.90 an
ounce.

 By Nia Williams	
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday as
high borrowing costs at an Italian debt auction intensified
concerns about the euro zone debt crisis spreading, though
deadlocked U.S. debt ceiling talks limited losses versus the
dollar. 
 Italy sold 10-year bonds but only at the cost of yields
soaring to their highest in 11 years, while yields in the
secondary market jumped, increasing worries a second Greek
bailout package agreed last week may not prevent contagion to
larger euro zone economies. 
 The euro dropped to a one-week low of $1.4268 on EBS trading
platform, with traders saying losses accelerated after stop-loss
orders were triggered from $1.4320 down to $1.4280.	
 It was last down 0.65 percent on the day at $1.4272 .
Traders said bids starting from $1.4250 may help limit losses.	
 ""The market seemed to put the U.S. debt ceiling on the back
burner as attention turned to Greece again, while Italian bond
yield spreads widening was the catalyst for the more aggressive
sell-off from $1.4330/40,"" said Richard Wiltshire, chief FX
broker at ETX Capital.	
 ""People are on the defensive, reducing euro longs amassed
over the last few days of dollar selling.""	
 The Swiss franc also rose to a record high against the
dollar of 0.7990 francs as investors unnerved by debt
crises on both sides of the Atlantic scrambled for safe haven
assets. 
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to 1.1454 Swiss francs ,
bringing it closer to a record low of 1.1365 francs hit in
mid-July.	
 ""We are seeing a sell-off in Italian bonds post-auction
which is putting pressure on the euro,"" said George Saravelos,
G10 FX strategist at Deutsche Bank, who said euro/dollar was
likely to pare losses because of concerns over the U.S. debt
ceiling impasse.	
 ""There is still a lot of uncertainty over how the Greek deal
will be employed, but there are fiscal issues in both Europe and
the U.S. so we think euro/dollar will mostly be moving sideways
for the next few days.""	
 Data showing euro zone economic sentiment worsened more than
expected to 103.2 in July from 105.4 in June, with business
optimism falling in all sectors, also contributed to negative
sentiment towards the shared currency. 
 
 DEBT CEILING DEADLOCK	
 The euro also fell sharply against the safe haven yen,
falling 0.9 percent to 111.00 yen , while the dollar
dropped 0.3 percent to a session low of 77.627 yen on
EBS, near a four-month low of 77.57 yen hit on Wednesday.	
 That was not far from a record low of 76.25 yen struck in
March, which triggered a co-ordinated intervention in the market
to stem the yen's strength.	
 The yen has climbed in recent sessions because U.S.
policymakers have so far failed to make progress in agreeing a
deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling before the Aug. 2
deadline, unnerving investors who worry the world's largest
economy could default on its debt.	
 It rallied further overnight after news reports quoted
Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano as saying currency
intervention to stem further yen strength would be quite
difficult, and the focus for Japanese policymakers would be the
U.S. deadline next week. 
 Market players have been speculating that the Bank of Japan
may intervene to curb yen strength but Yosano's comments
suggested there would be no central bank action before Aug. 2,
opening the door to further yen gains. 
 ""Euro and dollar are the two ugly currencies and nobody
really knows what to do with them. So if you want to go
defensive you buy the yen,"" said David Bloom, global head of FX
research at HSBC.	
 Analysts said the greenback would enjoy a short-covering
rally if the debt ceiling is raised in time to avert a default,
but such a bounce could prove short-lived, as the U.S. long-term
fiscal structure would remain unsustainable.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - - Mounting concerns about a U.S.
debt default dragged global stocks down to their lowest in more
than a week and drove the dollar to a record low against the
safe-haven Swiss franc on Thursday.	
 European stocks fell for the fourth straight session,
following their Asian counterparts, as sovereign debt risks
weighed on sentiment and drove investors away from riskier
assets to safer ones such as gold .	
 U.S. stock futures <.SPc1>,  showed Wall Street was
set for a firm start, but that was after they suffered their
worst day in eight weeks on Wednesday.	
 Stalemate in Washington over lifting the debt ceiling is
increasing the possibility of a U.S. credit rating downgrade and
has raised the prospect that the government of the world's
leading economy will run out of money to pay its bills.	
 ""The problem is that the whole thing has been a wake-up call
for the market, a real black swan: we're now starting to price
in a default risk for the world's biggest economy, which was
inconceivable just a few months back,"" said David Thebault, head
of quantitative sales trading at Paris-based broker Global
Equities.	
 European stocks were also hurt by a raft of mixed
earnings reports which sparked worries about company profits.
Investors were particularly rattled by comments from chemicals
major BASF , which said it saw global growth slowing
as it posted weaker-than-expected earnings, sending its stock
down 4.9 percent.	
 Swiss lender Credit Suisse was also down 2.6
percent after it posted lower-than-expected quarterly net
profit, hit by weak trading activity, and said it would cut
about 2,000 jobs.	
 World shares as measured by MSCI were down
0.5 percent, having fallen to its lowest since July 19 earlier
in the session.	
 The U.S. dollar hit a record low of 0.7990 francs against
the Swiss franc with investors increasingly downbeat
about its prospects on concerns that deficit reduction proposals
being discussed in Washington may fall short of the budget cuts
necessary to avert a U.S. debt downgrade.	
 
EUROPEAN WORRIES 
The political brinksmanship in Washington has not pulled
traders' attention away from the euro zone, where Italian and
Spanish bond yields kept widening over their German counterparts
after Italy paid a high price at a debt auction.	
 ""There is still a lot of uncertainty over how the Greek deal
will be employed, but there are fiscal issues in both Europe and
the U.S. so we think euro/dollar will mostly be moving sideways
for the next few days,"" said George Saravelos, G10 FX strategist
at Deutsche Bank.	
 The euro was down 0.6 percent at $1.4285 and lost 0.7
percent against the Swiss franc at 1.1433 francs, not
far from a record low of 1.1365 francs hit in mid-July. The euro
shed nearly 1 percent against the Japanese yen--the
other currency perceived as safe-haven among investors.	
 Japanese fund managers have slashed their euro zone bond
weighting to a record low and cut their U.S. bond allocations,
while raising their Japanese bond weighting to a fresh all-time
high, a Reuters poll showed. 
 U.S. 10-year Treasuries edged higher,
stabilising after falling overnight on a less-than-stellar
auction of new five-year bonds. The 10-year yield was at 2.97
percent, a basis point below where it finished last night in New
York.	
 With a ratings downgrade possible at any time, investors
also kept a wary eye on U.S. credit default swap rates. The
one-year CDS blew out to a record 85 basis points, pushing out
the difference over five-year CDS to more than 20 basis points. 
Gold prices were firm near record highs as investors
sought hard assets to hedge against risks. Gold was up 0.3
percent at $1,617.19 an ounce , having hit an all-time
high of $1,628 on Wednesday.	
 Brent crude  was also higher at $118.08 a barrel as a
storm heading towards the Gulf of Mexico raised the threat of
supply disruption.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, July 28 (Reuters) - The euro struggled to
find fans in Asia on Thursday, due to renewed fears of contagion
in Europe, while the U.S. dollar remained on the defensive as
Washington showed no signs of progress in getting a debt
agreement. 
 The dollar and the euro both sagged against the yen after
Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano was quoted by Jiji news
agency as saying currency intervention as big as 1 trillion to 2
trillion yen ($13 billion-$26 billion) would be quite difficult.	
 Yosano also said the focus for Japanese policymakers would
be the Aug. 2 deadline to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, Jiji
reported, citing the governor of Aichi Prefecture in central
Japan. 
 The impact from the comments attributed to Yosano was
limited, however, especially since Finance Minister Yoshihiko
Noda is the minister in charge of currency intervention, and not
Yosano. Noda reiterated on Thursday that he was closely watching
moves in the foreign exchange market. 
 The dollar eased 0.2 percent to 77.80 yen ,
hovering near a four-month low of 77.57 yen hit on
Wednesday on trading platform EBS, not far from a record low of
76.25 yen struck in March.	
 Traders say a decisive drop below an option barrier at 77.50
yen could accelerate the dollar's drop against the yen, with
stop-loss orders said to be lurking below that level.	
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent against the dollar to
$1.4358 and fell 0.3 percent versus the yen to 111.71 yen
.	
 Against the dollar, the euro has support at its 100-day
moving average near $1.4328, its 55-day moving average around
$1.4311, as well as its July 14 intraday high of $1.4282.	
 Weighing on the euro were contrasting statements by euro
zone leaders which highlighted the fragility of last week's deal
to rescue Greece, as well as Wednesday's rise in Italian
government bond yields ahead of an auction on Thursday.

 ""If Italian 10-year government bond yields break above their
previous peak and keep rising after climbing above 6 percent,
that would be a cause for significant concern,"" said Junya
Tanase, chief FX strategist for JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.1504 after having fallen 0.9 percent on Wednesday,
bringing it closer to a record low of 1.1365 franc hit in
mid-July on trading platform EBS.	
 The euro extended its drop against the Australian dollar,
and hit a six-month low around A$1.2970 at one point.
Euro/Aussie last stood at A$1.2986, down 0.3 percent and adding
to its roughly 1.7 percent drop on Wednesday.	
 
 DOLLAR SEEN ON DEFENSIVE	
 The U.S. dollar was seen likely to remain on the defensive
against safe-haven currencies as the prospect of a U.S.
downgrade is becoming real. Washington lawmakers were showing no
progress on raising the nation's debt ceiling ahead of the Aug.
2 deadline.	
 ""The dollar is weakening against the yen and Swiss franc and
that will likely continue until we get some sort of resolution,""
said Gareth Berry, analyst for UBS Investment Bank in Singapore.	
 Analysts said the dollar's outlook remained downbeat. Market
players are worried that the deficit reduction proposals being
discussed in Congress may fall short of the budget cuts
necessary to avert a U.S. debt downgrade by ratings agencies.

 The dollar is likely to enjoy a short-covering rally if the
debt ceiling is raised in time to avert a default, but such a
bounce could prove short-lived, said Sacha Tihanyi, senior
currency strategist for Scotia Capital in Hong Kong.	
 ""I believe that a debt ceiling decision will happen, but it
is unlikely that the long term fiscal structure will be changed
enough to completely remove the risk of a downgrade,"" Tihanyi
said.	
 ""The dollar short-covering would only be in the immediate
vicinity of an agreement, after which I'd expect the bearish...
fundamental picture to reestablish itself,"" Tihanyi added.	
 The dollar held steady against the Swiss franc at 0.8013
, stuck near a record low of 0.7996 hit on Wednesday.	
 The New Zealand dollar edged up to $0.8735 earlier after the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand flagged a rate hike as early as
September, nearing a 30-year peak of $0.8766 hit on Wednesday.

 After trimming some gains, the kiwi stood at
$0.8723 , up 0.1 percent on the day.

(Updates prices throughout)	
 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, July 28 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid more than 1
percent in thin volume on Thursday as investors trimmed
positions with just three trading days to go before a deadline
to lift the U.S. debt ceiling, while the Australian dollar
showed resilience in the face of global sovereign risks.	
 European stock futures  fell 1 percent in early
trade, echoing losses in Asia and on Wall Street overnight.	
 The increasing possibility of a U.S. credit rating downgrade
-- with Washington still in a stalemate over government spending
-- is weighing on equity markets globally, though there have
been no signs of panic selling.	
 The S&P 500 index finished down 2 percent on Wednesday
, while the futures were up a touch on Thursday .

 Fears of a U.S. debt default or downgrade and Europe's own
sovereign borrowing crisis have overshadowed most other risks,
just as the corporate results season gets going in Asia. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average was down 1.5 percent .
Clothing chain company Fast Retailing , whose stock hit
a 13-month high on Wednesday, was off 2.3 percent and led the
Nikkei lower.	
 Hitachi Construction Machinery , a subsidiary of
Hitachi Ltd , Japan's largest industrial electronics
company, saw its shares jump 4.6 percent after posting a 65
percent annual rise in April-June net profits.	
 Japan's biggest consumer electronics makers are expected to
show quarterly earnings slumped due to the March earthquake, but
investors will focus on whether these companies can meet their
forecasts for a swift recovery, given a fragile global economy.

 ""Buying on dips in companies with good earnings may
continue, but exporters may not fare well for the time being as
long as there are concerns about the U.S. economy,"" said
Hideyuki Okoshi, general manager at Chibagin Securities in
Tokyo.	
 Analysts in Asia Pacific have cut their estimates for
September quarter earnings across sectors by an average 0.6
percent, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine's SmartEstimates,
which give a greater weighting to more accurate forecasters.	
 Of these estimates, average downgrades were 4.9 percent for
technology firms and 1.4 percent for industrial companies.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
was down 1 percent, with technology,
commodity-related and consumer shares the biggest drags. 
 The index is up 1 percent so far in July compared with a 0.9
percent fall in the MSCI all-country world index
and a 1.2 percent decline in the S&P 500.	
 
 ASIA'S GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY?	
 However, the outlook for Asian earnings is still brighter
than elsewhere globally.	
 Companies in emerging Asia Pacific are expected to generate
earnings growth of 18.8 percent next year, exceeding the
estimate of 15.8 percent for global emerging markets and 16.8
percent for the world in aggregate, according to Starmine.	
 However, valuations in some Asian markets do not reflect
that premium. For example, Chinese companies are expected to
post earnings growth of 20 percent next year, but are trading at
11.8 times 12-month forecast earnings, in line with the global
average.	
 ""Investors are now torn between the fear and danger of a
U.S. default, even though most pundits still maintain that this
will be avoided, and the potential of a golden opportunity to
strike and pick up some stocks at bargain prices,"" said Ben Le
Brun, CMC Markets analyst in Sydney. 
 The Australian dollar has been an attraction for investors
in currency markets looking for opportunities in the midst of
debt crises in the United States and the euro zone.	
 The currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.1050 , not far
from a post-float high of $1.1081 on Wednesday after Australian
inflation data. 
 Having stayed above $1.10 even after the S&P 500 fell 2
percent, the Australian dollar may be forming a base from which
it will gradually head higher, analysts said. 
 Of course, flows into Asia Pacific have reversed quite
quickly in the past.	
 Three years ago as the global financial crisis was coming to
a boil, the Australian dollar made a post-float high at $0.9851,
with the market convinced that Australia was insulated from the
West's sub-prime mortgage fallout. Three months later the
currency had dropped to a low of $0.6007.	
 
 REDUCING EUROPE EXPOSURE	
 The euro was flat on the day at $1.4370 , still well
off its July low around $1.3835.	
 The deadlock in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling has
not pulled traders' attention away completely from the euro
zone, where Italian and Spanish bond yields keep rising relative
to German bonds and calm after a second bailout for Greece has
evaporated. 
 Japanese fund managers slashed their euro-zone bond
weighting to a record low and cut their U.S. bond allocation,
while raising their Japanese bond weighting to a fresh all-time
high, a Reuters poll showed. 
 After falling overnight on a less-than-stellar auction of
new 5-year bonds, U.S. Treasuries stabilised. The benchmark
10-year yield was at 2.97 percent , a basis point
above where it finished last night in New York.	
 Focus in credit markets would likely be on U.S. credit
default swap rates with a ratings downgrade possible at any
time. The 1-year CDS blew out to a record 85 basis points
overnight, pushing out the difference over the 5-year CDS to
more than 20 basis points.	
 Gold has also been a big winner as investors seek out hard
assets to hedge against risks. Gold rose 0.1 percent to
$1,615.04 an ounce after hitting an all-time high of
$1,628 on Wednesday.	
 U.S. oil futures were down 15 cents to $97.25 a barrel
, down a second day after hitting a one-month high. Brent
futures were up 30 cents to $117.73 a barrel .

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered their
worst day in eight weeks on Wednesday as lackluster earnings
and weak economic data hit investors already nervous about
faltering debt talks in Washington, while the U.S. dollar
rebounded following a sell-off this week.
 Despite heightened anxiety about a possible U.S. default,
the Treasury managed to sell $12 billion of 5-day cash
management bills and $35 billion of five-year notes on
Wednesday, suggesting investors are still willing to lend to
the U.S. government.
 A rallying dollar partly contributed to a pullback in gold
prices, which earlier soared to record highs for the sixth time
in two weeks. Analysts said the metal, which is up about 9
percent in July, could pull back sharply if a debt deal dampens
market fears.
 Republicans and Democrats rushed to rework rival plans for
deficit reduction, but with the fate of both proposals heavily
in doubt, top lawmakers pursued a behind-the-scenes compromise
to avert a crippling U.S. debt default.
 ""That is going to remain front and center in terms of
driving market activity,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ""Without
a deal and the clock winding down, I think investors' anxiety
is only going to increase.""
 If the two sides fail to break the stalemate, the United
States would not be able to borrow more money after Aug. 2 and
could run out of cash to pay all of its bills. The cost of
insuring U.S. government debt against a default within a year
rose to a record high. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]

 DOLLAR REBOUND
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading
7/32 lower in price to yield 2.98 percent.
 Prices came under mild selling pressure after the sale of
five-year notes, with foreign demand hitting a five-month low.
But the rising domestic participation suggests some investors,
at least, see no alternative to U.S. government bonds even in
the face of a default or possible ratings downgrade.
 ""Not a great auction, but not terrible. If they want a
grade to it, I would give it a B-minus or so,"" said Bret
Barker, portfolio manager at TCW in Los Angeles, with $65
billion in fixed income assets under management.
 The U.S. currency fell early to an all-time low against the
Swiss franc at 0.7996 . It also hit a four-month
trough of 77.57 yen , approaching a record low of
76.25 set in March, raising concerns Japanese authorities may
intervene to stem the yen's strength.
 But the dollar later rebounded and rallied against the euro
as investors booked profits on bets against the greenback.
 The dollar remained vulnerable, however, as most market
participants believed the deficit reduction proposals fall
short of the required cuts necessary to avert a downgrade.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the United States will
probably lose its top-notch AAA credit rating from at least one
major rating agency, believing the wrangling over the debt
ceiling has already damaged the economy. [ID:nN1E76P12Q]
 The euro, which often weakens on rising risk aversion, last
traded at $1.4367 , down 1 percent. Against a basket of
currencies, the dollar index <.DXY> fell as low as 73.421, a
2-1/2 month low, before bouncing back to last trade at 74.126.
 Spot gold  rose as high as $1,628 an ounce before
easing to near $1,613.
 U.S. crude  fell $2.19 to settle at $97.40 a barrel
after data showed the first release of crude from the U.S.
petroleum reserve unexpectedly pushed up domestic inventories
last week.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell sharply on
Wednesday as lackluster earnings and weak economic data hit
investors already nervous about faltering debt talks in
Washington, while the U.S. dollar rebounded following a
sell-off this week.
 Despite heightened anxiety about a possible U.S. default,
the Treasury managed to sell $12 billion of 5-day cash
management bills and $35 billion of five-year notes on
Wednesday, suggesting investors are still willing to lend to
the U.S. government.
 Republicans and Democrats rushed to rework rival plans for
deficit reduction, but with the fate of both proposals heavily
in doubt top lawmakers pursued a behind-the-scenes compromise
to avert a crippling U.S. debt default.
 If the two sides fail to break the stalemate, the United
States would not be able to borrow more money after Aug. 2 and
could run out of cash to pay all of its bills. The cost of
insuring U.S. government debt against a default within a year
rose to a record high. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]
 ""That is going to remain front and center in terms of
driving market activity,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ""Without
a deal and the clock winding down, I think investors' anxiety
is only going to increase.""
 Wall Street stocks fell, after a profit warning from
Juniper Networks  and moderating order growth at
Emerson Electric Co  compounded investors' concerns
about corporate strength after some high profile earnings
misses.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 157.80
points, or 1.26 percent, at 12,343.50. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 22.97 points, or 1.72 percent, at
1,308.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 66.79
points, or 2.35 percent, at 2,773.17.
 Further pressuring the market, new orders for long-lasting
U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in June, and a gauge

 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Major global stock markets
fell sharply on Wednesday on concerns about continued impasse
in Washington over U.S. debt, while the U.S. dollar rebounded
following a sell-off this week.
 Gold fell after earlier hitting record highs for the sixth
time in two weeks. The metal is up 8 percent in July as debt
troubles in both the United States and euro zone has fueled
safe-haven buying.
 A Republican plan to cut the U.S. deficit faced delay and
stiff opposition, raising the risk of default and a ratings
downgrade as the clock ticks toward a deadline less than a week
away. The cost of insuring U.S. government debt against a
default within a year rose to a record high. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]
 Wall Street stocks skidded as troubling signs from U.S.
corporations and weaker-than-expected U.S. durable goods data
further discouraged investors already nervous about faltering
debt talks in Washington.
 ""We haven't been committing new capital. We've been holding
off on making any purchases over the last few days,"" said Eric
Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment
Management Corp in Chicago. ""If you multiply us by the other

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell
for a third straight day on Wednesday and gold soared to
another record high as investors shed riskier assets and sought
safety on growing fears of a possible U.S. debt default.
 The U.S. dollar fell to a fresh all-time low against the
Swiss franc and a four-month trough against the Japanese yen as
investors moved out of dollar assets.

 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down half a percent.
 SAFE HAVENS SHINE
 The debt impasse drove investors to seek safe havens for
their money, most noticeably gold and the Swiss franc.
 Gold prices hit record highs for the sixth time in two
weeks and silver and palladium rallied. Spot gold  rose
as high as $1,628, before easing to around $1,625.
 ""If there isn't a last minute compromise (in the U.S. debt
talks) then the situation will get more and more critical. Gold
is one of the alternatives to U.S. Treasuries and therefore
there is further upside potential,"" said Peter Fertig, a metals
consultant at Quantitative Commodity Research.
 The dollar hit a fresh record low of 0.7996 Swiss franc

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed from
record lows against the Swiss franc and three-week troughs
versus the euro on Wednesday as investors trimmed bearish bets
on the greenback given no fresh news on negotiations to raise
the U.S. debt ceiling.
 Analysts though expected the dollar's rally to be
short-lived as its outlook remained downbeat whether or not the
U.S. government's borrowing limit is increased. Most market
participants believed the deficit reduction proposals being
discussed in Congress fall short of the required budget cuts
necessary to avert a U.S. debt downgrade by ratings agencies.
 ""We're still waiting to see what's going to happen in the
U.S. debt situation, but we didn't really get any new news on
the debt negotiations,"" said Steven Butler, director of foreign
exchange trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""The dollar has bounced back a little bit so we need fresh
inspiration to sell the dollar.""
 While everybody in the market expects Congress to strike a
debt agreement, a ratings downgrade seemed more than likely.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the United States will
probably lose its AAA credit rating from at least one major
rating agency and believe the wrangling over the debt ceiling
has already damaged the economy. [ID:nN1E76P12Q]
 As such, the dollar remained a sell on any rally, traders
said.
 In early New York trading, the dollar was little changed
versus the Swiss franc, after earlier hitting a fresh record
low of 0.79960  on the EBS trading platform. The
dollar has fallen roughly 4.6 percent so far in July against
the Swiss franc and was down for a sixth straight month.
 The Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven, has been the
main beneficiary of the latest dollar sell-off and traders said
the dollar could fall as low as 0.7600 franc in the near term.
Analysts said the Swiss National Bank was unlikely to enter the
market to weaken its currency despite its elevated levels.
 Gains in the dollar were also helped by the euro's losses.
 The euro came off a three-week high on concerns a new Greek
bailout plan agreed last week may not be sufficient to prevent
contagion from the debt crisis to other larger euro zone
economies. However, the single euro zone currency remained only
a cent below the early July high around $1.4577.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.44660 , having
earlier climbed to $1.45370. Traders cited offers in the
$1.45500 to $1.45800 area and bids layered into $1.44500.
 The euro's falls followed comments by German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that Berlin was against giving the
euro zone's rescue fund carte blanche to purchase bonds in the
secondary market. [ID:nB4E7IJ01H]
 The drop in the euro helped push the dollar index <.DXY>
off its lows. It was last up 0.3 percent at 73.660, off an
earlier trough at 73.421, a 2-1/2 month low.
 The yen also gained as investors sought perceived safer
alternatives to the dollar, raising concerns the Japanese
authorities may intervene to stem the yen's strength.
 The dollar fell to a four-month low of 77.570 yen ,
just shy of a reported option barrier at 77.50. It was last
down 0.1 percent at 77.80 yen. The record low in the pair was
76.250 hit in mid-March.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Tuesday his
mantra about closely watching ""one-sided"" moves, while sources
familiar with the matter said Japanese policymakers see solo
market intervention as an increasingly viable option.
[ID:nL3E7IP3V3]
 Analysts viewed intervention as unlikely given that
dollar/yen falls have been orderly but said officials were
likely to ramp up the rhetoric and fear of action may help
limit the yen's rise. Japan intervened to curb the yen in
March.
The Australian dollar, meanwhile, surged 1 percent to
US$1.1061, after earlier hitting a 29-year high of US$1.1081
, helped by strong Australian inflation data.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Gold soared to a record high for
the sixth time in two weeks on Wednesday and the dollar slumped
to another record low against the Swiss franc as investors
sought safety from a possible U.S. debt default.	
 Equities were weaker globally, particularly in Europe and
Japan. Wall Street looked set to open flat to lower.	
 The cost of insuring U.S. debt against a default in the next
year hit a new all-time high.	
 Bitterly partisan wrangling in Washington over raising the
U.S. debt limit is unnerving investors, who are facing a
scenario many thought to be inconceivable -- the United States
unable to pay its debts and being downgraded as a borrower.	
 Republican and Democratic leaders were scrambling to find
common ground over deficit cuts with less than a week before the
government hits its borrowing limit approved by Congress.	
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the United States will
probably lose its top-notch AAA credit rating from at least one
major rating agency, believing the wrangling over the debt
ceiling has already damaged the economy. 
 A Republican plan, which President Barack Obama was
threatening to veto anyway, was sent back to the drawing board
after it was found to cut less than advertised. 
 ""Our base scenario is still that some sort of eleventh hour
deal will be reached. However, there is always a risk that they
do not come to a compromise. The impact would be formidable and
the U.S. economy may not be strong enough to take this,"" said
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets in Brussels.	
 The impasse has driven investors to seek safe havens for
their money, most noticeably gold and the Swiss franc.	
 Spot gold rose as high as $1,625.24, before easing to
around $1,619.	
 The dollar, meanwhile, fell to a fresh record low versus the
Swiss franc , with the U.S. currency under broad pressure.	
 It hit a three-month low against a basket of major
currencies .	
 ""(Markets) still believe there will be a positive resolution
reached, but I suspect it's not going to be enough to satisfy
the ratings agencies,"" said Joseph Capurso, strategist at
Commonwealth Bank in Sydney.	
 
 SHARES FALL	
 World shares as measured by MSCI were
slightly weaker, with Europe and Japan providing most of the
losses.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.4 percent for a
year-to-date loss of just less than 5 percent. The region's
shares have also been hit by worries over the euro zone debt
crisis, where there are still strains despite a second Greek
bailout plan.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed down half a percent.	
 Europe's ongoing pain over the debt in its peripheral
economies was on display in bond markets.	
 Spanish and Italian government bond yields rose after German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Berlin was against a
carte blanche for the euro zone's rescue fund to purchase bonds
on the secondary market. 
 Schaeuble's remarks added to investor worries about whether
a new Greek bailout plan agreed last week would be enough to
stop the spread of contagion to bigger euro zone economies.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, July 27 (Reuters) - Gold prices hit a record high
of more than $1,625 an ounce on Wednesday and Asian stock
markets were largely flat as news out of Washington indicated
politicians were making little progress in ending a deadlock
over raising the U.S. debt ceiling.	
 Republicans had to delay bringing a plan to a vote in the
U.S. House of Representatives because it was being rewritten,
while an analyst at Standard & Poor's told CNBC that
prioritising debt payments to avoid a default would be ""deeply
disruptive"" to the economy. 
 Debt and inflation were globally the main focuses of
investors. 
 The Australian dollar jumped to a post-float high above
$1.1060 after second quarter inflation figures were higher than
forecast, squeezing investors who had recently increased bets
that the Australian central bank would cut rates this year.	
 The Australian dollar and other Asia-Pacific currencies have
been rising as traders anticipate more policymaker action to
keep quickening inflation and capital inflows at bay.	
 The threat of a U.S. default and a credit rating downgrade
loomed over equity markets and the dollar, which was sold across
the board on Tuesday, though a one-notch cut may not have a
lasting impact on markets.	
 ""The impact of a credit downgrade on the financial markets
would be negative for growth. The induced shocks to the economy
could lower next quarter's real GDP growth to close to zero.
However, a likely rebound in Q4 growth, following a resolution
of the budget debacle, could leave growth in the second half
lower by 0.6 percent,"" said Michael Carey, North American chief
economist with Credit Agricole, in a note.	
 
 DEBT POLITICS 
 The crisis over Washington's borrowing limit has not
triggered a persistent selloff in risky assets, especially since
many investors see few alternatives to the depth of the U.S.
Treasury market and contrast the political nature of the U.S.
crisis with the structural problems in the euro zone.

 Most market watchers expect some sort of last-minute deal in
Washington. But the standoff has made investors increasingly
hedge against an adverse outcome, particularly with the clock
ticking toward an Aug. 2 deadline when the U.S. Treasury said it
would not be able to borrow anymore.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.5 percent , led
by Honda Motor Co shares, which ended the day down 1.7 percent
. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
0.4 percent , though trading volume was low
throughout the region, suggesting many investors were choosing
to sit on the sidelines until the outlook becomes clearer.	
 The U.S. dollar index , which gauges its value against
a basket of six other major currencies, was largely unchanged on
the day after earlier hitting a fresh 2-1/2-month low at 73.42. 
 The dollar hit a four-month low against the yen, just below
77.70 , though the march lower has been sluggish because
of fears that Japan may step into markets unilaterally to slow
its currency's gains.	
 Japanese policymakers are becoming alarmed at persistent yen
rises and considering solo currency intervention as an
increasingly viable option for the near term, sources with
knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at
2.97 percent , up around 2 basis points from late
Tuesday in New York. The yield has darted around 3 percent for
the past week, with traders highly uncertain about the near term
outlook. 
 Shorter-term securities reflect more of the unease among
investors, with T-bills maturing in August yielding 2 to 3 basis
points more than debt coming due in September. 
 In commodity markets, gold climbed to an all-time high of
$1,625.24 an ounce , having risen more than 14 percent so
far this year, greatly exceeding the S&P 500 index's 6 percent
gain so far. 
 ""The same arguments about potential government bond fallout
are still being made,"" said a Singapore-based trader, ""but
people are on the sidelines ahead of the August deadline waiting
to see whether or not the U.S. is going to avoid a technical
default."" 
 U.S. crude oil futures  fell 19 cents to $99.40 a
barrel, while Brent crude futures  were up 10 cents at
$118.40.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly
on Tuesday as U.S. lawmakers remained deadlocked over raising
the nation's debt ceiling to avoid a devastating default, while
U.S. and European shares also declined.
 Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion
ceiling by Aug. 2, the United States faces the prospect of a
default on some of its $9.6 trillion bonds outstanding.
 President Barack Obama, in a televised address Monday
night, warned that this would be a ""reckless and irresponsible
outcome,"" but he gave no indication that a compromise was
imminent. For details, see [ID:nN1E76N0CA]
 Weakness in the greenback helped buoy crude oil prices,
while gold hovered near a record high above $1,600 an ounce as
investors sought the precious metal for safety.
 The U.S. currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
of 0.7997 franc  on trading platform EBS and fell to a
four-month trough at 77.828 yen , approaching a record
low of 76.25 set in March.
 ""The market is getting more nervous about the debt ceiling
issue,"" said You-Na Park, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt. ""If the market was really starting to price in the
possibility of a default, the dollar would be losing more than
what we saw.""
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar <.DXY> fell 0.7
percent. The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.4508 .
Investors fear a potential debt default and a downgrade of the
U.S. credit rating would tarnish the dollar's status as a
global reserve currency.
 The debt gridlock in Washington also hit U.S. stocks. The
Dow, the biggest loser, suffered additional pressure from
disappointment over quarterly earnings from 3M .
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 91.50
points, or 0.73 percent, at 12,501.30. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> lost 5.49 points, or 0.41 percent, at
1,331.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 2.84
points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,839.96.
 Just 6.46 billion shares changed hands in composite
trading, another lower-than-average day of activity.
 ""Investors are just kind of sitting on the sidelines,"" said
King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset
Management in San Francisco. ""No one wants to be short and no
one wants to be long.""
 European stocks closed down 0.3 percent at 1,100.97 points
<.FTEU3>. World stocks as measured by MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.3 percent, while emerging stocks
<.MSCIEF> gained 0.7 percent.
 Investors so far appear to have done little to prepare for
a default or a cut in the U.S. AAA credit rating. Many are
still clinging to the hope that lawmakers will eventually reach
a deal.
 It is also nearly impossible to insure against what is
considered a low-probability event, especially given the lack
of alternatives and the depth of the market, analysts said.
 The cost of insuring the United States against default
stood around 60.8 basis points , nearly half the
March 2009 peak.
 The CDS curve is nearly flat with one-year CDS
 at 61.2 basis points. This in itself reflects
investor jitters, but it is not the kind of pricing normally
seen when investors expect an imminent default.
 The United States will lose its top-notch credit rating
from at least one major rating agency, according to a Reuters
poll. [ID:nN1E76P12Q]
 TREASURY AUCTION
 Treasuries prices rose as a decline in the U.S. stock
market renewed a safe-haven bid. The benchmark 10-year note
 traded up 13/32 for a yield of 2.95 percent.
 Fears the government will soon run out of cash fueled
anxiety about appetite for this week's $99 billion of new debt
supply even after Tuesday's sale of $35 billion of two-year
notes attracted relatively solid demand.
 ""We have a lot of uncertainties with these auctions with
what's happening in Washington. People are hesitant to take on
risk,"" said Thomas Roth, executive director in U.S. government
bond trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA in New York.
 Safe-haven Bund futures  rose as buyers demanded a
high yield in debt auctions by Spain and Italy, underscoring
persistent concern about euro zone peripheral countries despite
a second bailout package for Greece last week.
 In commodities trading, U.S. crude  recouped early
losses to settle at $99.59 a barrel, up 39 cents. Spot gold
 traded around $1,619 an ounce, after hitting a record
$1,622.49 on Monday.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar skidded
broadly on Tuesday as U.S. lawmakers showed no sign of reaching
a compromise that would enable the debt ceiling to be raised,
fanning default fears and dimming the greenback's prospects.
 The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc, a
traditional safe haven, falling below a key option barrier at
0.80 franc, and dropped to a four-month trough versus the yen.
 A warning from President Barack Obama that failure to raise
the U.S. borrowing limit by the Aug. 2 deadline would severely
hurt the nation sparked selling of the dollar and tarnished its
traditional safe-haven appeal. For more see [ID:nN1E76P002].
 ""The U.S. debt ceiling impasse is killing the dollar,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New
York.
 Democrats are willing to accept a deal that does not
include tax increases but it remains to be seen whether there
will be a temporary increase in the debt ceiling or a permanent
one.
 ""Unfortunately this continued uncertainty has proven to be
extremely bearish for the U.S. dollar and until the debt
ceiling is increased, the greenback will remain under
pressure,"" Lien added.
 While the dollar has dropped smartly, it could fall even
further if the deficit reduction plan falls short and triggers
ratings changes by Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch.
 Indeed, according to a Reuters poll of economists, the U.S.
will lose its top-notch AAA credit rating from at least one
major rating agency. [ID:nN1E76P12Q] Executives at Standard and
Poor's and Moody's Investors Service are scheduled to testify
before Congress on Wednesday. [ID:nN1E76POSF]
 ""What the market is not pricing in is 'no deal'. Everyone
thinks there's going to be a deal, so I would be very careful
about selling the dollar too much,"" said Geoffrey Yu, senior
currency strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Yu added that he would still sell dollar/Swiss and
marginally sell dollar/yen, unless Japan intervenes, ""but if
things go wrong the dollar could rally on risk aversion.""
 A downgrade of the credit rating of the U.S. is a bigger
risk than a default and could add up to 0.7 percentage point to
bond yields over time, members of U.S. securities industry
group SIFMA said on Tuesday. [ID:nN1E76POHN]

 The euro  hit a session high of $1.4525. It was

 The dollar hit a record low versus the Swiss franc at
0.79970 franc  on trading platform EBS. Against the
yen, another safe-haven rival, the dollar also fell, hitting
77.828 yen , its weakest since mid-March, when major
central banks acted in concert to stem the yen's rise.
 U.S. Treasury auctions totaling $99 billion this week could
serve as an important gauge of investor demand for government
debt as the Washington stalemate persists.
 Treasury sold $35 billion worth of two-year notes Tuesday
in an auction that economists said went well.
 Against a currency basket <.DXY>, the dollar fell 0.8

 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly
on Tuesday as U.S. lawmakers remained deadlocked over raising
the nation's debt ceiling to avoid a devastating default, while
U.S. and European shares also declined.
 Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion
ceiling by Aug. 2, the United States would face the prospect of
a default on some of its $9.6 trillion bonds outstanding.
 In a televised address Monday night, President Barack Obama
warned that this would be a ""reckless and irresponsible
outcome,"" but he gave no indication that a compromise was
imminent. For more see [ID:nN1E76N0CA].
 Weakness in the greenback helped buoy crude oil prices,
while gold hovered near a record high hit the previous session
as investors looked to the precious metal for safety.
 The U.S. currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
of 0.7997 franc  on trading platform EBS and fell to a
four-month low near 77.883 yen , approaching a record
low of 76.25 set in March.
 ""The market is getting more nervous about the debt ceiling
issue,"" said You-Na Park, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt. ""If the market was really starting to price in the
possibility of a default, the dollar would be losing more than
what we saw this morning.""
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar <.DXY> fell 0.6
percent. The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.4493 .
 U.S. stocks were mostly lower, pressured by worries about
U.S. debt talks and weakness in 3M Co  and United Parcel
Service Inc , which both reported earnings.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 69.82
points, or 0.55 percent, at 12,522.98. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 3.64 points, or 0.27 percent, at
1,333.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 0.30
points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,843.10.
 European stocks fell 0.3 percent <.FTEU3> after
weaker-than-expected results from BP  and UBS .
 World stocks as measured by MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.3 percent, while emerging stocks
<.MSCIEF> rose 0.7 percent.
 Investors so far appear to have done little to prepare for
a default or a cut in the U.S. triple-A credit rating. Many are
still clinging to the hope that lawmakers will eventually reach
a deal. It is also nearly impossible to insure against what is
considered a low-probability event, especially given the lack
of alternatives and the depth of the market, analysts said.
 The cost of insuring the United States against default
stood around 59 basis points , nearly half the
March 2009 peak.
 The credit default swap curve is nearly flat with one-year
CDS  at 59.4 basis points. This in itself
reflects investor jitters, but it is not the kind of pricing
normally seen when investors expect an imminent default.
 TREASURY AUCTION
 Fears the government will run out of cash by Aug. 2 if
lawmakers do not reach agreement fueled anxiety about appetite
for this week's $99 billion of new debt supply, starting with a
$35 billion auction of two-year notes later Tuesday.
 Still, Treasuries prices rose in recent trading, as a
decline in the U.S. stock market renewed a bid for bonds and
investors dipped their toes back into bonds after recent losses
spurred by the default fears.
 ""We have a lot of uncertainties with these auctions with
what's happening in Washington. People are hesitant to take on
risk,"" said Thomas Roth, executive director in U.S. government
bond trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA in New York.
 The benchmark 10-year note  last traded up 11/32
in price for a yield of 2.96 percent.
 Bund futures  rose as Spanish and Italian
government bonds fell after concerns rose over whether a new
bailout plan for Greece would stop sovereign debt problems from
spreading to other countries.
 In the commodities market, U.S. crude  recouped early
losses to trade at $100.27 a barrel, up 1 percent on the day.
Spot gold  last traded around $1,614 an ounce.

 By Nia Williams and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Tuesday, hitting a record low against the Swiss franc as
investors fretted politicians would fail to strike a deal to
raise the U.S. debt ceiling and risk triggering a default that
could lead to further dollar losses.	
 The greenback fell as low as 0.7997 francs as
options-related barriers were taken out at the psychologically
key 0.8000 level, and traders said the dollar could fall
""another 2-3 big figures"" if U.S. lawmakers are unable to agree
on raising the debt ceiling by an Aug. 2 deadline. 
 A warning from President Barack Obama that failure to up the
U.S. borrowing limit would severely hurt the nation sparked
dollar selling, as the shift in focus to U.S. debt issues
tarnished the dollar's safe-haven status. 
 ""The market is pricing in a greater probability of a bad
outcome - either a default or a rating agency downgrade,"" said
Geoffrey Kendrick, FX strategist at Nomura, who said he expected
Washington to miss the Aug. 2 deadline but avoid a default.	
 ""Last week the market was a bit complacent on this issue but
we have seen the dollar sell off overnight against pretty much
everything. Negative headlines could drive it even lower.""	
 A debt default would ramp up the cost of U.S. government
borrowing and could lead to a loss of faith in liquid U.S.
assets as one of the safest destinations for investors, which
would trigger more selling in the dollar.	
 In addition to its losses versus the Swiss franc, the dollar
suffered against the yen, another safe-haven rival. It fell to
77.88 yen , its weakest since mid-March, when major
central banks acted in concert to stem the yen's rise.	
 It pulled back to 78.07 yen as movements calmed in European
trade following a volatile Asian session. Given deteriorating
dollar sentiment, traders in London said the U.S. currency could
test 76.25 yen -- an all-time low hit earlier this year -- in
the next week.	
 The dollar's slide has raised concerns Japanese authorities
may enter the market to stem yen strength and sources said
policymakers are becoming increasingly alarmed by persistent yen
rises. 
 
 BROAD DOLLAR LOSSES 
 The dollar traded at 0.8031 francs, trimming losses
but still down 0.4 percent on the day.	
 Traders see the possibility that the U.S. currency could
fall as low as 0.7600 francs in the near term, while analysts
said the Swiss National Bank was unlikely to enter the market to
weaken its currency despite its elevated levels.	
 Also in focus were a series of U.S. Treasury auctions this
week, beginning with an offer of two-year notes later in the
day. Market participants said weak demand for short-dated paper
would offer another cue to sell the dollar.	
 Treasuries have taken a slight hit in past sessions, which
has raised yields and expanded the spread between 10-year yields
against German ones to around 27 basis
points, approaching its widest since March. 
 ""We've been seeing a blowout in the spread between
Treasuries and Bunds and what that suggests is that the
perceived risk between them has widened to the detriment of
Treasuries,"" said Adam Myers, currency strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. 
 But he said the move would be short-lived as U.S. assets
were likely to survive the latest shake-up of market confidence
with their safe-haven status intact, even if the U.S. can only
secure a short-term funding solution to its debt problems.	
 ""We should see that spread narrowing and the dollar
strengthening again because debt problems in the euro zone are
far more difficult to manage because it's a currency union
whereas the U.S. is a union of states."" he added. 
 The euro traded at $1.4482, having rallied 1 percent
on the day to a three-week high around $1.4522 in earlier trade.
Gains were checked at that level by resistance from the 61.8
percent retracement of the early May to July sell-off.	
 Against a currency basket , the dollar fell 0.6
percent to 73.638. A fall below 73.506 would mark its lowest in
nearly three months.	
 The dollar also depreciated against commodity currencies
considered to be higher-risk.	
 The New Zealand dollar clocked a post-float high of
US$0.8743, while the Australian dollar rallied to
US$1.0955, its strongest since May. The greenback also fell to a
3-1/2 year low of C$0.9419 versus the Canadian dollar.

 LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - The dollar fell across the board
on Tuesday after U.S. President Barack Obama gave no sign of a
swift breakthrough in deadlocked talks to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling, while stocks put in mixed performance with focus on
earnings.	
 Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion
ceiling by Aug. 2, the United States faces a technical default
on some of its $9.6 trillion government bonds outstanding.	
 In a televised address, Obama warned that this would be a
""reckless and irresponsible outcome,"" but he gave no indication
that a compromise was imminent. 
 However, investors so far appear to have done little to
prepare for a default or a cut in the triple-A credit rating.	
 On the one hand they believe lawmakers will eventually reach
a deal. On the other, it is nearly impossible to insure
themselves against what is considered a low-probability event,
especially given the lack of alternatives and the depth of the
market.	
 ""Investors remain anxious but are still relatively patient,""
said Felix Parmantier, analyst at Close Brothers Seydler. 
 MSCI world equity index rose 0.5 percent
while European stocks fell 0.2 percent after
weaker-than-expected results from BP and UBS .
Emerging stocks rose 0.8 percent.	
 U.S. stock futures were unchanged for the day ,
indicating a flat open on Wall street later.	
 A recent run of strong U.S. corporate results is providing
support in otherwise jittery trading. Of the 154 S&P 500
companies that have reported earnings so far, 75 percent have
beaten analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.	
 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.5 percent, helped by a weaker
dollar. 
 Bund futures  rose 13 ticks. Spanish and Italian
government bonds fell after concerns rose over whether the new
Greek bailout plan would stop sovereign debt problems from
spreading to other countries.	
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent against a basket of major
currencies. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose half a
basis point to 3.01 percent .	
 A default could potentially spark a shift of billions of
capital currently parked in Treasuries into other triple-A rated
securities, triggering a sharp decline in an already weak
dollar.	
 The U.S. currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
and fell to a four-month low near 77.90 yen , approaching
a record low of 76.25.	
 ""People are so used to using the dollar, it being at the
heart of everything, that they're unlikely to change what they
do (in Treasuries),"" said Lloyds Bank strategist Charles Diebel.	
 ""But if bank funding costs rise or (a large fund) says they
won't buy Treasuries anymore then you could see a significant
spike in yields.""	
 The cost of insuring the United States against default stood
at 57.3 basis points , nearly half the March 2009
peak. 
 The CDS curve is nearly flat with one-year CDS
at 57.7 bps. This in itself reflects investor
jitters, but it is not the kind of pricing for a market that
expects an imminent default.	
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.4469.

 By Eric Burroughs	
 HONG KONG, July 26 (Reuters) - Asian shares rebounded on
Tuesday as upbeat earnings lured buyers, but the dollar slid to
a record low against the Swiss franc after a speech by U.S.
President Barack Obama gave no sign that a deadlock in
Washington over raising the debt limit was easing.	
 European and U.S. stocks were primed for gains, with futures
on the Dow Jones Eurostoxxe 50  flat in early trade and
S&P e-mini futures  rising 0.2 percent.	
 Short-term speculators took aim at the dollar after Obama
delivered a prime-time address to Americans, warning that a
default on U.S. bond obligations would be a ""reckless and
irresponsible outcome"". But he gave no indication a compromise
was imminent. 
 So far investors have shown few signs of panic even as
Republicans and Democrats have failed to bridge their
differences with just a week to go to the Aug. 2 deadline that
the U.S. Treasury has set for when it may fail to pay out on
Treasuries.	
 The market reaction to a sudden breakdown in talks over the
weekend was limited given the threat of a technical default and
a potential cut in the United States' top-notch AAA credit
rating.	
 But some market players were taking no chances, shifting
funds into safe-haven gold and the Swiss franc, driving both to
record highs in U.S. dollar terms. Gold was steady in early
trade at $1,614.60 an ounce.	
 Portfolio managers and traders have said they believe an
agreement will be reached in Washington at the last minute, and
that even a technical default or rating downgrade may only cause
short-term market volatility rather than a full-fledged crisis.	
 ""There's obviously political points to be made, who is going
to blink first, but in the final analysis we're confident that
there will be a compromise and that they will raise the debt
ceiling,"" said Malcom Wood, head of Asia Pacific strategy at
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Hong Kong.	
 Asian bonds, currencies and even shares have been one of the
beneficiaries from all the debt trouble in Europe and the
political gridlock in the United States, with investors viewing
the region's stronger growth and fundamentals as a relative
safe-haven.	
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 1 percent and has squeezed out a 1.6
percent gain on the month and year, withstanding the occasional
bouts of volatility from the U.S. deficit debate and euro zone
debt crisis.	
 Southeast Asian markets have fared the best. Indonesia's
Jakarta Composite extended its winning streak, vaulting
to an all-time high and taking this year's rise to 11.3 percent.
Currencies have also been on a tear, with the Singapore dollar
hitting a record high.	
 Gains were fairly broad but on very light trade as summer
holidays took a toll on trading activity. By sector, energy,
financial, resource and technology shares were the main drivers.	
 The improved appetite for risk spread to commodities. U.S.
crude oil prices  were up 40 cents a barrel at $99.60.	
 
 JAPAN RECOVERS	
 Japanese shares also rose as its big automakers and
manufacturers have recovered more quickly than expected from the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami.	
 Japan's Nikkei average climbed 0.6 percent, thanks
in part to solid earnings from blue-chip companies such as Canon
despite the yen's persistent strength.	
 In currencies, the dollar erased gains scored against the
euro the previous day on widening Spanish and Italian bond yield
spreads and hit a six-week low against a basket of currencies.	
 The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4485 , bursting
through chart resistance. The dollar hit an all-time low of
0.8005 Swiss francs . The dollar hovered near 78.00 yen
after briefly falling below that level.	
 High-yielding currencies were among the biggest winners. The
New Zealand dollar jumped 0.7 percent and hit a high of
$0.8708 -- the highest since being allowed to trade freely in
the early 1980s.	
 Option markets -- where investors typically hedge themselves
against potential risks -- were also showing no signs of panic
across the dollar, S&P futures and Treasury futures.	
 While the closely watched VIX index of S&P implied
volatility ticked up on Monday to 19.35, it remains well off
peaks earlier this year.	
 Implied volatility on Treasury futures was also
higher this month but historically subdued. For a chart see: http://r.reuters.com/paz72s	
 Analysts said that macro hedge funds and others were
reluctant to trade, having struggled with choppy markets all
years and cut back on positions heading into the European summit
on Greece last week.	
 ""It has been a tough year for macro funds, and many do not

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2011 02:12AM ET</span>",FOREX-Dollar dogged by US debt stalemate; yen seesaws ," * Dollar hits record low vs Swiss franc
 * Market doubts debt breakthrough after Obama's call
 * Dollar/yen hit 4-mth low, then briefly spikes higher
 * No talk of yen-selling intervention, traders say

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, July 26 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low
against the Swiss franc and a four-month trough versus the yen
on Tuesday, as investors were sceptical that U.S. President
Barack Obama's call for compromise would lead to a swift
breakthrough in deadlocked debt talks.	
 There was broad pressure on the greenback, with the New
Zealand dollar climbing to a post-float high, the Australian
dollar hitting a three-month peak, while the euro extended its
gains versus the dollar after breaching chart resistance. 
 The dollar seesawed against the yen. Stop-loss dollar
selling and speculative sales aimed at taking out an option
barrier helped drag the dollar down to a four-month low against
the Japanese currency at one point. 
 But the dollar later briefly spiked higher against the yen,
rising nearly a full yen from its four-month low in a matter of
minutes. Market players said the dollar's gain stemmed from
buying by a hedge fund and some Japanese banks and a short
squeeze. 
 But traders said there was no talk of yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities, and the dollar quickly
retreated from its intraday high. 
 ""Today's comments from Obama didn't offer any
specifics and were more of a general appeal, so I think the
market may have been disappointed with the lack of progress,""
said Christopher Gothard, head of FX for Brown Brothers Harriman
in Hong Kong. 
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 78.10 yen . Earlier, it
hit a four-month low of 77.883 yen on trading platform EBS,
edging closer to a record low of 76.25 yen hit in March.	
 At one point, the dollar struck a record low versus the
Swiss franc of 0.8005 . After trimming a bit of its
losses, the dollar was down 0.6 percent at 0.8010 francs.	
 Adding to pressure on the dollar, the euro rose 0.8 percent
to $1.4489 , its rise having gained steam after breaching
a series of resistance levels, including the top of the daily
Ichimoku cloud and trendline resistance drawn off a peak hit in
May.	
 One possible resistance, and upside target for the euro
lies at $1.4519, a 61.8 percent retracement of the euro's May to
July slide.	
 Obama called on Republican and Democratic leaders on Monday
night to reach a fair compromise on raising the debt ceiling to
avert a ""reckless and irresponsible"" national default. 
 In an address to the nation, Obama spelled out the severe
economic consequences of a default or even a credit ratings
downgrade resulting from failure to strike a deal on raising the
$14.3 trillion debt limit and reducing the budget deficit.

 ""The market is 99.9 percent certain that some sort of
agreement will be reached...But the closer they get to the Aug.
2 deadline, the worst the panic is likely to be,"" said David
Scutt, a trader at Arab Bank Australia 
 With jitters over the lack of a deal on the debt ceiling and
the possibility of a sovereign rating downgrade weighing on the
dollar, and the euro facing sovereign debt woes of its own, the
yen and emerging Asian currencies may continue to benefit, said
Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.	
 ""The U.S. yield curve has been steepening with short-term
yields staying low, and that is likely to keep pressure on the
dollar,"" Okagawa said.	
 The New Zealand dollar rising 0.6 percent to $0.8692
, having struck a post-float high of $0.8708 at one
point.	
 The Aussie dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0911 .
Earlier, it hit a three-month high of $1.0926.

 By Eric Burroughs	
 HONG KONG, July 26 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on
Tuesday, rebounding from Monday's fall, but the dollar slid to a
record low against the Swiss franc after a speech by U.S.
President Barack Obama gave no sign a deadlock in Washington
over raising the debt limit was easing.	
 Short-term speculators took aim at the dollar after Obama
delivered a prime-time address to Americans, warning that a
default on U.S. bond obligations would be a ""reckless and
irresponsible outcome"". But he gave no indication a compromise
was imminent. 
 So far investors have shown few signs of panic even as
Republicans and Democrats have failed to bridge their
differences with just a week to go to the Aug. 2 deadline the
U.S. Treasury has set for when it may fail to pay out on
Treasuries.	
 The market reaction to a sudden breakdown in talks over the
weekend was limited given the threat of a technical default and
a potential cut in the United States' top-notch AAA credit
rating.	
 But some market players were taking no chances, shifting
funds into safe-haven gold and the Swiss franc, driving both to
record highs in U.S. dollar terms. Gold was steady in early
trade at $1,614.14 an ounce.	
 ""The unfolding U.S. debt ceiling drama should add
to the headwinds for market risk sentiment, with a potential
downgrade of the world's ultimate risk-free asset - the U.S.
Treasuries - fuelling more flight to quality into gold and Swiss
franc,"" said currency analysts at Citigroup in a note to
clients.	
 Portfolio managers and traders have said they believe an
agreement will be reached in Washington at the last minute, and
that even a technical default or rating downgrade may only cause
short-term market volatility rather than a full-fledged crisis.	
 Asian bonds, currencies and even shares have been one of the
beneficiaries from all the debt trouble in Europe and the
political gridlock in the United States, with investors viewing
the region's stronger growth and fundamentals as a relative
safe-haven.	
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.8 percent and is up about 1 percent on
the month and year, withstanding the occasional bouts of
volatility from the U.S. deficit debate and euro zone debt
crisis.	
 Gains were fairly broad, if on light trade. By sector,
telecom, energy, financial and resource shares were driving the
rise.	
 
 JAPAN WEATHERS STORM	
 Japan has also weathered the storm as its big automakers and
manufacturers have recovered more quickly than expected from the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami.	
 Japan's Nikkei average clung to positive territory,
thanks in part to solid earnings from blue-chip companies such
as Canon despite the yen's persistent strength.	
 In currencies, the dollar erased gains scored against the
euro the previous day on widening Spanish and Italian bond yield
spreads and hit a six-week low against a basket of currencies.	
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.4470 , while the
dollar hit an all-time low of 0.8006 Swiss francs . The
dollar hovered near 78.00 yen after briefly falling below
that level.	
 The yen pushed back towards a record high hit against the
dollar in March, stirring some speculation Japanese authorities
may soon intervene to stem further gains. The dollar briefly
spiked against the yen, but traders said no intervention had
been spotted.	
 Option markets -- where investors typically hedge themselves
against potential risks -- were also showing no signs of panic
across the dollar, S&P futures and Treasury futures.	
 While the closely watched VIX index of S&P implied
volatility ticked up on Monday to 19.35, it remains off peaks of
24.65 and 31.28 struck earlier this year.	
 Implied volatility on Treasury futures was also
higher this month but historically subdued. For chart see: http://r.reuters.com/paz72s	
 U.S. Treasuries slipped for a second day, with long-term
Treasuries under the most pressure from the worries about a

 By Eric Burroughs	
 HONG KONG, July 26 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on
Tuesday, bouncing back from a slide the previous day, after U.S.
stocks posted only modest losses in reaction to the worsening
deadlock in Washington over raising the debt limit and avoiding
a technical bond default.	
 The dollar fell to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss
franc in early trade as President Barack Obama delivered a
prime-time address to Americans, warning that a default on U.S.
bond obligations would be a ""reckless and irresponsible
outcome."" 
 Investors have showed few signs of panic even as Republicans
and Democrats have failed to bridge their differences with just
a week to go to the Aug. 2 deadline the U.S. Treasury has set
for when it may fail to pay out on Treasuries.	
 The market reaction to a sudden breakdown in talks over the
weekend was relatively mild and limited given the threat of a
technical default and a potential cut in the United States'
top-notch AAA credit rating.	
 The S&P 500 shed 0.6 percent by the end of Monday,
but U.S. stock futures had been down 1 percent earlier in the
day.	
 Some market players were taking no chances, shifting funds
into safe-haven gold and the Swiss franc -- driving both to
record peaks against the U.S. dollar. Gold was steady in early
trade at $1,613.50 an ounce.	
 ""The unfolding US debt ceiling drama should add to the
headwinds for market risk sentiment, with a potential downgrade
of the world's ultimate risk-free asset - the US Treasuries -
fuelling more flight to quality into gold and Swiss franc,"" said
currency analysts at Citigroup in a note to clients. 
 But portfolio managers and traders have long believed that
an agreement would be reached in Washington at the last minute,
and that even a technical default or rating downgrade may only
cause short-term market volatility rather than a full-fledged

 Asian bonds, currencies and even shares have been one of the

was up 0.3 percent in early trade and is up
about 1 percent on the month and year, withstanding the
occasional bouts of volatility from the U.S. deficit debate and
euro zone debt crisis.	
 Japan has also benefited as its big automakers and
manufacturers have recovered more quickly than expected from the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami.	
 Japan's Nikkei average inched up 0.1 percent, thanks
in part to solid earnings from blue-chip companies such as Canon
despite the yen's persistent strength.	
 In currencies, the dollar dipped in early trade after having
gained the previous day. Bond yield spreads on Spain and Italy
worsened on Monday as a relief rally after European leaders
agreed to a second bailout for Greece fizzled.	
 The euro drifted up 0.1 percent to $1.4390 from near
$1.4378 in late New York trade. The dollar edged down slightly
to 78.20 yen and also slipped back towards a record low
of 0.8021 Swiss francs struck the previous day.	
 The dollar index -- a gauge of its performance against a
basket of currencies -- was flat at 74.041 .	
 Option markets -- where investors typically hedge themselves
against potential risks -- were also showing no signs of panic
across the dollar, S&P futures and Treasury futures.	
 While the closely watched VIX index of S&P implied

with long-term Treasuries under the most pressure from the
worries about a rating downgrade.	
 Ten-year notes were up 2/32 in price to yield
2.997 percent, down a basis point. Thirty-year bonds
found their footing and gained 6/32, pulling their yields down a
basis point to 4.308 percent.

 NEW YORK,July 25 (Reuters) - Fears that the United States
could suffer a ratings downgrade hit world stocks on Monday and
drove money into safe-haven gold and Swiss francs as a
breakdown in budget talks in Washington unsettled markets.
 Prospects of a budget breakthrough that would allow the
United States to raise its debt ceiling and avoid default on
its bond payments faded over the weekend as lawmakers missed a
self-imposed deadline to produce a deal. For details see:

 Gold hit a record high and the dollar fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc.
 Also weighing on markets was Moody's decision to cut
Greece's credit rating further into junk territory. Moody's
said it was almost certain to slap a default tag on Greek debt
as a result of a new EU rescue package. [ID:nL3E7IP0P2]
 Analysts warned of further sharp selling in stocks if
Washington fails to increase the debt limit and enters a
technical default on its debt next month; analysts have priced
in a roughly 10 percent chance of such a scenario.
 Many investors are still clinging to the hope that the two
major U.S. political parties will reach a compromise to
increase the $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling by Aug. 2.
 ""This whole game of chicken is fraught with risk,"" said Ken
Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York. ""Risk
for the investors, for the consumer, to the economy, to
Americans, to Europeans, risk across the board.""
 The Swiss franc was the biggest beneficiary of the demand
for safe havens, pushing the dollar down nearly 2 percent to an
all-time low of 0.8021 franc . The euro  fell
by the same margin versus the Swiss currency, and against the
dollar  it fell as low as $1.4323.
 Spot gold  hit a new peak at $1,622.49 an ounce and
was up 1.1 percent at $1,616.00.

 NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Major global stock markets
and the U.S. dollar fell on Monday as a political impasse in
Washington over raising the U.S. debt ceiling stoked fears of a
U.S. rating downgrade and even debt default.
 Investors poured into perceived safe-haven assets, driving
gold to a record high and the Swiss franc to an all-time peak
against the U.S. currency.
 U.S. government bonds, however, failed to benefit from
their usual safe-haven status after the weekend breakdown in
talks fueled investor anxiety over Treasury holdings. Selling
was particularly intense in longer-dated maturities.
 The United States moved one step closer to losing its
coveted triple-A credit rating as a sharply divided U.S.
Congress pursued rival budget plans on Monday, neither of which
appeared likely to win broad support. If the impasse were to
continue, the government will run out of money to pay its bills
in nine days unless lawmakers increase the $14.3 trillion
borrowing limit.
 ""If politicians don't find a solution right now, we are
facing a disaster of major proportions,"" said Fidelio Tata,
head of U.S. rates strategy at SG Corporate & Investment
Banking in New York.
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was down 86.73 points, or 0.68
percent, at 12,594.43. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was down 8.30 points, or 0.62 percent, at 1,336.72. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 16.52 points, or 0.58 percent,
at 2,842.31.
 A U.S. debt default would have massive repercussions for
financial instruments, in part because U.S. Treasuries are the
benchmark against which the performances of many other assets
are judged.
 ""The markets were hopeful that by now something would have
been agreed. I don't think a U.S. debt default has been
completely ruled out by the markets,"" said Keith Bowman, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
 Even if politicians raise the borrowing limit in time, the
threat of a downgrade remains. Standard & Poor's has said it
might still cut the United States to AA if lawmakers embrace a
short-term fix that lifts the debt ceiling but doesn't address
long-term fiscal issues.
 World stocks as measured MSCI's all-country world stock
index <.MIWD00000PUS> was last down 0.6 percent. Emerging
markets <.MSCIEF> also lost 0.6 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.2 percent. Japan's
Nikkei <.N225> earlier closed 0.8 percent lower.

 GOLD, SWISS FRANC
 The Swiss franc was the biggest beneficiary of the demand
for safe havens. The dollar  fell as low as 0.8021
Swiss franc on trading platform EBS and was last down 1.9
percent at 0.8030. The euro  lost about 2 percent
to 1.1535 francs.
 Against a basket of currencies <.DXY>, the dollar slipped
0.1 percent. The dollar  also dropped to to 78.055 yen
on EBS, its weakest since mid-March.
 ""The U.S. will have to come up with a credible long-term
plan in order to avert a downgrade,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 ""The increasing risk of a downgrade means declining
confidence in U.S. assets and the risk of capital outflows,
which is a negative for the dollar against the Swiss franc and
the yen,"" he added.
 Gold surged to a record high above $1,620 an ounce the
fifth record high for bullion in less than two weeks.
 Spot gold , which has risen nearly 14 percent so far
this year, climbed more than 1 percent to a record $1,622.49 an
ounce before easing to around $1,617.
 Oil prices fell as worries about a U.S. downgrade or even
default dampened hope for stronger global economic growth and
drove investors away from risky assets.
 Brent  crude was $1.12 lower at $117.58 a barrel.
U.S. oil  was 71 cents lower at $99.15.
 In the U.S. Treasury market, the 30-year Treasury bond was
last down 1-5/32 in price for a yield of 4.32 percent
 versus Friday's close of 4.26 percent.
 Benchmark 10-year notes  were down 14/32 with a
yield of 3.02 percent, up 4 basis points from late Friday.

 By Neal Armstrong and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low
versus the Swiss franc and a four-month trough against the yen
on Monday as the impasse over raising the U.S. debt ceiling
unsettled financial markets and fueled demand for perceived
safe-haven currencies.	
 The Swiss franc was the biggest beneficiary of the demand
for safe havens, pushing the dollar nearly 2 percent lower to an
all-time low of 0.8021 franc on trading platform EBS . The
euro fell the same amount versus the Swiss currency. 
 Most investors expect a deal will be done before the Aug. 2
deadline to avert default, but the lack of progress in talks
over how to cut the budget deficit and the possibility of a
ratings downgrade Of U.S. debt weighed on risk sentiment, which
analysts said would keep dogging the dollar. 
 The U.S. Treasury says it will run out of money to pay the
country's bills after Aug. 2, though some analysts say the
Treasury may be able to scrape some money together to get by for
a week or two -- a scenario that some market players are
starting to think cannot be ruled out.	
 Many traders think the dollar could test a record low of
76.25 yen if concerns about the U.S. debt ceiling worsen, while
they also expect the U.S. currency will keep plumbing all-time
troughs versus the Swiss franc. 
 ""It's likely the U.S. will stitch up some sort of deal to
avoid a technical default next week, but it could drag on until
the last moment,"" said Adam Cole, global head of FX at RBC.	
 ""If it does drag on, the only clear cut conclusion you can
draw is that dollar/yen goes down, and dollar/Swiss goes down,
and we're seeing a miniature version of that today.""

 
 U.S. GDP, AUCTION RISKS 
 The dollar slipped to 78.05 yen, its weakest since
mid-March, with traders reporting selling from Asian sovereign
accounts. 
 It slipped slightly to 74.141 versus a currency
basket, closing in on 73.889, a six-week low hit last week.	
 ""Below 74 in the dollar index could see it potentially down
towards the record lows (around 70.70) hit in 2008,"" said
Kathleen Brooks, head of research strategy at FOREX.com.	
 ""If U.S. GDP data on Friday shows weak growth added to an
unsustainable debt burden, that has to be toxic for the dollar,""
she added. 
 Cole at RBC warned a further, significant sell-off in the
dollar against the yen and the Swiss franc was likely if
Washington enters a technical default on its debt next month, of
which he said the market was pricing in a 10 percent chance.	
 In such a scenario, the dollar could plunge to 75 yen, while
dollar/Swiss could fall ""two or three big figures,"" he said.	
 Yet he added: ""You've got to assume as a central case that
the U.S. won't walk itself into a default, that ultimately when
push comes to shove something will come together either
temporarily or longer term.""	
 The euro was last up 0.1 percent at $1.4375 , but the
euro zone's lingering debt risks kept traders wary over the
single currency. It fell 2 percent versus the Swiss franc to
1.1531 francs .	
 The euro initially slipped against the dollar after Moody's
downgraded Greece by three notches to Ca from Caa1, though the
impact was limited because the move was not a surprise and
traders were focussed on the U.S. debt saga.	
 The sweeping bailout and policy package agreed by euro zone
leaders last week helped stem market panic in the short run. But
analysts say the measures may not be enough to bring the crisis
to a swift resolution.	
 In addition to U.S. growth data this week, JPMorgan analysts
said U.S. bond auctions posed another downside risk to the
dollar. The U.S. Treasury will offers two-year paper on Tuesday,
five-year bonds on Wednesday, and seven-year debt on Thursday.	
 ""Low levels of indirect participation in the Treasury
auctions this week ... could lead USD lower against JPY, CHF,
and EUR as demand to own UST weakens,"" they said in a note.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - Political brinkmanship in
Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling hit world stocks on Monday
and drove money into safe-haven gold and Swiss francs, ending a
brief relief rally over Greece's second bailout package.	
 Wall Street looked set to open sharply lower.	
 Prospects of a budget breakthrough that would allow the
United States to raise its debt ceiling and avoid default on its
bond payments faded over the weekend as lawmakers missed a
self-imposed deadline to produce a deal.	
 Further discussions were planned for Monday, however, and
most investors have been banking on a last-minute deal.

 Raising the borrowing limit would avoid default, but would
not necessarily end the threat by rating agencies to cut the
U.S. economy's coveted triple-A rating, vulnerable because of
the huge U.S. debt burden.	
 ""The markets were hopeful that by now something would have
been agreed. I don't think a U.S. debt default has been
completely ruled out by the markets,"" said Keith Bowman, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.	
 A U.S. default would have massive repercussions for
financial instruments, in part because U.S. Treasuries are the
benchmark against which the performances of many other assets
are judged. 
 Bowman said the issue had overshadowed a somewhat
better-than-expected earnings season for stock investors.	
 It has also undermined what succour investors were taking
from last week's deal to bail out Greece and stop -- at least
for now -- contagion to larger euro zone economies.	
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was
down 0.3 percent, with emerging markets losing 0.6
percent.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was down a third of a percent.
Japan's Nikkei earlier closed 0.8 percent lower.	
 
 GOLD, SWISS FRANC	
 The mood prompted investor flows into the Swiss franc and
gold, both safe havens of choice in the current market climate.	
 The dollar fell 2 percent against the Swiss currency
and the euro lost about the same. Otherwise the dollar
was weaker against the euro and a basket of major currencies

 ""The U.S. will have to come up with a credible long-term
plan in order to avert a downgrade,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.	
 ""The increasing risk of a downgrade means declining
confidence in U.S. assets and the risk of capital outflows,
which is a negative for the dollar against the Swiss franc and
the yen,"" he added.	
 Gold surged to a record high above $1,620 an ounce in Asian
trading, the fifth record high for bullion in less than two
weeks. 
 Spot gold , which has risen nearly 14 percent so far
this year, climbed more than 1 percent to a record $1,622.49 an
ounce before easing to around $1,619.	
 Yields were two basis points higher on U.S. Treasuries
and flat on core euro zone debt.

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, July 25 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped in Asia on
Monday as U.S. lawmakers had yet to reach a deal to raise the
country's debt ceiling with only a little over a week remaining
before the deadline to avert a default.	
 Most investors still assume that sanity will reign in
Washington and a debt deal will be done, but the lack of
progress in talks over how to cut the U.S. budget deficit is
making market players nervous. 
 The dollar fell to a four-month low against the yen
of 78.12 yen and shed 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc
to 0.8132 franc, about a centime away from its record low hit
last week. The uncertainty over the U.S. debt crisis also kept
growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar
in check.	
 ""It looks like only short-term players are trading now. Most
market players have been and still are expecting negotiations to
drag on until the very last minute,"" said Makoto Noji, a senior
strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.	
 In Washington, White House officials and
Republican leaders scrambled to look for ways to bridge gaps
over a range of issues, including whether to raise taxes and cut
social programmes to cut the deficit, and also over Republican
demands for a short-term debt-limit increase that would force
President Barack Obama to request further borrowing authority in
early 2012.	
 The impasse prompted White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley
to warn that there would be a ""few stressful days"" ahead for
financial markets, with limited time left before the Aug. 2
deadline to lift the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing limit.	
 The U.S. Treasury says it will run out of money to pay the
country's bills after Aug. 2, though some analysts say the
Treasury may be able to scrape some money to get by for a week
or two -- a scenario that some market players are starting to
think cannot be ruled out.	
 ""I suspect they will avoid a default. But credit downgrades
seem increasingly likely,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank. 
 
 UGLY DUCKLING CONTEST	
 Some analysts see room for the dollar to rebound if the U.S.
comes up with credible deficit-reduction plan in the long term.
But others think sharp spending cuts could backfire by slowing
the already fragile U.S. economy further.	
 ""Even if they reach a deal, large spending cuts are likely
to hurt growth and undermine the dollar,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo, adding that
Barclays has just revised down its one-month forecast for the
dollar to 75 yen from 80 yen.	
 The dollar held around 78.40 yen, near a four-month low of
78.12 yen hit earlier in the day. Many traders think it could
test a record low of 76.25 yen if the U.S. debt crisis drags on.	
 The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies
stood at 74.202 , holding above Thursday's six-week
low of 73.889.	
 But having broken its months-old trendline support last
week, the risk of breaking that low looks big, which could open
the way for a test of its June low of 73.506 and year-to-date
low of 72.696.	
 The euro briefly fell after Moody's downgraded Greece by
three notches to Ca from Caa1, though the impact was short-lived
as the move was hardly a surprise and as traders were gripped by
the U.S. debt saga.	
 The euro was steady at $1.4365 , and the euro zone's
lingering debt issues were seen as brakes on the single
currency's move higher.	
 The sweeping bailout and policy package agreed by euro zone
leaders last week has helped stem market panic in the short-run.
But analysts say the measures may not be enough to bring the
crisis to a swift resolution.	
 ""Things aren't too rosy in Europe either and so it's really
a contest to see who's the ugliest duckling at the party between
the euro and the U.S. dollar,"" said BNZ currency strategist Mike
Burrowes.	
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $1.0820 in a
knee-jerk ""risk-off"" reaction to the U.S. debt problems as share
prices fell across the region. U.S. stock futures fell 1.1
percent .	
 But some analysts said the Australian dollar and other
commodity currencies could gain, should a full-fledged
reallocation out of the United States gather steam, considering
that the euro has its own problems and the yen could be next in
the line of debt crises given Japan is the most indebted country
in the developed world.	
 ""Australia is expected to have a budget surplus in 2012.
Investors may look for currencies with sound fiscal background.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Australian dollar rises above
$1.1,"" said SMBC Nikko's Noji.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, July 25 (Reuters) - Stocks fell while the Swiss
franc rose and gold hit a record high on Monday as hopes for a
political deal to avert a U.S. default began to fade, though
investors were mostly seeking to protect their portfolios with
no signs of market panic.	
 Indeed, though the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
rose four basis points to 3 percent, it was still
down more than 30 basis points since the year began. 
 Equity markets in Asia were down between 0.8 percent to 2.3
percent, and U.S. stock futures fell 1.1 percent .	
 Investors have been whipsawed in the past few months by hope
and disappointment over policymakers' ability to halt sovereign
debt crises in the euro zone and the United States.	
 After European leaders scraped together a second bailout for
Greece last week, haggling in Washington has taken centre stage
after U.S. debt talks between President Barack Obama and
congressional leaders broke down over the weekend, making a U.S.
debt default, a previously unthinkable event, a possibility.
.	
 Investors said they still mostly viewed the headlines coming
out of Washington as political theatre and expected an
eleventh-hour solution before an Aug. 2 deadline when the U.S.
Treasury said it would not be able to borrow any more funds.
They have continued all the while, though, to cut their exposure
to risky assets.	
 ""Despite the ever-frustrating horse-wrangling between the
Democrats and Republicans, which could result in a downgrade of
the U.S. government debt ranking, I still believe that some kind
of temporary deal will be struck in the last minute,"" said Khiem
Do, head of Asian Multi-Asset with Baring Asset Management in
Hong Kong.

 US YIELDS RISE, BUT NO BUYERS STRIKE	
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 0.8 percent
, led by shares of clothing chain company Fast Retailing
which fell 1.5 percent after hitting a 13-month high
last Friday.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was down
1.2 percent , with industrials and energy-related
stocks underperforming the most.	
 Treasuries slid, with the 10-year future down 6/32 to
124-4.5/32 , though they remained not too far from a
seven-month high of 125-28/32 reached in June. 
 In the cash market, selling was heavier in late-dated
maturities. The 30-year yield climbed five basis points from
late Friday in New York to 4.31 percent .	
 Senior traders at Wall Street dealers in Asia said that
regional investors, including central banks, were more worried
about the debt crisis raging in Europe than with the political
paralysis gripping Washington.	
 ""Do I think interest rates will be resoundingly higher due
to a weaker credit? No. If that were the case, Japan would be
higher than Botswana,"" said Bernie Ward, co-head of global
central bank sales at RBS in Tokyo.	
 ""The point is, it doesn't mean a lot at the end of the day.
At some point the market will punish, but it's not now. We're
not seeing a buyers' strike yet."" 
 The Swiss franc was one of the biggest gainers from late
Friday in New York, owing to its safe haven status. 
 The dollar was down around 0.8 percent from Friday against
the franc at 0.8122 and was also down slightly against
the yen at 78.40 yen . 
 
 ASIAN OPPORTUNITY?	
 Asian assets were seen by many fund managers as a
beneficiary of the increasingly tense investment environment
because of the region's relatively stronger sovereign balance
sheets and better growth prospects. 
 ""Overall, we remain positive on the solid economic and
investment outlook for Asia, which may actually be considered as
the 'safe haven' while the debt concerns and consumer
de-leveraging in Japan, Europe and the U.S. continue,"" said
Barings' Do.	
 Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset
Management's emerging markets group, believes investors will
accelerate diversifying their assets out of the U.S. dollar into
Asian currencies if the U.S. debt talks fail.	
 ""The first reaction probably would be that there will be a
move into Asian currencies and Asian bonds. People will see that
as a safer alternative. You are already beginning to see that
trend. Some of the emerging countries have a lower cost on
credit default swaps from the developed countries,"" said Mobius,
who oversees some $50 billion in assets. 
 However, in times of heightened market volatility, investors
usually rush to liquid assets, of which emerging Asia has
relatively few compared with developed markets. 
 Even if Congress proves able to broker a deal with Obama, it
is not clear the credit rating agencies would hold off from
downgrading the top U.S. rating -- and what the market impact
would be of such a move. 
 Strategists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch expect the U.S.
S&P 500 index to drop about 100 points from where it is now if
the United States loses its top debt rating, though they don't
expect the 10-year Treasury yield to rise above 3.60 percent in
2011. 
 Traders were watching U.S. S&P 500 stock futures closely for
indications on the broader market's willingness to stick with
risky assets as the U.S. debt deadline looms.	
 Correlations between G10 currencies and the S&P 500 index
are strongest with the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and
Swedish crown, suggesting those currencies could be in the
firing line if fear causes dealers to liquidate positions in a
hurry, Robert Rennie, chief currency strategist with Westpac
Bank in Sydney, said. 
 The Korean won, one of the more liquid emerging Asian
currencies, has a relatively low correlation with the S&P in the
past year. 
 In commodities trading, gold rose to an all-time high
of $1,622.49 an ounce, then eased to $1,613.60, still up 0.9
percent for the day. Silver was at $40.52, close to last
Tuesday's two-month high of $40.84 .	
 U.S. crude oil for September delivery in New York 
fell 83 cents to $99.04 a barrel, while Brent oil futures
 were down 71 cents at $117.96. 
 ""Markets still believe that there is going to be a last
minute deal on this even though we might be pushing really close
to the line, and that is the reason why Asian trading has been
largely sanguine,"" said Kenneth Akintewe, a fund manager at
Aberdeen Asset Management who helps manage $6.8 billion in Asian
fixed income securities.

 By David Gaffen	
 NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell and
gold hit a new record on Sunday as Washington was no closer to
raising the U.S. debt ceiling to avert a devastating default.	
 The decline in equity futures points to a poor open for U.S.
markets and shows investors are getting increasingly worried
about the failure of legislators to coalesce around one approach
that will resolve the stalemate that is unnerving investors.	
 ""The fact that they seem to be jumping from one type of
proposal to another and not converging on anything is beginning
to worry markets,"" said Steven Englander, head of G10 FX
strategy at Citigroup.	
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei index was down 0.5 percent
in Monday morning trade.	
 S&P 500 futures fell at the outset of electronic trading.
The benchmark S&P  was down 0.8 percent, or 11 points, at
1,330.20.	
 Gold rose to $1,614.71 an ounce, just off a new
record for the precious metal reached earlier in the session,
as it has been a favored asset of those seeking safety from
declining U.S. assets.	
 Currency trading also showed investors moving away from the
U.S. dollar, with the biggest drop in the greenback coming
against the Swiss franc. The dollar dropped to 0.8153 against
the Swiss franc , down 0.4 percent.	
 White House officials and Republican leaders scrambled on
Sunday to avoid a debt default, but the two sides were still
not close to a deal. House Speaker John Boehner told fellow
Republicans on a conference call that a large-scale debt deal
was not possible with President Barack Obama.	
 An aide to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told
Reuters on Sunday the Nevada senator was outlining a plan that
would cut $2.5 trillion in spending and increase the debt limit
that he hoped would be brought to the Senate floor this week.	
 Earlier in the day, White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley
warned that there would be a ""few stressful days"" ahead for
financial markets.	
 ""The unproductive course in DC may result in continued
volatility, especially now that the focus is turning away from
Europe, and back to the U.S.,"" said Robert Tipp, chief
investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income in Newark, New
Jersey.	
 U.S. bond futures prices fell but the losses were held in
check in part because of the fall in equity prices. The 10-year
Treasury bond fell 3/32 to 124 7/32. The Treasury is expected
to sell $99 billion in two-, five- and seven-year debt later in
the week.	
 Ratings agencies have warned of a possible downgrade of U.S.
triple-A rated debt if long-term budget cuts are not sufficient.
The safe-haven status of Treasuries may be slightly diminished
by a potential downgrade of U.S. debt but it will still hold
appeal for many investors. 
""A single notch ratings cut should not overwhelm the market,
the usual reaction to such a move is a sudden drop in Treasury
prices, then a recovery,"" said David Keeble, global head of
interest rate strategy with Credit Agricole Securities (USA)
Inc. in New York.	
 In the past few days, markets seesawed on reports suggesting
progress toward an agreement to cut the deficit that would allow
for the U.S. debt ceiling to be raised and avert a
market-roiling default.	
 U.S. crude oil  for September delivery in New York was
down 65 cents at $99.22 a barrel, and Brent oil futures 
in London were down 63 cents at $118.04. For more, see 
 ""There's an old saying that things don't matter until the
day they matter; we're getting close to the day when it will
matter,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential
Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

 NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street futures fell and
the U.S. dollar dropped as Washington appeared no closer on
Sunday to raising the U.S. debt ceiling in order to avert a
devastating default.
 S&P 500 futures fell at the open of electronic trading as
investors grew increasingly worried at the lack of progress.
The benchmark S&P  was down 1 percent, or 14 points, at
1,326.00.
 Early currency trading suggested a move away from the U.S.
dollar, with the biggest drop in the greenback coming against
the Swiss franc. In early Asian trading, the dollar dropped to
0.8121 against the Swiss franc , down 0.7 percent.

(Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Friday as investors focused on how the second rescue
package for Greece and measures to stop the European debt
crisis from spreading will be implemented.
 The euro hit a two-week high of $1.4440 on electronic
trading platform EBS in early global trading but further gains
were seen as limited. Analysts highlighted the risks to the
deal being implemented quickly and questions over long-term
debt sustainability.
 ""What you saw yesterday was a relief rally as the initial
numbers that came out were better than expected,"" said John
Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""Now
we're looking for details on how effective the plan might
actually be.""
 The euro  was last at $1.4368, down 0.4 percent on
the day after jumping nearly 1.5 percent on Thursday. Despite
easing on Friday, it was on track for its first weekly gain
against the dollar since the trading week ended July 1.
 The single currency jumped as high as 1.1894 Swiss francs
, according to EBS data, -- around 4.5 percent
above the record low of 1.1365 francs hit at the start of the
week -- as investors slashed safe-haven positions in the franc.
It last traded at 1.1743, down 0.1 percent.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the Swiss franc
.
 ""The deal is positive. A debt/growth deal is the only
solution for an insolvent country and that is what the EU has
done, but political and implementation risks remain,"" Lena
Komileva, global head of G10 currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman in London, said of the Greece plan.
 Euro zone leaders agreed on a bailout package that will
make it easier for Greece to reduce debt by easing terms of
loans and by making investors in Greek bonds shoulder some of
the burden. For more see [ID:nL6E7IK2VL] and [ID:nN1E76K237].
 Provisions were also made for limiting the damage from
ratings agencies declaring Greece to be in temporary default.
Fitch ratings said it will place the Greek sovereign issuer in
""restricted default"" in due course. [ID:nFIT587417]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 But analysts said the risk of the Greek crisis spreading to
other indebted euro zone countries would remain if Spanish and
Italian funding costs fail to reverse a recent spike higher.
""We could see some more euro/dollar upside in the near term
... Beyond the next few weeks, however, we suspect that the
upside in euro/dollar could be difficult to sustain,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi in London.
 FOCUS SWITCHES TO U.S.
 The euro could extend gains against the dollar if concerns
grow about the limited progress made by U.S. lawmakers in
budget talks ahead of an Aug. 2 deadline to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling. [ID:nLDE76L02B]
 The U.S. currency slipped to a four-month trough of 78.22
yen on EBS , the lowest since joint G7 intervention in
mid-March to curb yen strength, before recovering to 78.44 yen,
flat on the day.
 While efforts to craft a $3 trillion deficit-reduction deal
gained traction on Thursday, the White House and Republicans
have not broken their impasse over higher taxes, which are
opposed by the Republicans, who control the lower house.
 Although most market players expect some sort of deal by
Aug. 2 to raise the $14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling and
avoid default, some worry that failure to reach a major deficit
reduction plan could lead to a credit downgrading.
 ""It's brinkmanship and no one's going to blink until they
really have to,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""The market would really
like to see a big deal, something along the lines of $3 to $4
trillion that really addresses the structural problems of the
U.S. economy, that's kind of a mix of tax increases and
spending cuts.""

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - World stocks held firm on
Friday but the euro fell and Wall Street stocks were mixed as
investors turned their attention to the struggle in Washington
over raising the U.S. debt ceiling to avert a default in less
than two weeks.
 Investors were also digesting details of the new aid deal
for Greece and trying to gauge whether it is enough to stop the
euro zone debt crisis from turning into a global one.
 Anxiety over the absence of a U.S. debt compromise and
implementation of the second round of the Greek debt plan
renewed some safety bids for gold and U.S. and German
government debt.

 But Wall Street stocks <.DJI> <.SPX> <.IXIC> underperformed
their peers as a disappointing profit report from heavy

surprises in this week's batch of upbeat quarterly results.
 ""We had a little bit of shortfall from Caterpillar,"" said
Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx, an affiliate of
the Bank of New York. ""It's taking the market off a little

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a two-week
high against the dollar and rose against the safe-haven Swiss
franc on Friday after euro zone leaders agreed a second rescue
package for Greece and measures to stop the debt crisis
spreading.	
 The package was more ambitious than anticipated earlier this
week and propelled the euro to a two-week high of $1.4440 versus
the dollar and as much as 1 percent higher against the Swiss
franc.	
 Further euro gains were seen limited, however, with analysts
highlighting risks to the deal's quick implementation and
questions over long-term debt sustainability.	
 The euro faced resistance at the top of the daily Ichimoku
cloud -- a key technical indicator -- around $1.4455, together
with a downtrend from the May highs at $1.4462, where traders
reported offers.	
 The euro was last at $1.4403, down 0.2 percent on the
day after jumping nearly 1.5 percent on Thursday.	
 ""The market rallied because euro zone leaders managed to
agree on something, but there is still an awful lot of analysis
going on into the deal they have come up with,"" said Maurice
Pomery, managing director at Strategic Alpha.	
 ""The problem is the bailout is dealing with a liquidity
crisis, not an insolvency crisis,"" he said.	
 Implied volatilities on euro/dollar options continued to
fall as fears receded that disappointment over the summit could
pummel the euro. One-month volatility fell below 12
percent from above 13 percent before the summit.	
 The single currency jumped as high as 1.1894 Swiss francs
, according to EBS data, -- around 4.5 percent above
the record low of 1.1365 francs hit at the start of the week --
as investors slashed safe-haven positions in the franc. 
 ""The deal is positive. A debt/growth deal is the only
solution for an insolvent country and that is what the EU has

shoulder some of the burden. 
 Provisions were also made for limiting the damage from
ratings agencies declaring Greece to be in temporary default.
Fitch ratings said it will place the Greek sovereign issuer in
""restricted default"" in due course.

 The dollar index stood at 74.085, not far from
Thursday's six-week low of 73.889, when it posted its biggest
daily drop of the year having clearly broken below trendline
support that had held since May.	
 The U.S. currency also slipped to a four-month trough of
78.22 yen , the lowest since joint G7 intervention in
mid-March to curb yen strength, before recovering to 78.43 yen.

 These concerns pushed the U.S. dollar to a 30-year low

1/2-year low against the Canadian dollar .

 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a two-week high
on Friday, while the euro and oil prices rose as a stronger than
expected new rescue package for Greece allayed immediate
concerns about the spread of Europe's debt crisis.	
 The dollar was subdued, however, as uncertainty intensified
as to whether U.S. lawmakers could strike a last-minute deal to
raise the country's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and avoid their
own default.	
 Many economists also warned that the Greek deal would not
draw a line under Europe's problems in the longer-term,
highlighting the risks to its quick implementation and whether
political leaders could sell it to their respective countries.	
 ""The deal is positive. A debt/growth deal is the only
solution for an insolvent country and that is what the EU has
done, but political and implementation risks remain,"" said Lena
Komileva, global head of G10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman.	
 At an emergency summit on Thursday, euro zone leaders
promised a second bailout with an extra 109 billion euros ($157
billion) of government money, plus a contribution by private
sector bondholders estimated to total as much as 50 billion
euros by mid-2014. 
 The region's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility, will be allowed to buy bonds in the secondary market
if necessary and also to lend governments money to recapitalise
banks.	
 The broad nature of the deal -- it involves private
investors and actively cuts Greece's debt burden -- raised
optimism that investors may now hold off with a fresh attack
that could trouble Spain and Italy.	
 They took in their stride a statement by Fitch that it would
declare Greece in restricted default on its debt -- seen as an
expected consequence of Thursday's deal.	
 MSCI world equity index rose 0.5 percent to
its highest in two weeks. European stocks was up 0.65
percent while emerging stocks bounced nearly 1 percent
to its highest in more than a week.	
 U.S. stock futures ,  pointed to a firm start
for Wall Street.	
 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.2 percent to $99.34 a barrel
while the euro was firm at $1.4415, hovering near a
two-week high against the dollar and jumping versus the Swiss
franc.	
 The cost of insuring Greek, Irish and Portuguese bonds
tumbled as did yields on peripheral debt while safe-haven Bund
futures fell.	
 Ten-year Greek bond yields fell by more than 1
percentage point to 15.64 percent, Portuguese 10-year debt
yields were down 49 basis points, and Irish yields
fell 45 basis points.	
 Analysts welcomed the fact the plan foresaw an easing of the
terms on the bailout loans to Greece, Ireland and Portugal but
had a series of questions over the involvement of bondholders
and the amount of liabilities the rescue fund can run up.	
 ""We still have to calculate the contingent liabilities of
the EFSF and finally the contingent liabilities of Germany from
all these rescue operations. But the markets are happy for the
time being,"" said Kornelius Purps, strategist at Unicredit in
Munich.	
 
 U.S. DEBT CEILING	
 The dollar eased against a basket of major
currencies, and ceded ground to growth-linked currencies like
the Australian dollar .	
 Efforts to avoid a U.S. default were underway in Washington
with President Barack Obama and top lawmakers sought a
last-minute deficit-reduction deal before the Aug. 2 deadline to
raise the country's debt ceiling.	
 Congressional aides report that a compromise plan could
include up to $3 trillion in spending cuts but might leave tax
reform for later.	
 The main obstacle remains the issue of tax increases that
Obama's Democrats demand and Republicans vehemently oppose.	
 Most investor appear to have been working on the assumption
that a deal would be forthcoming to stop a default. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained 1.2 percent on Thursday
on optimism both about Europe and the U.S. debt debate.

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a two-week
high against the dollar and rose against the safe-haven Swiss
franc on Friday after euro zone leaders agreed a second rescue
package for Greece and steps to stop the debt crisis spreading
to other countries.	
 The package was more ambitious than anticipated earlier this
week and propelled the euro to a two-week high of $1.4440 versus
the dollar and as much as 1 percent higher against the Swiss
franc.	
 Further euro gains were seen limited, however, with analysts
highlighting risks to the deal's quick implementation and
questions over whether it will ease concerns about long-term
debt sustainability.	
 The euro faced resistance at the top of the daily Ichimoku
cloud -- a key technical indicator -- around $1.4455, with
traders reporting offers above that level. The euro was
last at $1.4397, down 0.2 percent on the day after jumping
nearly 1.5 percent on Thursday.	
 ""The market rallied because euro zone leaders managed to
agree on something, but there is still an awful lot of analysis
going on into the deal they have come up with,"" said Maurice
Pomery, managing director at Strategic Alpha, which advises
banks and hedge funds on currencies.	
 ""The problem is the bailout is dealing with a liquidity
crisis, not an insolvency crisis,"" he said.	
 Implied volatilities on euro/dollar options dropped as fears
receded that disappointment over the summit could pummel the
euro. One-month volatility fell below 12 percent from
above 13 percent before the summit.	
 The single currency jumped as high as 1.1894 Swiss francs
, according to EBS data, -- around 4.5 percent above
the record low of 1.1365 francs hit at the start of the week --
as investors slashed long Swiss franc positions that had been
built on fears euro zone leaders might not reach a comprehensive
deal.	
 It later pared gains to trade at 1.1813 francs. 
 ""The deal is positive. A debt/growth deal is the only
solution for an insolvent country and that is what the EU has
done, but political and implementation risks remain,"" said Lena
Komileva, global head of G10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman.	
 Euro zone leaders agreed on a bailout package that will
make it easier for Greece to reduce debt more sustainably by
easing terms of loans and by making Greek bond investors
shoulder some of the burden. 
 Provisions were also made for limiting the damage if, as
seems likely, credit rating agencies declare Greece to be in
temporary default.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	
 But analysts said risks of the Greek crisis spreading to
other indebted euro zone countries would remain if Spanish and
Italian funding costs fail to reverse a recent spike higher.	
 ""We could see some more euro/dollar upside in the near term
... Beyond the next few weeks, however, we suspect that the
upside in euro/dollar could be difficult to sustain,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.	
 
 FOCUS SWITCHES TO U.S.	
 The euro could extend gains against the dollar if concerns
grow about the limited progress made by U.S. lawmakers in budget
talks ahead of an Aug 2 deadline to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling. 
 A break above $1.4455 could see the euro target $1.4520, a
61.8 percent retracement of its decline since May, and the July
high around $1.4577.	
 The dollar index stood at 74.049, not far from
Thursday's six-week low of 73.889, when it posted its biggest
daily drop of the year having clearly broken below trendline
support that had held since May.	
 The U.S. currency also slipped to a four-month trough of
78.22 yen , the lowest since joint G7 intervention in
mid-March to curb yen strength, before recovering to 78.51 yen.	
 While efforts to craft a $3 trillion deficit-reduction deal
gained traction on Thursday, the White House and Republicans
have not broken their impasse over higher taxes, which are
opposed by the Republicans, who control the lower house.	
 Although most market players expect some sort of deal by Aug
2 to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and avoid default,
some worry that failure to reach a major deficit reduction plan
could lead to a credit downgrading.	
 These concerns pushed the U.S. dollar to a 30-year low
against the New Zealand dollar and kept it near a 3
1/2-year low against the Canadian dollar .

 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a two-week high
on Friday and the euro and oil prices rose after European
leaders agreed on a package to rescue Greece that hopes to
prevent the region's debt crisis from deepening.	
 The dollar was under pressure as uncertainty intensified as
to whether U.S. lawmakers could strike on a last-minute deal to
raise the country's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling to avoid a
default.	
 The deal on Greece showed that Europe was taking stronger
action than markets had expected although many economists warned

 The region's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability

banks.	
 The comprehensive nature of the deal raised optimism that
Spain and Italy may avoid the sort of spiral into Greece's
problems may be prevented spread into other indebted peripheral
countries such as Spain and Italy.	
 ""It is encouraging they have come up with something and
dealt with some of the restructuring,"" Louise Cooper, markets
analyst at BGC Partners. ""The markets have got excited about
it."" 
 ""But the cuts to Greek debt do not put the country on a
sustainable footing for growth and does not take us where we
want to be."" 
 MSCI world equity index rose 0.4 percent to
levels not seen in a fortnight. European stocks added
half a percent and emerging stocks bounced 1 percent.	
 U.S. crude oil  rose half a percent to $99.66 a
barrel.	
 Bund futures  Fell 43 ticks while credit default
swaps of Greece and other peripheral countries fell broadly.	
 ""We still have to calculate the contingent liabilities of
the EFSF and finally the contingent liabilities of Germany from
all these rescue operations. But the markets are happy for the

 TOKYO/SYDNEY, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to a
two-week high against the dollar in Asia on Friday after
euro-zone officials gave their financial rescue fund sweeping
new powers to solve Greece's debt troubles, easing fears that
the country's debt crisis would spread.
 The dollar was punished across the board as the encouraging
news out of Europe contrasted with confusion over how much
progress Washington is making to avoid a U.S. default.
""Europe has made a big stride after all while the U.S. is
still dragging its feet on the debt ceiling. That's why the
dollar is under pressure now,"" said a dealer at a Japanese bank
in Tokyo.
Markets cheered the package as it was more ambitious than
some had expected earlier this week. The euro climbed to a
two-week high of $1.4440  before steadying around
$1.4390.
 The euro is around the level of the 50 percent retracement
of its decline from early May until last week, in which worry
about the euro zone debt crisis played a big role.
 European leaders have agreed on a bailout package that
would make it easier for Greece to reduce debt more sustainably
by easing terms of loans and by making Greek bond investors
shoulder some of the burden. [nL6E7IK2VL] [nN1E76K237]
 As these measures are likely to prompt credit rating firms
to declare Greece to be in temporary default, the leaders also
made provisions to protect Greek banks from the fallout, by
providing credit guarantees if needed to ensure they can still
obtain liquidity from the European Central Bank.
 The region's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility, will be allowed to buy bonds in the secondary market
if necessary and also to lend governments money to recapitalise
banks.
 ""The package has made it difficult to make speculative
attacks on the euro. But they were vague on increasing the size
of the bailout fund. That's one weak point,"" said another
trader at a Japanese bank.
 Euro bears say it is yet to be seen if the measures can
stabilise other indebted countries and stave off contagion to
the currency bloc's bigger economies.
 Still, it was enough to prompt short-covering in the euro.
 ""It's probably not a long-term solution but it provides
some clarity ... At the end of the day it doesn't address key
issues, but it will contain contagion,"" said Grant Turley, a
strategist at ANZ in Sydney.
 The common currency could target around $1.4455, where
charts show an Elliot wave equality target as well as the top
of the Ichimoku cloud, and then $1.4520, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its decline since May.
 Implied volatilities on euro/dollar options dropped as
fears receded that disappointment over the summit could pummel
the euro. One-month volatility  fell to below 12
percent from above 13 percent before the summit.
 The single currency also rose to around 1.1765 Swiss francs
, 3.5 percent above the record low of 1.1365 francs
hit at the start of the week.
 DOLLAR INDEX BELOW TRENDLINE
 As the euro recovered, the dollar index <.DXY> wallowed
near a six-week low after posting its biggest daily drop of the
year on Thursday.
 The index stood at 74.096, near Thursday's low of 73.889,
having clearly broken below its trendline support since May.
 The U.S. currency also slipped to a four-month trough of
78.22 yen , the lowest since joint G7 intervention in
mid-March, before recovering to 78.58 yen.
 Still, few traders think Japan is ready to intervene in the
near future, in part because the yen is still off recent peaks
against most currencies except the dollar.
 Japanese margin traders have a huge long position in the
dollar, which means any intervention would likely only invite
their profit-taking and have a limited impact.
 Pricing of dollar/yen options also suggested limited
expectations of Japan's intervention with scant demand for yen
puts, whose value would gain sharply in the event of yen
selling intervention.
 Their risk reversal spreads, which measure the price gap
between yen calls and yen puts, rose to the highest level in
four months in favour of yen calls, pointing to limited demand
for yen puts.
 That contrasts with the days following Japan's intervention
last September, when many market players bought yen puts for
hedging.
 While an enlivened risk appetite after the euro-zone debt
deal and the entrenched perception that U.S. monetary policy
will remain loose for the foreseeable future are the main
damper on the currency, some traders say the dollar was not
helped by uncertainty over wrangling in Washington on the debt
ceiling.
 Efforts to craft a $3 trillion deficit-reduction deal
gained traction on Thursday, but the White House and
Republicans have not broken their impasse over higher taxes.
Tax hikes are opposed by the Republicans, who control the lower
house.
 Although most market players expect some sort of deal by
the Aug. 2 deadline to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling
and avoid default, some worry that failure to reach a major
deficit reduction plan could lead to a credit downgrading.
 As the U.S. dollar wilted, the New Zealand dollar stayed
near a 30-year high of  $0.8643 hit on Thursday while
the Canadian dollar also remained near a 3 1/2-year high of
C$0.9424 .

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 22 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose and the
euro climbed to a two-week high on Friday after European leaders
agreed on a package to rescue debt-stricken Greece and gains
will be sustained if U.S. policymakers also manage to cobble
together a last minute deal.	
 European shares are set to open higher with financial
spreadbetters expecting major indices to open between 0.6 to 0.7
percent higher. 
 Even as markets greeted the Europe rescue package
news with relief, the single currency still faces considerable
headwinds in its march towards a early May peak of near $1.50 as
doubts regarding longer-term effectiveness of the deal remained.

 For now, euro-sensitive plays, such as Japanese stocks
including Canon and Nikon climbed, benefiting
from the currency's strength, which would boost their exports.	
 Hong Kong shares were the clear outperformers in the
region for the day with HSBC Holdings -- which makes
up a chunky 15 percent of Hong Kong's Hang Seng index -- up
nearly 3 percent, helping the index gain 1.7 percent. 
 An emergency summit of leaders of the 17-nation currency
area pledged on Thursday to conduct a second bailout of Greece
with an extra 109 billion euros ($157 billion) of government
money, plus a contribution by private sector bondholders
estimated to total as much as 50 billion euros by mid-2014.

 Investors who have been stricken by a series of factors
ranging from the U.S. and Europe debt crises to concerns about a
sharp slowdown in China used this rare bit of good news to pick
up bargains.	
 Australian shares rose 1 percent while
Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.8 percent though a stronger yen
may check gains. 
The MSCI index of shares for Asia ex-Japan
rose more than 1.1 percent, set for a fourth consecutive day of
gains. 
 Equity gains were also sustained by a strong close on Wall
Street with banks among the best performers after surprisingly
strong results from Morgan Stanley . 
 In credit markets, the Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment grade
index tightened by it biggest margin in over three
months, pulling in by five basis points to 115 bps.	
 Emerging markets remain a preferred investment destination
despite the uncertainty surrounding markets. Both emerging
market equities and debt recorded decent inflows in the week
ended July 20, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.

 EURO GAINS SHORT-LIVED? 
 Demand for risk was also rekindled as hopes of a
breakthrough in the U.S. debt deadlock gathered momentum with
the White House and top lawmakers scrambling to sort through
competing options before a Aug. 2 deadline. 
 In currency markets, the euro vaulted more than 1 percent to
as high as $1.4440 on trading platform EBS in early
trades, the highest level since July 6, before easing slightly
to $1.4385, up more than a percent since Thursday.	
 The single currency's way forward is strewn with technical
resistance levels in the areas of 1.4458, 1.4493 and 1.4519. 
 Barclays Capital said the latest rescue package remains
short of key details in areas like private sector involvement
and the proposed size of the euro zone's rescue fund.	
 ""The dollar is broadly weighed down, while the euro was
lifted mainly by short-covering and it may have some more room
to climb until around $1.45,"" said Makoto Noji, senior bond and
currency strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.	
 ""Still, the market is not overly optimistic as the euro's
effective exchange rate has not come up. The euro also remains
under pressure against the Swiss franc and the yen as the euro
zone debt problems linger,"" Noji said.	
 Elsewhere, gold fell to around $1,590 an ounce, about $20
below a record high of near $1,610 set on Tuesday. Silver
tumbled more than 2 percent.	
 In bond markets, yields on ten-year U.S. Treasury notes
stabilised around 3 percent after rising by more
than 12 basis points in the past three sessions.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
rallied on Thursday after news that Europe will create a fund
to make cheap loans to Greece and reports that Washington is
near a deal to shrink its budget and raise the debt ceiling.
 European officials at an emergency summit in Brussels
agreed to a second round of aid to Greece worth 109 billion
euros, while the European Financial Stability Facility, the
euro zone's bailout fund, will provide loans to Greece at a
lower interest rate and for longer maturities. For more, see:
[ID:nL6E7IK2VL]
 In the United States, two major newspapers reported the
White House and top Republican lawmakers are close to striking
a debt-reduction deal. This would remove the major political
hurdle to raise the statutory $14.3 trillion debt ceiling so
the United States can avoid a default in early August and the
loss of its top-notch credit rating. See [ID:nN1E76J292]
 The White House denied the reports of a debt deal.
 Perception of progress to resolve the messy debt situations
on both sides on the Atlantic reduced fears they would drag
down the global economy and led traders to cut holdings of gold
and U.S. and German government bonds.
 ""The market has gone from very pessimistic to hopeful,""
said Mark Pawlak, market strategist at Keefe Bruyette & Woods
in New York. ""Taking it on face value, these developments are
positive for risk assets.""
 Another batch of strong company profit announcements,
including those from American Express  and Nokia Corp,
  also fueled investor optimism.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended 152.50
points, or 1.21 percent, higher at 12,724.41. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 17.96 points, or 1.35 percent,
to 1,343.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 20.20
points, or 0.72 percent, at 2,834.43.
 European stocks rose 1.1 percent <.FTEU3> to a 1-1/2-week
high, while emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 0.6 percent.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWO00000PUS> jumped 1.5
percent on the day to its highest in almost two weeks.
 In the currency market, the euro  rose to a two-week
high. It gained 1.2 percent to $1.4387. [FRX/]
 While stocks and the euro rose, gold and U.S. and German
government bond prices fell.
 The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond  fell more than
a point in price to yield 4.32 percent, while the benchmark
10-year note  declined 24/32 to yield 3.02 percent.
German Bund futures  fell 0.9 percent at 127.00.
 Spot gold  fell to $1,590.14 an ounce on the EU
measures to combat the region's debt crisis. It was 1.2 percent
below the record $1,609.51 set on Tuesday. [GOL/]
 In other commodities, U.S. crude for August delivery in New
York  was up 83 cents at $99.23 a barrel, but Brent oil
futures  in London were down 21 cents at $117.93 after a
bout of late selling. For more, see [O/R]

rallied on Thursday after news that Europe will create a fund
to make cheap loans to Greece and reports that Washington is
near a deal to shrink its budget and raise the debt ceiling.
 European officials at an emergency summit in Brussels
agreed to a second round of aid to Greece worth 109 billion
euros, while the European Financial Stability Facility, the
euro zone's bailout fund, will provide loans to Greece at a
lower interest rate and for longer maturities.
 In the United States, two major newspapers reported the
White House and top Republican lawmakers are close to striking
a debt-reduction deal. This would remove the major political
hurdle to raise the statutory $14.3 trillion debt ceiling so
the United States can avoid a default in early August and the
loss of its top-notch credit rating.
 The White House denied the reports of a debt deal.
 Perception of progress to resolve the messy debt situations
on both sides on the Atlantic reduced fears they would drag
down the global economy and led traders to cut holdings of gold
and U.S. and German government bonds.
 ""The market has gone from very pessimistic to hopeful,""
said Mark Pawlak, market strategist at Keefe Bruyette & Woods
in New York. ""Taking it on face value, these developments are
positive for risk assets.""
 Another batch of strong company profit announcements,
including those from American Express and Nokia Corp, also
fueled investor optimism.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended 152.50
points, or 1.21 percent, higher at 12,724.41. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 17.96 points, or 1.35 percent,
to 1,343.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 20.20
points, or 0.72 percent, at 2,834.43.
 European stocks rose 1.1 percent <.FTEU3> to a 1-1/2-week
high, while emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 0.7 percent.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWO00000PUS> jumped 1.5
percent on the day to its highest in almost two weeks.
 In the currency market, the euro  rose to a two-week
high. It gained 1.2 percent to $1.4387. [FRX/]
 While stocks and the euro rose, gold and U.S. and German
government bond prices fell.
 The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond  fell a point
in price to yield 4.31 percent, while the benchmark 10-year
note  declined 21/32 to yield 3.00 percent. German
Bund futures  fell 0.9 percent at 127.00.
 Spot gold  fell to $1,590.14 an ounce on the EU
measures to combat the region's debt crisis. It was 1.2 percent
below the record $1,609.51 set on Tuesday. [GOL/]
 In other commodities, U.S. crude for August delivery in New
York  was up 83 cents at $99.23 a barrel, but Brent oil
futures  in London were down 21 cents at $117.93 after a
bout of late selling. For more, see [O/R]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to a
two-week high against the dollar on Thursday after a draft plan
by European officials to provide cheap loans to Greece and
other heavily indebted euro zone countries eased fears of
contagion.
 They were considering a sweeping expansion of the role of
the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund to help
states sooner, recapitalize banks and intervene in the
secondary bond market, a draft summit statement obtained by
Reuters showed. For details, see [ID:nL6E7IK2VL]
 ""The fact that the EU has thrown everything including the
kitchen sink into this is very comforting for investors and
unless the rating agencies say this is not enough for Greece to
avoid a default, the euro should hold onto its gains,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.4402  on trading
platform EBS, the highest level since July 6, before easing
slightly to $1.4371, up 1.1 percent on the day. It also rose
about 0.8 percent to 1.1744 Swiss francs .
 According to the draft, the EFSF will provide loans to
Greece, Ireland and Portugal at a lower interest rate and for
longer maturities.
 In a policy reversal, the European Central Bank signaled
that it is willing to let Greece default temporarily under the
crisis response that would also involve a bond buyback and a
debt swap, but no new tax on banks.
 Slow progress on resolving Greece's debt crisis has been a
major headwind for the euro. Investors fear Europe's debt
crisis, which has also engulfed Portugal and Ireland, could
spread to the much bigger economies of Spain and Italy.
 ""If the ECB was not able to accept Greek bonds as a
collateral, the financing for Greek banks would stop and that
would pull down the whole European banking system,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New
York. ""That's where the biggest worry was before the meeting.""
 Peripheral debt rallied after news of the draft documents.
Yields tumbled on short-dated Greek debt, down more than 4.5
percent in the two-year segment, while the more liquid Italian
and Spanish debt markets also showed substantial relief.
 CONCERNS REMAIN
 Some key questions remained, analysts said, such as the
total cost of the program, whether it can win the backing of
member nations, and how weaker economies can reduce their debt
burdens to sustainable levels over the long term.
 ""The ultimate success of the new EU crisis management
program will be determined not by its ability to halt the
market contagion of recent weeks but by its ability to halt the
fundamental deterioration of EU sovereign credits. The total
cost of stabilizing the EU's weakest link has yet to become
clear,"" said Lena Komileva, global head of G10 strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 In contrast to the optimism on Europe, investors remained
wary ahead of an August 2 deadline for raising the U.S. public
debt ceiling to avoid a default, and the threat of a downgrade
to the United States' triple-A credit rating.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's said on Thursday there was
a 50-50 chance it would lower the long-term U.S. credit rating
within the next three months. [ID:nN1E76K0FL]
 The White House said there was growing momentum toward a
significant deficit reduction plan that would include both
spending cuts and tax increases. Congressional aides, however,
said the parameters of any potential agreement remained fluid.
See [ID:nN1E76J292]
 The dollar hit a four-month low against the yen of 78.31
, according to Reuters data, the lowest since joint G7
intervention in mid-March to stem a rise in the Japanese
currency. The dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 78.55 yen.
 ""The pendulum is clearly swinging ... toward Europe right
now, whereas the U.S. is a little bit trailing behind in terms
of waiting for positive news,"" Wells Fargo's Serebriakov said.

 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
rose on Thursday after news of a plan to use the European
bailout fund to make cheap loans to Greece and other heavily
indebted governments in the euro zone.
 The new proposal from a summit of European leaders in
Brussels reduced fears the debt crisis would spread to other
euro zone countries and led traders to cut holdings of gold and
U.S. and German government bonds.
 Also, Wall Street stocks touched session highs and U.S.
Treasuries recouped some ground on a newspaper report that U.S.
President Barack Obama and top Republicans in Congress are
close to an agreement in negotiations over deficit reduction
and the government's statutory $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.
White House and the top House Republicans, however, denied the
New York Times report.
 In the euro zone's debt crisis, the region's bailout fund
known as the European Financial Stability Facility will provide
loans to Greece, Ireland and Portugal at a lower interest rate
and for longer maturities, according to draft summit
conclusions seen by Reuters.
 Loans from the EFSF will be extended from 7.5 years to at
least 15 years and the interest rate will be lowered from
around 4.5 percent, for Greece and Portugal, to around 3.5
percent, the draft document said. For more see
[ID:nB5E7HN032].
 ""It seems like they may have some solution rather than just
kicking the can down the road,"" said Larry Milstein, head of
government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co in New
York. ""This could make it easier for them to pay their loans.""
 Other measures being considered include a bond buyback, but
not new taxes on banks, sources said.
 Some investors, however, still worry about a possible Greek
default, which officials at the emergency summit have not ruled
out. This could have repercussions across the European banking
system, which holds a hefty sum of euro zone sovereign debt.
 ""An extension of the loans for Greece and increased
flexibility for the EFSF to recapitalize institutions takes the
heat off the ECB,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""It's definitely positive
for the euro. It's not a panacea, but it's a step in the right
direction.""
 In the credit default swap market, the cost to insure
European sovereign debt fell broadly. The five-year CDS price
on Greek government bond slipped to 2,264 basis points, down
almost 100 basis points on the day and its lowest level in
nearly two weeks, according to Markit.
 EARNINGS LIFT STOCKS
 Strong company profit announcements continued to buoy stock
prices on global markets, mitigating anxiety over slowing
economic growth and Washington's wrangling over the need to
raise the $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.

 By Nia Williams	
 LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro recouped ground on
Thursday on signs officials were nearing a deal to bailout
Greece with the help of the private sector, although some
players were unnerved by the prospect of that including a
short-term default.	
 The euro dived early in the session as players unwound some
of the bullish positions built up ahead of a summit of euro zone
leaders -- prompted largely by a knee-jerk reaction to officials
admitting openly a selective default was on the cards.	
 Ahead of the crisis summit, Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees
de Jager said a short-term or selective default for Greece,
previously opposed by the European Central Bank, was now a
possibility.	
EU sources said the ECB -- one of the key barriers to a
broader solution to the Greek crisis -- was willing to give way
on the default issue. 
 The euro jumped to $1.4240 from as low as $1.4190 after the
draft outline of the summit proposals emerged. 
 ""The market was long and is quite nervous. This talk of the
possibility of a default and the package not being quite as neat
as people expected from a banking point of view is not helping,""
said Sebastien Galy, FX strategist at Societe Generale.	
 ""There are a tremendous amount of leaks coming through but
most of the information we already know. That means technical
levels are very important right now,"" SocGen's Galy said.	
 The euro earlier hit a low for the day of $1.4138 and
technical analysts said the outlook for the euro was likely to
be bearish while it remained below resistance around $1.4300,
coinciding with the 100- and 55-day moving averages.	
 Downside support for the euro is now seen at $1.4120, the
61.8 percent retracement of the July move higher, at the
200-week moving average around $1.4023, and then at the 200-day
moving average at $1.3914.	
 ""If the euro closes the week below $1.40 and below the
200-week moving average then it is likely to head towards
$1.35,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

 CONTAGION FEARS	
 Fears that Greece's debt crisis could spread to bigger
economies in the euro zone have kept markets on edge since early
July, with yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds
reaching euro zone lifetime highs above 6 percent.	
 Analysts said market players would be looking to see whether
the summit agreement soothed contagion concerns.	
 ""Anything that comes out needs to be really convincing to
limit the risk of contagion to Italy and Spain which has
materialised in the last few weeks,"" said Derek Halpenny,
currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. 
 Traders had also been worried by worse-than-forecast
purchasing managers' surveys for Germany and the euro zone as a
whole as weighing on the single currency. 
 Investors remained wary ahead of an August 2 deadline for
raising the U.S. public debt ceiling to avoid a default, and the
threat of a downgrade to the United States' triple-A credit
rating.	
 Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser

for the possibility that the United States could default.

 The Australian dollar dipped 0.4 percent to $1.0699
amid the bout of risk aversion, compounding losses sustained
after a survey of manufacturers' showed activity in China's
manufacturing sector shrank in July.

 LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly and world
stocks slipped from a 1-1/2 week high on Thursday after European
officials said a selective default for Greece was a live
possibility, raising concerns about implications for the banking
sector.	
 A survey showing the euro zone's private sector grew at its
weakest pace in almost two years and nervousness surrounding
U.S. debt talks also sapped investors' tolerance for risk.	
 Ahead of a crisis summit of euro zone leaders, Dutch Finance
Minister Jan Kees de Jager said a short-term or selective
default for Greece, previously opposed by the European Central
Bank, was now a possibility. 
 EU sources said the European Central Bank is willing to let
Greece slip into temporary default.
 Germany and France will later present details of the accord
they thrashed out over seven hours on Wednesday to their fellow
leaders, who are trying to prevent fears of a Greek default from
poisoning access to the bond market for bigger euro zone states
such as Italy and Spain .	
 ""The market was long and is quite nervous. This talk of the
possibility of a default and the package not being quite as neat
as people expected from a banking point of view is not helping,""
said Sebastien Galy, FX strategist at Societe Generale.	
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.1 percent
on the day, having hit a 1-1/2 week high earlier. European
stocks fell 0.1 percent while emerging stocks
lost 0.2 percent.	
 U.S. stock futures were unchanged on the day ,
pointing to a steady open on Wall Street later.	
 Growth in the euro zone's manufacturing sector virtually
ground to a halt in July while its dominant service sector grew
at its slowest rate in 22 months as demand from abroad fell and
the region's debt crisis weighed on minds at home
.	
 A separate survey showed activity in China's manufacturing
sector shrank for the first time in a year in July, although the
figures had little sustained impact after the latest GDP report
showed overall growth remained robust. 
 U.S. crude oil  fell 0.4 percent to $98.02 a barrel.	
 Bund futures  fell 20 ticks while ten-year Italian
and Spanish bond yields nudged
higher on the day.	
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.4170, erasing earlier
gains.	
 ""Anything that comes out (from the summit) needs to be
really convincing to limit the risk of contagion to Italy and
Spain which has materialised in the last few weeks,"" said Derek
Halpenny, currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 
 US DEBT CRISIS 
 The dollar gained across the board, having earlier come
under pressure on concerns about the debt talks in Washington.	
 U.S. lawmakers and the White House are struggling to reach a
deficit-reduction deal to raise the government's $14.3 billion
debt ceiling and avoid a default .	
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent against a basket of
major currencies.	
 There have been glimmers of hope in Washington this week for
a compromise based on a broad deficit-cutting proposal from a
bipartisan group of senators that could stave off default and
salvage America's triple-A credit rating.	
 But the stakes are so high and the divide so wide between
President Barack Obama and his Republican rivals that
negotiations could go down to the wire early next month.

(Updates)	
 By Cecile Lefort and Eric Burroughs	
 HONG KONG/SYDNEY, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro edged up
against the dollar on Thursday after Germany and France agreed
on a joint position for bailing out Greece, stoking hopes for
real progress at the coming European summit after an array of
false starts.	
 Market players are looking to see if European leaders can
thrash out a framework for keeping the raging debt crisis from
engulfing more countries and threatening the banking system,
with many worried that hopes for a resolution will once again be
dashed.	
 But the euro has been propped up as the dollar suffers on
worries that U.S. lawmakers and the White House will be unable
to cobble together a budget compromise and lift the debt ceiling
as the Aug. 2 deadline rapidly approaches.	
 The Australian dollar dipped after a survey of
manufacturers' showed activity in China's manufacturing sector
shrinking for the first time in a year in July, but the figures
had little sustained impact after the latest GDP report showed
overall growth remained robust.	
 All eyes were fixed on the European Union summit as
investors look for a resolution to the uncertainty around Greece
that has driven bond yields on the much larger economies of
Italy and Spain sharply higher.	
 ""Success will have to be judged by the extent to which the
summit will provide a framework that will limit contagion risk
to both the banking system and weaker peripherals, and repair
the credibility deficit of the EU,"" said analysts at Deutsche
Bank in a note to clients.	
 The euro popped higher on news German Chancellor Angela
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy had reached a joint
position late on Wednesday on a new bailout plan for Greece that
will include participation of the banking sector.

 The euro touched a high of $1.4275 before steadying at
$1.4254 , up 0.3 percent on the day and gaining about 1
percent so far this week. 
 Markets have been disappointed before, making the single
currency vulnerable to a pull-back. Support is seen at $1.4133
with immediate resistance at around $1.4282, the euro's high on
July 14, and the 100-day moving average at $1.4302.	
 Fears that Greece's crisis will spread to bigger economies
in the region such as Italy and Spain have kept investors on
edge. Earlier this week, yields on Italian and Spanish
government bonds jumped above 6 percent before easing back. 
 ""We expect little concrete in terms of measures to reduce
contagion more broadly,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head of G10
FX strategy at Nomura in New York. 
 The nervousness over the euro zone debt crisis has been
reflected in euro options, given the resilience of the single
currency. Risk reversals show hedge funds and
investors holding hefty put positions in case the euro were to
take a hit.	
 
 
 RESILIENT RISK	
 Risk currencies have held up well given all the worries
about the debt crisis in Europe, the threat of the United States
temporarily defaulting on its benchmark bonds and the latest
signal that China's red-hot economy losing some steam.	
 The Aussie dipped 0.3 percent to $1.0712 and hit a
low of $1.0704, finding some near-term chart support after the
China flash PMI confirmed talk of a sub-50 figure showing
contraction.	
 The HSBC flash purchasing managers index for China helped
dent the kiwi , which was flat on the day at $0.8564
after having earlier powered to a fresh 30-year peak at $0.8588.	
 The U.S. dollar was broadly softer weighed by uncertainty
ahead of the Aug. 2 U.S. debt ceiling deadline, with the threat
of benchmark, AAA-rated Treasuries getting their credit rating
cut in the event of a default. 
 The White House signaled it could support a short-term
increase in the U.S. borrowing limit for ""a few days"" if
lawmakers agreed to a broad deficit reduction deal but needed
more time to pass it.	
 Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser
told Reuters on Wednesday that the Fed is actively preparing for
the possibility that the United States could default.

 The dollar slipped to 78.70 yen , nearing a one week
trough, from 79.31 on Wednesday and to 0.8197 Swiss francs
.	
 The greenback remains 1.7 percent lower against the Swissy
for the week and almost 12 percent for the year so far as
investors have favoured the franc given the troubles plaguing
the world's two major reserve currencies.	
 The dollar index slipped 0.2 percent to 74.680 ,
threatening to break chart support at 74.54/53 -- an upward
trendline from the May lows as well as the base of the Ichimoku
cloud.

(Drops the word 'data' from lead)	
 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro climbed for a third
day on Thursday after news about a France-Germany accord on
Greece's debt crisis relieved some concerns ahead of a European
summit, while Asian stocks slipped after China manufacturing
contracted for the first time in a year.	
 In a potentially dangerous combination for investors, the
flash Chinese PMI reading for July also reflected a jump in
inflation, causing S&P 500 equity futures to cut gains and
knocking mainland Chinese stocks further below a two-month high
hit on Monday.	
 Gold cut its losses and oil reversed early gains after the
China data and investors squared up before the euro zone crisis
summit in Brussels later in the day.	
 Pending details of the deal between France and Germany that
supposedly included European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet, investors were cautious about pushing the euro much
higher.	
 
 Deep questions remain about Europe, including whether a
second bailout of Greece will address contagion in other
fiscally weak countries such as Portugal and Ireland or even
Spain and Italy, whose bond markets have been savaged in July.	
 ""Judging from the current crop of headlines, the most
negative outcome for the euro would be a debt rollover without
additional measures,"" Todd Elmer, currency strategist with Citi,
said in a note.	
 ""Of course, the euro already appreciating ahead of the
meeting and moves in other asset classes somewhat more modest
than the FX price action would suggest it is far from clear that
currency gains could be sustained beyond the short-term.""	
 
 TECH CHECK	
 Summit hopes are also expected to help European stocks open
higher as well. Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE
100 to open 3 to 5 points higher, or as much as 0.1
percent, Germany's DAX to open 12 to 18 points higher,
or as much as 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 to open
around 8 points higher, or as much as 0.2 percent.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
was down 0.2 percent, with the consumer
discretionary sector taking the biggest hit. The index was still
up some 3 percent since hitting a 3-month low on June 20.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.2 percent ,
weighed by Chinese bank stocks and a 3.7 percent drop in CNOOC
Ltd in the wake of the offshore oil producer's
acquisition of a Canadian oil sands firm valued at $2.1 billion.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average was hardly changed on
the day, with weakness in tech-related stocks slightly
outweighing some strength in retailers.	
 The tech sector was getting whipsawed after weak results
from Yahoo Inc , a lowered PC market forecast from Intel
, and after Microsoft Corp stock dropped 1.7
percent ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday.	
 Apple's blockbuster results had given the sector a
shove higher on Wednesday.	
 
 DON'T GET SO DEFENSIVE	
 From a sectoral point of view, some analysts have been
recommending a shift from defensive segments of the market back
to cyclical stocks based on valuations and positioning.	
 ""It is good to start collecting some of these blue-chip
cyclical names because they have been beaten down so that
includes some steel companies as well,"" Lorraine Tan, director
of Asia equity research with Standard & Poor's, told Reuters
Television.	
 Tan added that in the current quarterly results season, in
which she expects materials and energy companies to do well,
profit margins will be an important factor for bottom line
growth because of the impact from higher commodity prices and
tighter monetary policy.	
 The euro was up 0.3 percent around $1.4260 after
hitting a session high near $1.4275 on news of an accord between
France and Germany over Greece.	
 The euro is facing tough technical resistance in the $1.4280
to $1.4300 area, where among other things the 100-day and 55-day
moving averages converge.	
 With uncertainties still high about negotiations over the
U.S. debt ceiling, traders may focus on further covering their
bets against the euro versus non-dollar currencies.

 Indeed, the common currency was already up 0.5 percent
against the Swiss franc, at 1.1719 francs .	
 The Australian dollar was down 0.1 percent at $1.0730
, with a break below $1.0700 possibly paving the way for a
test of support around $1.0670.	
 The Chinese economic news pushed gold prices back above
$1,600 an ounce , within sight of the record high of
$1.609.51 reached on July 19. The yellow metal has risen 6.6
percent in July.	
 Brent crude futures  reversed early gains and slipped
below $118 a barrel after the China PMI, although traders said
hopes for debt deals in Europe and the United States could
provide a floor for prices.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro gained on Wednesday
on guarded optimism an accord would be reached to avert a
Greek default, reducing the appeal of low-risk U.S. and German
government debt.
 World stocks, with the exception of Wall Street, rallied on
strong earnings and expectations European officials could
achieve a viable financial rescue for Greece at a summit in
Brussels on Thursday. see [ID:nLDE76J0CA].
 Doubts persisted whether a second round of aid worth 110
billion euros for highly indebted Greece would be enough to
stop the region's crisis spreading to Italy and Spain, the euro
zone's third- and fourth-largest economies.
 ""We expect a new framework for Greece to be agreed,
involving the first real efforts to reduce Greece's debt
burden. But we expect little concrete in terms of measures to
reduce contagion more broadly,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head
of G10 FX strategy at Nomura in New York.
 In the United States, hints of progress in Washington over
cutting the federal debt and increasing the $14.3 trillion
statutory borrowing limit allayed some anxiety over a possible
default and the loss of top-notch credit ratings.
 A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers dubbed the ""Gang of
Six"" presented a new plan late on Tuesday that could revive the
stalled U.S. debt talks. This reduced fears lawmakers may fail
to lift the federal borrowing limit and cause the world's
biggest economy to default and lose its prized credit grade
from rating agencies. For more, see [ID:nN1E76H1Y0]
 U.S. President Barack Obama expressed support for the
bipartisan proposal but doubts remained whether it could muster
enough votes to pass.
 ""I wouldn't jump for joy until I see the details,"" said
Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at Trust Company of
the West in Los Angeles, which manages $121 billion in assets.
""I would also like to see diligent spending control rather than
just raising the debt ceiling.""
 Despite those reservations over debt deals on both sides of
the Atlantic, investors bought the euro and pared holdings of
safe-haven U.S. and German government debt.
 The 30-year Treasury bond  fell more than 1
point in price to yield 4.26 percent after posting its best day
in eight months. The benchmark 10-year note  was
down 17/32 with its yield at 2.94 percent. See [US/]
 German Bund futures  were down 0.5 percent at
128.35.
 In the currency market, the euro  traded at $1.4221,
near its session high of $1.4239. In two days, the single
European currency has gained 0.8 percent. [FRX/]

 U.S. STOCKS STRUGGLE
 Another batch of upbeat earnings was not enough to extend a
rally for Wall Street stocks after their best day since March
as investors remained cautious over whether enough is being
done to keep the U.S. and European debt problems from spiraling
into a global crisis.
 ""There's still tremendous uncertainty around the U.S. debt
ceiling and the euro zone, and while earnings have been good,
it isn't surprising to have a big up day followed by a down
day,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox
Advisors in New York, referring to Tuesday's stocks gains.
 Instead, U.S. stocks struggled, but Apple's strong earnings
helped put a floor under stock prices.
 Apple Inc  reported blockbuster quarterly results
after the market closed on Tuesday. The maker of the iPhone and
the iPad rose 2.7 percent to $386.90 a share after flirting
with a record high of $400. For more, see [ID:nN1E76J0A0]
 The robust results and Monday's surprisingly strong housing
starts data have reduced fears of a recession, analysts said.
 Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser told
Reuters on Wednesday the U.S. central bank may need to tighten
monetary policy later this year if economic growth accelerates
and unemployment falls. [ID:nN9E7HG01Y]
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> gained 1.3
percent, cutting its year-to-date losses to around 3 percent.
 Earlier, Japanese stocks marked their biggest daily rise in
three weeks. The Nikkei <.N225> closed up 1.2 percent.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWO00000PUS> were up
0.6 percent despite a mixed U.S. stock market.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 15.51
points, or 0.12 percent, at 12,571.91. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, at
1,325.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 12.29
points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,814.23.
 Data signaling strong energy demand, together with improved
investor sentiment, helped lift oil prices. Brent oil futures
 in London were up $1.04 at $118.10 a barrel, while U.S.
crude for August delivery in New York  settled up 64
cents at $98.14. [O/R]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Wednesday on hopes euro zone leaders would reach a
deal to ease Greece's debt burden, though concerns about
contagion to other European economies should keep the bloc's
currency vulnerable.
 French ministers said European leaders were less divided
than the media was reporting and were likely to reach an accord
at Thursday's summit to help Greece avert a potential default
that could roil financial markets. For more see
[ID:nLDE76J0CA].
 Analysts cautioned that fears remained that Greece's crisis
will spread to bigger economies in the region such as Italy and
Spain. Yields on the two countries' bonds jumped above 6
percent earlier this week before easing back.
 ""We expect a new framework for Greece to be agreed,
involving the first real efforts to reduce Greece's debt
burden. But we expect little concrete in terms of measures to
reduce contagion more broadly,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head
of G10 FX strategy at Nomura in New York.
 ""Hence, bond markets in Spain and Italy will largely remain
on their own in coming weeks. We continue to trade the euro
from the short side in the current environment.""
 The euro  rose 0.5 percent to $1.4221. Initial
resistance is seen around $1.4282, the euro's high on July 14,
according to Commerzbank technical analyst Karen Jones. Support
lies around $1.3915, the 200-day moving average.
 Euro zone sources said a summit of euro zone leaders would
be delayed slightly to allow time for a deal to be reached on
private-sector involvement in shouldering the costs of a Greek
debt resolution. [ID:nB5E7IB01F]
 While an agreement on Greece would be welcomed by
investors, the success of the summit would be better judged by
the performance of Italian and Spanish bonds, analysts said.
 Spain will auction 10- and 15-year bonds on Thursday ahead
of the EU leaders' meeting. Investors will closely watch the
costs of funding to gauge the stress level on peripheral debt
markets.
 U.S. DEBT PROGRESS
 Signs of progress on a U.S. budget deal also prompted a
rise in risk tolerance. A group of Democrat and Republican
senators, dubbed the ""Gang of Six,"" presented a new plan late
on Tuesday that could revive stalled U.S. debt talks and avert
a default by the world's biggest economy. [ID:nN1E76H1Y0]
 Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 currency strategy at
Deutsche Bank in New York, in a note said a striking feature of
the more favorable news on U.S. fiscal development was how
short-lived the U.S. dollar gains were.
 ""It is worth considering whether the U.S. dollar can
benefit from the budget,"" he said. Negative debt ceiling news
is a clear dollar negative, but while positive news on U.S.
debt discussions is good for the dollar, it's also likely to
boost risk appetite, which would largely negate any positive
dollar reaction, he said.
 The United States faces an Aug. 2 deadline to raise its
debt ceiling. Lack of progress in negotiations has pressured
the dollar and led ratings agencies to warn of a downgrade in
the event of a default.
 Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser
told Reuters on Wednesday that the Fed is actively preparing
for the possibility that the United States could default.
[ID:nN9E7HG01X]
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 78.77 yen , while
against a basket of major currencies, the dollar index slipped
0.5 percent to 74.806 <.DXY>.
 Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey, said the dollar's only real chance at a rally would
probably come if the EU meeting fails to ease euro zone debt
fears and the euro sells off.

involving the first real efforts to reduce Greece's debt
burden. But we expect little concrete in terms of measures to

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the

may reach a deal to ease Greece's debt problems, though
concerns remained about contagion to other countries in the

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Wednesday, with investors hopeful European leaders will reach
some kind of deal to ease the debt problems in Greece at this
week's summit but doubtful that this would ease fears of
contagion.	
 The euro was up 0.3 percent versus the dollar at $1.4198
but any gains were seen limited, leaving it in a range
below last week's high around $1.4283 and vulnerable to signs
the debt crisis could still spread to larger countries like
Italy and Spain.	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday dampened
expectations that Thursday's emergency summit would produce any
comprehensive solution to Greece's debt crisis, saying further
steps would be needed. 
 However, the euro was helped as French ministers said
European leaders were less divided than media was reporting and
were likely to reach an accord at the summit that will ease
Greece's debt woes. 
 Better appetite for risk among investors also buoyed the
euro and weighed on the dollar, with European equities
up 0.7 percent on signs of progress on a U.S. budget-reduction
deal and strong earnings from Apple .	
 ""There is a feeling that there will be some kind of deal on
Greece at the summit, but there are no guarantees this will ease
concerns about the crisis spreading to Italy or Spain and people
are unlikely to push euro/dollar too much higher,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.	
 ""The uncertainties over the U.S. budget deal and the debt
crisis in the euro zone are more or less balancing each other
out"". 
 Late on Tuesday, a group of Democratic and Republican
senators presented a new plan that could revive stalled U.S.
debt talks and avert a default by the world's biggest economy.

 The euro sat well above a four-month low near $1.3838 hit
last week, with support near $1.4120, which roughly coincides
with trendline support on hourly charts, with traders saying it
was propped up by Asian sovereign demand.	
 It faces resistance near $1.4219, a 76.4 percent retracement
of its recent drop to $1.4015 from $1.4282.	
 Higher up, there is more resistance near $1.4300, around the
55-day and 100-day moving averages. Some technical analysts
pointed to the fact that the 55-day average will soon move below
the 100-day average, a bearish signal that could see the euro
target its 200-day average around $1.3914.	
 ""I don't think anyone can buy the euro wholeheartedly,"" said
Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for Okasan Securities' foreign
securities department in Tokyo, adding the euro may struggle to
rise above resistance between $1.4250 and $1.4300 in the near
term. 
 The euro could find some support if Asian central banks
convert some of the dollars purchased via dollar-buying
intervention into the single currency.	
 Asian currency traders said a number of Asian central banks
were spotted conducting dollar-buying intervention on Wednesday,
including the central banks of Thailand and the Philippines.

 
 MARGIN TRADERS SELL DOLLAR/YEN	
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent against the yen to 78.93 yen
, having backed off an intraday high near 79.30 yen.	
 Akihisa Takeda, executive officer for Japanese margin broker
Central Tanshi FX in Tokyo, said Japanese retail margin traders
sold the dollar earlier when it rose toward its intraday high.
Leveraged retail traders were likely to keep selling dollar/yen
and cross/yen on rallies, he said.	
 Data from the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the main exchange
for currency margin trading in Japan, shows that margin traders'
net long position in dollar/yen and major cross/yen pairs
combined had hit a record 722.3 billion yen on Monday.	
 In the fx options market, there are signs that market
players are hedging against the risk of a further drop in
dollar/yen in the wake of the dollar's fall to a four-month low
of 78.45 yen last week on trading platform EBS.	
 One-month dollar/yen risk reversals now stand around 1.4
percent in favour of dollar puts, compared to a recent low of
0.55 percent hit early last week, showing a rise in demand for
dollar puts compared to dollar calls . 
 Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were supported by
better appetite for risk, with the New Zealand dollar
at $0.8551, near an earlier 30-year high of $0.8568.

 * Obama signals progress in U.S. debt settlement talks	
 * Euro, euro zone debt recover ahead of crisis summit	
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - Strong company results and hopes
for a settlement in the U.S. debt ceiling row boosted global
equities on Wednesday while the euro rose on hopes for a scheme
to address the Greek debt crisis.	
 Wall Street also looked set to open higher.	
 Gold retreated from a record high of $1,609.51 hit on
Tuesday, but was still well towards the top of recent trading
levels. It has been boosted by both the U.S. and European debt
fears.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.4
percent, adding to Tuesday's gains and led by emerging markets
, which gained 0.9 percent.	
 ""It's important that there are slightly more positive tones
coming out of Capitol Hill, at least averting an immediate issue
with their debt ceiling,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief investment
officer at Octopus Investments.	
 ""We're within the trading range, driven by good and bad
news. The U.S. earnings season will be a positive catalyst and
gives us more perspective, compared to the worries and concerns
about the euro zone debt crisis.""	
 U.S. President Barack Obama suggested on Tuesday that
progress was being made toward a $3.75 trillion deficit
reduction deal, easing worries that lawmakers may fail to lift
the U.S. debt ceiling. 
 Earnings have also boosted stock sentiment. After Wall
Street closes, Apple reported revenues well above
analysts' estimates.	
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 gained around 1
percent, cutting its year-to-date losses to around 3 percent.	
 Earlier, Japanese stocks marked their biggest daily rise in
three weeks. The Nikkei closed up 1.2 percent.	
 
 EURO ZONE SUMMIT	
 The euro climbed around 0.6 percent against the dollar on
increased belief that a solution to the Greek debt crisis might
be on the table. 
 The EU is said to be considering enabling the euro zone
bailout fund to recapitalise the banks and let its special EFSF
bailout fund buy bonds in the secondary market. A levy on banks
has also been proposed.	
 Banking sources said banks were on track to offer a complex
Greek rescue proposal, which excludes a bank levy, to a meeting
of euro zone leaders on Thursday. 
 The single currency was up above $1.42 .	
 French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said the summit
needed to send a ""strong message"" and that views among leaders
were less divergent than media were reporting, after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said hopes for a single plan to solve
Greece's crisis were unrealistic.	
 Euro zone bond markets were also seeing risk-aversion plays
ease as the summit approached.	
 Core German debt prices fell and yields on bonds of the euro
zone's debt-troubled issuers eased.	
 ""The EU have come out saying they're considering letting the
EFSF buy bonds in the secondary market, so basically the
euro-area wide discussions about a lender of last resort are
happening, so that's Bund negative and periphery positive,"" a
trader said.	
 Italy's 10-year yield was down more 10 basis
points at a little over 5.6 percent. It rose above 6 percent
earlier in the week.

 By Vikram Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, July 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on hopes
that an 11th-hour deal in U.S. debt talks would avert a rapidly
approaching default while blowout results from Apple lifted the
tech sector which is likely to extend gains into European
trading as well.	
 However, dampened expectations of a comprehensive solution
to Greece's debt crisis at a euro zone leaders' summit on
Thursday ate into the euro's gains.	
 Financial bookmakers expect Europe's main stock indexes to
rise on Wednesday, adding to the previous session's tentative
rebound, helped by earnings hopes and signs of progress on a
U.S. budget-reduction deal. 
 Financial spreadbetters expect Britain's FTSE 100 to
open around 16 points higher, or 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX
to open 25 points higher, or 0.4 percent, and France's
CAC 40 to open 8 points higher, or 0.2 percent.

 The euro which had risen earlier as Italian and
Spanish yields fell, gave up gains on increasing doubts that
Thursday's euro zone summit will offer a long-term solution to
the debt crisis. 
 With just two weeks left until the U.S. government runs out
of money to pay bills, President Barack Obama seized on a plan
by a bipartisan group of senators that could revive stalled U.S.
debt talks and the prospect of a long-term deficit reduction
deal to avert a default. 
 
 TECHS IN FOCUS	
 Asian tech stocks, this year's worst performing regional
sector, got a lift as corporate earnings from IBM and iPhone
maker Apple which surpassed analyst forecasts. 
 They are still by far the biggest underperformers with the
MSCI index of technology firms in Asia ex-Japan
down 7.6 percent this year, followed by industrials which are
down only 2.5 percent.	
 Benchmarks in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan
rose as makers of tablet and smart phone components
posted strong gains. Beaten-down smartphone maker HTC
jumped 7 percent.	
 ""Thanks to Apple, its suppliers would be able to continue to
grow substantially in Q3, even into next year,"" said Oscar
Chung, who manages about $448 million for Capital Securities
Investment Trust in Taiwan.	
 The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index rose 1.1
percent. Samsung Electronics , which plans to
introduce an upgraded version of its own Galaxy tablet in the
Korean markets on Wednesday, jumped 3.5 percent.	
 Analysts from Societe Generale said in a note that over the
past month Asia's tech sector had clearly lagged peers in the
U.S. and Europe, suggesting there was more room for a rebound in
regional names especially if Intel Corp results,
expected later on Wednesday, are not as bad as feared.

 The euro edged lower as German Chancellor Angela Merkel
doused expectations for Thursday's emergency euro zone summit,
saying expectations for a single, final solution to the Greek
crisis was unrealistic. 
 ""Further steps will be necessary and not just one
spectacular event which solves everything,"" Merkel told
reporters on Tuesday. 
 
 EURO ZONE SUMMIT	
 The euro was trading down 0.1 percent around $1.4140
against the dollar after a 0.3 percent gain on Tuesday, having
pulled away from a four-month low near $1.3838 hit last week.	
 ""There hasn't been any progress and the euro just seems to
be moving this way and that within a range,"" said Tsutomu Soma,
senior manager for Okasan Securities' foreign securities
department in Tokyo. 
 ""I don't think anyone can buy the euro wholeheartedly,"" he
said, adding that the euro may struggle to rise above resistance
in the $1.4250 to $1.4300 area in the near term.	
 Gold edged up again on light Asia buying after it snapped an
unprecedented 11-day winning streak, shedding over 1 percent
overnight as safe-haven interest ebbed. Spot gold which
hit a record $1,609.51 an ounce on Tuesday was trading around
$1,588.6 an ounce.	
 NYMEX crude oil  rose above $98 a barrel supported by
hopes of a U.S. debt deal, a weakening dollar against the euro
and tightening crude stocks in the world's largest oil consumer.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on
Tuesday as progress on a U.S. budget-reduction deal and strong
earnings gave investors reasons to be optimistic about the
economy, while the euro and European shares rose ahead of an EU
summit later this week.
 Some investors are hopeful the EU summit could pave the way
for a deal to solve Greece's debt problems.
 Encouraging remarks from U.S. President Barack Obama that
some progress was made toward a budget-reduction deal and
raising the statutory $14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling
propelled U.S. stocks higher.
 A surprising jump in U.S. housing starts in June helped
reduce concern that the U.S. economy may be slipping into a
recession.
 Crude oil prices jumped as optimism about the economy
underpinned the outlook for energy demand, and the weaker
dollar also supported prices. Prices of both Brent crude and
U.S. oil rose more than 1 percent.
 ""So far, earnings have been showing us a better picture of
the economy than some macroeconomic issues suggest, which is
encouraging, especially with housing starts surprising to the
upside,"" said Michelle Gibley, senior market analyst at Schwab
Center for Financial Research in Denver.
 In European equities markets, banking shares bounced back
from two-year lows ahead of Thursday's euro-zone summit in
Brussels on hopes the leaders will approve a second bailout for
Greece worth 110 billion euros to help contain the sovereign
debt crisis.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.8 percent to end at
1,076.88.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> gained
1.3 percent, offsetting Monday's drop of similar size.

 Before Obama's remarks on the latest budget talks, the U.S.
stock market focused on strong earnings, including results of

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 202.26

500 Index <.SPX> was up 21.29 points, or 1.63 percent, at
1,326.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 61.41
points, or 2.22 percent, at 2,826.52.
 Dow component IBM rose 5.7 percent to $185.21 after it
reported stronger-than-expected growth in its services division
late on Monday, raising hopes for the technology sector.
 On the Nasdaq, shares of Apple  hit a 52-week high
at $378.65 ahead of its earnings, due after the closing bell.
 Not all of Tuesday's results were encouraging. Wall Street
firm Goldman Sachs  said its quarterly earnings fell far
short of expectations, while Bank of America , the
biggest U.S. bank, posted a record quarterly loss.
 Under growing pressure to avert a government default, U.S.
President Obama threw his support on Tuesday behind efforts by
a bipartisan group of senators to negotiate a new
deficit-reduction plan. For more, see [ID:nWEN5604]
 Investors for the most part appear to be assuming that the
U.S. debt ceiling will be lifted before the Aug. 2 deadline and
a default averted, with the 10-year Treasury  yield
hovering just below 3.0 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday on hopes policymakers may reach a deal to
provide further aid for Greece at a summit later this week,
though a lack of a long-term solution for the country's debt
crisis could keep the single currency vulnerable.
 A fall in debt yields on Italian and Spanish bonds a day
after they jumped above 6 percent on fears of a potential Greek
default helped bring some relief to the euro and helped it
consolidate around support near $1.4150.
 Euro zone leaders are trying to complete an agreement on a
second round of aid for Greece worth 110 billion euros ($154
billion), but it remained unclear how a consensus could be
reached to involve private owners of Greek government bonds.
For details, see [ID:nL6E7II0FP]
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel doused expectations for
Thursday's emergency euro zone summit. She said the widespread
longing for a single, final solution to make the Greek crisis
disappear once and for all was unrealistic. [ID:nL6E7IJ0PP]
 Markets are ""desperate for any details indicating
resolution ahead of Thursday's meeting,"" said Eric Theoret,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""Headline
risk for the euro remains high.""
 The euro  rose as high as $1.42172 on trading
platform EBS, before retreating to $1.4138, up 0.2 percent on
the day. Analysts expect the euro to stay in a range of $1.40
and $1.43 before Thursday's meeting.
 The euro also rallied versus the safe-haven Swiss franc
 to hit 1.16881; it was last up 1 percent at
1.1658.
 The European Central Bank has resisted the possibility of a
Greek default, but comments on Tuesday from Austria's central
bank governor, Ewald Nowotny, that a solution could involve a
""selective default"" was the first sign of a crack in the
central bank's hard line. [ID:nLDE76I040]
 Nowotny later said that he was in complete agreement with
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on Greece. [ID:nVIE003644]
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington, cautioned that while the euro bounced
higher on hopes of a deal on Thursday, an agreement ""could
include some form of Greek default,"" which he said ""is not
necessarily a positive outcome for the euro.""
 RISE THE CEILING
 The dollar cut losses against the euro and rose against the
yen after President Barack Obama on Tuesday supported a
bipartisan proposal for a new deficit-reduction plan aimed at
averting a U.S. debt default.
 Obama said the ambitious budget plan brought forward by the
""Gang of Six"" group of senators could provide new ideas for
breaking the impasse in Congress over raising the federal
government's credit limit by Aug. 2. [ID:nN1E76H1Y0]
 Against the yen , the dollar rose 0.2 percent to
79.21, rebounding from a session low of 78.820 on EBS.
 ""Currency markets are likely to look favorably upon this
proposal, both in its capacity to avert immediate default, and
its potential to address profound imbalances in the longer
term,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior market strategist Western
Union Business Solutions.
 ""While the proposal is no panacea for the deeper problems
that the United States faces, it is a significant indication
that policymakers are serious about addressing the issues in a
balanced manner,"" he said.
 The dollar has recently been stung by worries about U.S.
debt as investors fret that Washington will hit a stalemate
over raising the government's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.
 Higher-yielding currencies rallied as gains in stocks
lifted risk appetite. The Australian dollar was up 1.1 percent
. The New Zealand dollar rose to a post-float high
against its U.S. counterpart of $0.8573 . The New
Zealand dollar was floated in March 1985.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose on on
upbeat U.S. corporate earnings on Tuesday, and the euro and
European shares gained ahead of an EU summit later this week on
expectations that a solution to Greece's debt problems may be
reached.
 A surprise jump in U.S. housing starts in June helped
reduce concern that the U.S. economy may be slipping into a
recession.
 Crude oil prices as the optimism on the economy underpinned
the outlook for energy demand, and the weaker dollar also
supported prices. Prices of both Brent crude and U.S. oil rose
more than 1 percent.
 ""So far earnings have been showing us a better picture of
the economy than some macroeconomic issues suggest, which is
encouraging, especially with housing starts surprising to the
upside,"" said Michelle Gibley, senior market analyst at Schwab
Center for Financial Research in Denver.
 In Europe equities, banking shares bounced back from
two-year lows ahead of Thursday's euro zone summit in Brussels,
hoping it will complete a second bailout for Greece in an
attempt to contain the sovereign debt crisis.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> provisionally closed up 0.8
percent at 1,076.59 points.
 Italian and Spanish bonds, which were pummeled by fears
that a possible Greek default could damage the third and fourth
largest economies in the euro zone, firmed slightly after
10-year yields jumped to 6 percent on Monday.
 But even as bank shares rose in Europe, there were concerns
that the gains might not be sustained.
 ""We're not in a banking crisis, we're in a political
crisis,"" Robert Quinn, chief European strategist at Standard &
Poor's equity research said, adding he was bearish heading into
Thursday's meeting and saw the potential for further banking
sector losses.
 Gold continued to attract safe-haven investment flows,
although it retreated below $1,600 an ounce after touching an
all-time high near $1,610 .
 The euro  rose as high as $1.42172 on electronic
trading platform EBS before retreating to $1.41722, still up
0.4 percent on the day.
 ""There is some lightening of short positions ahead of (the
summit) on the risk there could be some sort of agreement
reached,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""But an agreement on Thursday could include some form of
Greek default, which to me is not necessarily a positive
outcome for the euro.""
 The single currency also gained against the yen 
and the Swiss franc , which have been the safe havens
in the foreign exchange market due to anxiety about debt
troubles in Europe and the United States.
 Still, risk aversion among investors remained high also
because of the U.S. government's Aug. 2 deadline for raising
the debt ceiling. Failure to do so would push the world's
biggest economy into default and endanger its top-notch credit
rating.
 The U.S. White House and Congress are still at an impasse
over raising the $14.3 trillion statutory debt limit.
[ID:nN1E76H1Y0]
 Investors for the most part appear to be assuming that the
U.S. debt ceiling will be lifted and a default averted, with
the 10-year Treasury yield hovering near 3.0 percent.
 The stock market, however, found focused on strong
earnings, including results of IBM and Coca-Cola, and the data
showing that housing starts in June hit a six-month high and
permits for future construction unexpectedly increased.
[ID:nLDE76I14Y]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 113.03
points, or 0.91 percent, at 12,498.19. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 11.66 points, or 0.89 percent, at
1,317.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 42.87
points, or 1.55 percent, at 2,807.98.
 Dow component International Business Machines Corp 
added 4.2 percent to $182.63 after it reported late Monday that
new business at its services division was up more than
expected, raising hopes for the technology sector.
 The S&P information technology sector <.GSPT> gained 1.5
percent, the top gainer among S&P sectors. Shares of Apple
 hit a 52-week high ahead of its report due after the
closing bell.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
1.0 percent after losing 1.2 percent on Monday.

 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks and the

as investors paused in their selloff of riskier assets

LONDON)
 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro strengthened on
Tuesday as debt yields of some peripheral euro zone countries
retreated ahead of an EU summit later this week on expectations
a solution to Greece's debt problem may be reached.
Traders said official Asian and Russian names bought the
euro as yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds eased
slightly following a surge higher in the past week on concern
the debt crisis is deepening. [GVD/EUR]
 The dollar briefly recovered against the yen after a
government report showed U.S. housing starts rose more than
expected in June to touch a six-month high and permits for
future construction unexpectedly increased. [ID:nCAT005473].
 It then fell back as some investors said that one monthly
number, however positive and above the consensus, does not make
for an improving trend in the nation's housing market. That
market remains mired down with foreclosures and a huge
inventory of unsold homes. [ID:nN1E76I0AD]
 ""There is some lightening of short positions ahead of (the
summit) on the risk there could be some sort of agreement
reached,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""But an agreement
on Thursday could include some form of Greek default, which to
me is not necessarily a positive outcome for the euro.""
 The euro  rose as high as $1.42172 on electronic
trading platform EBS before retreating to $1.4196, still up 0.6
percent on the day.
 It found near-term support after breaking above technical
resistance around $1.4111 and $1.4175, the 31.8 percent and
23.6 percent retracements of the euro's rally last week.
 The euro also traded higher against other currencies,
rising to a session high of 1.16556 versus the safe-haven Swiss
franc . 
 Euro zone leaders are trying to complete an agreement on a
second round of aid for Greece worth 110 billion euros ($154
billion).
 But it remained unclear how a consensus could be reached
for private owners of Greek government bonds -- banks, insurers
and other investors -- to contribute by taking cuts in the face
value of their holdings. [ID:nL6E7II0FP] 
 The European Central Bank has resisted the possibility of a
default, but comments on Tuesday from Austria's central bank
governor, Ewald Nowotny, that a solution could involve a
'selective default' was the first sign of a crack in the
central bank's hard line. [ID:nLDE76I040]
 Nowotny later said that he was in complete agreement with
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on Greece. [ID:nVIE003644].
 RISE THE CEILING
 Strength in the euro pushed the dollar, considered a safer
bet during times of uncertainty, lower against several major
currencies.
 Against the yen  it slipped 0.1 percent to 79, while
sterling rose 0.5 percent against the dollar to $1.6126
 and the Australian dollar gained 0.7 percent to
$1.0683 .
 Euro gains were the primary driver of a weaker dollar, but
analysts said the U.S. currency has also been stung by worries
about U.S. fiscal problems. Investors fret that Washington will
hit a stalemate over raising the government's $14.3 trillion
borrowing limit in the very near future. 
 ""Euro/dollar is trapped between the euro zone debt crisis
on one side and questions surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling on
the other, and the market doesn't want to take on any major
positions,"" said You-Na Park, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 Despite the June increase in housing starts, they are still
less than a third of their peak during the housing boom.
 But demand for rentals, as Americans shun homeownership
because of plummeting home prices, may be helping demand for
permits for future construction.
 ""In the grand scheme of things, it's nice to see it jump
higher, but it doesn't take us out of the range we've been in,""
said David Mann, senior currency strategist at Standard
Chartered in New York. ""So there's still an extremely long way
to go before we can be sure there's a serious recovery
underway.""

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - World stocks clawed back some
recent losses and the euro firmed on Tuesday as investors paused
from their selloff of riskier assets triggered by debt crises in
the euro zone and United States.	
 Wall Street also looked set to open higher.	
 Gold, however, continued to attract safe-haven investment
flows, rising for the sixth session in a row to around $1,604 an
ounce .	
 Italian and Spanish bonds, now in the maelstrom as euro zone
debt problems spread, firmed slightly after 10-year yields
vaulted six percent on Monday.	
 Investors were focusing on a euro zone summit to be held on
Thursday, hoping it will complete a second bailout for Greece in
an attempt to stop the sovereign debt crisis from seriously
infecting larger countries, notably Italy and Spain.	
 Stakes are high with the scope for serious market ructions
if Europe's leaders fail to provide a definitive plan.	
 ""Things are coming to a head. This is a political crisis
just as much as a financial crisis. We need some real
leadership,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven
Investment Management.	
 Risk aversion among investors has also been stoked by the
approaching U.S. Aug 2 deadline on the federal borrowing limit.
Political leaders in Washington are still at an impasse.

 Investors for the most part appear to be assuming that the
U.S. debt ceiling will be lifted and a default averted, with the
10-year Treasury yield camped comfortably below 3 percent.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up
half a percent and still have gains of around 1.3 percent for
the year despite a plethora of financial, political and natural
crises from Japan to Europe, the United States and North Africa.	
 European shares rose, helped along by technology shares that
got a boost from an upbeat statement from IBM . The
FTSEurofirst 300 gained three-quarters of a percent.	
 ""We can expect a relatively strong (stock) rebound if we get
a political solution to the debt crisis on Thursday, a solution
that would please the market,"" said Christophe Brule, president
of Entheca Finance. ""Without an adequate solution, the market
could drop another 10-15 percent.""	
 Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.85 percent.	
 
 EURO STEADY	
 The euro rose broadly with investors torn as they balance
the debt concerns on both sides of the Atlantic.	
 ""Euro/dollar is trapped between the euro zone debt crisis on
one side and questions surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling on the
other, and the market doesn't want to take on any major
positions,"" said You-Na Park, currency strategist at Commerzbank
in Frankfurt.	
 The euro was at $1.4165 .	
 On euro zone bond markets themselves, safe-haven German bond
prices fell and Italian and Spanish bonds prices rose slightly,
with some profit-taking on the core debt.	
 ""You can argue that the summit isn't really focusing on the
matter in hand to a degree. There's a risk we could get some
disappointment in terms of help for Spain and Italy if the
crisis gets worse on Thursday,"" one bond trader said. 
""Spain especially is at very pronounced yield levels.
Systemic risk is definitely the danger into the end of the
week.""

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, July 19 (Reuters) - Equities stabilised on
Tuesday, helped by technology shares ahead of Apple's earnings,
though the euro sagged, suggesting investors may keep cutting
their exposure to risks in the face of default threats in the
United States and Europe.	
 U.S. stock futures were up 0.3 percent  and European
share markets were expected to open slightly higher, though
risky assets may be on borrowed time.	
 With the clock ticking in Washington before an Aug. 2
deadline on the federal borrowing limit, political leaders were
still at an impasse. Europe also appeared no closer to sealing a
deal for a second bailout of Greece ahead of Thursday's European
Union summit.	
 Investors for the most part appear to be assuming that the
U.S. debt ceiling will be lifted and a default averted, with the
10-year Treasury yield camped comfortably below 3 percent, but
stakes are running high in the euro zone. 
 Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields rose above 6 percent
on Monday in the wake of stress tests on the region's banks,
pulling further away from German Bund yields and reflecting a
low degree of confidence that policymakers can contain the
crises. Funding costs are perceived to be unsustainable if
yields rise over 7 percent.	
 ""Italian and Spanish government bond yields have risen
pretty sharply. If that continues, a risk-off trend on the back
of concerns about Europe could continue and spur buying of both
the yen and the dollar against the euro,"" said Junya Tanase,
chief FX strategist for JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average was down 0.8 percent ,
well off a four-month high hit on July 8. Markets in Tokyo had
been closed on Monday for a holiday.	
 ""Foreigners are selling mega banks and buying defensive
names like NTT,"" said a trader at a European brokerage,
referring to a telecom company.	
 
 HIDDEN GEMS 
 China's benchmark stock indexes were down across the board
after the Shanghai composite hit a two-month high on
Monday. 
 Some investors were on the prowl, though, for value in Asian
equities, where sovereign balance sheets are in markedly better
condition than the West.	
 Khiem Do, head of multi-asset group at Barings Asset
Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters Television that bank
stocks in Asia were what he considers a hidden gem being
overlooked by markets because of their low valuations but
relatively strong fundamentals.	
 ""The time to hold high dividend yields and cash may have
passed already. The stocks that have been defensive are not
cheap any longer and the cheap stocks or sectors are those that
have been beaten down and usually related to growth,"" Do said.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was
largely unchanged on the day , with outperforming
technology and telecom equipment sectors offsetting financials
and industrials.	
 Hopes for tech stocks were running high ahead of Apple Inc's
quarterly results due later. Thomson Reuters Starmine's
SmartEstimate, which gives a greater weighting to more accurate
forecasters, for the June quarter's earnings is 3 percent higher
than the median expectation, suggesting a chance Apple may
surprise to the upside.	
 Shares of News Corp listed in Sydney were up 2.5 percent
after Bloomberg reported the media conglomerate --
suffering from a spreading phone hacking scandal -- was
considering elevating the current Chief Operating Officer to be
a chief executive.

Murdoch. 
 
 FRANCLY SPEAKING	
 The euro was down against the dollar a touch at $1.4085
, and down 0.1 percent against the Swiss franc at 1.1521
francs .	
 The franc has been a big winner in the past few months,
serving as a haven along with gold from fiscally weak G10
countries. Though the rapid move into the Swiss franc has
cooled, widening Italian and Spanish bond yield spreads over
Bunds will likely trigger fresh selling of euro/Swiss franc. 
 Deutsche Bank said a basket trade that is short the dollar,
sterling, yen and the euro -- the major currencies tied to
fiscally weak economies -- and long the rest of the G10
currencies has annual excess returns of 8.1 percent so far this
year. 
 Precious metals have also been a beneficiary of investors
seeking hard assets as debt crises in Europe and the United
States grow. Spot gold edged up 0.1 percent to $1,605.51
an ounce in early Asian trade, though off the record high of
$1,607.01 reached on Monday. 
 Silver has been catching up lately with gold's
advance, though was nearly flat on Tuesday, at $40.53 an ounce,
off Monday's high of $40.70 -- its highest since May 4.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar and hit a record low against the Swiss franc on Monday
and concerns the euro zone debt crisis will worsen looked set
to keep the single currency under pressure.
 While a stalemate in Washington over raising the nation's
$14.3 trillion borrowing limit was also high on investors'
minds, most were betting some deal will be reached. That helped
support the dollar against major currencies.
 By contrast, in Europe, anxiety over a Greek default and
contagion risks remained high. Italian and Spanish bond yields
rose sharply and the cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt
against default soared to record highs.
 Euro zone leaders will meet on Thursday to try to finalize
a second round of aid for Greece worth 110 billion euros ($154
billion). Investors feared little progress will be made as
officials and bankers remained divided over how to keep the
region's debt woes from spreading.
 ""Considering what Europe is facing and will face, I think
the euro might be a little bit overvalued,"" said Fabian
Eliasson, vice president of currency sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank in New York. ""I don't see the problem going away anytime
soon.""
 The euro last traded down 0.5 percent at $1.40758
, off a session low of $1.40145 on trading platform
EBS. Technical analysts see support at the 200-day moving
average at $1.39121.
 The euro hit a record low of 1.13650 Swiss francs
 on EBS, before bouncing back to last trade at
1.1521, down 0.1 percent.
 As Germany presses for significant private sector
involvement and the European Central Bank insists it will not
accept defaulted bonds as collateral, policymakers are
struggling to reach a consensus. For details, see

 U.S. DEBT SAGA
 The dollar also fell to a record low against the Swiss
franc at 0.8034  on EBS. It rebounded to 0.8183 as
some dealers covered their short positions.
 The franc continues to be the safe-haven of choice as
investors seek liquidity and relative safety on concerns about
fiscal health in both Europe and the United States.
 Negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling are running
dangerously close to an Aug. 2 deadline after which Washington
will be unable to pay its bills if the limit is not raised.
 The lack of progress has led two ratings agencies to warn
of a credit rating downgrade in the event of a U.S. default.
Such a move, some traders fear, could send interest rates
soaring and erode the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status.
 Fitch Ratings on Monday reiterated that if the U.S. debt
ceiling is not raised prior to Aug. 2, it will place the AAA
rating on watch negative, meaning it could downgrade it within
a three- to six-month period. [ID:nLDE76H182]
 Although no deal has yet been made, Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner was optimistic, saying top Republicans had
taken ""default off the table.
 The top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell,
submitted a plan that would essentially make Obama the one with
the power to raise the debt limit. A vote is planned in the
Senate later this week but prospects are uncertain in the
House, where the Republicans hold sway.
 Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in
New York, said ""the currency market is clearly complacent""
about the issue, which is reflected in the euro's move lower
against the dollar.
 ""However, if by the Friday there is no meaningful agreement
on plan B and the parties remain far apart, the greenback could
see panic selling as fears of possible technical default grip
the market,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
stumbled on Monday, while gold prices jumped to a record high
on fears that no imminent solutions to the European and U.S.
debt problems could allow them to spiral into a global crisis.
 European officials and bankers remained divided over steps
to keep the fiscal woes of heavily indebted nations from
spreading. The euro zone's 17 national leaders will meet on
Thursday in Brussels in an attempt to finalize a second round
of financial aid for Greece worth 110 billion euros ($154
billion). For details, see [ID:nL6E7II0FP]
 ""We are in the midst of a political crisis that has not
offered any viable solution,"" said Jurgen Odenius, principal of
international economics and investment strategy at Prudential
Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey, which oversees $240
billion, speaking of the European debt crisis.
 ""Given the wrangling, I think it's increasingly clear that
we are in a situation that lacks major leadership,"" he said.
 Anxiety about a potential Greek default and its
repercussions across Europe remains high even after stress
tests for euro zone banks released on Friday showed most of
them have enough capital to weather such an event. But the
results did not wipe out doubts about the banking system if the
crisis deteriorates further. [ID:nL6E7IF19G]
 In the United States, as the clock ticks toward the Aug. 2
deadline for an increase in the statutory $14.3 trillion
borrowing limit, investors were nervous about the stalemate in
Washington and chances of the economy slipping into a recession
only two years after the last one.
 The lack of progress in negotiating a U.S. fiscal package
has already led all three major ratings agencies to warn of a
credit rating downgrade in the event of a U.S. default. Such a
move, some traders fear, could send interest rates soaring and
erode the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status.
 These worries pushed Wall Street stocks lower, with the
Standard & Poor's 500 index at its lowest in three weeks.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 110.73
points, or 0.89 percent, at 12,369.00. The Standard & Poor's

 GOLD, SWISS FRANC GAIN
 As worries over fiscal burdens persist, investors have been
scrambling to shelter their money in cash, gold, the Swiss
franc, the Japanese yen and other less-risky investments.
 ""There is still a great concern about the (euro zone)
peripheral debt crisis and in the U.S. we have our own issues
with the consensus the U.S. is on downgrade watch,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York. ""The yen and the Swiss franc are benefiting as safe
havens more than the dollar.""
 The euro  was down roughly 0.8 percent versus the
dollar and the yen  at $1.4077 and 111.22 yen,
respectively. The safe-haven Swiss franc   hit
record highs against the dollar and euro.
 Spot gold  rose to an all-time peak above $1,600 an
ounce after rising more than 3.0 percent for a second straight
week last week, a feat it has not achieved since Feb. 2009.
 With fears growing that the debt crisis could spread to
Italy or Spain, the euro zone's third- and fourth-largest
economies, Spanish 10-year government bond yields 
rose to 6.36 percent, their highest since the introduction of
the euro. The Italian equivalent  also rose above
6.0 percent.
 Unease over a U.S. default seeped into the U.S. Treasuries
market, stoking selling in the 30-year bond, but safe-haven
bids from Europe's debt crisis supported other maturities.
 The 30-year Treasury bond  was down 21/32 in
price to yield 4.29 percent versus 4.25 percent on Friday.
 Prices on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note 
were flat to yield of 2.91 percent, about 10 basis points above
a seven-month low it touched last week.
 Worries over sovereign defaults on either side of the
Atlantic and their possible toll on the world economy and
energy demand pushed oil prices lower. U.S. crude futures
 were down 1.4 percent at $95.95 a barrel. [O/R]

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday,
hitting a record low against the Swiss franc and dropping
against the yen on concerns the euro zone debt crisis will only
get worse in the near term.
 The dollar also hit a record low against the Swiss franc as
investors worried that there was little apparent movement by
the U.S. Congress in dealing with the nation's looming debt
ceiling crisis. That concern eased somewhat after more positive
comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner about
the prospects for a deal being reached but until the details
are in place, it will continue to weigh on sentiment.
 Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields rose sharply while
the cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against default
soared to record highs on contagion risks and policymakers'
failure to quickly resolve the debt crisis. [GVD/EUR]
 ""There is still a great concern about the (euro zone)
peripheral debt crisis and in the U.S. we have our own issues
with the consensus the U.S. is on downgrade watch,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York. ""The yen and the Swiss franc are benefiting as safe
havens more than the dollar.""
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Sunday for
private investors to make a major contribution to bailing out
Greece. Officials proposed a range of schemes for the European
Financial Stability Facility to finance a buy-back or a swap in
which private owners of Greek government bonds would accept
cuts in the face value of their holdings. [ID:nL6E7IH099] 
 The euro fell sharply against the Swiss franc early in the
global trading day to change hands at a record low of 1.1365
 on EBS.
 The pair bounced to 1.1496 francs, helped by German bank
buying, but was still down 0.4 percent for the day. Traders
said the franc's rise in Asian trade may have been exacerbated
by thin conditions owing to a Japanese holiday.
 The franc continues to be the G10 currency of choice for
investors and traders seeking liquidity and relative safety
from concerns that the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis could
spread to countries such as Spain and Italy.
 The euro was down 0.6 percent versus the dollar on the day
at $1.4040 , off an earlier low of $1.40145. Technical
analysts said next support was the 200-day moving average
currently at $1.39121. The euro fell over one percent against
the low-yielding yen to 110.66 yen  and last traded
around 111.35 yen.

 The dollar also fell to a record low of 0.8034 francs

their short positions, but with the U.S. grappling with its own
debt issues, traders said any bounce in the greenback may prove
fleeting.
 Political negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling are
running dangerously close to an Aug. 2 deadline after which
Washington will be unable to pay its bills.

 Republican and Democratic senators sought on Sunday to
craft a plan that could avert a government debt default should
the talks remain in stalemate.
 ""The Treasury Secretary speaking early today was trying to
calm things down,"" said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington. ""The Swiss franc continues to be the
big winner until there is fear of intervention but the dollar
is taking its role as a safe haven.""

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - The euro, stocks, and bonds of
highly indebted European countries fell on Monday as investors
fled riskier assets on escalating U.S. and euro zone debt
worries, while safe-haven gold rose to a fresh high.	
 European banking shares took a beating after euro zone
stress tests results failed to address the potential for a Greek
sovereign debt default, which many economists are expecting.

 Investors were also nervous about the lack of progress in
U.S. debt negotiations to avert a government default as a
deadline to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling loomed. U.S.
S&P 500 stock futures  were down 0.8 percent, pointing to
losses on Wall Street.	
 ""There are two (major) regions in the world -- the United
States and the euro area -- where we have debt problems
climaxing in the coming days,"" said Kornelius Purps, fixed
income strategist at UniCredit.	
 ""There are still so many unsolved issues and therefore
investors are definitely on the defensive side.""	
 Attention was centred on a meeting of euro zone leaders
later this week that may prove critical in determining the role
of private sector creditors in further aid to Greece.

 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.6
percent. European stocks lost more than 1 percent on
the day, led by banking stocks , after posting the worst
weekly performance in nearly four months last week.	
 The euro was down 0.8 percent versus the dollar at
$1.4030. Emerging stocks fell 0.8 percent.	
 Eight smaller euro zone banks failed the stress tests, in
line with expectations, while a further 16 were close to
failing. All of them may need to shore up their balance sheets. 
 With fears growing that the debt crisis could spread to
Italy or Spain, the euro zone's third and fourth largest
economies, Spanish 10-year government bond yields
rose to 6.36 percent, their highest since the introduction of
the euro. The Italian equivalent also rose above 6
percent.	
 The German Bund future  was up 58 ticks on the day
at 129.57, while the dollar was up 0.7 percent against a
basket of major currencies. 
 With five days remaining before President Barack Obama's
Friday deadline for a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling,
Republicans and Democrats have yet to agree on a plan to cut the
nation's deficit and raise its debt limit in time to avoid an
unprecedented default. 
 U.S. corporate earnings will also be watched, with
International Business Machines Corp and Charles Schwab
Corp due to report later Monday.	
 
 GOLD ABOVE $1,600	
 Spot gold rose to an all-time peak above $1,600 an
ounce after rising more than 3 percent for a second straight
week last week, a feat it has not achieved since February 2009.	
 The safe-haven Swiss franc hit record highs
against the dollar and euro.	
 ""The stress test result was met with a lukewarm response
with focus again switching back to Europe. When that happens
gold is often allowed to perform despite the dollar
strengthening at the same time,"" said Saxo Bank analyst Ole
Hansen. 
 Concern over the failure of European policymakers to quickly
resolve the region's debt crisis drove the cost of insuring
Greek, Spanish and Italian debt against default to record highs.	
 Merkel called on Sunday for private investors to make a
major contribution to bailing out Greece. Officials proposed a
range of schemes for the European Financial Stability Facility
to finance a buy-back or a swap in which private owners of Greek
government bonds would accept cuts in the face value of their
holdings. 
 But clarity about a second bailout of Greece may bring only
temporary relief for the euro if investors decide the single
currency area's problems have become systemic and require a
region-wide solution.	
 Risk aversion pushed oil prices lower, with U.S. crude
 falling 0.6 percent at $96.69 a barrel.

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday, with a euro zone sovereign debt crisis that looks to be
getting worse pushing nervous investors towards perceived
safe-havens such as the Swiss franc and yen.	
 European bank stress test results released on Friday did
little to calm jitters, and attention is shifting to the next
emergency meeting of EU leaders scheduled for Thursday, when a
second bailout package for Greece will be under discussion.

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Sunday for private
investors to make a major contribution to bailing out Greece.
Officials proposed a range of schemes for the European Financial
Stability Facility to finance a buy-back or a swap in which
private owners of Greek government bonds would accept cuts in
the face value of their holdings. 
 However, clarity about a second bailout of Greece may bring
only temporary relief for the euro if investors decide the
single currency area's problems have become systemic and require
a region-wide solution. 
 ""It seems like a vicious circle with Germany's Merkel not
budging on private sector involvement and the ratings agencies
saying private involvement would constitute a selective
default,"" said Tom Levinson, currency analyst at ING. 
 ""With ECB (president) Trichet seeing no way defaulted debt
could be used as collateral, it's difficult to see the cycle
being broken at the moment.""	
 The euro fell sharply against the Swiss franc early in the
Asian trading day to change hands at a record low of 1.1365
, according to dealers, down from 1.1501 late in New
York on Friday. The pair bounced to 1.1446 in European dealing.	
 The franc has been the G10 currency of choice for investors
and traders seeking liquidity and relative safety from concerns
that the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis could spread to
countries such as Spain and Italy.	
 Italian and Spanish government bonds came under further
pressure on Monday, pushing their yield premiums over benchmark
German Bunds up on investor concern over the failure of euro
zone policymakers to quickly agree on a strategy for tackling
the debt crisis. 
 The euro was down 0.8 percent versus the dollar from late
Friday in New York at $1.4034 . Technical analysts said
next support was the 200-day moving average around $1.3912. The
euro fell over one percent against the low-yielding yen to
110.66 yen .	
 
 
 
 U.S. DEBT SAGA	
 Dealers have had some trouble pushing the euro out of a
trading range against the dollar in the past three months, with
political negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling running
dangerously close to an Aug. 2 deadline after which Washington
would be unable to pay its bills.	
 Republican and Democratic senators sought on Sunday to craft
a plan that could avert a government debt default should the
talks remain stalemated. Even if they do come up with a plan,
though, Standard & Poor's said last week it may still cut its
Aaa rating on U.S. debt if the agency is not convinced of
medium-term fiscal stability. 
 A Citi index of hedge fund positioning, which tracks the
correlation between fund returns and currency moves, showed bets
on the euro at overextended levels -- a somewhat
counterintuitive signal that suggested hedge funds were being
contrarian and buying on dips last week.	
 ""EURUSD continues to trade well above its last year's low.
It seems that market sentiment has turned decisively
USD-negative on the back of recent economic underperformance and
political brinkmanship with regard to the U.S. fiscal issues,""
said Citi in a note.	
 The dollar traded as low as 0.8034 francs on EBS,
against 0.8129 late on Friday. It then rebounded back to flat
for the day at 0.8134 as some dealers covered their short
positions.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 18 (Reuters) - Gold and the Swiss franc hit
record highs on Monday with further gains likely as the lack of
any breakthrough to the escalating debt crisis in the euro zone
and the United States saps demand for risky assets.	
 A looming U.S. debt default, Greece's future in the eurozone
ahead of a special summit on Thursday and the underwhelming
market reaction to the European bank stress test suggest
investors will keep increasing their exposure to cash and other
safe-haven assets this week at the cost of equities. 
 Even though Asian markets have remained largely resilient to
the latest flare-up in the ongoing euro zone debt crisis, a U.S.
debt default or the euro zone debt crisis engulfing one of its
major economies like Italy or Spain could trigger sharp outflows
from emerging markets. 
 Trading in Asia was largely quiet with Japan out for a
holiday though some choppiness across markets and a firm bid for
gold underscored the overall nervousness.	
 With five days remaining before President Barack Obama's
Friday deadline for a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling,
Republicans and Democrats have yet to agree on a big plan to cut
the nation's deficit and raise its debt limit in time to avoid
an unprecedented U.S. default. 
 
 
 
LOSING CONFIDENCE	
""Investors are gradually losing confidence as the U.S. debt
ceiling date nears and even though we expect a last-minute deal
to materialise, this kind of behaviour is making markets very
nervous,"" said Adrian Foster, head of financial markets research
-Asia Pacific at Rabobank International in Hong Kong.	
 ""While we may see some technical bounces in some asset
classes, sentiment is likely to remain cautious,"" he said. 
 Reflecting those worries, the greenback fell to as low as
0.8034 against the Swiss franc on EBS, against 0.8129
late on Friday, before settling higher.	
 The euro extended its slide against the Swiss franc, gapping
to a record low of 1.1365 in early Asian trade on
Monday according to dealers, down from 1.1501 late in New York
on Friday. 
 It has fallen by more than seven percent in the last 10
trading sessions.	
 Gold -- which has been one of the few bright spots in a
gloomy July so far -- stretched its winning streak to a 11th
session, the longest it has seen since at least August 1970. 
 The SPDR Gold ETF has been among the top performing
asset classes in the last three months, gaining nearly seven
percent. 
 
 NOT RIGOROUS ENOUGH	
 Even the better-than-expected results of a ""stress test""
conducted by the European Banking Authority on Friday failed to
dispel the broader gloom sweeping across markets.	
 The European Banking Authority (EBA) said that eight of 90
European banks had failed ""stress tests"" performed to determine
if they could withstand a long recession. Expectations were for
up to 15 banks to fall short. 
 The tests did not factor in the possible impact of a
sovereign Greek default, which most economists expect to happen
in some form. JP Morgan's Kian Abouhossein said Europe's banks
would be 80 billion euros short of funds in a tougher test of
their health, more than 30 times the amount demanded in the
official test.	
 With the stress results out of the way, market focus would
switch right back to a planned summit in Brussels on Thursday
where euro zone leaders would discuss the rescue of Greece.

 For now, risky assets are on the back foot.	
 Equities extended losses after suffering their biggest
weekly loss since February with the MSCI index of shares
ex-Japan down 0.5 percent. It fell 3.1 percent
last week.	
 Stock markets in Seoul , Australia and Taiwan
were trading in the red with losses in the latter led by
electronics and steel sectors.	
 Mirroring weaker Asian equities, European markets are
expected to open in the red with main European indices set to
open between 0.4 to 0.7 percent, lower according to financial
spreadbetters. 
 Corporate results will be in focus this week with Wall
Street giants like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Apple, GE and IBM set to report earnings. 
 In bond markets, U.S. Treasury yields rose to 2.98 percent,
rising from a seven-month low of 2.82 percent hit last Tuesday
as investors remained nervous about the risk of the world's
biggest bond market losing its much-prized ""AAA"" rating.	
 U.S. crude for August delivery  held on to last week's
gains at above $97.28 per barrel due to some short covering and
lower supplies.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Concern about the U.S.
government's ability to avoid a default boosted gold for a 10th
straight day on Friday and put pressure on stocks, even as
strong corporate earnings stoked some gains.
 Fears over the outcome of debt talks fueled safe-haven
buying, with U.S. government bond prices also rising.
 An acrimonious stalemate between President Barack Obama and
Republicans deepened on Friday in their negotiations over a
debt plan. For details, see [ID:nN1E76D26R]
 ""Everybody seems to be of the opinion that an agreement
will be reached even if at the last moment,"" said Natalie
Trunow, chief investment officer of equities of Calvert
Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland, which manages
about $14.8 billion.
 ""Hopefully we won't have any unpleasant surprises.""
 The euro turned flat against the dollar as the results of
European bank stress tests only slightly relieved anxiety over
euro zone debt woes.
 Only eight of the 90 European banks surveyed by the
European Banking Authority failed the stress tests, well below
market expectations that as many as 15 lenders would need more
capital to withstand a prolonged recession.
 ""To be honest, I am pretty skeptical of the results and
find it hard to believe that only eight failed,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange
in Washington.
 The test results, which were released after European stock

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The euro traded unchanged
against the dollar on Friday as investors shrugged off
European bank stress-test results and remained focused on
contagion risks of peripheral debt.
 Europe's banks grabbed the spotlight in the afternoon when
the European Banking Authority released its widely anticipated
stress-test results, showing eight banks failed a test of
their ability to withstand a prolonged recession. For story
[ID:nL6E7IF19G] [ID:nBANKTESTS]
 The stress test made on 90 lenders came in slightly below
expectations that around 10 to 15 lenders would fail.
""To be honest, I am pretty skeptical of the results and
find it hard to believe that only 8 failed,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 ""Furthermore, the assumptions used are not as realistic as
they could have been, and they did not discount for haircuts
on Greece or other sovereign debt.""
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro  was
nearly unchanged at $1.4146, still above a four-month low of
$1.38376  hit this week when fears of contagion risks
fears were running high.
 The more investors fear that heavily indebted euro-zone
governments will be unable to repay their debts, the more the
yields on their bonds rise, dragging down their value in
banks' balance sheets, erasing their capital, and increasing
the need for yet more bank bailouts by stronger euro-zone
governments.

 TAKE A LOOK: European bank stress tests
[ID:nL6E7IE0W0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 An unexpected contraction in a New York state
manufacturing index in July and a drop in U.S. consumer
sentiment had earlier boosted the safe-haven greenback. For a
wrap-up of U.S. economic data, see [ID:nN1E76E0B9].
 The ICE dollar index <.DXY> was last down 0.1 percent at
75.147. The core reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index for
June was up 0.3 percent, higher than forecast, but that did
not hurt the dollar. The data suggested another round of
Federal Reserve quantitative easing was not imminent.
 The impasse on the U.S. debt ceiling talks should remain a
headwind for the U.S. dollar. Standard & Poor's earlier said
there was a one-in-two chance it could cut the United States'
credit ratings if no deal was reached on raising the
government's debt ceiling. [ID:nL3E7IF03A]
 The euro's outlook was also shaky on worries about whether
Europe could find a solution to the debt crisis in Greece and
prevent contagion to larger countries such as Italy,
highlighted by the rising cost of insuring peripheral euro-
zone debt against default. [GVD/EUR]
 With prospects for both the euro and dollar muddied by
major concerns about debt in the euro zone and the United
States, some analysts recommended buying the safe-haven Swiss
franc as a hedge against risks to both the euro and the
dollar.
 Implied volatility in euro/Swiss one-month implied vols
 rose higher than Aussie/dollar one-month implied
vols  for the first time, which analysts said
reflected a continued search for safer alternatives as the
euro zone's debt crisis rages.
 Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities
in Toronto, favored buying the Swedish krona against the euro.
The euro was nearly unchanged at 9.1948 krona .
 ""The outlook for higher rates, large current account
surpluses, firm growth and local tolerance for (krona)
appreciation suggest that its recent slump versus the euro
should start to reverse.""

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Friday after results of European bank stress tests
eased some worries about the outlook for the region's financial
system, while on Wall Street stocks struggled to hold gains.
 Gold prices rose for a 10th straight session as fears over
the outcome of talks to avert a U.S. default fueled safe-haven
buying, which accelerated after President Barack Obama and
Republicans traded demands for a serious deficit plan.
 Only eight of the 90 European banks surveyed by the
European Banking Authority failed the stress tests, well below
market expectations that as many as 15 lenders would need more
capital to withstand a prolonged recession.
 ""It's a relief not more banks failed,"" said Thomas Roth,
executive director of U.S. government bond trading at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. in New York.
 The test results, which were released after European stock
markets had closed, measured the banks' ability to withstand a
prolonged recession that did not build in the impact of a Greek
default. For details, see [ID:nL6E7IF19G]
 European bank ADRs mostly gained, including Barclays
, up 0.3 percent at $14.60.
 Worries about the persistent euro zone debt woes have
weighed on markets, along with the prospect of a U.S. debt
default.
 Investors remain deeply concerned by Europe's inability to
find a broader solution to a debt crisis that could eventually
lead to a series of sovereign defaults and have wide-ranging
implications for public finances and banks worldwide.
 The euro hit a high of $1.41900, a New York session high.
It was last at $1.41572 , up 0.1 percent.
 The euro has borne up relatively well against the dollar
due to parallel concerns over the United States' own debt
troubles and hints further monetary easing could yet be on the
cards there, potentially flooding global markets with dollars.
 On Wall Street, stocks held on to slight gains, also helped
by Citigroup  and Google  , which reported much
stronger-than-expected earnings, adding to optimism about
corporate results for the second quarter.
 U.S. consumer sentiment in early July fell to its lowest
since March 2009 and manufacturing in New York state contracted
unexpectedly, according to data released on Friday. Indexes are
down for the week.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 2.68 points,
or 0.02 percent, at 12,439.80. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 3.02 points, or 0.23 percent, at 1,311.89. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 19.28 points, or 0.70
percent, at 2,781.95.
 ""With the European banks stress test out of the way, the
market has stabilized a bit, but we still have a lot to be
nervous about, mainly the U.S. debt ceiling issue,"" said Randy
Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab
Center for Financial Research in Texas, Austin.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading European
shares ended down 0.2 percent, while the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.1 percent.
 Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> closed
0.4 percent higher.
 Worries the euro zone debt crisis was spreading to Italy
have driven Italian bond yields  up half a percent
since last Friday and slashed valuations of financial sector
firms across the region.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose modestly as the public debt
problems on both sides of the Atlantic and worries over a
faltering U.S. economy revived safe-haven demand for U.S.
government debt.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading
4/32 higher in price to yield 2.94 percent, down from 2.96
percent late Thursday.
 Oil and gold prices also rose.
 U.S. crude  led the oil complex higher, rising $1.75
$97.44 a barrel. Brent crude  gained $1.19 to trade at
$117.45 a barrel.
 Spot gold  was up 0.2 percent at $1,589.89 an ounce.
It failed to hit a new peak after rallying to all-time highs in
the previous two sessions.
 ""The longer the debt talk drags on, the more you would want
to own a safe haven like gold. The crude oil market is also
rallying quite nicely, and that's a big element in support for
gold,"" said James Steel, chief commodity analyst at HSBC.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Anxiety over the results of
European bank stress tests drove down the euro against the
dollar on Friday and kept a lid on equities on both sides of
the Atlantic, despite strong earnings from Google and
Citigroup.
 Gold slipped after hitting record highs this week, with
some of the recent risk aversion easing.
 Worries about the persistent euro zone debt woes have
weighed on markets, along with the prospect of a U.S. debt
default.
 The stress tests on European banks are expected to show
that as many as 15 lenders need more capital to withstand a
prolonged recession, with criticism growing that the tests do
not encompass the impact of a Greek default. The results are to
be published at about 1600 GMT. For details see
[ID:nL6E7IF19G].
 Investors remain deeply concerned by Europe's inability to
find a broader solution to a debt crisis that could eventually
lead to a series of sovereign defaults and have wide-ranging
implications for public finances and banks worldwide.
 ""There's a general sense of nervousness prevailing because
of the stress tests,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX
research at GFT in New York.
 The euro  edged lower to $1.41251, down 0.1 percent,
while on the week, the euro was down 0.6 percent versus the
dollar.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading European
shares was down 0.1 percent, while the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.1 percent.
 Wall Street stocks opened higher after both Citigroup 
and Google  reported stronger-than-expected earnings,
adding to optimism about corporate results for the second
quarter. But the market pared gained on concern over the
European bank stress tests and signs of weakness in the U.S.
economy.
 U.S. consumer sentiment in early July fell to its lowest
since March 2009 and manufacturing in New York state contracted
unexpectedly, according to data released on Friday. Indexes are
down for the week.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 23.72
points, or 0.19 percent, at 12,460.84. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 4.41 points, or 0.34 percent, at
1,313.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 17.94
points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,780.61.
 Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> closed
0.4 percent higher.
 The dollar was supported by some safe-haven buying due to
the contraction in the New York state's manufacturing index in
July and the drop in a U.S. consumer sentiment index spurred
some safe-haven buying of the greenback. The euro and some
risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars fell against the dollar.
 But the focus remained squarely on the critical euro zone
bank stress tests. They are expected to show that around 10-15
lenders have insufficient capital to withstand a prolonged
recession. [ID:nL6E7IE23E].
 Traders, however, cited talk that banks in the euro zone
failing the tests could actually be more than 20.
 ""The key number is 15. If the number is higher than 15
banks, then that would create a disturbance in euro/dollar,""
said Schlossberg of GFT.
 The euro has borne up relatively well against the dollar
due to parallel concerns over the United States' own debt
troubles and hints further monetary easing could yet be on the
cards there, potentially flooding global markets with dollars.
 Worries the euro zone debt crisis was spreading to Italy
have driven Italian bond yields  up half a percent
since last Friday and slashed valuations of financial sector
firms across the region.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose as worries over the fallout from
the prolonged debt crisis in Europe and stalled U.S. budget and
deficit talks bolstered the safe-haven appeal of U.S.
government debt.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading
8/32 higher in price to yield 2.93 percent, down from 2.96
percent late Thursday.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,583.49 a troy ounce from
$1,586.75 an ounce late in New York on Thursday when the
precious metal hit a record high of $1,594.16.

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against the
dollar on Friday, as fears the results of European bank stress
tests due later in the day could further sour sentiment towards
the currency were tempered by concerns about U.S. debt after a
rating agency warning.	
 With worries about the euro zone and the United States
roughly offsetting each other, the euro was left stuck in
a range above a four-month low of $1.3838 hit earlier this week
and below Thursday's high of around $1.4282.	
 The euro was last up 0.1 percent at $1.4156. Traders said
demand from sovereign names had supported the single currency,
though they expected gains to be limited due to offers reported
at between $1.4190 to $1.4225. 
 ""Range-trading (in euro/dollar) is likely because
fundamentals everywhere are so bad,"" said Jane Foley, currency
strategist at Rabobank.	
 Many investors, while cautious, did not expect the stress
test results at 1600 GMT to have a significant market impact.
They are expected to show around 10 lenders have insufficient
capital to withstand a prolonged recession. 
 While there have been question marks over the tests'
credibility, no large bank is expected to fail and the total
capital needed could be under 10 billion euros. 
 ""It could be that the stress tests are a bit of a
non-event ... The market is bracing itself for something which
may not be brilliant but will show that banks are holding their
heads above water,"" Rabobank's Foley said.	
 Weighing on dollar sentiment, Standard & Poor's earlier said
there was a one-in-two chance it could cut the United States'
credit ratings if no deal was reached on raising the
government's debt ceiling. 
 But euro sentiment was also shaky on worries about whether
Europe could find a solution to the debt crisis in Greece and
prevent contagion to larger countries such as Italy, highlighted
by the rising cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default. 
 ""We continue to favour euro/dollar lower, fading any
rallies,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS. He
added, however, that many investors had been wrong-footed in
recent days in predicting that the euro had already peaked,
leaving them inclined to sit tight for now.	
 Italy's lower house of parliament was expected to give final
approval to austerity measures aimed at cutting its deficit in a
vote on Friday. 
 
 SWISS FRANC SEEN A BETTER BET	
 With the outlook for euro/dollar muddied by major concerns
about debt in both the euro zone and the U.S., some analysts
advocated buying the safe-haven Swiss franc as a hedge against
downside risks to both the euro and the dollar.	
 ""Given the sovereign debt problems in the Eurozone, we would
expect the Swiss franc to act as the major outlet to USD
downside should a ratings adjustment occur. USD/CHF and to a
lesser extent, EUR/CHF should decline,"" Commonwealth Bank of
Australia analyst Richard Grace said in a note.	
 The euro rose 0.15 percent to 1.1557 francs while
the dollar was steady at 0.8160 francs. However, both the
euro and the dollar hovered not far from recent record lows of
1.1494 francs and 0.8080 francs respectively.	
 Elsewhere, the Australian dollar fell sharply,
trading down 0.6 percent at $1.0650, after a Westpac note said
the next rate move by the Reserve Bank of Australia would be a
cut and forecast 100 basis points of easing through 2012.	
 Implied volatility in euro/Swiss one-month implied vols
rose higher than Aussie/dollar one-month implied
vols for the first time ever, which analysts said
reflected a continued search for safer alternatives as the euro
zone debt crisis rages.	
 ""The risk in the European story is outpricing everything
else,"" says Societe Generale analyst Olivier Korber, though he
added the prospect of Australian rate cuts could drag on the
currency and push Aussie vols higher again.	
 The dollar traded at 79.06 yen above a session low of
78.89 hit shortly after S&P's warning.	
 U.S. inflation data at 1230 GMT, followed later by U.S.
industrial output and University of Michigan sentiment figures
may provide further direction for the U.S. currency. 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that
inflation was higher than in 2010 when quantitative easing was
reintroduced, disappointing dollar bears.

 LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - Investors squared up on Friday
before the release of European bank stress tests, with European
banking shares flat after a sell-off that has knocked 2.5
percent off the region's stock markets this week. 
 Worries the euro zone debt crisis was spreading to Italy
have driven Italian bond yields up half a percent
since last Friday and slashed valuations of financial sector
firms across the region. 
 The euro has borne up relatively well against the dollar due
to parallel concerns over the United States' own debt troubles
and hints further monetary could yet be on the cards there,
potentially flooding global markets with dollars.	
 But investors remain deeply concerned by Europe's inability
to find a broader solution to a debt crisis that could
eventually lead to a series of defaults and have wide-ranging
implications for public finances and banks worldwide.	
 European Banking Authority test results, due to be published
at 1600 GMT after markets close, are expected to show that as
many as 15 lenders need more capital to withstand a prolonged
recession, with criticism growing that the tests do not
encompass the impact of a Greek default. 
 ""I'd be neutral going into (the stress test results) but
until there's a solution to the bigger picture problems that
people see as tangible and could work, Bunds are the only place
to be,"" Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers,
said.	
 European banks were flat after falling as much as
1.2 percent earlier.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European
shares was down 0.2 percent, while the MSCI All-Country World
Index eased 0.1 percent. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei
average closed 0.4 percent higher.	
 Yields on 10-year German Bunds were down 1.5
basis points at 2.728 percent, while Greece's 10-year government
bond yields rose 20 basis points to 17.38 percent.	
 
 
 DEBT CRISIS	
 Deutsche Bank analysts said in a report that political
disunity in tackling the debt crisis could prompt a slide in
equity valuations of 35 percent on world stocks, ""if the
situation deteriorates into a full-blown financial crisis on the
scale of the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.""	
 That is an extreme scenario, but critics say the banking
health check fails to reflect expectations that Greece will
default on its debt in some form, which would pile up losses for
German and French banks holding its bonds.	
 The cost of insuring European bank debt against debt default
rose, with the iTraxx Senior Financials index up by
4.9 basis points to 183.50 basis points.	
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4170 and up 0.4
percent at 1.1581 Swiss francs .	
 ""We think EUR/CHF may be the cleanest vehicle to express a
bearish view on eurozone systemic tension,"" brokerage Nomura
said in a note.	
 ""The challenge posed by the turmoil in the Italian bond
market is sustainable and in our view, the euro is set to
underperform as long as bond market tension in Italy and Spain
persists.""	
 An impasse over raising the United States' debt ceiling may
continue to weigh on the dollar, with ratings agency Standard &
Poor's following rival Moody's in warning it could cut the
country's prized AAA credit rating. 
 The dollar was steady at 79.12 yen and down 0.2
percent against a basket of currencies . 
 U.S. stock index futures    rose 0.1 to
0.3 percent, indicating a firm open for Wall Street on Friday
ahead of Citigroup quarterly results.	
 Gold eased 0.4 percent after hitting a record high of
$1,594.16 an ounce in the previous sessions due to investors
using it as a refuge from the tensions in other markets.	
 Brent crude  slipped 0.4 percent to trade below $116
a barrel, while copper prices rose 0.2 percent to trade
above $9,600 a tonne.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, July 15 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied in Asia on
Friday after the impact from a Standard and Poor's warning that
it could cut U.S. credit ratings was short-lived, and investors
bought back the U.S. currency as they shifted their focus to
stress tests on European banks.	
 The ratings agency warned there was a one-in-two chance it
could cut U.S. ratings if no deal was reached on raising the
government's debt ceiling. 
 The dollar briefly came under selling pressure, but the
impact was short-lived, perhaps because Moody's had already
raised the possibility of a downgrade. Dealers said the market
might also be hoping that the pressure from the agencies would
jolt U.S. lawmakers into doing a deal.	
 ""The impact from S&P's move is very limited. Obviously, it's
not great for the dollar, but contrary to what many people
think, it's not such a grave development,"" said Osamu Takashima,
chief forex strategist at Citibank in Tokyo.	
 The euro briefly advanced to $1.4199 , but investors
turned wary of bidding up the single currency ahead of the
result of Europe-wide stress tests on 90 banks due at 1600 GMT
which could force some to seek state aid .	
 As a result, the euro was holding in a tight range around
$1.4168 by midday in Asia, having earlier edged up from
an overnight low of $1.4115.	
 The dollar dipped to 0.8153 Swiss francs , not too far
from its record low of 0.8080.	
 The dollar remains 2.5 percent lower against the Swiss
currency for the week, and almost 13 percent for the year so
far, and dealers are betting on further losses.	
 The dollar edged back to 79.15 yen after slipping to
a session low of 78.89 shortly after S&P's warning.	
 Tokyo dealers said the dollar quickly advanced above 79 yen
after meeting solid bids from importers and retail investors.	
 Japanese players were reluctant to sell too actively as
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Friday kept up his verbal
intervention in the face of the yen's gains. 
 
 U.S. CONCERNS	
 Still, the yen is expected to stay buoyant as dollar
sentiment was harmed by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments and
uncertainty over debt ceiling in the United States.	
 Bernanke reiterated that the Fed would be prepared to inject
more stimulus into the system if the U.S. economy worsens after
the Fed ended its $600 billion asset-purchase programme, dubbed
QE2, last month.	
 But he told a U.S. Senate committee on Thursday that the
time had not come yet and noted inflation had picked up since
late 2010. 
 Wariness over the euro zone's debt crisis is also expected
to encourage yen buying, with the market closely watching the
outcome of the stress tests on European banks.	
 ""It's difficult to buy the dollar now with credit ratings of
U.S. debt under threat of being downgraded. Also, Bernanke's
remarks over possible monetary easing is another factor weighing
on the dollar although there are many hurdles to actually easing
credit further,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading
at Mizuho Corporate Bank in Tokyo.	
 ""Dollar/yen in particular will be under bigger downward
pressure due to the situation in the United States, as well as
Europe's debt crisis. The dollar can recover on short-covering,
but basically there is a bigger risk for dollar/yen to go
downwards,"" Kanehira said.	
 After four straight days of talks, President Barack Obama
and congressional leaders were nowhere near an agreement on
extending the nation's borrowing authority. 
 Bernanke said a Treasury default would be ""a calamitous
outcome. It would create a very severe financial shock that
would have effects not only on the U.S. economy but the global
economy."" 
 The market has always assumed the spectre of default would
force the warring sides to compromise on a deal, but concerns
are growing that some Republicans actually want to see the
government default.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 15 (Reuters) - Gold slipped on Friday after
rising for the past nine sessions, though growing risks
surrounding U.S. and euro zone debt crises have left investors
few safe alternatives except perhaps precious metals, the Swiss
franc and yen.	
 The U.S. dollar initially slipped against the euro
and Treasury prices dipped after Standard & Poor's warned there
was at least a 50 percent chance it will downgrade the U.S.
credit rating in the next 90 days, but with stress-test results
of European banks due later, traders were reluctant to make big
bets. 
 With the heightened risk that the world's most liquid
sovereign bond market may lose its top rating, together with
contagion in Spain's and Italy's bond markets, asset allocation
has become very difficult for investors with global remits.	
 Even emerging markets with their relatively higher growth
rates and big piles of foreign exchange reserves have struggled
recently, making it difficult for investors to preserve capital
other than putting them in perceived safe-haven assets.	
 ""Since the prospect of a downgrade would directly hit the
perceived safety value of U.S. Treasuries, it probably does mean
that global investors would be looking for a different kind of
safe asset if you will,"" said Michael Kurtz, head of strategy,
Asia with Macquarie Securities.	
 ""It's hard not to see Asia benefiting, not simply because
there are sovereigns in Asia that are beginning to look stronger
in relative terms but also because the U.S. dollar would be
likely to decline in that scenario,"" Kurtz told Reuters
Television. 
 
 The euro hit an intraday high around $1.4200 versus
the dollar after the S&P announcement before trimming some of
its gains to settle back at $1.4173.	
 Against the low-yielding yen , the greenback was
trading at 79.13 yen, though some short-covering demand after
this week's sharp drop and before the weekend is expected to
lend support to the pair.	
 Though the recent flurry of warnings by ratings agencies is
widely seen as a move to jolt U.S. authorities to end a looming
debt deadlock, Todd Elmer, FX strategist at Citigroup, said
S&P's emphasis on the need for a more sustainable medium-term
fiscal path posed a more formidable challenge.	
 ""This presents a much higher hurdle for policymakers and, as
such, represents a more serious threat to the U.S. dollar,""
Elmer said in a note.	
 Ten-year Treasury note futures  edged slightly higher
to 124-14 after spending most of the session in the red. Yields
on 10-year notes were unchanged on the day at 2.95
percent, though risked climbing higher. After Moody's warned it
may cut the U.S. rating, Treasuries sold off in the New York
trading session.	
 The past three months have favoured the Swiss franc, gold
and U.S. Treasuries. The Swiss franc ETF is up 9.19
percent over the past three months while the SPDR Gold ETF
has gained 6.5 percent.	
 The Bank of America Merrill Treasury Master index is up 3.5
percent while the S&P 500 and the MSCI emerging markets
stocks index is down 0.82 percent 3.79 percent
respectively. 
 A recent spike in Italian and Spanish bond yields has
demanded a greater urgency in tackling Europe's debt crisis, and
further downgrades of the credit ratings of Portugal and Ireland
have made clear that the lack of a comprehensive solution
threatened to drag bigger countries into the debt crisis.
 
 Gold was down 0.3 percent at $1,581.59 an ounce,
still within sight of a record $1,600 an ounce after a nine-day
rally pushed prices up as much as 7 percent. Silver was
up 0.2 percent at $38.27, just below a two-month high of $39.34
hit in the previous session. 
 NO QE3	
 Demand for risky assets also received a setback after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke deflated some hopes of a
third round of stimulus for the struggling economy. The earlier
two rounds of quantitative easing were powerful drivers for
equities and commodities. ID:nN1E76D169]	
 Hong Kong shares dipped, weighed down by Chinese
property stocks after China on Thursday extended home purchase
restrictions to more cities. 
 Japanese shares were slightly up on bargain buying.
Foreigners have turned into net buyers of Japanese equities for
two successive weeks.	
 Citigroup says Japan now ranks at the top of the global
earnings revision index in key regions.	
 Technology counters in Asia got a boost from internet giant
Google Inc's strong results which sent its shares
surging higher by 12 percent. 
 The MSCI index of shares for Asia ex-Japan
was largely flat. For the week it is down nearly 3 percent, its
biggest weekly decline since mid February. 
 Bernanke's comments took the wind out of the oil markets for
most of the Asian session, though U.S. crude for August delivery
 bounced a bit to $95.86 a barrel after finishing the
previous session at $95.69.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Gold prices hit a record high
on Thursday in the wake of Moody's warning that the U.S.
government may lose its top credit rating, while stocks and oil
prices fell after the Federal Reserve chief dampened hopes of
further economic stimulus.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated on Thursday that the
U.S. central bank would be prepared to inject more stimulus
into the system if the U.S. economy worsens, but told a U.S.
Senate committee that the time had not come yet and noted
inflation had picked up since late 2010. For details, see
[ID:nN1E76D0IG]
 While Bernanke's comments broadly pushed commodities lower,
gold rallied on a safe-haven bid after Moody's warning late
Wednesday, which was the latest jolt to investors who are
already on edge about the spreading debt crisis in the euro
zone.
 The credit rating agency said it could strip the world's
biggest economy of its coveted AAA credit status on the growing
risk that it could default because Washington has not reached a
deal to raise its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. For details see
[ID:nLDE76D01W]
 The U.S. Treasury has warned that after Aug. 2 it will not
have enough money to pay all of the country's bills if a deal
is not reached over cutting the fiscal deficit to allow the
debt ceiling to be raised.
 Spot gold  touched a record high of $1,594.16, and
was up 0.3 percent at $1,586.11 an ounce. U.S. gold futures
 for August delivery settled up $3.80 an ounce.
 The precious metal posted its ninth straight daily rise,
its longest run of gains since October 2006, notching total
gains for the period of more than 7 percent.
 ""This is more about fear, about the dollar, the debt
troubles in Europe, as well as the possible downgrade of the
U.S. credit rating by Moody's,"" said Commerzbank analyst Eugen
Weinberg. ""For gold, this is (one of) the best times.""
 BERNANKE WEIGHS ON MARKETS
 U.S. stocks fell after Bernanke backed off hints that
additional near-term stimulus could be on the way, removing a
possible catalyst from a market already facing plenty of
obstacles.
 Wall Street had snapped a three-day losing streak on
Wednesday after comments by Bernanke, in his first of two days
of testimony before Congress, suggested that the Fed could be
ready to act again to support the economy.
 ""Bernanke has backed off considerably from what might have
been more stimulus, and that made yesterday's rally like eating
sugar for lunch: nothing more than a short burst of energy,""
said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol
Securities Management in Richmond, Virginia.
 The Fed chairman also renewed his warning that a United
States debt default would be devastating for the U.S. and
global economies.
 The Fed ended its most recent asset-purchase program in
June. Traders said another round of easing would flood the
financial system with yet more money and encourage investors to
reach for higher-yielding currencies and assets.
 The Fed's easy money policies since 2008 have helped
bolster stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up about 95
percent from its March 2009 closing low.
 Technology stocks led the losses on Wall Street on
Thursday.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 54.49 points, or 0.44 percent, at 12,437.12. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 8.85 points, or 0.67
percent, at 1,308.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 34.25 points, or 1.22 percent, at 2,762.67.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.7 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> ended down 0.9
percent. In Asia overnight, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended down
0.3 percent.
 In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar was up 0.02
percent against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. Both the euro
 and dollar  at one point hit record lows
against the Swiss currency as investor demand for the
traditional safe haven remained elevated.
 OIL SLIDES
 Oil prices dropped in volatile trading following Bernanke's
comments.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, August crude 
fell $2.36, or 2.41 percent, to settle at $95.69 per barrel,
trading from $94.53 to $98.88. Thursday's slip was the biggest
one-day percentage loss since July 8.
 ICE Brent August crude  went off the board after
falling 46 cents to settle at $118.32.
 U.S. Treasuries prices slipped as well, with benchmark
10-year Treasury notes  trading 20/32 lower in
price to yield 2.96 percent, up from 2.88 percent on Wednesday
afternoon.
 ""The potential downgrade of U.S. debt caused the market to
sell off a little bit overnight, but given all the headlines
concerning the potential downgrade, the markets are trading
extremely resiliently here, and I would not be surprised if
once we digest this bit of supply we continue to motor toward
lower yields,"" said Scott Graham, head of government bond
trading at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the
euro and rallied from record lows versus the Swiss franc on
Thursday after the Federal Reserve chief dampened growing
expectations another round of monetary easing was imminent.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated that the central bank
would be prepared to inject more stimulus into the system if
the U.S. economy worsens after the Fed ended its $600 billion
asset-purchase program, dubbed QE2, last month.
 But he told a U.S. Senate committee on Thursday that the
time had not come yet and noted inflation had picked up since
late 2010. For details, see [ID:nN1E76D0IG]
 The euro, which had been trading near $1.4225, fell on
Bernanke's remarks and was last down 0.3 percent at
$1.4135. Bernanke's comment also helped the dollar
climb from a four-month trough against the yen .
 Comments by Bernanke on Wednesday, in the first of two days
of testimony before Congress, that the Fed could do more to
boost the economy had bruised the dollar.
 ""The dollar has unwound its losses from yesterday because
Bernanke has backed away from QE3 (quantitative easing),"" said
Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in
New York.
 The greenback still faced an uphill battle though,
particularly after Moody's warning late on Wednesday that the
United States could lose its top credit rating if Congress does
not raise the debt ceiling.
 In a statement, Moody's said it sees a ""rising possibility""
that the debt limit will not be raised in time to prevent a
default on some U.S. Treasury debt obligations.
 After four straight days of talks, President Barack Obama
and congressional leaders were nowhere near an agreement on
extending the nation's borrowing authority. [ID:nN1E76D0KY]
 Bernanke said a Treasury default would be ""a calamitous
outcome. It would create a very severe financial shock that
would have effects not only on the U.S. economy but the global
economy."" [ID:nN1E76D0OQ]
 However, most market participants assume U.S. politicians
will ultimately do the right thing. Peter Buchanan, an
economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, believes a ""default
is unlikely,"" but if it does happen, the ""U.S. dollar would
likely lose ground ... along with equities as risk-averse
investors sought out alternative havens.""
 EURO STRUGGLES, YEN IN DEMAND
 The euro also faces hurdles, traders said, with persistent
worries about the euro zone debt crisis likely to keep it under
pressure. It retreated from a session high near $1.43 after
Italy was forced to pay the highest borrowing costs on record
for new 15-year debt. [ID:nL6E7IE0DV]
 Investors are worried about European bank exposure to a
possible Greek default. French banks are thought to have some
of the largest exposure, and price action reflects the unease.
 Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura in
New York, said the best way to express a bearish view on the
euro is to sell it against the Swiss franc.
 ""Euro/Swiss franc has tracked systemic risk in the euro
zone more closely than euro/dollar,"" said Nordvig. ""This is
perhaps no major surprise given that euro/dollar is heavily
influenced by the state of the U.S. economy, expectations for
which are highly variable at the moment.""
 Both the euro  and dollar  hit record
lows against the Swiss currency on Thursday. In late trading,
the euro slipped 0.2 percent to 1.1534 francs, while the dollar
rose 0.2 percent to 0.8160 franc. For the week, the dollar was
on track for its weakest performance since late May.
 The rush for safer assets also boosted the yen, with the
dollar hitting a four-month low around 78.450 yen  before
rebounding to 79.15, up 0.2 percent on the day.
 The yen's rise prompted warnings from Japan's Finance
Ministry, with a senior official saying the country could
intervene without warning to weaken the currency.
[ID:nL3E7ID3ZE]
 Japan intervened in tandem with other major countries in
March following its devastating earthquake and tsunami, but
analysts say it would likely act on its own this time.
 A strong yen hurts the fragile, export-driven Japanese
economy, but investors tend to flock to it in uncertain times
as they unwind risky trades funded with the yen's cheap rates.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Gold prices hit a record high
on Thursday in the wake of Moody's warning that the U.S.
government may lose its top credit rating, while stocks and oil
prices fell on comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 Stocks reversed early gains after the U.S. central bank

 BERNANKE WEIGHS ON MARKETS
 Bernanke, in a second day of delivering the Fed's
semiannual monetary policy report to the U.S. Congress,
repeated his statement that the Fed stood ready to take more
action should the economy weaken further. But he also said that
inflation was higher now than it was late last year, so the Fed
is not ready yet to take action.
 The Fed chairman also renewed his warning that a United
States debt default would be devastating for the U.S. and
global economies.
 On Wednesday, stocks had rallied after he suggested further
monetary policy stimulus was possible if needed.

one-day percentage loss since July 8.
 U.S. Treasuries prices slipped as well, with benchmark
10-year Treasury notes  trading 15/32 lower in
price to yield 2.94 percent, up from 2.88 percent on Wednesday
afternoon.
 ""The potential downgrade of U.S. debt caused the market to
sell off a little bit overnight, but given all the headlines
concerning the potential downgrade, the markets are trading
extremely resiliently here and I would not be surprised if once
we digest this bit of supply we continue to motor toward lower
yields,"" said Scott Graham, head of government bond trading at
BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Gold prices hit a record high
on Thursday in the wake of Moody's warning that the U.S.
government may lose its top credit rating, while stocks and oil
prices fell on comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 Stocks reversed early gains after the U.S. central bank
chief's comments dampened investor speculation that more
economic stimulus may be on the way. Oil prices also declined,
while the U.S. dollar trimmed its losses.
 Moody's warned late Wednesday that it could strip the
world's biggest economy of its loftiest credit status on the
growing risk that it could default because Washington has not
reached a deal to raise its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. For
details see [ID:nLDE76D01W].
 The U.S. Treasury has warned it will run out of money after
Aug. 2 to pay all of the country's bills if a deal is not
reached over cutting the fiscal deficit to allow the debt
ceiling to be raised.
 Spot gold  touched a record $1,594.16 an ounce and
was up 0.4 percent at $1,588.06. U.S. gold futures for August
delivery gained $3.40 an ounce at $1,588.90.
 The precious metal is on track for its ninth straight daily
rise, its longest run of gains since October 2006. During that
period, bullion has risen more than 7 percent.
 ""This is more about fear, about the dollar, the debt
troubles in Europe, as well as the possible downgrade of the
U.S. credit rating by Moody's,"" said Commerzbank analyst Eugen
Weinberg. ""For gold, this is (one of) the best times.""
 In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar was off 0.2
percent against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. Both the euro
 and dollar  at one point hit record lows
against the Swiss currency as investor demand for the
traditional safe haven remained elevated.
 As the deadline for raising the U.S. statutory borrowing
limit nears, investors ""are going to want to hold other
currencies and that will weigh on the dollar,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 BERNANKE WEIGHS ON MARKETS
 It was the second day of testimony from Bernanke to the
U.S. Congress. Stocks rallied on Wednesday after he suggested
further monetary policy stimulus was possible if needed.
 The Fed ended its most recent asset-purchase program in
June. Traders said another round of easing would flood the
financial system with yet more money and encourage investors to
reach for higher-yielding currencies and assets.
 The Fed's easy money policies since 2008 have helped
bolster stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up about 95
percent from its March 2009 closing low.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 5.49 points,
or 0.04 percent, at 12,497.10. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 1.76 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,315.96. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 19.30 points, or 0.69
percent, at 2,777.62.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
1.3 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> ended down 0.9
percent. Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended down 0.3 percent.
 OIL SLIDES
 Oil prices dropped in volatile trading following Bernanke's
comments. In London, Brent crude for August delivery 
fell 48 cents to $118.30 a barrel, down from a session high of
$119.40. U.S. crude for August delivery  dropped $2.30 to
$95.75 after rising to $98.88 earlier.
 U.S. Treasuries prices slipped as well, with benchmark
10-year Treasury notes  trading 7/32 lower in
price to yield 2.94 percent, up from 2.88 percent on Wednesday
afternoon.
 ""The potential downgrade of U.S. debt caused the market to

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Gold prices hit another
record high and the U.S. dollar slid to a fresh low against the
Swiss franc on Thursday in the wake of Moody's warning that the
U.S. government may lose its top credit rating.
 Stocks were mixed, with an improved outlook for
second-quarter U.S. corporate profits after JPMorgan Chase's
 results helped U.S. stocks in early trading.
 Moody's said late on Wednesday there was an increased
possibility the statutory U.S. debt limit would not be raised
on a timely basis, leading to a default on U.S. Treasury debt
obligations. For details, see [ID:nLDE76D01W]
 The U.S. Treasury has warned that it will run out of money
after Aug. 2 to pay all of the country's bills if a deal is not
reached over cutting the fiscal deficit to allow the debt
ceiling to be raised. A default would raise the prospect of a
cut in the United States' AAA credit rating.
 Spot gold  touched a record $1,594.16, and was up 0.4
percent at $1,588.49 an ounce at 1330 GMT. U.S. gold futures
 for August delivery were up $3.40 an ounce at
$1,588.90.
 ""This is more about fear, about the dollar, the debt

 In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar was down

euro  and dollar  at one point hit record
lows against the Swiss currency as investor demand for the
traditional safe haven remained elevated.
 As the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the U.S. statutory
borrowing limit nears, investors ""are going to want to hold

McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 STOCKS STEADY AFTTER BERNANKE
 Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that he
was not ready to take more monetary easing action yet caused
stocks to cut some early gains, while the dollar trimmed some
of its losses.
 It was the second day of testimony from Bernanke to the
U.S. Congress. His comments on Wednesday supported stocks after
he suggested further monetary policy stimulus was possible if
needed.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 17.26
points, or 0.14 percent, at 12,508.87. The Standard & Poor's

0.3 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> shed 0.8

government debt.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low
against the Swiss franc on Thursday and the euro rose a day
after Moody's warned the United States could lose its top
credit rating if Congress doesn't raise the U.S. debt ceiling.
 The dollar also hit a four-month low against the yen after
the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted Wednesday at further policy
easing should the economy worsen, though better-than-expected
U.S. unemployment and retail sales data Thursday eased concern
and helped the dollar pare its losses. [ID:nN1E76D0A6]
 Still, traders said the prospect of a U.S. downgrade would
make it hard for the dollar to gain much traction, particularly
with talks between the White House and Republicans to reach a
last minute deal not going well. [ID:nN1E76C007]
 In a statement, Moody's said it sees a ""rising possibility""
that the debt limit won't be raised in time to prevent a
default on some U.S. Treasury debt obligations.
 As the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the debt ceiling nears,
investors ""are going to want to hold other currencies, and that
will weigh on the dollar,"" said Mark McCormick, currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 The euro was last up 0.3 percent at $1.4227 , well
off a four-month low beneath $1.39 hit earlier this week. But
lingering worries about the euro zone debt crisis could cap
further gains, traders said. The euro retreated from a session
high near $1.43 after Italy was forced to pay the highest
borrowing costs on record for new 15-year debt.[ID:nL6E7IE0DV]
 Investors are still worried about European bank exposure to
a possible Greek default. French banks are thought to have some
of the largest exposure, and price action reflects the unease,
with the euro's fortunes waxing and waning in tandem with the
share prices of banks such as BNP Paribas .
 ""It's really a tug-of-war between the euro and dollar.
They're like two lumbering prize fighters just leaning against
each other,"" said David Watt, senior strategist at RBC Capital
Markets. ""If you want clarity on what people think of both
currencies, look at the Swiss franc.""
 Both the euro  and dollar  hit record
lows against the Swiss currency on Thursday as investor demand
for the traditional safe haven remained elevated.
 The same rush for safer assets boosted the yen, with the
dollar hitting a four-month low around 78.45 yen . It was
last unchanged at 79.05 yen.
 That provoked warnings from Japan's Finance Ministry, with
a senior official saying the country could intervene without
warning to weaken the currency. [ID:nL3E7ID3ZE]
 Japan intervened in tandem with other major counties in
March following a devastating earthquake and tsunami, but
analysts say it would likely act on its own this time.
 Traders said there may have been some semi-official demand
overnight, but investors would treat any rally in the dollar
against the yen as an opportunity to sell as Japan has limited
success intervening on its own.
 A strong yen hurts the fragile, export-driven Japanese
economy, but investors tend to flock to it in uncertain times
as they unwind risky trades financed with borrowed yen.
 ""Swiss franc strength causes discomfort but yen strength
causes actual pain,"" Watt said. ""But as long as the global
backdrop is one of risk aversion, they will probably have only
limited success if they try to stand in the way of yen gains.""
 The New Zealand dollar  hit a 30-year high after
better-than-expected economic data increased expectations of a
rate increase before year end. It was last up 0.6 percent at
$0.8434. [ID:nL3E7I5025]

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Rating agency Moody's warning
that the U.S. economy's top credit ranking may be in danger
weakened world stocks on Thursday, hit the dollar and helped
push gold to a record high.	
 Moody's said late on Wednesday there was an increased
possibility the statutory U.S. debt limit would not be raised on
a timely basis, leading to a default on U.S. Treasury debt
obligations. 
 The idea of Washington losing its triple-A status was enough
to wipe out any residual bounce on stock markets from U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments on Wednesday
that there could be further stimulus if needed.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI fell 0.3
percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 shed more than 1
percent. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.3 percent.	
 Analysts continue to believe that there will be a
last-minute political deal to extend the U.S. debt limit, but
the uncertainty is playing into a generally nervous market.	
 ""The U.S. debt situation is annoying. It's politics pure and
simple. I guess they'll get out of it in time so no harm will be
done,"" said Koen De Leus, strategist at KBC Securities. 
""But it does create additional nervousness on top of all
other issues like the uncertainty about U.S. growth in the
second half of 2011, inflation problems in emerging countries
and the European debt problem.""	
 U.S. stock futures fell around 0.1 percent , pointing
to a weaker open on Wall Street later.	
 General risk aversion towards debt pushed investors into
gold , which hit a nominal record of $1,589.56 an ounce.	
 ""Lacking a really reliable destination, a lot of the funds
leaving the bonds market are going into precious metals on the
notion that their value will be retained even if policymakers
are pressured to go to further extremes to work against
contagion,"" said one gold trader in Singapore.	
 
 DOLLAR SUFFERS	
 Demand for triple-A rated German debt rose after the Moody's
U.S. warning. But that was only one factor driving a flight from
risk as concern about the euro zone's own problems also grew
over delays to policymakers' plans to tackle the region's
deepening debt and after Fitch downgraded Greece further into
junk territory on Wednesday. 
 Italy has moved closer to centre stage in Europe's debt
crisis over the past week. At an auction on Thursday, Italy had
to pay the highest rates in three years to sell almost 5 billion
euros of long-term debt, highlighting growing pressure on its
public finances .	
 The euro erased early gains to stand flat at $1.4191 .
The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies
, hurt by both Moody's and Bernanke.	
 ""The dollar has digested the news from Moody's but there is
still an awful lot of event risk in the coming couple of
sessions. It's going to be a bit of a wild ride,"" said Adam
Cole, FX strategist at RBC Capital Markets.	
 Concerns about the U.S. budget deficit put the brakes on a
rally in oil prices, pushing Brent  down 20 cents to
$118.48 a barrel.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on the run in
Asia on Thursday after a ratings warning from Moody's and a hint
of further policy easing from the Federal Reserve unleashed a
wave of panic selling, much to the relief of the hard-pressed
euro.
 As fiscal problems hurt not just the euro but also the
dollar, traders looked to the Swiss franc as a likely safe haven
for investors, boosting the currency to a record high against
the dollar and the euro.
 The New Zealand dollar was another stand-out performer,
soaring to 30-year highs against the greenback after data showed
the economy grew far faster than expected in the first quarter,
reviving the chance of a rate hike before the year-end.
[ID:nL3E7I5025]
 That stood in stark contrast to the United States, where Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke had canvassed the idea of further
quantitative easing should economic growth and inflation slow.
[ID:nTOPMACRO]
 ""Three months ago all the focus was on the exit from
unconventional policy; now Bernanke mentions the conditional
possibility of QE3,"" said Paul Meggyesi at JPMorgan. ""This is
unambiguously bad for the dollar and good for risk.""
 The dollar fell to its lowest level in a week against a
basket of currencies, with the dollar index <.DXY> falling as
low as 74.690, down 2.6 percent from a four-month peak hit just
two days ago.
 A fall below trendline support, which comes around the
74.40-45 area this week, could be taken as a sign that the
dollar's gradual uptrend since early May has ended, opening the
way for a new downtrend just as the Fed's two previous
experiments with quantitative easing led to a constant decline
in the dollar.
 ""Now that Bernanke has made it clear that a third round of
quantitative easing is possible, any weak reading in U.S. data
could boost speculation about easing and is likely to pressure
the dollar,"" said Yunosuke Ikeda, a senior analyst at Nomura
Securities.
 The U.S. dollar slid to a fresh record low against the Swiss
franc around 0.8080 francs , before stepping back up to
around 0.8122 franc, which is still 0.8 percent below late U.S.
levels.
 The euro leaped to $1.4205  for a gain of 0.3 percent,
having risen nearly 3 percent from a four-month low hit earlier
in the week, when players were frightened by the spectre of the
euro zone debt crisis hitting big economies such as Italy and
Spain. But it hit another record low against the Swiss franc,
dropping as low as 1.1494 franc  before bouncing back
to around 1.1550.
 The dollar fell to a four-month low of 78.45 at one stage,
just above a 76.4 percent retracement of its rally after joint
intervention by the Group of Seven nations in March before
spiking up about a full yen to around 79.60 yen, with traders
citing heavy buying from a U.S. bank.
 While the sharp price action made traders nervous about
intervention from Japanese authorities, many traders think the
Bank of Japan was not in the market.
 ""Lots of people are talking about big one-shot buying from a
U.S. bank,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda earlier said the
yen's rise does not reflect fundamentals but many traders doubt
that Japan is ready to intervene to curb the yen's strength at
this stage given that the move is driven largely be overall
weakness in the dollar, rather than yen-specific factors.
 DOUBLE WHAMMY
 In a double whammy for the U.S. currency, Moody's warned the
country could lose its top-notch credit rating if lawmakers fail
to increase the country's debt ceiling. [ID:nWNA3574]
 In a statement, Moody's said it sees a ""rising possibility
that the statutory debt limit will not be raised on a timely
basis, leading to a default on U.S. Treasury debt obligations.""
 The market has always assumed the spectre of default would
force the White House and Republicans to reach a last minute
deal by Aug. 2, when the U.S. will run out of funding options,
but the talks are not going well.
 ""Markets seem to think the deal will be reached in time but
they may be overlooking the risk of the deal not coming through.
And if this put more strains on markets, that will only hasten
QE3,"" said Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo
Securities.
 Indeed, the talks between President Barack Obama and
Republican lawmakers on Wednesday became so acrimonious that
Obama walked out as they clashed over how to cut budget
deficits. [ID:nN1E76C007]
 The latest U.S. debt woes were a timely diversion for the
euro given that Fitch had just downgraded Greece deeper into
junk territory, citing the absence of a new and fully funded
financing programme. [ID:nN1E76C16K]
 But Fitch also indicated that Italy would be able to keep
its current credit rating if it stuck to fiscal targets, giving
some fillip to Italian and Spanish debt.[ID:nN1E76C0OO] Some
market players think panic over Italy is overdone as the country
is seen running a primary budget balance this year.
 For now, Italy faces a tough test later on Thursday when it
sells up to 5 billion euros of new debt, with dealers expecting
it to have to pay high yields to attract demand.
 Elsewhere, the kiwi flew as high as $0.8508 , a
30-year peak, on the strong reading in New Zealand's GDP. But it

percent on the day.
 The currency also gained sharply against the Australian
dollar, as rising expectations that rates may rise sooner helped
to tighten the Aussie's yield advantage over the kiwi. The
Aussie fell 0.5 percent to NZ$1.2730 , falling below

 By Vikram Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, July 14 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday,
sending gold to a record high, after a Moody's warning on the
United States' credit rating but resilience in U.S. Treasuries
suggested bond investors expected lawmakers to ultimately raise
the county's debt ceiling in time to avoid default.	
 The weak dollar gave the beleagured euro a slight reprieve
although a looming Italian bond auction kept investors on edge.	
 European stock markets were set for a lower start with
Britain's FTSE 100 seen down 1.2 percent and Germany's
DAX down a percent. 
 Italy will likely have to pay a hefty price to sell up to 5
billion euros of long-term bonds in what will be a key test of
market appetite for the country's debt since contagion worries
sparked a sharp sell-off in its assets. 
The standoff in the U.S. Congress over raising Washington's
debt ceiling while disagreements over a plan to reduce the
ballooning deficit prompted Moody's to place its Aaa rating on
review for a possible downgrade for the first time since 1996.

 For markets, the stalled U.S. debt talks have added to
worries that Europe's sovereign debt crisis is worsening.
Meantime, euro zone leaders sought to break an impasse on how
and when to grant Greece urgent aid. 
 The risk of a lower credit rating for the U.S. overshadowed
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's suggestion, in testimony
to Congress, that the central bank could provide more stimulus
if the economy weakens further.	
 ""It's a very political environment right now and that's
causing all this volatility and you'd have to be too brave to
take very big decisions,"" said Elke Schoeppl-Jost, Chief
Investment Officer at BEA Union Investment in Hong Kong.	
 ""Gold is speaking its own language and I expect its rise
will continue,"" said Schoeppl-Jost. ""Especially if there is more
money-printing from the U.S.""	
 The potential for another round of asset purchases by the
Fed, known as quantitative easing, and the Moody's warning added
up to a double whammy for the dollar.	
 It slid to a four-month low of 78.48 against the yen
earlier in the day before regaining some ground to hit a session
high of 79.01 on talk that a U.S. bank was a buyer of dollars.
.	
 The stronger yen drove demand for Japanese government bonds
with the yield on 10-year JGBs dropping below
1.085 percent to an eight-month low and the benchmark Nikkei
stock index which ended 0.3 percent lower.	
 Exporters were hit by the yen's rise with Sony Corp
down a percent and Toyota off 0.8 percent.	
 Adding a layer of uncertainty to already jittery markets, a
senior official at Japan's Ministry of Finance said it was
possible Japan could intervene in the market without giving any
advance warning. 
 The White House and Congress must forge a deal to raise
America's debt limit by Aug. 2 or the government will run out of
money to pay its bills and default on some obligations. But they
have so far failed due to a sharp divide over taxes.	
 
 
 DOLLAR WOES	
 The U.S. currency was on the run in Asia hitting a fresh
record low against the Swiss franc around 0.8082 francs earlier
while the euro rose to $1.4177 after having fallen
to as low as $1.3984.	
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.2
percent at 75.092 , having tumbled for a high of 76.053.	
 The Moody's warning has intensified pressure on U.S.
lawmakers to scramble together a deal to avert a debt default.	
 ""We believe that the most likely scenario is that the
Moody's statement provides motivation for a more serious push to
a political compromise and USD selling on this factor may
unwind,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 foreign exchange
strategy at Citigroup.	
 Gold powered to a fresh record on course for a ninth
successive day of gains, matching a similar winning streak in
2006. 
 Elsewhere in Asia, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan
was trading down 0.3 percent lower with Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index down 0.3 percent.	
 ""From a macro perspective and even a fundamental perspective
Asia is in a much stronger position than the West, but you can't
look at Asia in isolation,"" said Catherine Yeung, investment
director at Fidelity Investments in Hong Kong.	
 ""You look at market turnover and it's been incredibly thin.
From a fund flow point of view, the biggest risk for Asia
Pacific markets still remains what's going in the U.S. and
Europe,"" said Yeung, who added that there were buying
opportunites based on valuations for long-term investors in
Asia.	
 Thomas Kwan, Head of Asian Debt Investment at Baring Asset
Management, said a U.S. technical default ""would be troublesome
to the market, even for a very short period of time. Look at
what happened to Italy on Monday."" 
 ""But this will not mean real money accounts will actually
sell heavily into this event as investors will still believe
that the US will at least come up with a plan to service debt
very quickly, if not, it would be disastrous for the global
financial system global and economy.""

 * Moody's after-hours announcement reverses earlier rally
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures and the
dollar fell late Wednesday after Moody's Investors Service
warned the United States may lose its prized AAA credit rating,
reversing a rally on Wall Street.
 The credit ratings agency cited the growing risk that
Washington could fail to raise its $14.3 trillion government
debt limit ""on a timely basis."" For details, see [ID:nWNA3574]
U.S. government debt prices also fell. Benchmark 10-year
Treasury notes  slid 8/32 in price to yield 2.91
percent, while the dollar tumbled against most major currencies
and set another record low against the Swiss franc as
Thursday's Asian trading session opened.
 The dollar fell as low as 0.8140 Swiss franc on electronic
trading platform EBS . S&P 500 futures initially lost
about 11 points on the news to about 1,302 before recovering a
bit to 1,306, down 5.10 points from Wednesday's close.
 ""They've been threatening to do it for the last 60 days,""
said Cliff Draughn, president and chief investment officer at
Excelsia Investment Advisors in Savannah, Georgia. ""What has
been beginning to spook Moody's and some other people is that
Congress may be dumb enough to actually default on the debt.""
 Investors have not fully appreciated the seriousness of a
potential credit downgrade, as most have expected an agreement
to be reached in Washington, said Troy Buckner, managing
principal at NuWave Investment Management in Parsippany, New
Jersey.
 ""This would likely be a game-changer over the very short
run and could cause large market dislocations very quickly,""
Buckner said.
 Some still held out for President Barack Obama and Congress
to broker a deal despite political brinksmanship and an
attitude toward default that is too cavalier, said David Joy,
chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.
 Moody's announcement came after global stocks and the euro
had rallied following three days of losses. Risk assets were
spurred after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in
testimonty to Congress, suggested the U.S. central bank could
provide more stimulus if the economic recovery in the United
States falters.
 Commodities also climbed, and gold had jumped to a record
near $1,590 an ounce.
 Bernanke said the Fed was ready to ease monetary policy
further if the economy weakens and inflation moves lower.
 The Fed ended its most recent asset-purchase program in
June. Traders said another round of easing would flood the
financial system with more money and encourage investors to
reach for higher-yielding currencies and assets.
 The Fed's ""easy money"" policies since 2008 have helped
bolster stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX> has
almost doubled since it touched a decade low in March 2009.

 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro rose
after three days of losses on Wednesday as U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested the central bank could
provide more stimulus if the economic recovery falters.
 Commodities also climbed, with gold jumping to a record
near $1,590 an ounce.
 Investors mostly took a respite from worries about
Europe's debt crisis, although the problems are far from over.
Irish government bond yields hit record highs after Moody's
downgraded the country's credit rating to junk on Tuesday. On
Wednesday, Fitch Ratings downgraded Greece's debt deeper into
junk territory.
 Bernanke said the U.S. central bank was ready to ease
monetary policy further if the economy weakens and inflation
moves lower.
 ""He didn't say that they would exercise the stimulus, but
it is clear that they discussed the issue, and that there are
options to take, if necessary,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief
investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford
Hills, New York.
 The Fed ended its most recent asset-purchase program in
June. Traders said another round of easing would flood the
financial system with more money and encourage investors to
reach for higher-yielding currencies and assets.
 The Fed's ""easy money"" policies since 2008 have helped
bolster stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX> is up
95 percent from its March 2009 closing low.
 Bernanke noted Fed forecasts for June, which were already
revised downward significantly from April, had not
incorporated recent data, particularly last Friday's dismal
June employment report. That showed job growth grinding to a
halt in the last two months. For details, see [ID:nW1E7IB008]
 Bernanke's comments to Congress on the U.S. economy and
monetary policy followed Tuesday's release of minutes of the
Fed's latest meeting, which suggested the possibility of more
stimulus measures. [ID:nN1E76B1XL]
 U.S. stocks rallied more than 1 percent during the
session, but ended well off the day's highs.

15.01 points, or 0.54 percent, to close at 2,796.92.
 Surprisingly strong Chinese growth data, which eased fears
about a hard landing in the world's second-largest economy,
also boosted stocks. [ID:nL3E7ID0AS].
 European shares recovered after the previous session's
losses, while the euro reversed some of its recent weakness
against the dollar.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
rose 0.7 percent to end at 1,099.69. The MSCI world equity
index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.1 percent. [ID:nL3E7ID0AS]

 The euro  was last at $1.41460, up 1.2 percent for
the day and off a four-month low beneath $1.39 hit on Tuesday,
though investors were also keeping a wary eye on the European
sovereign debt crisis.
 ""I'd call this a short-term respite,"" said Firas Askari,
head of FX trading at BMO Capital Markets. ""If we don't hear
anything substantial from Europe by the weekend, people will

 The dollar posted its worst performance against a basket
of currencies in almost a month. In late afternoon trading,
the ICE dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.86 percent to 75.158

 Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating to junk status
on Tuesday, the latest in a series of blows to European
economies struggling to get out from under a huge mountain of
debt. The yield on the 10-year Irish bond rose above 14
percent.
 The rating agency warned that Ireland would probably need
a second bailout. A week ago, Moody's slashed Portugal's
rating to junk status with a similar warning.
 Investors are also beginning to fear that the euro-zone
debt crisis is spreading from the bloc's small economies to
the larger ones.
 These concerns have rattled financial markets because of
the potential impact on banks' profits and liquidity as a
result of exposure to troubled euro-zone debt.
 European leaders, set to convene an emergency meeting on
Friday, have yet to agree on a second Greek bailout.
 U.S. Treasuries prices ended little changed as a solid
10-year note auction and lingering fears over the euro-zone
crisis offset profit-taking that snapped a three-day advance.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
dipped 2/32 in price to 102-1/32 to yield 2.89 percent, up
just slightly from 2.88 percent late on Tuesday.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Stocks, commodities and
the euro rose on Wednesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke suggested the central bank could provide more
stimulus if the economic recovery falters.
 Gold rose to a record near $1,590 an ounce.
 Investors took a respite from worries about Europe's debt
crisis, although those problems are far from over. Irish
government bond yields hit record highs after Moody's
downgraded the country's credit rating to junk late on
Tuesday.
 On Wall Street, U.S. stocks rose more than 1 percent after
Bernanke said the central bank was ready to ease monetary
policy further if the economy weakens and inflation moves
lower.
 Bernanke noted Fed forecasts for June, which were already
revised downward significantly from April, had not incorporated
recent data, particularly last Friday's dismal employment
report. That data showed job growth essentially grinding to a
halt in the last two months, pushing the U.S. unemployment rate
up to 9.2 percent. For details, see [ID:nW1E7IB008]
 Investors have been especially keen to hear his views on
how the economy is holding up, given that the Fed's last
stimulus program ended in June.
 Bernanke's comments to Congress on the U.S. economy and
monetary policy followed Tuesday's release of minutes of the
Fed's latest meeting, which suggested the possibility of more
stimulus measures. [ID:nN1E76B1XL]
 European shares recovered after the previous session's
losses, helped by a better-than-expected reading on China's
second-quarter GDP, while the euro reversed some of its recent
weakness against the dollar.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index<.FTEU3> of top European shares
rose 0.7 percent to end at 1,099.69.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.5
percent to 340.61.
 Optimism about the global economy increased after data
showed China's economy grew more quickly than expected in the
second quarter, easing fears about a hard landing in the
world's second-largest economy.[ID:nL3E7ID0AS]
 The Chinese data was a ""Goldilocks scenario where it's
slowing, but not slowing enough to cause a crash,"" said John
Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 At 1:45 p.m. EDT (1545 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 129.34 points, or 1.04 percent, at
12,576.22. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 14.06
points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,327.70. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was up 34.79 points, or 1.25 percent, at
2,816.70.
 IRISH BOND YIELDS JUMP
 The euro was last at $1.4163 , up 1.3 percent for the
day and off a four-month low beneath $1.39 hit Tuesday, though
investors were also keeping a wary eye on the European
sovereign debt crisis.
 ""I'd call this a short-term respite,"" said Firas Askari,
head of FX trading at BMO Capital Markets. ""If we don't hear
anything substantial from Europe by the weekend, people will be
back to shorting the euro next week.""
 Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating to junk status
late on Tuesday, the latest in a series of blows to European
economies struggling to get out from under a huge mountain of
debt. The yield on the 10-year Irish bond rose above 14
percent.
 The rating agency warned that Ireland would probably need a
second bailout. A week ago, Moody's slashed Portugal's rating
to junk status with a similar warning.
 Investors are also beginning to fear that the euro-zone
debt crisis is spreading from the bloc's small economies to the
larger ones. These concerns have rattled financial markets
because of the potential impact on banks' profits and liquidity
as a result of exposure to troubled euro-zone debt.
 European leaders, set to convene an emergency meeting on
Friday, have yet to agree on a second Greek bailout.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell as investors sold Treasuries
to take profits from a recent safe-haven rally. Some reduction
in anxiety over the extent of the euro zone's debt crisis also
gave investors less of a reason to buy or hold Treasury bonds
in Wednesday's session.
 However, losses were trimmed after a $21 billion 10-year
note sale.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down
6/32, with the yield at 2.8988 percent, from 2.88 percent late
on Tuesday.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against most
major currencies on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said the central bank could resort to more
monetary stimulus if a sluggish U.S. economy weakens further.
 That pushed the euro near $1.42, moving it further from the
prior session's four-month low beneath $1.39 and on track for
its best day since mid-January.
 Surprisingly swift Chinese growth data also helped divert
attention, at least temporarily, from a worsening euro zone
debt crisis after Fitch Ratings said an ambitious Italian
deficit reduction plan would help stabilize its credit rating.
For more, see [ID:nWNA3494] [ID:nL3E7ID0AS]
 ""The comments from Bernanke and Fitch amount to a double
whammy for the dollar and a boost for the euro and riskier
assets. It's all positive for risk,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 In testimony before a House of Representatives committee,
Bernanke said: ""The possibility remains that the recent
economic weakness may prove more persistent than expected and
that deflationary risks might re-emerge, implying a need for
additional policy support."" For details, see [ID:nN1E76C0KZ]
 The Fed ended its most recent asset-purchase program in
June. Traders said another round of easing would flood the
financial system with more money and encourage investors to
reach for higher-yielding currencies and assets.
 Major U.S. stock indexes rose more than 1 percent and gold
hit a record high. The euro was last at $1.4177 , up 1.4
percent, after touching $1.4193 on trading platform EBS. It
also rose 1.8 percent against the yen .
 The high-yielding, commodity-sensitive Australian 
and New Zealand dollars  rose sharply.
 Fitch's remarks eased worries about Italy, which saw its
borrowing costs soar this week for fear a default in Greece
would hurt European banks and strain other countries'
finances.
 Italy is considered especially vulnerable, as it has the
euro zone's second-largest debt-to-output ratio, which would
become harder to finance with higher borrowing costs.
 Still, some analysts said markets remained anxious.
European leaders, set to convene an emergency meeting on
Friday, have yet to agree on a second Greek bailout.
 ""I'd call this a short-term respite,"" said Firas Askari,
head of FX trading at BMO Capital Markets. ""If we don't hear
anything substantial from Europe by the weekend, people will be
back to shorting the euro next week.""
 In the options market, one-month risk reversals were
elevated in favor of euro puts -- options to sell the currency
, with plenty of event risks ahead, including the
results of stress tests on euro zone banks due on Friday.
 Reflecting that unease, the yen soared against the euro and
hit its highest level against the dollar since Japan's March
earthquake as investors unwound risky trades funded with yen.
 The dollar was last at 78.98 yen , up 0.3 percent,
not far from its 78.481 four-month low hit on EBS earlier in
the global session.
 That brought warnings from top Japanese officials worried
that a strengthening yen will hurt Japan's fragile economy,
raising the possibility authorities could intervene to weaken
the currency. [ID:nT9E7HS04S] [ID:nL3E7ID007]
 The dollar fell to a fresh record trough of 0.81939 Swiss
francs  after Bernanke's testimony, and Askari said
markets were also on edge about a pending deadline to lift the
U.S. debt ceiling.
 ""We still have not seen the political will in either Europe
or the United States to resolve the key issues,"" Askari said,
which makes positioning for currency investors difficult.
 ""With currencies, it's hard to be short everything. The
Swiss franc is appreciated, but even Swiss banks won't be
immune from a meltdown in Europe,"" he said.

 * Euro recovers from 4-month low vs dollar on short squeeze
 * Strong China data lift commodity currencies, boost risk
appetite
 * Yen in new range below 79.50 after hitting 4-month high vs
dollar

 By Anirban Nag and Nia Williams	
 LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro bounced on Wednesday,
gaining a reprieve from this week's sell off, while commodity
currencies rose after upbeat Chinese data comforted investors
fretting that the euro zone debt crisis could trigger a global
slowdown.	
 But concerns about the crisis spreading to the region's core
economies like Italy are likely to keep euro gains in check,
with the focus shifting to an emergency summit of European Union
leaders expected on Friday. 
 Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating to junk and warned the
country might need a second bailout, echoing recent downgrades
to junk status for both Greece and Portugal and serving as a
reminder to investors that the euro was vulnerable.

 The single currency was up 0.6 percent at $1.4066 ,
easing slightly from a session high of $1.4111. Traders said it
was helped by steady buying from sovereign investors, a
narrowing of peripheral euro zone debt spreads over German Bunds
and a bout of short covering. 
 The buying helped it recover from a four-month low around
$1.3838 hit on Tuesday. Immediate support is seen around
$1.3907, the 200-day moving average, then the recent trough,
followed by the March low of $1.3740/50.	
 ""We have moved through the panic phase and seen some
stabilisation in Italy which has enabled the euro to make some
gains,"" said Daragh Maher, FX strategist at Credit Agricole.	
 ""But the fact Italy moved into the frame was a game changer
for the euro. We might try to push higher short term but then go
for another test of yesterday's low. We see the euro at $1.3400
by the end of September.""	
 In the options market, one-month risk reversals were
elevated in favour of euro puts -- options to sell the currency.
One-month 25-delta risk reversals were at 3.05
vols with plenty of event risks ahead, including the results of
stress tests on euro zone banks due out on Friday. 
 In Asian trade, the euro got some help after data showed
solid expansion in the Chinese economy and industrial output,
wrong-footing those who had expected a sharper slowdown.	
 Commodity currencies advanced after the Chinese data, with
the Australian dollar gaining 0.7 percent to $1.0673.
The New Zealand dollar rose 1 percent to $0.8256.	
 The euro also rebounded against the Swiss franc ,
rising 0.8 percent to 1.1688 francs, off Tuesday's record low of
1.1555. Against the yen, the euro gained 1.4 percent to 111.59
yen .	
 The yen, which has benefited from safe-haven flows on the
back of the euro's woes, hit a four-month peak against the
dollar and many other currencies in thin early Asian trade. It
gave up those gains as overall risk appetite showed signs of
improving.	
 
 YEN IN NEW RANGE	
 The dollar briefly fell to 78.48 yen as stop-loss orders,
mainly from Japanese retail traders, were triggered in thin
volumes a few hours before Asian trading became active. 
 Just before that, Japanese margin traders' net foreign
currency buying was at a record high, according to data from
major margin trading exchange TFX.	
 The dollar later bounced back to around 79.30 yen , up
0.7 percent on the day, helped by selling from Japanese
investors. 
 Still, the greenback has broken below support around 79.50
yen for the first time since mid-March, when Japanese officials
and other major central banks had to intervene to curb the yen,
which soared in the wake of the massive March 11 earthquake and
subsequent nuclear crisis.	
 ""Intervention is possible given the rhetoric we have had in
the past few days,"" said Simon Derrick head of currency research
at Bank of New York Mellon. 
 ""But it will be a wait-and-watch situation as they (the
Japanese authorities) recognise that in a risk-averse situation
yen-funded carry trades will be unwound. Their intervention will
be more to smoothen the move.""	
 For now though, few traders expect intervention. 
 Firstly, the yen's moves can hardly be described as
volatile, with the currency stuck in a narrow trading band in
the past few months. In addition, Japanese share prices are
holding well above post-quake lows, so Japanese policymakers are
likely to be less alarmed than they were in March. 
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Wednesday
that policymakers were watching forex moves carefully and a rise
in the yen puts downward pressure on the Japanese economy in the
short term.

 Traders say the dollar is now likely to stay below 80 yen,
which is seen as a strong resistance level. Dollar bulls are

semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary policy before
the House Financial Services Committee starting at 1400 GMT. 
 Following last Friday's dismal jobs report, Bernanke could
err on the side of caution, adding more pressure to the dollar.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Gold surged to a record near
$1,590 an ounce on Wednesday as the possibility of more Federal
Reserve stimulus coupled with Europe's deepening debt crisis
fueled bullion's longest winning streak in five years.
 Bullion's gains accelerated after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said the Fed is ready to ease monetary policy
further if economic growth and inflation slow much more. Silver
rallied nearly 6 percent, moving in tandem with commodities,
U.S. stock markets and risk assets.
 Some market watchers expect gold to extend its rally to
above $1,600 an ounce later this year, while bullish option
bets point to bullion as high as $1,700 an ounce by December.
 Fears that the euro zone crisis is spreading to Italy, the
region's third-largest economy, and uncertainty over frantic
talks to raise the U.S. debt limit underpinned precious
metals.
 ""We have fear and contagion risks in Europe, and we are
getting a rally of risk assets on the back of Bernanke alluding
to the Fed trying to stimulate the economy, what people refer
to as QE3,"" said Jeffrey Sherman, commodities portfolio manager
at DoubleLine Capital, with more than $12 billion in assets.
 Spot gold  rose 0.9 percent to $1,578.89 an ounce as
of 3:20 p.m. EDT (1920 GMT). U.S. August futures  settled
up $23.20 at $1,585.50 an ounce, after trading between
$1,564.60 and $1,588.90.
 Spot silver  was last up 5.3 percent at $37.96 an
ounce, its largest one-day gain in more than two months.
 Gold would benefit from additional U.S. monetary easing
because such a move should weaken the dollar and stir
inflation. A worsening sovereign debt crisis in Europe could
also prompt policymakers to mull further stimulus, which would
increase bullion's safe-haven appeal.
 The Fed ended its $600 billion bond-buying program known as
QE2, for quantitative easing, because the addition of money to
the monetary system effectively lowered U.S. interest rates.
Gold is up almost 30 percent since Bernanke's Jackson Hole
speech in August 2010, which marked the start of QE2.
 Further financial and fiscal uncertainty is likely to fuel
fund buying in gold, lifting it above $1,600 before the year
ends, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott, a broker/dealer with $54 billion in assets.
 ""The worst thing for gold would be to have the economy
doing well enough that the Federal Reserve starts to normalize
monetary policy, or conditions in the European Community begin
to settle down,"" Luschini said. ""As we can see, neither is
happening.""
 Gold is set for an eighth consecutive day of gains,
something it has not achieved since mid-October 2006, when it
rose for nine days in a row.
 The metal also rallied to record highs in sterling
, euros  and the South African rand
.
 It has risen around 12 percent so far this year, versus the
S&P stock gauge's 5.5 percent gain, and a loss of 5 percent for
the dollar index <.DXY>.
 OPTIONS VOLATILITY SOARS
 Gold option volatility rose sharply on Wednesday, as
bullion investors bet that underlying future contract prices
could extend a record rally on signs of more Federal Reserve
stimulus coupled with Europe's worsening debt crisis.
 COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan Jossen said one
investor sold a huge position in $1,600 December call options
and then bought twice as much in $1,750 December calls. Heavy
call purchases suggest buyers expect underlying gold futures to
rise further.
 ""Escalating gold prices speak volumes about investors'
fears surrounding the euro zone, and gold's move to unchartered
territory has spurred an increase in volatility,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Soothing data about China's
economy provided some succour to investors on Wednesday although
Europe's debt crisis rolled on with Irish government bond yields
hitting record highs after a downgrade to junk.	
 Wall Street looked set to open higher with focus on
testimony from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.	
 Following minutes of the Fed's latest meeting which
suggested the possibility of more stimulus measures, Bernanke is
likely to be asked why the Fed's current stimulus measures have
not been more effective at bringing down unemployment.

 European shares recovered after the previous session's
losses, helped by a better-than-expected China second-quarter
GDP reading, which also lifted oil and commodity prices, while
the euro reversed some of its recent weakness against the
dollar.	
 Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating to junk status on
Tuesday, the latest in a series of blows to European economies
struggling to get out from under a huge debt mountain. The Irish
10-year bond yield rose above 14 percent.	
 The rating agency warned that Ireland would probably need a
second bailout. A week ago, it slashed Portugal's rating to junk
status with a similar warning.	
 Investors are also beginning to fear that the euro zone debt
crisis is spreading from the bloc's small economies to the
larger ones.	
 The International Monetary Fund called on Tuesday for
""decisive implementation"" by Italy to cut its public debt as the
country sought this week to calm market worries about the
sustainability of its debt burden, which amounts to 120 percent
of GDP.	
 ""The big countries are in this crisis now, it's getting
pretty dangerous,"" one trader said.	
 On the global economic front, however, investors were lifted
by China's GDP data.	
 The country's annual gross domestic product grew 9.5 percent
in the second quarter of 2011, slightly above 9.4 percent
forecast by a Reuters poll, despite a spate of monetary
tightening measures from Beijing. 
 Retail sales in the world's second-biggest economy grew 16.8
percent in the six months ended June year-on-year, showing that
domestic demand still held up relatively well despite policy
tightening, China's statistics bureau said. 
 ""What today's numbers are telling us is that higher rates
are not having a sharply negative impact. We've seen the economy
ratchet down a gear,"" said Adrian Foster, head of Asia Pacific
financial markets research, at Rabobank in Hong Kong. 
 Although investors are concerned about overheating in China,
they are perhaps more edgy at the moment about a hard landing
which would strip growth across the world.	
 
 STOCKS BUOYANT	
 The China data lifted commodities, including oil and
copper , which in turn helped European shares shake off
the debt crisis at least temporarily. The FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent,
snapping a three-session sell off.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI gained half
a percent, with Japan's Nikkei closing up 0.4 percent
and emerging market stocks up 0.9 percent.	
 The euro paused from its selloff but longer-term gains were
seen likely to be checked by concerns about the debt crisis and
a European Union leaders' emergency summit expected on
Friday. 
 The euro was up 0.8 percent at $1.4085 , after hitting
a four-month low around $1.3838 at one point on Tuesday.	
 ""The euro is very much vulnerable to any negative news about
Italy or any peripheral euro zone country,"" said Niels
Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea.	
 Oil prices were slightly higher, with Brent for August
 up a cent at $117.76 a barrel, supported by China's GDP
data and an upbeat report on demand from the International
Energy Agency. 
 Gold rose for an eighth day on concerns about the
euro zone debt crisis, putting it on course for its longest
stretch of gains in nearly five years. It was trading at
$1,570.66 an ounce, less than half a percent off its record
high.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro found some reprieve on
Wednesday from a plunge since the start of the week and
commodity currencies rose after upbeat Chinese data comforted
market players gripped by fears that the euro zone debt crisis
could spiral out of control.
 The euro has managed to stay more than one percent above a
four-month low against the dollar and kept some distance from a
record low against the Swiss franc in Asia, as falls in Italian
and Spanish bond yields after their surge to 14-year highs on
Tuesday have put the brakes on selling of the single currency.
 The Japanese yen, which has benefited from the euro's woes,
hit a four-month peak against the dollar and many other
currencies in thin, early Asian trade, but it then stepped back
from highs in line with an easing in overall risk aversion
trade.
 The U.S. dollar were not helped by the minutes of the
Federal Reserve's last meeting that revealed that some
policymakers believed further easing could be needed if the
recovery remains too sluggish. [ID:nN1E76B18T]
 ""I guess we've already seen selling climax for the moment.
But the market is still a bit shocked, so trade is thin and
volatile,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage.
 ""We still need to keep an eye on Italy and Spain. But in
the very near-term, a lot of bad positions seem to have already
been unwound,"" the trader said.
 The euro stabilised around $1.3990 , after Tuesday's
wild swings that took it to a four-month low around $1.3838
, with the news that Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating
to junk status adding salt to its wounds.
 In Asian trade, the euro got some help after data showed
solid expansion in the Chinese economy and industrial output,
wrong-footing those who had expected a sharper slowdown.
 Immediate support is seen around $1.3907, the 200-day
moving average, then the overnight trough, followed by the
March low of $1.3740/50.
 Still, the euro is poised to remain vulnerable to worries
about the debt crisis with focus shifting to the European Union
leaders' emergency summit expected on Friday after finance
ministers acknowledged for the first time that some form of
Greek default may be needed to cut Athens' debt and stop
contagion spreading to Italy and Spain. [ID:nL6E7IC097]
The European Banking Authority will also publish stress test
results for 91 of the region's top lenders on Friday, keeping
euro bulls in check.
""The euro is going to remain under downward pressure until
we get some clarity,"" said Richard Grace, chief currency
strategist at Commonwealth Bank in Sydney, adding it could fall
to $1.3659 in coming days.
Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the common currency
stood at 1.1640 franc , having plumbed a record low
of 1.1555 on Tuesday.
 YEN IN NEW RANGE
 The dollar briefly plunged to 78.48 yen as stop-loss
orders, mainly from Japanese retail traders, were triggered in
thin volumes a few hours before Asian trading became active.
 Just before that happened, Japanese margin traders' net
foreign currency buying was at a record high, according to data
from major margin trading exchange TFX.
 The dollar later bounced back to around 79.54 yen ,
up 0.4 percent on the day, helped by selling from Japanese
investors.
 Still, the greenback has broken below support around 79.50
yen for the first time since mid-March, when Japanese
officials, along with other central banks, had to intervene to
curb the yen.
 ""It was a pretty sharp spike down and I think the Bank of
Japan will be watching to see what happens next,"" Commonwealth
Bank's Grace said.
 But for now few Tokyo traders see imminent intervention for
several reasons. For one, the currency's moves can hardly be
described as volatile even counting on its rise this week,
having stuck to a narrow trading band in the past few months.
 Yen selling could lift the cost of rebuilding after the
earthquake as Japan has been running a rare trade deficit as it
needs to import more raw materials while its exports plunge,
traders also said.
 In addition, Japanese share prices are holding out well
above its post-quake low, thus Japanese policy makers are
likely to be less alarmed than they were in March. For latest
Reuters FX analyst column, click on [nL3E7ID0RT]
 Traders say the dollar is now likely to stay below 80 yen,
which is seen as strong resistance.
 Commodity currencies advanced after the Chinese data, with
the Australian dollar  gaining 0.3 percent to $1.0630.
Commodity currencies have seen much milder moves than the euro,
even though they were not completely spared the overnight
drama, in which investors dumped risky assets.
 The U.S. dollar has problems of its own, not least the
political impasse on lifting the government's debt ceiling,
which could result in default if not resolved -- an issue that
has escaped the level of market scrutiny on euro zone debt.
 ""Right now the market is looking at a fire that is flaring
up nearby rather than at smoke in the distance,"" said Sumino
Kamei, senior currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ.
 Some players think the market's focus could shift later
this month ahead of Aug. 2, when the U.S. will hit the debt
ceiling and run out of funding options unless congress agrees
to raise the ceiling.
 Dollar bulls are also wary ahead of Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke's semi-annual testimony on the economy and monetary
policy before the House Financial Services Committee starting
at 1400 GMT.
 Following last Friday's dismal jobs report, Bernanke could
err on the side of caution, adding more pressure to the
dollar.

 SINGAPORE, July 13 (Reuters) - Asian equities, metals and
commodity currencies rallied on Wednesday as investors piled
into risky assets after China's economic growth data reassured
markets that the world's second-largest economy was maintaining
its growth momentum.	
 The euro found some reprieve from a plunge since the start
of the week and Australian dollar gained 0.3 percent to
$1.0630 as the data comforted market participants fretting that
the euro zone debt crisis could spiral out of control.	
 European stock markets opened weaker with the FTSEurofirst
300 index of top European shares down 0.3 percent, its
fourth straight day of falls. 
 China's annual gross domestic product grew 9.5 percent in
the second quarter of 2011, above 9.4 percent forecast by a
Reuters poll, as a spate of monetary tightening measures from
Beijing begins to take effect.	
 Retail sales in China grew 16.8 percent in the six months
ended June, showing that domestic demand still held up
relatively well despite policy tightening, China's statistics
bureau said.	
 ""What today's numbers are telling us is that higher rates
are not having a sharply negative impact. We've seen the economy
ratchet down a gear,"" said Adrian Foster, head of Asia Pacific
financial markets research, at Rabobank in Hong Kong.	
 China's GDP has grown expanded at an average annual pace of
10 percent in the past three decades and has in recent times
underpinned a fragile U.S. economy as Europe struggled with debt
problems. 
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 1.1 percent by 0610 GMT, with stock markets
in Australia, and South Korea up 0.4 percent and
0.9 percent respectively. The Nikkei advanced 0.4
percent.	
 
 
 EURO RECOVERS	
 The euro stabilised around $1.3990 , after Tuesday's
wild swings that took it to a four-month low around $1.3838
, with the news that Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating
to junk status adding salt to its wounds.	
 The currency has managed to stay more than 1 percent above a
four-month low against the dollar and kept some distance against
the Swiss franc in Asia, as falls in Italian and Spanish bond
yields after their surge to 14-year highs on Tuesday have put

 Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the common currency

1.1555 on Tuesday.	
 European Union leaders appear set to hold an emergency
summit on Friday after finance ministers acknowledged for the
first time that some form of Greek default may be needed to cut
Athens' debts and stop contagion spreading to Italy and Spain.

 ""We think the worst fears will not be realized in Europe.
This is an ongoing grind rather than an implosion."" said
Rabobank's Foster.	
 Some dollar bulls are also wary ahead of Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony on the economy and
monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee
starting at 1400 GMT.	
 
 HONG KONG OUTPERFORMS	
 Hong Kong stocks advanced 1.0 percent, supported by a
4.5 percent rise in Agricultural Bank of China's on
strong earnings forecast. Risky assets have taken a beating this
week on growing worries that Greece's debt crisis could lead to
more countries requiring financial aid.	
 The Hong Kong benchmark is coming off its worst two-day
decline in 17 months on the back of a sluggish banking sector, a
worsening euro zone debt crisis and a Moody's report that
re-ignited fears about Chinese corporate governance.

 Copper on the London Metal Exchange extended early
gains after the Chinese data, and was up 0.5 percent at $9,698 a
tonne.	
 Spot gold was steady at $1,565 per ounce, while Brent
for August  fell 40 cents to $117.35 a barrel.

(Updates to U.S. markets close)
 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro and stocks fell for
a third day on Tuesday as moves by officials to stem the
European debt crisis failed to allay concerns that the risk was
spreading to Italy and Spain.
 Gold rallied to near its all-time high and U.S. bond prices
rose as worries about contagion pushed investors into
safe-haven assets.
 ""Caution is clearly warranted given all the possible
outcomes of these events,"" said Gibson Smith, co-chief
executive officer of fixed income at Janus Capital Group in
Denver.
 Investors have been worried about the potential effect on
the global economy, especially as the U.S. recovery has
struggled to pick up speed.
 In a bid to keep Italy and Spain from the same fate as
Portugal and Ireland, euro zone finance ministers on Monday
promised cheaper loans, longer maturities and a more flexible
rescue fund. For details see [ID:nL6E7IB1PQ].
 But they set no deadline and Dutch Finance Minister Jan
Kees de Jager said a selective default for Greece was no longer
being excluded. [ID:nB5E7I401K]
 Fears about Italy have accelerated concerns over the impact
of the debt crisis because the country is the euro zone's
third-largest economy.
 Adding to pressure on the euro, late in the U.S. session,
Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating to junk status.
[ID:nN1E76B1IE]
 ""The market has woke up to the fact that there's a much
larger problem (than Greece). That's what precipitated the
large fall (in the euro),"" said Adam Myers, senior FX
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. ""I very much doubt the
European Central Bank, let alone the IMF, can bail out a
country the size of Italy.""
 On Wall Street, stocks ended lower after a volatile
session, as the fiscal problems in Europe and a weak start to
technology earnings kept investors from buying.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 58.88 points,
or 0.47 percent, to end at 12,446.88. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> was down 5.85 points, or 0.44 percent, at
1,313.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 20.71 points,
or 0.74 percent, at 2,781.91.
 Earlier, European stocks hit a four-month low and closed
down for a third straight day. Shares also tumbled overnight in
Asia on fears about the European debt crisis.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed down 0.54
percent at 1,091.72, off its session lows.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.8
percent.
 The euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar in
four months and hit another record low against the Swiss
franc.
 Ireland's rating cut gave investors more evidence to
suggest the euro zone problems are far from over. The ratings
agency said the country will likely need additional rounds of
financing before it can return to capital markets.

 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest
level against the dollar in four months on Tuesday as moves by
officials to stem the European debt crisis failed to allay
concerns that the risk was spreading to Italy and Spain.
 Euro-priced gold hit a record high as investors spooked by
fears of contagion sought safety. Investors are worried about
the potential effect on the global economy, especially as the
U.S. recovery has struggled to pick up speed.
 In a bid to keep Italy and Spain from the same fate as
Greece, Portugal and Ireland, euro zone finance ministers
promised Monday cheaper loans, longer maturities and a more
flexible rescue fund. For details see [ID:nL6E7IB1PQ].
 But they set no deadline and Dutch Finance Minister Jan
Kees de Jager said a selective default for Greece was no longer
being excluded. [ID:nB5E7I401K]
 ""The situation in Europe continues to deteriorate and
uncertainties within the sovereign credit space remain high,""
said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT
Capital in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Fears over Italy have accelerated concerns over the impact
of the debt crisis because the country is the euro zone's
third-largest economy.
 In equities markets, European stocks hit a four-month low
and closed down for a third straight day. Earlier, shares
tumbled overnight in Asia on fears over the European debt
crisis.
 But on Wall Street, stocks were higher after posting their
worst day in a month, gaining ground after the release of
minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting.
 Helping support markets, traders cited rumors that the
European Central Bank was buying peripheral bonds for the first
time in three months, with Portugal the suspected target.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed down 0.54
percent at 1,091.72, off its session lows.
 In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei stock index <.N225> closed
off 1.4 percent, its biggest fall in a month, and Hong Kong
shares <.HSI> posted their biggest daily fall in 14 months.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 53.55 points, or 0.43 percent, at 12,559.31. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 6.26 points, or 0.47 percent, at
1,325.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 2.56

 Even though the minutes offered no surprises on the Fed's
interest rate outlook, it showed some officials felt more

to reduce unemployment. [ID:nW1E7IB006]
 In European equities, Italian banks rose sharply, a rally
mainly seen by traders as short covering following steep losses
in the past few days.
 ""We are reaching nuclear-war-like valuation levels on
financials. It's not absurd given the indecision of political
leaders, nevertheless, a number of investors are trying to
catch the falling knife,"" Thomas Kleb, head of equity sales at
Societe Generale CIB, said.
 In the foreign exchange market, the euro  was down
for a third day against the dollar. It was last trading at
$1.4002, down about 0.2 percent on the day, and fell as low as
$1.3835. It also fell to a record low against the safe-haven
Swiss franc .
 ""The power of the market to force the problems associated
with contagion to the surface are clear today,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 U.S. Treasuries prices edged up after solid bidding at a
three-year note sale countered concerns over Washington's
stalemate in talks to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
2/32, its yield at 2.92 percent.
 Oil prices were higher. U.S. crude futures  were up
$2.13 at $97.28 a barrel, ahead of weekly inventory data with
forecasts that domestic crude stocks fell last week. Brent
crude erased early losses to trade higher. Brent crude was last
up 25 cents at $117.49 .
 Euro-priced gold rose to a second consecutive record on
Tuesday, driven by investors who found little comfort in
pledges by European Union officials to contain the spread of
the debt crisis across the single-currency bloc.
 Spot gold  traded just above $1,570 an ounce, having
risen in each of the last six trading sessions, while gold in
euros  was up 0.3 percent, set for a third daily
rise, at 1,109.60 euros, having hit a record 1,118.58 earlier.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro slid to its lowest
level against the dollar in four months and hit another record
low against the Swiss franc on Tuesday on fears that leaders in
the euro zone are failing to stop a debt crisis from
spreading.
 Borrowing costs for Italy and Spain soared to 14-year highs
earlier in the session as euro zone leaders conceded for the
first time that Greece may have to default on some of its debt.
See [ID:nL6E7IC097]
 Italian 10-year bond yields later fell below 6 percent on
market talk the European Central Bank was buying Italian and
Spanish bonds. [ID:nL6E7IC260]
 Investors fear a Greece default could ripple through
Europe's banking system, putting pressure on stretched public
finances in other euro zone countries. Italy, the euro zone's
third largest economy, looks especially vulnerable: its
debt-to-output ratio is second only to Greece, and markets fear
political bickering may derail a plan to slash spending and
rein in the deficit.
 ""The power of the market to force the problems associated
with contagion to the surface are clear today,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3835 , a four-month low,
though data showing a wider U.S. trade deficit and talk that
the ECB was buying euro zone debt sparked a short-squeeze that
helped lift it to $1.4004, down 0.2 percent from late Monday.
 Plans for an emergency summit of policymakers on Friday to
discuss the debt crisis also helped the euro recoup some of its
losses, traders said.
 Sutton said fears over Spain and Italy are understandable
but not totally justified.
 While Spain has a fiscal balance problem, it does not have
a debt problem, with a relatively small gross debt position of
64 percent of GDP. Italy, on the other hand, has a debt problem
with a concerning gross debt of 120 percent of GDP, she said.
 ""The more important complications for Spain and Italy are
their ability to grow in the current environment, exposure to
the periphery and political tensions.""

 The euro fell to a record low against the Swiss franc for a
second straight day , and last traded at 1.1672,
down 0.5 percent on the day. The franc is seen as a traditional
safe haven in times of trouble.
 YEN GAINS, US DEBT DEBATE IN BACKGROUND
 The yen, also considered a shelter from the storm, rose
broadly, The dollar fell 0.9 percent to 79.52 yen, near its
lowest since March. The euro shed 1.1 percent to 111.34 yen.
 Sentiment toward the euro could change if the EU adopts
what Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup,
termed ""the big bazooka approach"" -- a blanket guarantee on
peripheral countries' debt, aggressive ECB buying of euro zone
debt or a plan to create a common euro zone bond.
 ""It is likely that if one of these 'big' solutions is
adopted, we would see the euro rally initially and perhaps
sharply,"" he said. But ""the question would be whether such
proposals would be credible if Italy and Spain were under
sustained pressure, since the potential sums would be extremely
large and political opposition in the core far from trivial.""
 If the EU can calm markets, analysts said the focus could
shift to the dollar and the U.S. debt ceiling. The U.S.
Treasury Department has warned it may have to default on some
debt if lawmakers don't agree to lift the legal U.S. borrowing
limit by Aug. 2.

 U.S. government bond prices initially rose on the euro zone
concerns, but turned slightly lower as bond dealers made room
for $32 billion worth of three-year debt to be auctioned
later.

 * Jump in Italy, Spain yields prompts exodus from risky FX

 By Anirban Nag and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Tuesday as euro zone government bond
yields jumped on deepening concerns that the region's debt
crisis would spread, prompting investors to dump the single
currency for safer ones.	
 The euro plunged 1 percent on the day to 1.1555 francs on
electronic platform EBS. Against the dollar, it hit a four-month
trough of $1.3837, with investors in the options market pricing
in more downside risks for the common currency in coming days.	
 Mounting worries about the euro zone's ability to stem
contagion risk drove hedge funds and other investors to the
relative safety of the dollar, franc and yen, while
high-yielding currencies including the Australian and
New Zealand dollars took a hit.	
 Confidence is fast dwindling in the European Union's ability
to prevent debt problems in Greece, Ireland and Portugal from
spreading to Spain and Italy, where bond yields have surged in
recent sessions.	
 ""Italy has moved very, very quickly to catch up with Spanish
yields, and the market has woken up to the fact that there's a
much larger problem. That's what precipitated the large fall (in
the euro),"" said Adam Myers, senior FX strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB.	
 He said concerns about whether Italy can undertake budget
reforms had changed the market's previous perception that Rome
was sheltered from the debt crisis.	
 Many in the market said the selloff in the euro seen this
week marks a turning point in the currency market, where
investors have finally acknowledged that stronger countries are
not immune to the region's fiscal problems.	
 ""I very much doubt the ECB, let alone the IMF, can bail out
a country the size of Italy,"" Myers said.	
 Analysts said the euro would continue to take a beating as
yields rise in the wake of an emergency meeting by European
financial officials on Monday, which failed to agree fresh
action to tackle the region's debt problems. 
 A euro zone diplomat said on Tuesday that EU leaders would
hold an additional summit on Friday the discuss the debt crisis.	
 The euro was hammered lower after a jump in benchmark
10-year Spanish and Italian bond yields expanded their spreads
against safe-haven German debt to their widest since the
mid-1990s. . As borrowing costs rise, the repayment of
debt becomes more costly to maintain and could lead to an
economic slowdown and more losses for banks.	
 The euro was last trading at $1.3911, pulling away
from lows on Asian sovereign demand and supported by results
from an Italian bond auction where Rome was able to sell
one-year paper, albeit at much higher yields. 
 The euro clawed back above $1.3906, its 200-day moving
average which was seen as a key support level. Having broken
below that level in earlier trade, a daily close below would
signal more losses. Traders cited option expiries at $1.3900.	
 
 EURO VOLATILITIES JUMP	
 The euro has already shed more than 4 percent against the
dollar this month, and market participants in London said there
was a sense of panic on the trading floor.	
 The latest selloff has contributed to a spike higher in
market volatility, pushing one-month euro/dollar implied vol to
around 15 percent , its highest since November 2010.	
 The premium on euro puts -- the option to sell the currency
-- also jumped, with one-month 25-delta risk reversals
hitting 3.3 vols in favour of puts, the highest
in roughly a year.	
 Analysts said appetite for downside strikes in euro/dollar
was intensifying.	
 ""Option investors were already holding puts given
risk-reversal levels, and very quickly everyone can be long vol
and short spot,"" said Olivier Korber, strategist at Societe
Generale. ""For vols to go higher, we need new sellers, and they
are less and less present.""	
 The selloff in risky currencies boosted the dollar by almost
1 percent versus a currency basket to 76.719, its highest
in four months. It eased to 76.386 later in the session.	
 The franc and the yen also rallied, with the Swiss currency
hovering around historic highs against sterling, while broad yen
strength pushed the dollar down roughly 1 percent on the day to
79.17 yen , its weakest since mid-March. It was last
trading at 79.64 yen, still down 0.7 percent on the day.	
 The Australian dollar fell 1 percent versus its U.S.
counterpart, while the New Zealand currency fell 2 percent.
Closely linked to commodity prices and seen as a barometer of
risk demand, these currencies reversed gains made in previous
sessions.

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Investors dumped the euro,
peripheral euro zone government debt and European shares on
Tuesday as officials struggled to contain fears that the euro
zone debt crisis was spreading to Italy and Spain.	
 In a bid to keep Italy and Spain from the same fate as
Greece, Portugal and Ireland, euro zone finance ministers
promised on Monday cheaper loans, longer maturities and a more
flexible rescue fund. 
 But markets came under pressure as they set no deadline, and
Dutch Finance Minister said a selective default for Greece was
no longer being excluded. 
 ""Italy and Spain have been thrown into the mix, and they are
far bigger in magnitude than Greece, Ireland and Portugal. This
could be a true systemic crisis,"" said Andrew Lim, analyst at
Espirito Santo in London.	
 There was some respite for Italian assets after speculation
swirled that the European central bank was buying Italian and
Spanish paper, even though traders who usually see those
transactions said they had seen no evidence of such trades. 
 
 The costs of insuring against a default by the euro zone's
peripheral issuers hit record highs, and Italian and Spanish
bond yields spiked higher. 
 Italian 10-year government bond yields broke
above 6 percent for the first time since 1997. Traders said a
move towards 7 percent could be a tipping point for bond yields,
making the cost of refinancing unsustainable.	
 Italy's short-term borrowing costs jumped in the first test
of appetite for its paper since the recent surge in investor
nerves. 
 ""Italy is by far the country with the greatest sensitivity
to rising debt servicing costs and particularly in terms of
rolling over debt,"" said Mark Ostwald, strategist at Monument
Securities.	
 ""This is not a situation which it can afford to have going
on for any sustained period of time.""	
 The euro hit four-month lows of $1.3837 and fell to a
record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc .	
 ""Italy has moved very, very quickly to catch up with Spanish
yields, and the market has woken up to the fact that there's a
much larger problem. That's what precipitated the large fall (in
the euro),"" said Adam Myers, senior FX strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB	
 European shares also came under pressure, with bank stocks
slumping more than 3 percent to two-year lows.	
 Brent crude oil futures fell 2 dollars on fears about
slowing energy demand.  World stocks and U.S. equity
futures were down about 1 percent heading into U.S. trade.

 SINGAPORE, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro declined to a
four-month low on Tuesday after new IMF Managing Director
Christine Lagarde said the fund was not yet ready to discuss
terms of a second Greek bailout, while equity markets tumbled on
concerns more countries will be engulfed by the euro zone's debt
problems.	
 European stock index futures pointed to a sharp decline in
equities, extending the previous session's steep sell-off. By
0605 GMT, futures for Euro STOXX 50 , for DAX 
and for France's CAC  were 1.1 to 1.3 percent lower.	
 Growing worries about Europe stoked investors' flight from
riskier assets into bonds, extending a rally in U.S. Treasuries
and sending Japanese government bond prices to a two-week high.	
 In a bid to keep Italy and Spain from the same fate as
Greece, Portugal and Ireland, euro zone finance ministers
promised on Monday cheaper loans, longer maturities and a more
flexible rescue fund. They said new measures would be announced
""shortly"", but set no deadline. 
 ""Even if they agree on a multi-billion dollar package for
Greece and other affected peripheral countries, if we don't see
a continuation of implementation of the austerity cuts, all bets
are off,"" said Thomas Lam, group chief economist at OSK-DMG in
Singapore.	
 The euro fell as low as $1.3932 -- its lowest since
March 17 -- after a slew of stop-loss orders were triggered
below $1.3980. The single currency fell broadly, dropping to an
all-time low of 1.1660 Swiss franc .	
 The euro extended its early losses against the dollar in
Asia and was down 0.6 percent by 0605 GMT after Lagarde said the
IMF and its European partners were not yet ready to discuss
conditions or terms of a second bailout package for Greece. She
said the contagion currently hitting Italy was tied to
market-driven forces. 
 ""The market was to a certain extent expecting the problems
in Greece to spread to Spain, but this drastic move in Italian
bonds was very surprising,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief forex
strategist at Citibank in Tokyo.	
 The spread on the 10-year Italian bond yield
over that of German bonds widened to above 300
basis points the previous day from about 180 bps at the start of
the month.	
 Billionaire investor George Soros said in a Financial Times
editorial that Greece is heading for a disorderly debt default
or at least a devaluation, and repeated his call for European
Union leaders to adopt a ""plan B"" to stem contagion to the rest
of the bloc. 
 
 
 EQUITIES TAKE A BEATING	
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 2.2 percent, while the Nikkei shed
1.4 percent. Stock markets in Australia lost 1.8
percent, South Korea declined 2.2 percent and Hong Kong
gave up 1.9 percent.	
 The broader Asia index has snapped three straight weeks of
gains on investor expectations that the second half held better
prospects for risky assets than the first.	
 The outlook for Asian markets appears weak.	
 ""Every time we seem to be getting momentum, the European
debt issue seems to rear its ugly head, and we are at the mercy
of that,"" said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie
Equities.	
 Spot gold held steady at $1,549 per ounce as
investors fled riskier assets to buy bullion. Gold priced in
sterling and euro both hit record highs on Tuesday, buoyed by
worries about an escalating euro zone debt crisis.	
 Sterling-priced gold rose to an all-time high of
980.33 pounds an ounce, and euro-denominated gold hit
a record of 1,114.29 euros per ounce. 
 Brent futures for August  lost 0.6 percent to $116.5
a barrel.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro was beaten down
further in Asia on Tuesday, plunging to a record low versus the
Swiss franc and sinking to a four-month trough against the
dollar on growing concerns that the euro zone's sovereign debt
crisis was spreading.	
 The single currency fell as low as $1.3932 -- its
lowest since March 17 -- after a slew of stop-loss orders were
triggered below $1.3980. The euro fell broadly, dropping to an
all-time low of 1.1660 Swiss franc .	
 The euro was on the defensive as an emergency meeting by
European financial officials failed to offer fresh measures to
tackle the region's debt problems, dealers said.	
 Market participants were especially concerned about the debt
of countries such as Spain and Italy, which came under strong
selling pressure the day before.	
 ""The market has become particularly concerned due to the
sell-off in Italian bonds. A steep widening of the spread
between Italian and German bonds is making the market worried,""
said Osamu Takashima, chief forex strategist at Citibank in
Tokyo.	
 ""The market was to a certain extent expecting the problems
in Greece to spread to Spain, but this drastic move in Italian
bonds was very surprising.""	
 The spread on the 10-year Italian bond yield over that of
German bonds widened to above 300
basis points the previous day from about 180 bps at the start of
the month.	
 The euro was bought back against the Swiss
franc by late Asian trade, trading down 0.1 percent at
1.1 716 franc
. 
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.6 percent at
111.86 after falling as far as 111.67 -- the lowest
since March 18. 
 Against the dollar, the single currency dropped 0.5 percent
to $1.3959 .	
 Support is seen around $1.3905/10, a 50 percent retracement
of the January-May rally as well as the 200-day moving average.	
 Global macro funds were detected selling the euro actively
in Asia, traders said.	
 Some traders said the euro came under pressure as IMF
Managing Director Christine Lagarde failed to comment
specifically on resolving Greece's problems. 
 Lagarde said the IMF and its European partners are not
yet ready to discuss terms of a second Greek bailout, urging
Athens to do more to deal with its debt crisis. 
 In her first roundtable with Washington-based news
agencies since taking the helm of the IMF a week ago, Lagarde
said Greece had taken important steps to cut its budget deficit
but that they were not enough. 
 Weakness in the euro helped push the dollar up
against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index
climbed as high as 76.370 -- its highest since April 1. 
 The dollar index was up 0.4 percent at 76.269. 
 ""I feel that the euro zone debt situation particularly
deteriorated after Portugal was downgraded to junk status last
week. The market again started to focus on the debt problem as
being a problem for the whole region,"" said Kimihiko Tomita,
head of foreign exchange at State Street and Trust.	
 ""The fact that the euro broke decisively below $1.4 is
significant. The most recent selling appears to be a bit too
rapid, but the market could test the euro further in the short
term given current sentiment,"" Tomita said.	
 In a bid to stop financial contagion engulfing Italy and
Spain, officials promised to provide cheaper loans, longer
maturities and a more flexible rescue fund to help Greece and
other EU debtors. 
 They declined to rule out the possibility of a selective
default by Greece, a move officials said bolstered Germany's
push to involve investors in easing Greece's debt despite the
concerns of the European Central Bank. 
 European Union finance ministers meet later on Tuesday and
are under the cosh to soothe market nerves ahead of Thursday's
Italian bond auctions. Italy is aiming to raise 7.75 billion
euros in the debt market, according to estimates from Barclays
Capital. 
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 80.15 yen , pressured
mainly by the yen's firmness against the euro, but the U.S.
currency met solid bids slightly above 80 yen.	
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy on hold and gave a
brighter assessment of the economy on Tuesday, encouraged by a
rebound in factory output and increasing signs that the recovery
from the devastating March earthquake is broadening.

 Still, the market showed a muted reaction to the central
bank's assessment towards the Japanese economy.
