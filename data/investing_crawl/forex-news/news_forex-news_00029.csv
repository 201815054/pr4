 NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The dollar reversed earlier
declines to rally against the euro and yen on Thursday amid
rising bond yields after a report unexpectedly showed factory
activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region rose in December.
 U.S. Treasury prices posted fresh session lows after the
report suggested an acceleration in economic growth and the
yield on the benchmark 10-year note touched a session high of
3.56 percent, up from 3.52 percent on Wednesday.
 ""The data turned Treasuries around and as U.S. rates backed
up the dollar went with them,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3196 after sliding more
than 1 percent on Wednesday.
 The dollar had gained earlier this week as benchmark
10-year Treasury yields hit seven-month highs, pushing the
dollar to a three-month peak against the yen at 84.51 yen on
Wednesday. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen at
84.36 yen on Thursday.
 Yields stayed near those seven-month highs on Thursday
after the European Central Bank said it will double its
subscribed capital due to increased market volatility and
credit risk.
 Yet investors cautioned that higher bond yields may work
against the dollar in the longer term.
 ""Who wants to own a Treasury as yields rise?"" said Chuck
Butler, president of EverBank World Markets in St. Louis. ""It's
a short-term blip for the dollar.""
 While a further rise in U.S. bond yields was seen helping
the dollar for now, some market players noted a breakdown in
the dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields and with
U.S.-Japan yield spreads.
 ""It's too early to say with conviction, but it could be due
to an emergence of bearish factors, such as the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 EU SUMMIT
 The euro had been up on Thursday as a European Union summit
to discuss the debt crisis got underway, but investors had
already cautioned the currency was vulnerable to a sell-off on
lingering euro zone peripheral debt concerns.
 European leaders sought to paper over deep divisions on how
best to resolve the debt crisis ahead of their summit, but
Spain and Portugal came under renewed pressure to get their
finances in order.
 Euro zone policymakers are discussing ideas to fall back on
if moves to create a permanent European Stability Mechanism for
solving debt crises fail to calm markets.
 While the summit statement is expected on Friday, investors
are looking for any comments that may be made separately by
those attending the meeting.
 ""They are showing no signs of breaking the impasse,"" said
Forex.com's Dolan. ""Germany is resisting the expansion of the
bailout facility and pushing it on the ECB, and as long as that
happens, the final long-term debt default resolution mechanism
is not in sight.""
 Traders said liquidity was showing signs of drying up as
the year end was approaching and this was likely to increase
the potential for sharp moves.
 The euro hit the day's highs after results from an auction
of Spanish 10- and 15-year bonds on Thursday, a day after
ratings agency Moody's said it could downgrade Spain's ratings.
The auction resulted in higher yields, but solid bid-to-cover
ratios.
 ""Spain is not in a situation where it would have trouble
servicing its debt, so the auction saw enough demand,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, senior currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 But others added the higher yields indicated continued
wariness about euro zone debt.
 Government debt yields for Spain, Portugal and Italy rose
after the Spanish bond auction, highlighting those
concerns.

 NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Yields on debt of smaller euro
zone countries jumped and global stock markets fell on Thursday
after Spain paid high premiums in its bond auction and European
leaders signaled markets may not have seen the last of the euro
zone debt woes.
 The U.S. dollar was little changed against the euro, but
was supported by data including a fall in weekly claims for
jobless aid and a rise factory activity in the country's
Mid-Altantic region which pointed to an economic recovery that
is gaining traction.
 Yields on U.S. Treasuries steadied after a three-day spike
but held near seven-month highs on lingering expectations of
inflation, higher growth and a wider fiscal deficit. The
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury  traded down 4/32,
yielding 3.5517 percent.
 The volatility in debt markets spilled over to global
equity markets. The MSCI's all-country world stock index
<.MIWD00000PUS> dropped 0.46 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of leading European shares eeked out marginal
gains of 0.04 percent.
 European Union leaders met on Thursday for a two-day summit
in Brussels to address credit risks of the region and sign off
on a permanent fund to stabilize struggling countries.
 Spain was forced to pay a hefty premium at its final bond
auction of the year on Thursday, in a key test of investor
appetite for euro zone peripheral debt a day after Moody's said
it may cut the country's rating.
 The Spanish Treasury raised 2.4 billion euros ($3.20
billion), within the targeted range of 2-3 billion euros but
disappointing some analyst who expected more debt to be sold.
 ""The big picture isn't that bad for stocks, but the problem
is fears over euro zone debt issues are like a sword of
Damocles,"" said Christian Jimenez, fund manager and president
of Diamant Bleu Gestion, in Paris.
 ""Valuation ratios are attractive, yet we haven't seen
inflows in equities. Big institutional investors are still on
the sidelines, for regulation reasons but also because they are
wary of potential new spikes in the debt crisis.""
 Despite optimistic indicators from the U.S. economic data,
including a slight uptick in November housing starts and weekly
jobless claims in line with expectations, U.S. benchmark
indexes were mixed.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> tumbled 19.98
points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,437.49. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 0.08 points, or 0.01 percent, to
1,235.15, while the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 4.52
points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,621.74.
 Euro  fell to session lows versus dollar, trading at
$1.3192, down 0.14 percent. the dollar <.DXY> rose against a
basket of major trading-partner currencies, up 0.08 percent to
80.322. Against the Japanese yen , the dollar gained 0.14
percent to 84.37 yen.
 Oil and gold slipped as the dollar strengthened, with U.S.
crude oil  down 0.73 percent to $87.97 per barrel and
spot gold prices  shedding 1.11 percent to $1364.00.

 * Market to grapple with e-trade, regulation in 2011
 * Small banks seen retrenching due to high investment costs
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The battle among top banks for
dominance of the $4 trillion a day FX market will be decided by
their ability not only to offer rapid-fire pricing and razor-
thin spreads, but also to adapt to tighter trading rules.
 In interviews with Reuters, big FX banks said players with
deeper pockets would continue to maintain and develop technology
for their electronic trading platforms in 2011, while smaller
ones would struggle to keep pace with such massive investment.
 Consequently, smaller players may lose some market share
gained through aggressive expansion in 2007-10, when the share
of the top five banks slipped to 55 percent from 61 percent.
 ""Those institutions which have tried to go from being niche
players to top five players will probably see that their
investments are not paying off to the extent that they thought
they were,"" said Jeff Feig, global head of G10 foreign exchange
at Citi.
 Canadian bank BMO, which raised its market share in the past
year, acknowledged it could not compete with the bigger banks on
investment.
""Major FX banks are investing heavily and reinvigorating
their teams to try and capture more volume market share and we
won't be trying to compete with that,"" said Firas Askari,
Managing Director and head of FX trading for Canada and London
at BMO Capital Markets.
 Instead it would instead concentrate on becoming a niche
provider of Canadian dollar liquidity.
 A Bank for International Settlements survey this week showed
daily average trading volumes at the top banks have soared by up
to 200 percent since 2007, suggesting major players are taking a
bigger piece of the FX pie while smaller banks are pushed aside.
 
 GROWTH IN ETRADE
 Overall growth in the industry has been driven by electronic
trading, whose volume has climbed since 2006 to comprise roughly
50 percent of the FX market this year, according to Greenwich
Associates consultancy, which contributed to the BIS survey.
 Citi, ranked the No. 4 FX bank by market share in
Euromoney's benchmark industry survey, said a rise in the
electronic trading of swaps and growing interest in emerging
markets boosted its FX business in 2010.
 Deutsche and Barclays Capital, ranked by Euromoney as No. 1
and No. 3 respectively, both said electronic trading in options
grew significantly after they launched fully automated trading
services for such products this year.
 The race to offer the most sophisticated products and the
narrowest spreads via electronic platforms will remain intense
as growing awareness of FX as a profitable asset class helps to
drive volumes higher next year.
 Industry analysts say higher volumes and volatility will make
better risk management and transparency more important. Tighter
trading rules, including new regulation on derivatives in the
U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, will address this in 2011.
 ""Banks which can show their clients they can comply with the
regulatory environment will be rewarded. It's not just about who
has the quickest prices and the best spreads,"" said David Poole,
chief operating officer at market researcher Client Knowledge.
 ""It's about who has the best process too.""
 One of the main areas where improving systems will be most
vital is algorithmic trading -- high-volume, automated trades
designed to capitalise on the tiniest of market movements.
 ""Algo"" trades accounted for 45 percent of transactions on
electronic platform EBS in 2010, jumping from 28 percent three
years ago, and some banks are seen struggling to keep investing
the vast sums required to cope with growing demand for them.
 But Client Knowledge's Poole said their growing popularity
meant success in the market would increasingly depend on how
well players could handle high-frequency trades.
""Rather than being a niche activity by a few top banks and
investors, it will be something that everyone will have to have
the infrastructure to be able to deal with to act effectively in
the market,"" he said.

 By Nicolas Misculin
 LUJAN, Argentina, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Soy and corn crops in Argentina's
Pampas are starting to suffer from the effects of La Nina, and farmers say
rains are badly needed before the end of the year to safeguard yields.
 Rainfall has been below average for weeks in the farming heartland as a
result of the weather anomaly, and many agricultural analysts expect
production to fall in the South American country, a leading exporter of soy
and corn.
 ""The situation is worrying, but it isn't desperate,"" said Javier
Dominguez, who farms in Lujan district 70 km (43 miles) west of the capital
Buenos Aires.
 Global grains markets are keeping a close eye on the weather in
Argentina as corn crops near the flowering stage when final yields start to
be determined and when insufficient rainfall can do the most damage.
 In Lujan, most soy and corn plants are still in good shape, although
some are stunted and late-seeded soy has yet to germinate due to the lack
of soil moisture.
 ""What farmers are worried about is the rains we get until the end of
the month, so soy can develop enough to be able to defend itself from the
dryness in January,"" Dominguez said.
 ""Some crops are going to be okay, but others are going to be very
vulnerable,"" he added.
 After several months of plentiful rains earlier this year, analysts
forecast a record corn harvest and soy production similar to last season's
record crop, but La Nina's arrival in November has stoked fears that
production will suffer.

 Stories on South America crop weather [ID:N27230400]
 Soy output graphic: http://link.reuters.com/deg56p
 Corn output graphic: http://r.reuters.com/puc64q

 Memories of a severe drought in the 2008/09 season, which battered soy
and corn production, are fresh in the minds of many growers.
 Soybeans tend to cope with drought better than corn, which could be
worse hit if the current dryness drags on into the yield-defining
development stages.
 ""This La Nina is really hurting us from the point of view of corn. A
lot of corn still hasn't been planted. Those that have been planted are
bad, very few are in good condition,"" said Luis Marcenaro, president of the
Producir XXI consulting firm, which works with farmers in Lujan.
 ""Now we're getting to Christmas and things are bad in terms of soil
moisture in many places and the outlook for corn is very bad,"" he added.
 FARMERS' NERVES
 Last weekend, there were rains in Argentina's central farming region,
but they only brought relief to a few of the areas worse hit by La Nina.
 ""The rains registered these days improved the condition of crops in
some areas, but they weren't heavy enough. We still need more rainfall,""
said Liliana Nunez at Argentina's National Meteorological Service.
 Some forecasters are predicting rains over the coming weeks, but that
has not been enough to calm farmers' nerves. [ID:nN14274843]
 ""Corn plants have recovered a lot thanks to the rains we've had in the
past week, but it's essential that we get some rain during the flowering
period at the end of December,"" the Lujan farmer Dominguez said.
 ""If it doesn't rain, yields will be much lower-than-expected,"" he
said.
 Argentina's agriculture minister has estimated this season's soy
production at 52 million tonnes, compared with 52.7 million in the previous
harvest, with corn output seen rising to 26 million tonnes from 22.7
million previously.
 La Nina is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the
Equatorial Pacific. Typically, it spawns drought in Brazil or Argentina,
very dry weather in the U.S. Southwest reaching up into the grain belt, and
excessive rain in Australia and Indonesia.
 Its counterpart is El Nino which is characterized by unusually warm
ocean temperatures along the Equator in the Pacific. Its effects likewise
are the exact opposite, from drought in Australia and Indonesia to too much
rain in Argentina and Brazil, and heavy rains in the U.S. Southwest into
the grain belt, though it tends to hinder hurricanes in the Caribbean.
 El Nino means little boy in Spanish. It was named after the Christ
child by anchovy fisherman off the coast of Peru one Christmastime in the
19th century.

 (Recasts, adds more comment, market reaction)
 By Carmel Crimmins
 DUBLIN, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Ireland avoided slipping back
into recession in the third quarter but its modest growth rates
underline the huge challenge ahead in tackling its financial
crisis.
 Ireland's debt levels have quadrupled on the back of a
banking sector meltdown and it needs solid economic growth to
ensure it can meet repayments and fiscal targets set down in an
85 billion euros EU/IMF bailout agreed last month.
 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose 0.5 percent in the third
quarter, data on Thursday showed, rebounding from a 1 percent
drop in the previous quarter but missing expectations for a 0.8
percent increase as a strong export performance only partially
compensated for weak domestic demand.
 ""The small rise in Irish GDP in Q3 is clearly encouraging,
but it does not alter our underlying view that the government
faces an enormous task to reduce public debt to a sustainable
level without defaulting,"" said Ben May of Capital Economics.
 Despite securing external aid that will cover its funding
requirements over the next three years, yields on Irish debt
remain sky-high due to fears Dublin will restructure its debt in
the future.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish paper
over German bunds rose 9 basis points on Thursday to 543 basis
points.
 Ireland's government is targeting average economic growth of
2.7 percent between 2011 and 2014 and it seized on the third
quarter performance as proof that it was on track.
 ""Today's figures show that the economy has stabilised and is
now on an export-led growth path,"" Finance Minister Brian
Lenihan said in a statement. 
 ""The budget day forecast for economic growth of 1.7 percent
in 2011, which is in line with the consensus forecast, remains
on track."" 
 Economists polled by Reuters expect Ireland to generate 1.6
percent GDP growth next year.

 DOMESTIC DEMAND
 Many investors doubt that Ireland with reach its medium term
growth targets, given that Dublin is pushing through
unprecedented cutbacks and tax increases to cut the worst budget
deficit in Europe.
 All components of domestic demand fell in the third quarter
from the previous three months and consumer consumption fell 0.5
percent, its biggest drop since the fourth quarter of last year,
when Ireland was still in recession.
 Exports rose 3.6 percent while imports increased 1.4
percent.
 ""To be absolutely confirmed that we are past the worst, we'd
want to see things like consumer spending and capital investment
within the economy rise,"" said Eoin Fahy, chief economist at
Kleinworth Benson Investors.
 The European Commission has estimated Ireland will grow at
just 0.9 percent next year, just over half the government
forecast, and has already given Dublin until 2015, an extra
year, to get its deficit under control.
 Ireland has committed to cutting its deficit under the
EU/IMF deal and the EU has given it until 2015 to get its
shortfall below an EU limit of 3 percent of GDP.
 Ireland's shortfall will blow out to 32 percent of GDP this
year due to the one-off inclusion of a 30 billion euros bill for
bailing out the banks.
 On an underlying basis, Ireland's shortfall will be nearly
12 percent this year and 9.4 percent next year still the highest
in the euro zone despite record cutbacks.
 Gross national product, seen by some economists as a more
accurate indicator of the state of the economy, jumped 1.1
percent, beating expectations for a 0.2 percent increase.
 GNP strips out the profits of multinational firms operating
in Ireland but the income of foreign listed companies
headquartered in the country is recorded in this measurement
until they pay out dividends.
 A slew of companies, including insurance firm Beazley and
advertising group WPP have moved their tax domicile to Ireland
in recent years.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2010 07:28AM ET</span>",Russia tells Ukraine: join post-Soviet trade bloc," MOSCOW, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin encouraged Ukraine on Thursday to join Moscow-driven
efforts to integrate the economies of the biggest post-Soviet
republics into one trading bloc.
 Ukraine has sought closer ties with Russia since the
election of Viktor Yanukovich in February 2010, abandoning the
goal of joining NATO and extending Russia's lease of a military
base on the Black Sea.
 ""In the last 15 years we have seen the first real steps
towards integration and the creation of a new union between our
three states: Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus,"" Putin said when
asked whether Ukraine and Russia should unite again.
 ""If our Ukrainian colleagues see some sort of benefit in
joining these processes, if Ukraine was to join these processes
in some form or another, then of course it would be a powerful,
important boost,"" Putin said at his annual question-and-answer
session with the Russian people.
 Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan are already members of a
customs union and signed a macroeconomic policy coordination
agreement last month, an important part of their drive to create
a free trade zone in 2012.
 But joining Russia-dominated efforts could hamper a deal
with the European Union because the customs union has a common
foreign trade policy with tight links to Russia.
 Putin, a 58-year-old former KGB spy who watched from a
posting in East Germany as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991,
has sought to claw back some of the clout Russia lost when the
Soviet empire broke up.
 ""He who doesn't regret the collapse of the Soviet Union has
no heart, but he who wants it restored in the original has no
brains,"" Putin said, repeating one of his most notable comments.

weighs
 * Turkish bond yields at new record low on expected rate cut
 * Forint, dinar gain as central banks seen raising rates
 
 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks fell for the
second straight session on Thursday as weak U.S. Treasuries
weighed on risk appetite but domestic Turkish bonds rose to new
highs ahead of an expected cut in interest rates.
 Markets failed to react significantly to a ratings upgrade
for China by Standard & Poor's which came after markets closed.
S&P now rates China 'AA-', on a par with Moody's.
 While U.S. Treasuries steadied following a selloff that
pushed 10-year yields past the 3.5-percent level and the dollar
also slipped, investors seemed reluctant to take on fresh bets
on emerging markets less than two weeks before the new year.
 Markets were also rangebound before a European Union
end-year summit starting at 1500 GMT. The meeting is unlikely
however to yield any concrete decisions other than an agreement
to changes in the plan to create a system for handling a
post-2013 financial crisis.
 ""It may be that we are in the last days of normal trading,
it's a period of extremely restricted liquidity, moves will be
rather erratic,"" said BNP Paribas emerging markets strategist
Elisabeth Gruie. 
 ""The focus is on the outcome of the EU meeting.""
 By 1130 GMT, the MSCI emerging index fell 0.6 percent after
having lost 0.7 percent on Wednesday. In Asia, Chinese markets
closed near one-week lows investors priced in the likelihood of
more policy tightening by the central bank.
 Emerging European equities also fell.
 Investors were focusing on Turkey, where the central bank is
widely expected to cut rates by 50 basis points to 6.50 percent
at its meeting later on Thursday..
 The bank is worried that waves of money flooding into Turkey
and other emerging markets risk creating an asset bubble and
pushing the current account deficit to unsustainable levels.
 Turkish stocks are one of the best performing this year with
gains of around 23 percent but the index pulled back in line
with broader emerging markets on Thursday.
 The prospect of more rate cuts continued to buoy bonds
however, and the benchmark two-year yield dropped to a new
record low around 7.3 percent.
 The lira fell to a 3-1/2-month low against the dollar before
recovering slightly. The currency has lost 1.2 percent so far
this week after falling 2.2 percent last week, hit by the
dollar's rise and expectations of central bank action to curb
the runaway capital inflows.
 Some analysts say a cut is not a foregone conclusion.
 Credit Agricole expects no changes to the rate but
acknowleged the bank may attempt to cut policy rates to cap
capital inflows but raise reserve requirement ratios sharply.
 ""It would be a risky strategy, as inflation should remain a
challenge for next year, and also because lower rates could give
a boost to asset prices, and could in turn attract more flows.
It is worth remembering that the CBT (Central Bank of Turkey)
has already cut policy rates aggressively by 1025 bps,"" Credit
Agricole told clients.
 
 RATE INCREASE PROSPECTS LIFT FORINT, SERB DINAR
 In Hungary the opposite was true as the forint gained
traction from expectations the central bank will raise interest
rates by 25 basis points on Monday. It rose over half a percent
against the euro, outperforming neighbours.
 ""I expect a further 25-basis-point rate increase in
December. They can continue to lift interest rates by 25 basis
points every month until February,"" said Gyula Toth, head of
emerging markets research at Unicredit in Vienna.
 Hungary held a successful bond auction, selling more debt
than planned across three maturities.
 In Serbia too, the dinar stayed strong, forcing the central
bank to call an auction to buy euros. It bought 26 million
euros, a day after it intervened in the market to scoop up 30
million euros to stop the currency moving higher. 
 The dinar has appreciated roughly 5 percent this month,
after underperforming hugely in the first half of 2010.
 Gruie of BNP Paribas attributed the turnaround in the dinar
to policy changes at the central bank which recently started
delivering rate hikes to combat high inflation. It raised rates
by a percentage point last week to 11.5 percent.
 ""There is speculation they might hike again, rates are
almost the highest in the world, clearly the yield pick-up is
most impressive,"" she added.
 Overall bond markets were firm though sovereign bond spreads
widened four basis points as Treasury yields fell.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European shares shed early gains
and peripheral euro zone bonds dipped on Thursday after Spain
paid a high premium at a debt auction, ahead of a summit at
which EU leaders will focus on the region's debt crisis.
 U.S. Treasury yields eased but held near seven-month highs
after jumping the previous day on a rise in inflation
expectations and the spectre of higher growth and a wider
deficit.
 EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday
for their end-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome the
year-long debt crisis at the heart of their agenda.
 Leaders will try to agree how to stop it spreading, with
Portugal and Spain in their sights, and discuss changing the
EU's treaty to create a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism
from 2013 and might look at enlarging the existing crisis fund.
.
 Markets are not anticipating any significant developments
from the summit, though any positive news would likely support
the euro and risk appetite.
 ""Spain is going to be the issue, with the threat of a
downgrade, investors will be looking for comments from the EU
meeting,"" Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG Index, said.
 ""We don't want Spain to get bailed out. If it does, it sends
a big message to investors that if an economy as big as Spain is
fragile, then the euro-zone may be a risky place to do
business.""
 Spain was forced to pay a hefty premium at its final bond
auction of the year on Thursday, in a key test of investor
appetite for euro zone peripheral debt a day after Moody's said
it may cut the country's rating. 
 The Spanish Treasury raised 2.4 billion euros ($3.20
billion), within the targeted range of 2-3 billion euros but
disappointing some analyst who expected more debt to be sold. 
 ""In the short term this should reduce pressure on the
Spanish market, but I think when one looks at the bigger picture
and considers the small amount sold, with low bid-covers, yet at
a high yield, then it seems clear that peripheral markets remain
under pressure and in need of support from policymakers,"" said
Peter Chatwell, rate strategist at Credit Agricole in London.
 Government debt yields for Spain as well as Portugal and
Italy were pulled higher after the auction, while Bunds traded
in a narrow range with yields little changed on the day.
 
 U.S. YIELDS EASE
 European stocks gave up earlier gains to trade close to flat
at 1,128.79 as shares in southern Europe dipped following the
Spanish bond sale. 
 The euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.3225
after coming under pressure on Wednesday on Moody's Spain
warning, while the dollar was steady versus a basket of
currencies.
 Oil was trading a touch lower at $88.10 and gold rose 0.2
percent.
 In the cash market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. note slid
to 3.47 percent after climbing as high as 3.57 percent
overnight.
 The 10-year yield has risen nearly 90 basis points since
November, contributing to a dramatic steepening of the 2-year to
10-year yield curve to 282 basis points from 226 basis points at
the beginning of November.
 That spread is on course for the largest widening in a
quarter since the first quarter of 2008.
 ""The market is very difficult now ... but what I do sense is
that we've got down to levels that are technically supportive,""
said a trader at a European firm.
 ""It's difficult to sell at this low and initiate a new
position,"" he added.
 U.S. equity futures were pointing to a slightly lower open
ahead of a raft of U.S. data, with the current account, housing
starts, weekly jobless claims and the Philly Fed Business
Activity index all set for release.

 BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - More expensive energy was the
main driver of euro zone inflation in November, but the pace of
price growth remained at the European Central Bank's target as
wage growth slowed sharply in the third quarter, data showed.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said
consumer prices in the 16 countries using the euro rose 0.1
percent month-on-month for a 1.9 percent year-on-year increase,
as expected by economist polled by Reuters.
 Eurostat said higher prices of fuels for transport, heating
oil and gas added almost 0.51 percentage points to the
year-on-year figure. Petrol and more expensive clothing and
vegetables were also key drivers for the monthly increase.
 Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food costs, or
what the ECB calls core inflation, prices were flat
month-on-month and grew 1.1 percent year-on-year, the same as in
October. 
 The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to
2 percent over the medium term.
 An even broader measure of core inflation, which excludes
alcohol and tobacco prices, showed prices fell 0.1 percent
month-on-month in November for a 1.1 percent annual rise.
 In the euro zone, prices fell month-on-month in Ireland,
Cyprus, Malta and the Netherlands. 
 Separately, Eurostat said wage growth in the third quarter
slowed sharply year-on-year to 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent in
the second quarter and 1.9 percent in the first.
 Total hourly labour costs, which apart from wages include
employers' social contributions and employment taxes less
subsidies, grew 0.8 percent in annual terms in the third
quarter, slowing from 1.6 percent in the second quarter.
 Wages fell in euro zone periphery countries most exposed to
market concerns over sovereign debt -- Greece, Spain, Portugal,
as well as in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and the Netherlands.
 Data for Ireland, which has secured an EU/IMF financial aid
package to fend off upward market pressure on its yields, was
not available.
 Total labour costs also fell in Finland, even though wages
there grew, thanks to a sharp fall in employers' social
contributions and employment taxes less subsidies.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European markets were little
changed in thin trade on Thursday as investors digested a key
Spanish debt auction ahead of a summit at which they hope EU
leaders will agree fresh steps to tackle the region's debt
crisis.
 U.S. Treasuries won some reprieve from a sell-off near key
support levels.
 EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for their
end-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome the year-long debt
crisis at the heart of their agenda.

 Spain's Treasury paid 5.5 to 6 percent on Thursday to sell
more than 2 billion euros of 10- and 15-year bonds, with yields
rising sharply from the previous corresponding sales a day after
ratings agency Moody's put the country's sovereign debt on
review for a possible downgrade.
European stocks traded with gains of around 0.2 percent at

 JAPAN OUTPERFORMS, CHINA SLIPS
 Japanese stocks continued to outperform global stock markets
thanks to foreign investment. Japan's Nikkei share average was
flat, though up 1 percent so far in the week, outperforming the
MSCI all-country world index advance of 0.1 percent. 
 ""The Nikkei is taking a breather after a six-week rally, but
sentiment remains bullish overall,"" said Takashi Ohba, a senior
strategist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. Foreign investors
have been net buyers of Japanese stocks for six consecutive
weeks to Dec. 11, purchasing a cumulative $9.8 billion worth of
equities, Japan's finance ministry data showed. 
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index of equities fell 0.5
percent in sluggish trade, lead by a fall in Chinese stocks. 
 After sliding more than 2 percent in November on early
profit taking, the index has staged a rally in light turnover in
December. It is up 3.6 percent so far in December.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Thursday
ahead of an EU summit but remained vulnerable on euro zone debt
concerns, while the dollar slipped back after a surge in U.S.
Treasury yields ebbed.
 EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to try to
agree on further action to tackle a year-long debt crisis that
has consumed Greece and Ireland and threatens to spread to
Portugal and Spain.
 ""The forex market has gone into this with a high degree of
hope for some signs of consensus from political leaders ...
although I doubt there will be any additional clarity on euro
bonds or enhancing the bailout fund,"" said Jane Foley, senior
currency strategist at Rabobank.
 ""If they (politicians) give an impression of many
differentiating factions, the market would react quite badly.""
 Euro zone policymakers are toying with a number of ideas to
fall back on if moves to create a permanent European Stability
Mechanism for solving debt crises fail to calm financial markets
next year.
 By 0900 GMT, the euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.3241 after
falling more than 1 percent on Wednesday. Chartists put support
at $1.3160-65, with the next level to watch at
$1.3050-75 and then the November low of $1.2969.
 Option expiries were being cited at $1.3200 and at $1.3300.
 Spain will remain in focus ahead of the summit after ratings
agency Moody's warned on Wednesday it could downgrade Spain's
rating and as Madrid was scheduled to sell up to 3 billion euros
of 2020 and 2025 bonds on Thursday.
 ""It's bad timing considering Moody's announcement before the
auction, but there has been substantial cheapening so it will be
interesting to see what level of demand emerges,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 Reaction was limited to data showing the euro zone flash
manufacturing purchasing mangers' index rose to its highest
level since April at 56.8 in December from 55.3 in November,
confounding forecasts for a fall to 55.2.
 
 DOLLAR LOSES STEAM
 The dollar lost upward momentum as U.S. Treasury yields
eased and the dollar index was down 0.2 percent at 80.07.
 It had gained earlier this week as benchmark 10-year
Treasury yields rose, hitting seven-month highs at 3.565 percent
and pushing the dollar to a three-month high against the yen at
84.51 yen on Wednesday. 
 On Thursday the dollar slipped back to 84.07 yen.
 ""The move above 84.41 yen should be a bullish sign for the
dollar/yen but it does depend on U.S. yields,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.
 A convincing break of 84.50 could bring the dollar into
sight of post-intervention peaks near 86.00 yen set in
September.
 Many market players are not convinced the selloff in
Treasuries since early November is coming to an end. However,
while a further rise in U.S. bond yields was seen helping the
dollar, some market players noted a breakdown in the
dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields and with
U.S.-Japan yield spreads.
 Its three-month correlation with five-year yield spreads
fell to just 0.65 from 0.96 in August/September.
 ""It's too early to say with conviction, but it could be due
to an emergence of bearish factors, such as the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" Rabobank's Foley said.
 The Swiss franc dipped against the euro after the Swiss
National Bank left interest rates unchanged as expected and said
it would take all measures necessary should the euro zone crisis
lead to renewed deflation threats in Switzerland. 
 The Swiss franc hit a record high of 1.2758 francs per euro
on trading platform EBS on Wednesday.

 * Manufacturing sector growth accelerates
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The euro zone's dominant service
sector expanded much slower than expected this month but its
manufacturing sector, which led a large part of the economic
recovery, grew faster than thought, surveys showed on Thursday.
 Worryingly for policymakers, a large part of the strength
was on the back of a very positive performance in Germany and a
supportive France, which outshone other member states.
 ""Possibly the divergence is growing wider. Growth in Germany
is near a record rate ... France has been a strong performer as
well as far as PMIs go,"" said Chris Williamson at Markit.
 ""When you strip France and Germany out of the euro zone
figures we can see that in December growth of activity across
services and manufacturing slowed down almost to stagnation.""
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from banks
to restaurants, slumped to 53.7 in December from November's
55.4.
 The index has now been above the 50.0 mark that divides
growth in business activity from contraction since September
2009, but it was well shy of the consensus forecast in a Reuters
poll for 55.2.
 The manufacturing sector saw activity pick up faster than
expected this month, driven by a buoyant Germany and strong new
orders.
 The flash manufacturing index rose to its highest level
since April at 56.8 in December from 55.3 in November,
confounding forecasts for a fall to 55.2, while the output index
bounced to 57.8 this month from 55.8 in November.
 Earlier data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed
its service sector slowed more than expected, shy of November's
more than three-year record, but its manufacturing sector
expanded much more than predicted.
 In neighbouring France both services and manufacturing
activity grew at a slower pace than was expected, but Markit
said this could be partly due to severe weather and protests
over government pension reforms.
 The euro zone composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
dropped to 55.0 this month from 55.5 in November, missing
expectations for 55.4.
 Markit said the data pointed to fourth-quarter euro zone
growth of 0.5 percent, up from the 0.4 percent growth official
figures showed for the third quarter with support from a strong
Germany. The economy expanded 1.0 percent in the second quarter.
 A Reuters poll of more than 50 analysts published on
Wednesday forecast the economy would grow 0.3 to 0.5 percent per
quarter through to the end of 2012.
 
 OPTIMISM, PRICES RISE
 While activity may have slowed in the service sector, firms
were more optimistic about the longer term outlook, with
business expectations rising to 66.5 this month from 66.3 in
November. The index hit a near four-year high of 69.3 in April.
 Data showed manufacturers were able to pass on some of the
rising raw material costs as the output price index rose to 55.4
this month from November's 55.2, marking its highest reading
since August 2008.
 Service sector firms were able to raise prices for the first
time since October 2008.
 ""There is growing evidence that we are seeing a pass-through
of cost pressures, certainly among manufacturers. We are finally
seeing some improved pricing power in the service sector,""
Williamson said.
 But companies hired fewer new workers this month, with the
composite employment index dipping to 52.3 from November's
33-month high of 53.1. Manufacturers took on more staff than
they have done since July 2007 but this was offset by fewer new
hires in the service sector.
 Official data released late last month showed unemployment
in the bloc nudged up to 10.1 percent in October from 10.0
percent in September.

(Adds Hildebrand interview, analysts)
 By Catherine Bosley and Emma Thomasson
 ZURICH, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank held
interest rates ultra low on Thursday despite the economy's brisk
recovery as the euro zone debt crisis has pushed up the Swiss
franc and hurt the export-dependent Alpine country.
 Inflation should stay well within the SNB's definition of
price stability over the medium-term, the central bank said as
it cut its mid-term inflation forecast, indicating that interest
rates could be on hold for longer than previously expected.
 The safe-haven franc hit a record against the euro on
Wednesday around 1.2760 amid new concerns about the single
currency and SNB chairman Philipp Hildebrand said exporters in
this small, open economy were feeling the pain.
 ""An aggravation of the crisis in the euro area would
inevitably have further negative consequences for the Swiss
economy,"" he told a news conference after the rate decision.
 ""It is clear that comprehensive and far-reaching action is
needed to reinstate confidence and the culture of stability that
is a prerequisite for a successful European Union,"" Hildebrand
later told Reuters Insider television.
 The Swiss central bank left its target band for the 3-month
Swiss franc LIBOR unchanged at 0.00-0.75 percent and said it
would continue to aim to keep the LIBOR at 0.25 percent.
 All 37 economists polled by Reuters had expected the central
bank would leave rates on hold, and the majority predicted the
first SNB rate hike in the third quarter of 2011. 
 The Swiss economy would slow significantly in the quarters
ahead, Hildebrand said. The SNB forecast growth of around 1.5
percent for 2011 after some 2.5 percent in 2010.
 He also said the central bank would take all measures
necessary should the euro zone crisis and the franc's strength
trigger fresh deflation threats, although analysts think new
central bank intervention to weaken the franc is unlikely.

 HOSTAGE TO EURO ZONE CRISIS
 The SNB tried to counter the franc's rise earlier this year
to fight deflation risks, selling over 200 billions of francs in
interventions, which it stopped in June.
 The franc eased after the SNB decision, trading at 1.2841 at
1416 GMT, though still within sight of Wednesday's record high
.
 Interest rate futures indicated that markets pushed back
expectations for the first tightening after the SNB's comments,
pricing in a full hike only for December 2011. <0#FES:>
 ""SNB: hostage of the EMU debt crisis,"" wrote UniCredit
economist Alexander Koch in a note. ""The SNB will refrain from
conducting or even signalling any tightening moves until we see
a sustained easing in EMU tensions"".
 The SNB chief listed sustainable global economic growth,
stability in the euro zone, signs of overheating in the Swiss
real estate market and the impact of the currency on exports as
the factors that would determine the timing of a hike.
 The SNB forecast inflation of just 0.4 percent in 2011 and
cut its 2012 forecast to 1.0 percent from 1.2 percent. It sees
the first breach of its price stability threshold of 2 percent
only in the third quarter of 2013.
 Hildebrand told the news conference the lowering of the
SNB's inflation forecast meant the central bank had won an extra
quarter of room for manoeuvre on monetary policy.
 However, he said the rise in the inflation forecast towards
the end of the three-year horizon showed loose monetary policy
could not be maintained indefinitely.
 The Swiss economy has recovered more strongly than many
other European countries from the global crisis.
 While consumer and company investment spending helped the
country to post robust growth over the summer, goods exports
declined in the third quarter as the strong franc made products
from Switzerland more expensive abroad.
 Swiss industry data, published on Thursday, also reflected
the slowdown, showing that orders growth dropped sharply to just
2.9 percent on the year in the third quarter. [ID:nZCHFNE64L]

 * Little impact on banks' profits, but useful tool: analysts	
 * Steps aimed at reducing impact from sudden capital outflow	

(Updates with analysts' comments, effect)	
 By Yoo Choonsik and Lee Shin-hyung	
 SEOUL, Dec 16 (Reuters) - South Korea aims to impose a
levy on foreign-currency borrowings by banks late next year to
curb capital inflows and minimise the possible impact from a
sudden outflow of capital, senior finance officials said on
Thursday.	
 They said the government would try to avoid setting the
levy so high that it would be a big burden on the industry or
shock financial markets, while government sources suggested
the levy would be set at less than 0.1 percent of the foreign
borrowing.	
 Analysts said there would be little immediate impact on
banks' profits if the levy was set at a low rate but that the
move would be a significant additional tool to control capital
flows.	
 ""If we correctly understand the system, the levy will be
set at a relatively low level and apply only once. If so, the
impact on profitability will not be big,"" said Mok
Young-chung, head of research at Royal Bank of Scotland based
in Seoul.	
 ""However, it is still meaningful because it means the
government will now have a system through which it can control
flows and which it can adjust should the need arise.""	
 Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong-yong told Reuters the
government aims to unveil details of the levy later this
month. Deputy Minister Shin Je-yoon told reporters it would
take effect in late 2011 and target foreign-currency borrowings.	
 They declined to comment on a local media report that
details would be announced as early as Sunday, although Yim
said it could come at any time this month.	
 A government source said later it was considering
including cross-currency swap positions held by banks in the
foreign-currency debt to be levied.	
 The move comes as loose monetary policy in the advanced
economies has driven funds into emerging-market assets and
after the leaders of the Group of 20 major economies gave a
nod last month to emerging economies in imposing capital
controls.	
 ""The aim is neither giving a shock to the markets nor
managing the foreign exchange rate at a targeted level,"" Yim
said in interview. ""Our goal is to implement a tool to secure
soundness of banks.""	
 South Korea has often been hit hard by global credit
squeezes because of its heavy exposure to foreign debt,
attributed to a big demand for dollar funding to meet forward
deals by shipbuilders and to make up for falling domestic
deposits.	
 Foreign-currency borrowings owed by banks in South Korea,
including branches of foreign banks, rose to as high as 66
percent of the official foreign reserves in the third quarter
of 2008 from less than 25 percent four years before.	
 A sharp rise in foreign reserves along with the
government's effort to curb borrowings have since then helped
bring the ratio down to 42 percent in the third quarter of
this year, central bank data shows.	
 South Korea has already imposed ceilings this year on
currency derivative trades that banks can hold.	
 Emerging economies have quickly recovered from the fallout
from the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and their fast
growth since then has attracted funds from the developed
economies still relying on loose monetary policy.	
 South Korea's economy, the fourth-largest in Asia, is
expected to grow by more than 6 percent this year after
averting contraction last year and is tapped to post the
third-highest growth next year among OECD members.

interest rates on Thursday despite the economy's brisk recovery,

 The central bank said after its quarterly policy meeting

 If the tensions worsened, it could have a detrimental effect

36,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2010 01:40AM ET</span>",HIGHLIGHTS-A rare glimpse inside China's central bank," BEIJING, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Zhou Xiaochuan, head of China's
central bank, offered a rare elaboration late on Wednesday of his
views on a range of issues from global currency reform to
inflation and hot money.
 His comments, made in a university lecture and obtained by
Reuters, were largely academic but help shed light on policy
thinking in the world's second-largest economy.
 For a related story, click on [ID:nTOE6BE065]
 Here are some highlights translated from his talk, along with
relevant background.
 ON EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND INFLATION
 * Background:
 Analysts say that excess cash in the Chinese economy from
hefty trade inflows and a lending surge during the global
financial crisis is one of the root causes of inflation's 5.1
percent jump in the year to November, a 28-month high.
 * Zhou's view:
 He said it was inappropriate to directly compare China's
money supply with that in the United States, because China has a
much higher savings rate and the United States has more direct
financing.
 ""What is the measure for whether money supply is appropriate?
The answer is very clear in modern monetary theory. It is largely
the core consumer price index (CPI).""
 ""Why is the core CPI used? Because there are many other
prices that have little relationship with money, such as the
import prices of commodity prices and price changes caused by
weather or other reasons.""
 He said fast money growth during the global financial crisis
had been necessary and any fallout could be dealt with.
 ""There will definitely be some over-shooting, but the key is
that you make adjustments in a timely manner when you spot the
turning point so that the over-shooting won't be serious.""
 ""We started to tighten liquidity long before CPI hit 5.1
percent. We have raised banks' required reserves six times this
year. We paused in the middle of the year because of the debt
crisis in Europe.""
 ON MANAGING CAPITAL INFLOWS
 * Background:
 Zhou said last month that China can create ""pools"" to lock up
capital inflows, leaving the market to speculate about his
meaning. He expanded on the idea in his lecture.
 * Zhou's view:
 ""A typical pool would be foreign exchange reserves. But
reserves are in fact composed of many parts, and each part can be
viewed as a pool as well.""
 ""Some pools can cover trade payments. Some pools are reserves
for the future remittance of profits by foreign companies. They
have made a lot of investments in China and will someday take
profits out.""
 ""And one pool is for hot money. As long as you get into the
pool, I can sterilise 100 percent of the liquidity, so you won't
have any negative impacts on the real economy.""
 ""We have to look at the sources of liquidity. If the growth
in liquidity comes from a rising trade surplus, foreign capital
inflows or foreign direct investments, you know we have to
enhance the sterilisation efforts.""
 ""Even without strong inflation pressure, we should still step
up sterilisation... and use the tool (reserve requirements),
which should play its role.""
 HIS PROPOSAL FOR A SUPER-SOVEREIGN CURRENCY
 * Background:
 In March 2009, Zhou suggested that a beefed-up Special
Drawing Rights (SDR), the International Monetary Fund's unit of
account, could displace the dollar as the world's main reserve
currency.
 ""You can view this as a suggestion or an idea.
 ""Reserve currency (issuing countries) may have a conflict
between their domestic policies and international
responsibilities, so the idea emerged that whether there should
be a super-sovereign currency.
 ""You may think it a quite theoretical issue or a very remote
thing, but the background was quite real.""
 ""After the breakout of the financial crisis, and we all know
the crisis happened on Wall Street, some people tried to blame
others for their own mistakes and tried to shirk their
responsibilities.
 ""In particular, at the end of 2008 and the start of 2009,
there was much noise that China was the source of the financial
crisis, that China's trade surplus had caused a global imbalance.
 ""We find that ridiculous. It's your property bubble, your
subprime loans, your lax regulation and your business models. How
can you blame others for all the problems?
 ""I don't think any Chinese person will accept that (blame).""
 ""To a large extent, the initial discussion of a
(super-sovereign currency) relates to analysis of the reasons for
the financial crisis and the share of responsibilities.
 ""It won't do any good to just exchange a few words. We have
to present the issues in an analytical way.
 ""However, we do want to discuss what the future international
monetary system should look like. It may be remote, but there
should be some kind of blueprint.""

 * Pakistan, borders remain key differences

(Adds China, India comments)	
 By Sui-Lee Wee and Abhijit Neogy	
 NEW DELHI, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
pressed on with a charm offensive in India on Thursday,
offering support for New Delhi's bid for a greater role in the
United Nations and agreeing on an ambitious target of $100
billion in trade between the rising Asian powers by 2015.	
 Relations between the world's two fastest growing major
economies are tense, despite the booming trade relationship
between them. Nearly 40 years after they fought a war there
are still rifts over disputed borders, and suspicion in New
Delhi over China's regional ambitions and its close ties with
arch-rival, Pakistan.	
 But both Wen and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
exchanged vows of amity and goodwill, appearing to brush under
the carpet a series of differences that have dogged relations
for decades.	
 ""I believe with our joint efforts, through the visit,
we'll be able to raise our friendship and cooperation to a
high level in the new century,"" said Wen, standing alongside
Singh at the Indian presidential palace after a formal
red-carpet welcome ceremony.	
 
 Wen's visit, the first by a Chinese premier to India in
five years, has looked carefully choreographed to improve ties
between two countries that between them are home to more than
a third of the world's population.	
 At least 34 Tibetan protesters were arrested for taking
part in anti-China demonstrations in New Delhi on Thursday.	
 Arriving with more than 300 business leaders on Wednesday,
Wen said that India and China were not rivals and there was
room in the world for both powers to develop.	
 ""There is a trust deficit, a trade deficit but certainly
not a charm deficit,"" said broadcaster CNN IBN Deputy Editor
Sagarika Ghose.	
 Singh responded in kind to Wen's effusive words before
they went into a meeting behind closed doors: ""A strong
partnership between India and China will contribute to
long-term, peace, stability, prosperity and development in
Asia and the world.""	
 
 BOOSTING TRADE	
 China's willingness to increasingly engage with India on
key issues such as their dispute over boundaries, as well as
free trade talks, could stem from a realisation in Beijing
that China needs India's support in increasingly significant
international platforms such as the G20.
The two sides said they wanted bilateral trade
to cross $100 billion by 2015 from $60 billion in 2010, partly
driven by greater access for Indian firms to Chinese markets.	
 Wen offered plenty of compromises during his visit but
gave few details on when and how the thorny issues, including
reducing India's trade deficit with China, would be addressed.	
 India's trade deficit with China is by far the highest
among its trade partners and could touch $25 billion this
year, which would account for around a fifth of India's total
expected annual deficit.	
 India has sought to diversify its trade basket, but raw
materials and other low-end commodities such as iron ore still
make up about 60 percent of its exports to China.	
 ""We would like our pharmaceuticals, we would like our
agricultural commodities and we would like our IT services,
all of which we are brand leaders internationally, to come
into China,"" said Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said.
India and China are the world's fastest-growing
major economies. But India fears China wants to curtail its
rise as a global power, and is concerned about Beijing's close
security ties with Pakistan where Wen arrives on Friday on the
second part of his trip.	
 India and Pakistan have fought three wars since
independence from Britain in 1947 and Delhi broke off peace
talks after Pakistani militants attacked Mumbai in 2008,
killing 166 people.
The China-India statement on Thursday outlined
Beijing's support for U.N. Security Council Resolution 1267,
which calls for sanctions against the Lakshar-e-Taiba militant
group that New Delhi blames for the attack and accuses
Pakistan of harbouring.	
 India also fears China wants to restrict its global reach
by possibly opposing its bid for a permanent U.N. Security
Council seat or encircling the Indian Ocean region with
massive projects from Pakistan to Myanmar.	
 China reiterated its support for India's aspirations to
play a greater role in the Security Council, but it stopped
short of expressing full backing for India.	
 
 CHARM OFFENSIVE	
 Long wary of Washington's influence in South Asia,
Beijing's overtures toward New Delhi come just a little over a
month after U.S. President Barack Obama's trip to India,
during which he endorsed India's long-held demand for a
permanent seat.	
 India has sewn up almost $50 billion in commercial deals
with the United States, France and China over the past few
weeks. The number of foreign leaders visiting, with Russia's
president due next week, highlight the growing importance of
India on the world stage.
Wen's avuncular style contrasts sharply with
that of Singh, who is seen as shy and lacking charisma. Singh
is also engulfed in what may be India's biggest corruption
scandal, threatening the stability of the Congress party-led
coalition government.	
 Wen announced on Wednesday that Chinese companies would
sign deals with Indian firms worth more than $16
billionranging from power equipment to telecoms gear --
underscoring business was driving the relationship, for now.
Chinese banks will provide the bulk of lending for these
deals. [ID:nSGE6BE03E]	
 Although both India and China have said they are exploring
a possible free-trade agreement, no real progress was made on
that front during the visit as there is scepticism in New
Delhi that Beijing may only want to dump cheap manufactured
goods on India's booming $1.3 trillion economy. [ID:nSGE6BC04V]	
 ""Gradually, the whole relationship seems to be becoming
better than before ... on the economic side, the private deals
signed yesterday show things might be becoming a little more
equitable,"" Bhaskar Roy, a political analyst told Reuters.
China is now India's largest trade partner and
two-way trade is expected to reach $60 billion in 2010/11
compared with $3 billion in 2001/02 -- illustrating the
phenomenal growth rate.	
 Still, total investment by China in India is small,
amounting to only $221 million in 2009, representing about 0.1
percent of China's total outward foreign direct investment in
that year. That figure is seven times less than what China has
invested in Pakistan, according to official data.	
 While the two are often lumped together as emerging world
powers, China's GDP is four times bigger than India's and its
infrastructure outshines India's dilapidated roads and ports,
a factor that makes New Delhi wary of Beijing's growing might.

 By Mantik Kusjanto	
 WELLINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - New Zealand consumer
confidence fell to its lowest level in 18 months in the fourth
quarter while business confidence posted its first drop in
three months in December, reinforcing expectations its
economic recovery will remain sluggish and uneven well into
2011.	
 Confidence remained positive, despite the slight
softening, pointing to an economy struggling to pick up pace
and giving the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) scope to
keep interest rates steady into the middle of next year.	
 ""Today's results support our expectations that the RBNZ
can afford to wait till June before it raises the OCR
(official cash rate),"" said ASB bank economist Christina Leung. 
 The New Zealand dollar edged lower to $0.7393, from
$0.7405 before the business confidence data. The currency was
already being dragged lower by falls in the euro
against the U.S. dollar on worries about euro zone debt and as
traders unwound long euro positions ahead of the year end.	
 ANZ-National bank chief economist Cameron Bagrie said
businesses were holding back from taking more decisive action
partly because of their focus on paying back debt.	
 ""Grumpy growth has been the theme. Nonetheless, the seeds
of a robust recovery are being sown. It takes time for
germination to take hold,"" Bagrie said.	
 ""2010 was not about getting growth per se. It was about
setting the scene for growth that will ultimately prove to be
enduring.""	
 The National Bank of NZ's monthly business outlook showed
a net 34.5 percent of companies expected their own business to
improve in the next 12 months, compared with a 35.3 percent
optimism level in the November survey.	
 The survey's headline measure of sentiment showed a net
29.5 percent of respondents expected the economy to improve
over the next 12 months, compared with a net 33.2 percent a
month earlier. 
 Reflecting the patchy economy, the Westpac-McDermott
Miller survey showed consumer confidence falling to 108.3 in
the December quarter from 114.1 in the previous quarter. A
reading above 100 indicates more optimists than pessimists.
[ID:nL3E6NF066]	
 Westpac economists said the decline in sentiment was
across the board and seemed to stem from weak income growth
and a more pessimistic view of the short-term economic outlook.	
 ""Consumers have clearly become more cautious over the past
few months, and indeed over the past year, despite falling
unemployment, lower income tax rates, strong commodity prices,
and lower fixed term interest rates,"" Westpac senior economist
Donna Purdue said in a statement.	
 Last week the RBNZ held its cash rate at 3 percent because
of the weak economic recovery, and said it was prudent to keep
rates low until the economy gains some strength. 
 A Reuters poll after the decision showed a majority view
that the next move would be a 25 basis point rise in June next
year. 
 Recent data has shown weak retail sales as consumers stay
cautious and reduce debt in the face of slow wage growth and a
soft property market.	
 However, there were some signs that the foundations are
being put in place for a solid rebound later in 2011.	
 The results of the latest dairy auction by the country's
top exporter, Fonterra, showed a 2.4 percent rise in dairy
prices, indicating sustained high prices for the country's
main commodity. [ID:nL3E6NF05G]	
 And the latest manufacturing survey showed the sector
posting its first growth in four months in November.
[ID:nL3E6NF1US]	
 ""Today's data suggests the economy improved modestly into
the latter parts of the year.Â We expect that improvement to
continue into 2011, albeit at a modest pace,"" said Goldman
Sachs economist Philip Borkin. Â

 * EU summit not seen offering solution to debt crisis
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Thursday ahead
of an EU summit but looked vulnerable to further falls, while the
dollar held near the top of recent ranges against several major
currencies but lacked energy to vault them.
 Trading conditions have become choppy as the year-end
approaches, making it hard to take directional bets, although a
surge in U.S. yields has boosted the dollar across the board, and
took it to a three-month high of 84.51 yen on Wednesday.
 Treasury prices edged up on Thursday and the dollar paused,
helping the euro hold just above the bottom of a range it has
kept since the start of the month, ahead of an EU summit set to
discuss the euro zone debt crisis.
 ""The move above 84.41 yen should be a bullish sign for the
dollar/yen but it does depend on U.S. yields,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.
 ""The euro area still faces peripheral problems ... If
contagion spreads to Portugal, then who's next?""
 The euro's decline has been compounded by more upbeat U.S.
economic data, which helped drive benchmark 10-year Treasury
yields to seven-month highs at 3.565 percent and powered the
dollar higher.
 EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for their
end-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome the region's
year-long debt crisis at the heart of their agenda.
 Leaders will try to agree the next step in dealing with the
debt crisis and how to stop it spreading. They will discuss
changing the EU's treaty to create a permanent crisis-resolution
mechanism from 2013 and might look at enlarging the existing
crisis fund. For preview see.
 ""We expect plenty of contradictory headlines. Hence, the euro
is now vulnerable to a renewed move lower, with a break below
initial support at $1.3170 likely to trigger a decline to recent
lows in the $1.2970 area,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a client
note.
 ""With continued pressure on peripheral spreads, today's
Spanish bond auction will be important for sentiment.""
 Spain, which rating agency Moody's warned on Wednesday could
be downgraded, is scheduled to sell up to 3 billion euros of 2020
and 2025 bonds on Thursday.
 RBC analyst Sue Trinh said those maturities were typically
well subscribed, but at a price.
 ""At the margin, it may be euro-positive,"" she said.
 EURO FLAT
 The euro was flat on the day at $1.3215. Other chartists put
key support for the bottom of the range at $1.3160-65 and say
with a drop through there, the next level to watch is $1.3050-75
and then the November low at $1.2969.
 Dollar/yen was steady at 84.24 yen, after pushing up through
resistance at 84.00 yen on Wednesday. There was some talk of
Japanese corporate selling at the higher levels.
 A convincing break of 84.50 could bring the dollar into sight
post-intervention peaks near 86.00 yen set in September.
 The dollar index rose more than 1 percent overnight to above
80.00, but was flat at 80.23 on Thursday.
 Yet, the sharp rise overnight has only brought the dollar
index towards the top-end of a wide range around 78.80-80.50 seen
in the past few weeks as thin conditions made for choppy moves.
 Commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar faded
against the stronger dollar. The Aussie was last at $0.9870, well
off one-month high of $1.0030 set earlier in the week.

 HONG KONG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on
Thursday as dealers squared up positions ahead of a meeting of
European Union leaders, while U.S. Treasuries bounced after a
selloff overnight took 10-year yields above 3.5 percent,
sending some investors hunting for value.	
 Traders were wary that a discussion in Brussels about a
permanent mechanism to prevent fiscal crises from spreading
may push up the euro toward $1.33, though persistently higher
U.S. bond yields have been keeping the dollar broadly
supported in thin, year-end markets. [ID:nLDE6BE29I]	
 The euro wobbled overnight after Moody's said it was
considering downgrading Spain's credit rating and as a bond
auction in Portugal saw its three-month borrowing costs nearly
double. Spain will auction 10- and 15-year bonds later on
Thursday.	
 Shrinking trading volumes in Asian equity markets have
been a tell-tale sign that investors comfortable with their
cash allocations are heading to the sidelines for the rest of
the year rather than expose their portfolios to more risks. 
 A steep tumble in U.S. Treasuries in the wake of a deal in
Washington to extend tax cuts, though, has kept fixed income
fund managers nimble. Some investors see an end on the horizon
to the selling pressure even though trend-following funds have
kept upward pressure on yields in recent days.	
 ""Before the tax cuts, many investors had expected a
2.5-3.0 percent range for 10-year yields. Now their
expectations have shifted to 3.0-3.5 percent. I think the
10-year yield will eventually fall,"" said Hiroshi Yokotani,
fixed income director at Alliance Bernstein in Tokyo. 
 In equities, Japanese stocks continued to outperform
global stock markets thanks to foreign investment.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average was flat, though up 1 percent
so far in the week, outperforming the MSCI all-country
world index advance of 0.1 percent .	
 ""The Nikkei is taking a breather after a six-week rally,
but sentiment remains bullish overall,"" said Takashi Ohba, a
senior
strategist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo.	
 Foreign investors have been net buyers of Japanese stocks
for six consecutive weeks to Dec. 11, purchasing a cumulative
$9.8 billion worth of equities, Japan's finance ministry data
showed.	
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index of equities fell 0.5
percent in sluggish trade, despite another
flurry of positive U.S. economic data overnight. The consumer
discretionary sector, which has been a popular buy this year,
was down 1.6 percent, the biggest underperformer in the index,
suggesting profit taking was at play.	
 After sliding more than 2 percent in November on early
profit taking, the index has staged a rally in light turnover
in December. It is up 3.6 percent so far in December.	
 Southeast Asian equities were the region's biggest
underperformers in terms of countries on Thursday, though they
will probably keep the crown of best performing Asian stock
markets excluding frontier countries.	
 After accounting for currency moves, the benchmark stock
index in Thailand is up 55 percent so far this year,
followed closely by Indonesia and the Philippines, which have
risen 47.5 percent and 38.6 percent <.PSEi>,
respectively.	
 Thailand and Indonesia were the third- and fifth-most
favoured countries to invest in among global emerging market
investors, a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch survey released on
Tuesday showed.	
 Fast-growing emerging economies are expected to remain
strong draws for foreign investors in 2011.	
 
 EURO STEADIES, BUT FOR HOW LONG?	
 The euro was largely unchanged on the day at $1.3212
, with talk of sell orders around $1.3300 keeping it
hemmed in a tight range, traders said.	
 Chart support at $1.3164, the low of the range carved out
in the past week, if breached could lead to a further decline
to around $1.2969, the November low.	
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury futures expiring in March were up
8/32  after plumbing a 7-month low overnight. In the
cash market, the yield on the 10-year note slid to 3.49
percent after climbing as high as 3.57 percent
overnight.	
 The 10-year yield has risen nearly 90 basis points since
November, contributing to a dramatic steepening of the yield
curve of 2-year to 10-year debt to 282 basis points from 226
basis points at the beginning of November.	
 That spread is on course for the most widening in a
quarter since the first quarter of 2008.

Representatives voted on Wednesday to renew valuable U.S. trade
benefits set to expire at the end of the year for Andean
nations and about 130 other developing countries.
 The Senate has been working on a similar package, but it is
unclear whether it will vote on legislation before the Andean
Trade Preferences Act, or ATPA, and the much larger Generalized
System of Preferences, or GSP, expire.
 The House bill extends the two programs, which provide U.S.
duty-free treatment for thousands of goods, for 18 months.
 It provides additional duty suspensions for a number of
foreign raw materials and other products used by U.S.
manufacturers to make finished goods. Congress passed a similar
duty suspension bill earlier this year.
 A fourth plank of the bill extends the federal Trade
Adjustment Assistance program, which helps retrain workers who
have lost their jobs because of trade competition.
 Colombian officials, in particular, are worried that even a
temporary expiration of the Andean program would add to the
problems the country faces after heavy rains and flooding that
drove nearly 2 million people from their homes.
 On Monday, the government of Colombian President Juan
Manuel Santos estimated damage from the country's worst natural
disaster could reach 10 trillion pesos, which is about $5.2
billion.
 The Colombian flower industry is a major beneficiary of
ATPA, which slashes duties on imports of clothing,
vegetables, plastics, aluminum products and other goods from
the region to support jobs.
 President Barack Obama's administration supports extending
both ATPA and GSP and has been working with Congress toward
that end, said Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade
Representative's office.
 Congress is unlikely to let the programs lapse permanently,
even if it fails to pass an extension by Dec. 31.
 But work could be delayed in 2011 because of the time it
would take to educate new members on the issue.

(Adds pledge of adequate rescue fund, Strauss-Kahn on Spain)
 By Ilona Wissenbach and Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed
on Thursday to create a permanent financial safety net from 2013
and the European Central Bank moved to increase its firepower to
fight the debt crisis that has rocked the euro zone.
 But at Germany's insistence, the 27 leaders said the
long-term crisis-resolution mechanism, to be added to the EU's
governing treaty, could only be activated ""if indispensable to
safeguard the stability of the euro as a whole"".
 They also decided there was no need to increase an existing
temporary rescue fund, which some analysts say could be
insufficient if Spain and Portugal need EU/IMF bailouts after
Greece and Ireland, nor did they discuss using it more flexibly.
 ""The heads of state and government of the euro zone stand
ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability of the
euro zone as a whole,"" European Council President Herman Van
Rompuy told a news conference after chairing the first day of a
two-day EU summit.
 The ECB, in charge of monetary policy in the 16-nation euro
area, said it would almost double its capital to 10.76 billion
euros to cope with bigger credit risk and market volatility.
Euro zone members will provide the increase.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters the central
bank's governing council thought it was appropriate to make
""additional provisioning"" -- a veiled reference to potential
losses on euro zone sovereign bonds it has bought.
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been
critical of EU leaders' disjointed response to the rolling
crisis, said he was concerned about slow growth and the threat
of contagion in Europe.
 ""I'm worried and that's why I'm urging the Europeans to
provide for a comprehensive solution, because this piecemeal
approach obviously doesn't work,"" Strauss-Kahn told a Thomson
Reuters Newsmaker event in Washington. ""And the markets are just
waiting for what's next.""
 
 RECORD SEVENTH SUMMIT
 The leaders -- holding a record seventh summit this year --
approved a two-sentence amendment to the EU treaty at Germany's
behest to permit the creation of a European Stability Mechanism
to handle financial crises from 2013, Van Rompuy said.
 The ESM, to replace a temporary European Financial Stability
Facility created in May, will be empowered to grant loans on
strict conditions to member states in distress, with private
sector bondholders sharing the cost of any sovereign debt
writedown on a case-by-case basis.
 The aim is for all 27 member states to ratify the change by
end 2012. Van Rompuy said no country would need to put it to a
referendum, removing one potential risk. Decisions will be taken
by unanimity, ensuring that EU paymaster Germany retains a veto.
 The EU, together with the IMF, has set up a 750 billion euro
($1 trillion) emergency loan pool to help highly indebted euro
zone states unable to finance themselves in volatile markets.
 The decision by the Frankfurt-based ECB to raise its
subscribed capital base was the first such increase in its
12-year lifetime, a mark of the severity of the situation.
 The central bank has bought some 72 billion euros in euro
zone government bonds since May but has resisted political
pressure to step up these asset purchases substantially to help
indebted governments avoid having to seek a bailout.
 Strauss-Kahn said he was concerned about the length of the
process Europe was going through to resolve its crisis and said
the EU needed to find a ""comprehensive"" solution.
 But he voiced optimism that Spain would be able to ward off
the worst of the debt crisis without needing a rescue, and said
he saw no threat to the euro's existence.
 
 MERKEL GETS HER WAY
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pressed for the treaty
change to assuage Germany's constitutional court, got her way by
keeping other ideas, such as increasing the size of the EFSF or
issuing euro zone bonds, off the summit agenda.
 She said earlier she had settled a public spat with
Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the finance ministers of the
euro zone, over his call to issue common euro area bonds.
 The head of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, told
leaders at the summit that euro bonds should not be dismissed.
Strauss-Kahn said they could be a useful tool if Europe became
more centralised, but could not be a starting point now.
 Merkel contends so-called E-bonds would remove the incentive
for countries to balance their budgets, and raise Berlin's own
borrowing costs. Juncker, who called Germany's instant rejection
""un-European"", confirmed he had buried the hatchet with Merkel
but stuck to his guns on the euro bond proposal.
 Spain's Treasury paid a high premium to sell long-term bonds
on Thursday but found strong demand, in a test of investors'
appetite for euro zone peripheral debt.
 Portugal announced extra measures on Wednesday to cut red
tape and bolster structurally slow growth, in a move to convince
EU officials and financial markets it is doing enough to stave
off the pressure to seek EU financial aid.
 Throughout 2010, EU leaders have struggled to show unity and
clear communication in handling the crisis, alternating between
rushing out half-formed or contradictory proposals and dithering
on the right course of action while markets burned.
 There has been a relative lull in financial market pressure
in the past two weeks as investors and traders close their books
ahead of the end of the year, but analysts expect pressure to
resume in 2011 without action.
 Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said the EU's
portion of the existing crisis fund, totalling 440 billion
euros, could be doubled to fend off the threat of renewed market
pressure on Portugal and Spain. ""Of course we need to show we
have deep pockets,"" Reynders told reporters.

 NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Prospects for a credit
downgrade in Spain, combined with upbeat U.S. economic data,
led to a sharp downturn for the euro versus the U.S. dollar on
Wednesday, while Wall Street shed gains in a late sell-off.
 Oil traded in New York rose after the U.S. government
announced an unexpectedly large decline in U.S. crude
inventories, the biggest weekly drop in eight years.
 U.S. stocks struggled for much of the session, but gave in
to a late sell-off for a third day in a row.
 Early indications pointed to a flat opening for stocks in
Tokyo on Thursday as Nikkei futures traded unchanged at 10,375
.

after Moody's Investors Service put Spain's sovereign credit
rating on review for a possible downgrade. [ID:nL3E6NF0D8]
 ""We had a lot of very positive data today, but we still
have persistent euro-zone concerns, which is creating this
tussle in the market,"" said Judy Moses, a San Francisco-based
portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management.
 She added that seasonal issues related to the end of the
year could be affecting traders.
 ""Managers don't want to show high cash balances after such
a strong year, but at this point, they also want to lock in
gains.""
 At the close of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> fell 19.07 points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,457.47. The
index earlier hit a fresh 52-week intraday high. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, to
1,235.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 10.50

 Some investors say the tax deal, in addition to expected
strong corporate profits, is a reason to hold stocks over the
coming year.
 Another positive element going forward is the supportive
trend in U.S. economic data. On Wednesday, reports showed
November industrial output and consumer inflation, plus
December New York-regional manufacturing data, pointing to an
accelerating recovery.
 European share prices ended lower after Moody's
announcement, ending a two-week rally.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares

closing high. The benchmark Nikkei stock index fell 0.07
percent <.N225>.
 EURO DROP
 The euro fell early in Asian trade on Wednesday but slumped
further as the global trading day came to a close.
 Moody's cited concerns about Spain's mounting debt and 2011
funding needs. The warning included the caveat that while the
Aa1 rating could be cut, Moody's does not expect Madrid to have
to follow Greece and Ireland in requiring a European Union
bailout. [ID;nL3E6NF0D8]
 In late New York action, the euro fell 1.26 percent at
$1.3216. The euro hit an all-time low of 1.2758 against the
Swiss franc on the EBS trading platform  before
clawing back to 1.2790, still down about 0.4 percent.
 The greenback climbed 0.75 percent to 84.26 yen ,
while rising over 1 percent against a basket of currencies of
its major trading partners <.DXY>.
 Even as the euro fell, investors sniffing for a bargain
swooped in and bought Spain's sovereign bonds in a hunt for
yield.
 Spanish government bonds reversed early losses. Ten-year
government bond yields  shot up to a high of 6.43
percent before falling past Tuesday's closing level to 5.48
percent, down 7 basis points for the day.
 ""It's literally a question of people thinking maybe Spain
is too cheap,"" said Huw Worthington, a European fixed income
strategist at Barclays Capital in London. ""People have maybe
cheapened it too much ahead of the auction.""
 Spain holds a 10- and 15-year bond auction on Thursday.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 6/32 of a point in
price, lifting the yield to 3.5 percent . The

56,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2010 05:40PM ET</span>",RPT-ANALYSIS-China's super-hawks come to terms with inflation," * Repeats story issued on Dec 15
 * China showing more tolerance for inflation
 * Structural factors to keep inflation relatively high
 * Harsh tightening still in reserve if inflation surges

 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 15 (Reuters) - China is striding into an era
where higher inflation will become a more permanent feature of
its economic landscape, a shift that the government, long
assumed to have zero tolerance for rising prices, is showing
signs of accepting.	
 That would be a good thing.	
 A little bit of inflation would go a long way in China,
providing lubricant for reforms from higher wages to more
market-based resource pricing that are essential to
restructuring the economy along consumption-driven lines.	
 But the ride will be bumpy, testing the government's nerve
and its ability to leave room for prices to rise while still
anchoring inflationary expectations.	
 ""This is not a crisis situation that requires bringing the
big guns out,"" said Andy Rothman, China macro economist with
CLSA in Shanghai.	
 
 ""We will have slightly higher structural inflation in the
next few years than we have had recently, but not dramatically
higher,"" Rothman said, noting that increasing labour, energy
and land costs would keep prices on an upward trend.	
 Chinese consumer prices rose 5.1 percent in the year to
November, a 28-month high. Though well below an 8.7 percent
peak in 2008 during the country's last bout with inflation,
the pace of increase is well above the 1.9 percent rate
averaged over the past decade.	
 
 RISING TOLERANCE	
 Inflation touches a raw nerve in Beijing. A trigger of
unrest throughout China's history, rising prices added to
discontent in widespread anti-government protests in 1989.	
 That sensitivity has led to steadfast hawkishness on
prices and, as an offshoot, inflation regularly running below
the 4-5 percent rate common in developing countries.	
 But evidence has accumulated in recent days that Beijing
is more relaxed -- or at least less panicked -- than in the
past.	
 First, the government has held off increasing interest
rates since October, despite a jump in inflation that many
analysts thought would trigger an automatic interest rate rise.	
 Second, it has raised next year's inflation target to 4
percent from this year's 3 percent. This in part is a
realistic outlook based on price trends, but it is also an
indication of what policymakers see as the ""new normal"", in
the words of Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch.	
 Third, official media has worked to counter expectations
of aggressive policy actions.	
 ""No comprehensive tightening is needed now"" was the top
economic story on Wednesday in the overseas edition of the
People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's main newspaper.
""Monetary conditions will not be tighter next year"" said the
front-page editorial in the China Securities Journal on the
day of latest upside surprise in inflation data.	
 Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Essence Securities, said
policymakers were aware that the causes of inflation this time
around were different and related to specific issues,
especially higher wages. That was making them wary of raising
interest rates, he said.	
 ""Compared to previous episodes of inflation, the current
one is the first not associated with economic overheating,"" he
said.	
 
 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS	
 Still, the government has certainly not been complacent.
It has raised banks' required reserves six times to a record
high and has also steered lending growth back on a path
towards the country's long-run average below 20 percent.	
 An open question, though, is whether this mix of medicine
stems from a careful diagnosis or simply indecision.	
 Fan Gang, a former adviser to the central bank, believes
it is the former.	
 ""We need controls that are targeted at excess liquidity,""
Fan said in the People's Daily on Wednesday. Quantitative
measures, not interest rates, are the right tools, he said.	
 Gao is not so certain.	
 ""They are wavering and haven't made up their minds. The
tone creates enough room for manoeuvre for next year,"" he said.	
 In other words, the softly, softly approach to tightening
may be a passing phase. It could yet morph into harsher
tactics if the expected slowdown in inflation in the coming
months does not materialise, said Ken Peng, a Citigroup
economist in Beijing.	
 ""This is the policy thinking at the moment. It will remain
the policy thinking until we have another surge in inflation,""
he said.

 (Updates prices, adds quote)
 NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply on
Wednesday after Moody's said it may downgrade Spain's debt
rating and investors awaited more news on how policymakers will
resolve the eurozone's fiscal crisis.
 The Moody's report, saying the ratings agency placed
Spain's Aa1 ratings on review for a possible downgrade, was a
reminder that fiscal problems in Europe are far from over. For
details, see [ID:nL3E6NF0D8]
 The negative news from ratings agency Moody contributed to
the euro's biggest one-day fall in percentage terms since late
November.
 The U.S. dollar ended higher, bolstered by U.S. data
showing rising industrial production in November. Consumer
price inflation remained subdued also supporting the Federal
Reserve's quantitative easing policy.
 ""Going forward, we certainly think the pressure on the euro
will be lower. Sharp declines in the currency would be
event-dependent,"" said Aroop Chatterjee, chief FX quant
strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.
 ""But the potential for sharp declines is higher than for
any meaningful appreciation,"" Chatterjee said.
 The increase in the pace of European Central Bank buying of
peripheral bonds helped stabilize the euro recently, but
Chatterjee said the additional purchases were not enough.
 Overall, the Barclays team expects the euro to fall to
$1.28 over the next three months, before recovering.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 1.29
percent against the dollar at $1.3227 , off an earlier
low of $1.3211 on Reuters data and $1.3210 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 Traders said the euro's bias was neutral, although a push
higher is a possibility as long as the $1.3164 support -- the
December 9 low on trading platform EBS -- holds. On the other
hand, a break above $1.3496 will cement the case that the fall
from $1.4283 -- the November high -- is complete.
 The euro edged 0.3 percent lower against the Swiss franc to
1.2802 francs , having hit a record low of 1.2758
on trading platform EBS in the wake of the Moody's news on
Spain.
 The franc gained as worries about debt problems in some
European countries encouraged investors to reduce exposure to
riskier euro zone assets and seek safer alternatives.
 Contributing to the euro's fall, the dollar firmed after
mostly upbeat economic data lifted U.S. bond yields, enhancing
the appeal of some dollar-denominated assets. [ID:N15127066]

 * Talks on track to conclude by end 2011
 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Free trade negotiations between
Canada and the EU are more ambitious than most such talks,
particularly when tackling sensitive sectors that each side
wants to protect, Canadian Trade Minister Peter Van Loan said
on Wednesday.
 Van Loan and European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De
Gucht said they had agreed in a stock-taking exercise that,
after five rounds of talks, there was enough common ground to
justify continuing the process. The next round is set for
January in Brussels.
 The officials would not say how they plan to resolve some
of the thornier issues not yet discussed, which include
agricultural subsidies and procurements.
 But in an interview with Reuters, Van Loan said the way
officials were dealing with sensitive areas is what would set
this deal apart from other, more conventional ones.
 ""This has been fairly conventional negotiating with one
exception ... Where we have run into difficult issues, on many
of them the approach on both sides has been, instead of being
less ambitious, we've said let's try and be more ambitious,""
Van Loan said.
 ""That's why I say this will be the broadest trade agreement
we've ever entered into.""
 The two sides aim to strike a deal by the end of 2011 that
they say would generate extra annual income of about 11 billion
euros ($14.2 billion) for the EU and 8 billion euros for
Canada.
 Although two-way trade is relatively small, a deal with the
EU would be a major breakthrough for Canada as it seeks to
diversify markets in the face of weaker U.S. demand for its
exports. It has also begun free trade talks with India, with a
second round of negotiations scheduled for March.
 CRITICS FEARFUL
 Critics have speculated that the Conservative government
might cede too much control to clinch a far-reaching deal such
as opening up sensitive industries to more foreign investment,
or giving European companies too much access to prized public
works contracts.
 Van Loan would not respond to those allegations, but said
one side effect of a deal could be the elimination of
interprovincial trade barriers in Canada.
 He said warnings about loss of sovereignty voiced by
anti-free trade groups were not believable as the groups had
made the same dire predictions when Canada joined the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.
 ""When you go down the scenarios of doom that they painted,
none of those negative consequences came to pass with the
United States, the biggest economy in the world right next door
to us.""
 For its part, Canada has vowed to keep intact its supply
management system, which protects farm industries through a
system of quotas and tariffs.
 Another challenge is public procurement contracts offered
by Canadian provinces, which have traditionally been reluctant
to open this market up to outsiders.
 When asked about the EU approach to procurement, De Gucht
said in a separate Reuters interview: ""We are trying to make
away with obstacles. That's what I'm supposed to do -- to
resolve problems that exist.""
 The Canadian provinces are directly involved in the
negotiations, and Van Loan said they are ""on side"" with the
federal government.

 * Options investors continue to buy dollar calls
(Updates prices, adds quote)
 NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday
after Moody's said it may downgrade Spain's debt rating, but
losses were contained as investors await more developments
about how policymakers will resolve the region's fiscal
crisis.
 Analysts said the Moody's news, while clearly negative for
the euro, did not add anything new to the debate on the euro
zone's financial woes.
 The dollar rose, bolstered by U.S. data showing a steady
recovery in New York state's manufacturing sector. A somewhat
soft U.S. consumer price index, while supportive of the Federal
Reserve's quantitative easing and dollar-negative, did not
alter the view that the economy is growing modestly.
 That left investors focusing more on contagion risks from
the euro zone debt crisis. The Moody's report, saying the
ratings agency placed Spain's Aa1 ratings on review for a
possible downgrade, was a reminder that fiscal problems in
Europe are far from over. For details, see [ID:nL3E6NF0D8]
 ""Going forward, we certainly think the pressure on the euro
will be lower. Sharp declines in the currency would be
event-dependent,"" said Aroop Chatterjee, chief FX quant
strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.
 ""But the potential for sharp declines is higher than for
any meaningful appreciation,"" Chatterjee said.
 The increase in the pace of European Central Bank buying of
peripheral bonds helped stabilize the euro recently, but
Chatterjee said the additional purchases were not enough.
 Overall, the Barclays team expects the euro to fall to
$1.28 over the next three months, before recovering.
 In midafternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.9
percent against the dollar at $1.3259 , off an earlier
low of $1.3253 on Reuters data.
 Traders said the euro's bias was neutral, although a push
higher is a possibility as long as the $1.3164 support -- the
Dec. 9 low on trading platform EBS -- holds. On the other hand,
a break above $1.3496 will cement the case that the fall from
$1.4283 -- the November high -- is complete.
 The euro edged 0.2 percent lower against the Swiss franc to
1.2812 francs , having hit a record low of 1.2758
on trading platform EBS in the wake of the Moody's news on
Spain.
 The franc gained as worries about debt problems in some
European countries encouraged investors to reduce exposure to
riskier euro zone assets and seek safer alternatives.
 Contributing to the euro's fall, the dollar firmed after
mostly upbeat economic data lifted U.S. bond yields, enhancing
the appeal of some dollar-denominated assets. [ID:N15127066]

above 3.50 percent in Asian trade, helped by above-forecast
U.S. retail sales data. [ID:nN14261708] In New York trade,
10-year yields edged lower from that high to 3.48 percent.

 ""The (U.S.) data doesn't really change expectations that
the economy is improving gradually and because it hasn't really
surprised in either direction, it ... allows the market to
revert back to what it's most comfortable with,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange
in Washington.
 EU heads of state and government meet on Thursday and
Friday to discuss the region's spreading debt crisis, but
expectations of meaningful progress are low.
 The dollar also gained 0.7 percent against the Japanese yen
to 84.23 yen  on electronic trading platform EBS.
 In the options market, traders cited strong buying of U.S.
dollar calls -- a bet of further currency appreciation --
against the yen, sterling, and euro.

 * Deal could be signed in first half of 2011 - EU
 * Talks on Doha round have been stalled for two years
 By David Ljunggren
 OTTAWA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The European Union's top trade
official said on Wednesday there was a real chance that a
global trade deal could be reached next year, but only if
politicians showed enough will to push it through.
 The head of the World Trade Organization is trying hard to
revive long-running talks on the so-called Doha Round of trade
talks, which collapsed in 2008. Leaders of the G20 and APEC
economic groups want the round finished next year.
 ""The window of opportunity is limited and is probably
(restricted) to the first half of next year. The idea that we
could start from scratch and have an additional two, three or
four years is not realistic,"" European Union Trade Commissioner
Karel De Gucht told Reuters in an interview.
 ""I think that for the first time since 2008, when the
negotiations collapsed in Geneva, there is a serious chance
that we can come to an agreement. Whether it will materialize
entirely depends upon the politicians,"" De Gucht said.
 The Doha round -- beset by a series of delays -- was
launched nine years ago to free up global commerce and help
poor countries prosper through increased trade.
 The talks have been stuck for two years on a U.S. demand
that that major developing countries such as China, India and
Brazil do more to open their markets. Emerging countries say
they have already done enough.
 De Gucht noted that some developing countries had made
significant economic advances since the Doha round started in
2001 and were now serious competitors.
 ""That balance will have to be adapted compared to what the
original mindset in 2001 was and that's about political will,""
he said after meeting Canadian Trade Minister Peter Van Loan.
 Speaking in a separate interview with Reuters, Van Loan
said he had some sympathy for the U.S. position that the Doha
Round needed to be reworked to take into account the newfound
power of China and others.
 ""China was a far less significant economic power. India and
Brazil were far less economically advanced ... As that economic
balance has shifted there is more argument that there has to be
more in the agreement for countries like the United States,
like Canada,"" he said.
 Van Loan added that Canada felt there was ""some
possibility"" a Doha deal could be struck next year. He spoke
after meeting De Gucht to discuss talks on a free trade deal
between Canada and the European Union.

 By Daniel Bases and Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday
after Moody's warned it could downgrade Spain's credit, but
investors, sniffing for a bargain, swooped in and bought the
country's sovereign bonds in a hunt for yield.
 European share prices ended lower after Moody's
announcement, ending a two-week rally, while Wall Street was
little changed after early gains on upbeat U.S. economic data.
 Precious metals prices came under pressure as the U.S.
dollar rose. Oil gained following an unexpectedly large drop in
U.S. inventories. For details see [ID:nL3E6NF09K]
 U.S. Treasuries saw their early flight-to-safety buying
momentum wane, but the 10-year benchmark note held modest gains
while the 30-year bond lost more than half a point.
 Spanish government bonds reversed early losses. The 10-year
government bond yields  shot up to a high of 6.43
percent before falling past Tuesday's closing level to 5.48
percent, down 7 basis points for the day.
 ""It's literally a question of people thinking maybe Spain
is too cheap,"" said Huw Worthington, a European fixed income
strategist at Barclays Capital in London. ""People have maybe
cheapened it too much ahead of the auction.""
 Spain will hold a 10- and 15-year bond auction on
Thursday.
 The euro fell to a record low against the Swiss franc of
1.2758 francs on the EBS trading platform before recouping to
1.2787 , off 0.4 percent.
 Against the dollar the euro fell 0.91 percent at $1.3262
. The greenback rose 0.49 percent to 84.04 against the
yen . Against major currencies the U.S. dollar was up

funding needs. The decision included the caveat that while the

government debt where a recent selloff made yields more
attractive. [ID:nN15122981]
 ""The CPI was friendly for bonds,"" said David Ader, senior
government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group in Stamford,
Connecticut, referring to the Consumer Price Index.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded up 10/32 in price,
pushing the yield down to 3.45 percent. Buyers appeared as
yields hit a seven-month high of 3.50 percent . The
30-year bond however was off 18/32 of a point in price,
yielding 4.57 percent .

 U.S. stocks rose early on economic data.
 ""The economic numbers are giving us this upside, but I want
to see how we end today. If we roll over today, that would say
to me we're probably going to plod through to the end of the

(Adds details, background)
 BERLIN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Previous EU summit decisions have
given markets cause for turmoil, euro zone finance ministers'
chairman Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted as saying, urging EU
politicians to worry less about appealing to domestic audiences.
 ""Unfortunately there are dissonances in public,"" Juncker was

 Governments ""should suppress the reflex to ask before each

 The newspaper also quoted Juncker as saying EU summit
decisions had ""given cause for market turbulences"".
 It said Juncker would raise the topic of joint euro zone
bonds at an EU meeting on Thursday and Friday but did not expect
a decision on them.
 Germany opposes the proposal, which would seek to use its
high credit standing to raise funds jointly with weaker euro
zone economies such as Portugal and Greece.
 EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for their
end-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome the region's

 As well as approving a change to the EU's treaty demanded by

73,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2010 12:04PM ET</span>",EU plans to tackle unwanted impacts of biofuels," * EU biofuel probe confirms some negative impact - officials
 * EU's Oettinger: indirect effects are a ""concrete danger""
 * Oettinger: science unclear, more studies due by July 2011
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A year-long European Union
investigation into biofuels has concluded that their green
credentials might be partly compromised by indirect
side-effects, which should be tackled, EU officials said.
 The multi-billion-dollar industry fears barriers will be
further raised against unsustainable biofuels from food, but the
long-awaited European Commission report, due next week, will
stop short of proposing any new actions.
 Instead, it will recommend six months more of studies.
 The report follows a one-year internal battle among experts
within the Commission, which has thrown into doubt EU plans to
create a $17-billion-a-year market for biofuels from producers
such as France, Germany, Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia.
 Investment in European biofuels has slowed to a halt due to
doubts over the sector's green credentials and the challenging
investment climate.
 ""Now we should realise security on sustainability and
security for investors in the EU fuel and transport sectors and
for countries of production,"" EU Energy Commissioner Guenther
Oettinger said when asked by Reuters about the report.
 
 CONCRETE DANGER
 Recent uncertainty over investments has largely been caused
by a new concept known as ""indirect land-use change"" (ILUC).
 In essence, that means that if you take a field of grain and
switch the crop to biofuel, somebody, somewhere, will go hungry
unless those missing tonnes of grain are grown elsewhere.
 The crops to make up the shortfall could come from anywhere,
and economics often dictate that will be in tropical zones,
encouraging farmers to hack out new land from fertile forests.
 Burning forests to clear that land can pump vast quantities
of climate-warming emissions into the atmosphere, enough, in
theory, to cancel out any of the climate benefits the biofuels
were meant to bring.
 ""Indirect land use (change) is a concrete danger,"" Oettinger
said. ""It's a normal economic process that acres with
agriculture will be used as acres for production of biofuels.""
 ""There's a danger that deforestation follows,"" he added.
""It's in our interest to have an instrument to avoid this
process.""
 The Commission has run 15 studies on different biofuel
crops, which on average conclude that over the next decade
Europe's biofuels policies might have an indirect impact equal
to 4.5 million hectares of land -- an area the size of Denmark.
 If that was gained by clearing wild land, as economics often
dictate, it could result in a one-off release of at least 200
million tonnes of carbon -- about the same as the annual
fossil-fuel emissions of Germany, according to Reuters
calculations.
 
 LAST STEP
 Environment campaigners and many politicians want some kind
of disincentive applied to biofuels from food crops to reflect
that impact.
 Industry argues the science is flawed and that the issue
could be tackled by a major overhaul of agricultural strategy to
improve productivity. But mostly it is eager for some sort of
clarity by which to plan its investments.
 Oettinger said the science was still very uncertain.
 ""It's very difficult to have a detailed balance of this
process acre-by-acre,"" he said. ""We need more time to come up
with the best proposal.""
 He did not reveal his options for tackling ILUC.
 One EU source said the Commission would look at various
options, including raising the greenhouse gas savings threshold
for biofuels that can be counted towards the EU's goal of
getting 10 percent of road fuels from renewable sources by 2020.
 Other options include a penalty factor for biofuels with a
high ILUC impact, or additional ""sustainability criteria"" to
reduce that impact.
 ""The last step will be a proposal from (climate
commissioner) Connie Hedegaard and myself, in July next year,
before the summer break,"" said Oettinger.

 NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Investors sold the euro to

Investors Service gave a warning on Spain's credit rating.
 In European stocks a two-week rally came to a halt on the

 OTTAWA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Canada and the European Union
pledged on Wednesday to push ahead with comprehensive trade
negotiations, but declined to comment on how they planned to
resolve the most sensitive issue still on the table.
 Canadian Trade Minister Peter Van Loan and European Union
Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht agreed in a ""stock-taking
exercise"" that, after five rounds of talks, there was enough
common ground to justify continuing, with the next round set
for January in Brussels.
 ""The commissioner and I are satisfied with the substantial
progress that has been made in these negotiations,"" Van Loan
told reporters in a joint press conference following a
bilateral meeting in Ottawa.
 Both sides said the negotiations were ahead of schedule.
But neither men would provide details on the thorniest issues
yet to be negotiated, including agricultural subsidies and
procurement for public works projects.
 The two sides estimate that a deal would, within seven
years, generate additional annual income of about 11 billion
euros ($14.2 billion) for the EU and 8 billion euros for
Canada.
 A trade deal with the EU would be a major breakthrough for
Canada, which has been hurt by weak U.S. demand for its exports
and is pursuing other free trade deals -- including one with
India -- to diversify its markets.

(Updates with more details, reaction)
 By Doug Palmer and Paul Eckert
 WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese
officials said on Wednesday they had made progress on beef,
software and other bilateral trade irritants, reducing some
friction ahead of a presidential summit next month.
 ""The understandings that we reached today will help to
protect American jobs and bolster America's competitiveness and
help to grow our economy,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said at the conclusion of two days of talks.
 Beef exporters hailed Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan's
statement that China, in accordance with scientific principles
and quarantine standards, would ""resume the imports of American
beef, both deboned and bone-in, under the age of 30 months.""
 Its market has been closed to U.S. beef since 2003, when
the first case of mad cow disease was found in the United
States. But some other countries, including South Korea,
already buy U.S. beef with the 30-month age limit.
 Reopening the Chinese market could mean ""about $200 million
in annual beef business,"" said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the
U.S. Meat Export Federation.
 U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said a U.S. team
would travel to China in early January for technical talks on a
staged reintroduction of U.S. beef into the market.
 He also welcomed a Chinese decision to lift a ban on
poultry from in Idaho and Kentucky, also imposed because of
disease concerns.
 The announcements came at the conclusion of the 21st
U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, an annual
bilateral forum to resolve trade irritants.
 US EXPECTS CONCRETE RESULTS
 Wang also promised China will actively fight copyright
piracy by promoting greater use of legal software, and will
submit a revised offer to join the World Trade Organization's
government procurement pact, he said.
 ""We expect to see concrete and measurable results on issues
like intellectual property rights, including increased
purchases and use of legal software in China,"" Kirk said.
 The two sides signed seven agreements, including one to
promote cooperation and information sharing regarding Chinese
investment in the United States.
 Other pacts covered inspection and quarantine procedures
for soybeans, energy grid standards, water monitoring and trade
development programs.
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said he expected
further, broad trade deals when Chinese President Hu Jintao
comes to Washington in January.
 Some U.S. industry officials expect Hu to be accompanied by
a large delegation of Chinese businesses announcing purchases
of U.S. goods potentially worth tens of billions of dollars.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the meeting yielded
progress on several of their concerns, but urged the two
governments to agree on ""metrics"" to measure results.
 ""We note that today's promises must be measured not by
words on paper, but by tangible progress on the ground,"" said
Myron Brilliant, the business group's vice president for
international affairs.
 U.S. officials welcomed a pledge that Chinese government
procurement decisions would not discriminate against products
containing intellectual property developed outside of China.
 That addressed one major concern about China's ""indigenous
innovation"" policies, the U.S. officials said.
 BILATERAL INVESTMENT PACT
 The two sides also agreed to take steps to promote
bilateral investment. That's a priority for China, whose
companies' attempts to invest in the United States have
sometimes been challenged on national security grounds.
 ""Chinese businesses are very confident about investing in
the United States"" and would like the two countries to complete
work on a bilateral investment pact to establish clearer ground
rules, said Chin's Commerce Minister Chen Deming.
 The United States also agreed to consider accelerating
talks on China's desire to be designated a market economy under
U.S. trade law, Wang said. Beijing believes that would lead to
more favorable treatment in anti-dumping cases brought by U.S.
companies against Chinese imports.
 U.S. officials promised to consider China's interest in
importing more high-technology products from the United States
as the Obama administration continues its reform of national
security export controls, Wang said.
 A major irritant -- U.S. concerns about China's
""undervalued"" yuan currency -- was not on the official agenda
for this week's meeting but lurked in the background.
 Wang met on Tuesday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, who has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to push
China to let its currency rise more quickly in value as part of
an effort to reduce global trade imbalances.
 An effort in the U.S. Senate to pass legislation to
pressure China to allow a faster appreciation of the yuan
fizzled this week. That likely killed the effort for this year,
although supporters may mount an uphill effort to attach the
measure to other legislation before Congress adjourns.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly, hitting
a record low versus the Swiss franc on Wednesday, after Moody's
said it may downgrade Spain's debt rating, but losses may be
contained as liquidity thins going into the holiday season.
 The dollar, on the other hand, rose, bolstered by U.S. data
showing a steady recovery in the New York state's manufacturing
sector. A somewhat soft U.S. consumer price index, while
supportive of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, did
not alter the view that the economy is growing modestly.
 Investors on Wednesday, however, focused more on contagion
risks from the euro zone debt crisis. The Moody's news, saying
the ratings agency placed Spain's Aa1 ratings on review for a
possible downgrade, was a reminder that fiscal problems in
Europe are far from over.
 The Moody's report pushed Spanish bond yields higher.
 Still, some analysts suggested investors are less likely to
sell the euro further given that the market has pretty much
priced in most of the bad news on the euro zone. Analysts said
the Moody's news, while clearly negative for the euro, didn't
add anything new to the debate on the region's crisis.
 ""The ratings news had an impact on the euro but there has
been no follow-through,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency
strategist, at RBC Capital in Toronto.
 ""We're starting to see lower liquidity toward the holiday
season and the market right now is unwilling to take the euro
lower. The momentum is not favoring euro losses because of a
lack of conviction.""
 In early New York trading, the euro was down 0.4 percent
against the dollar at $1.3330, off an earlier low of $1.3285
where traders reported sovereign demand for the euro.
 The euro edged 0.2 percent lower against the Swiss franc to
1.2807 francs, having hit a record low of 1.2758 on trading
platform EBS in the wake of the Moody's news on Spain.
 The Swiss currency gained as worries about debt problems in
some European countries encouraged investors to reduce exposure
to riskier euro zone assets and seek safer alternatives.
 Contributing to the euro's fall, the dollar firmed after
mostly upbeat economic data lifted U.S. bond yields, enhancing
the appeal of some dollar-denominated assets.
 ""On balance, the data doesn't really change expectations
that the economy is improving gradually and because it hasn't
really surprised in either direction, it essentially allows the
market to revert back to what it's most comfortable with,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 ""Right now, that's selling the euro on increasing sovereign
credit concerns.""
 The dollar gained 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 79.693, moving away from a three-week low of
78.819 plumbed on Tuesday.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a seven-month high just
above 3.50 percent in Asian trade, helped by above-forecast
U.S. retail sales data.tax cuts would worsen U.S. fiscal
problems even if they help the economy. Traders said that for
some investors this made the Swiss franc a more attractive
safe-haven asset than the dollar.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The European Union will need to
increase the size of its rescue fund in 2011 amid fears it will
be called on again but is unlikely to issue an all-member backed
bond, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Wednesday.
 The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which has
440 billion euros of EU funds, will likely have to be increased
next year, according to three-quarters of analysts polled over
the past week in the run-up to the last EU summit of 2010.
 EU leaders meet on Dec. 16-17 to approve a change in the
union's treaty that should lead to the creation of a permanent
mechanism for handling euro zone financial and debt crises from
mid-2013, replacing the EFSF.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet called on Tuesday for the
16-member bloc to give the rescue fund maximum flexibility in
both size and scope. The Reuters poll predicted the fund would
be increased to 700 billion euros of EU funds.
 ""A near-term solution remains to increase the size of the
EFSF. Allowing the EFSF to purchase government bonds in the
secondary market would also be a powerful tool to fight
contagion,"" said Elwin de Groot at Rabobank.
 Ireland agreed an 85 billion euro bailout deal from the EU
and International Monetary Fund in November to prop up its
battered economy, months after Greece obtained a similar rescue
package.
 Since the Ireland bailout was announced, the European
Central Bank has stepped up its modest government bond purchase
programme, focusing on Ireland and Portugal, to force down
rising yields.
 Portugal will probably need to seek bailout funds from the
European Union, according to a majority of economists in a
Reuters poll taken late last month.
 Like Ireland and Greece, Portugal this year announced vast
budget austerity measures aimed at convincing financial markets
it can deal with its debt burden itself while issuing bonds at
affordable rates.

E-BONDS BLOCKED
 Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and Italian
Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti called earlier this month for a
bond to be jointly issued by euro zone countries but only 10 of
29 analysts in the poll expected to eventually see common bonds.
 Juncker and Tremonti said the joint European sovereign bonds
-- ""E-bonds"" -- would assert the ""irreversibility of the euro"".
 But the plan quickly ran into opposition from Germany,
Europe's biggest economy, which said there were legal and
economic hindrances to the bonds that would require fundamental
changes to the European Union's underlying treaty.
 Germany is also keen to ensure governments are kept under
pressure from bond markets, to avoid a repeat of the years of
easy borrowing that led to Europe's debt crisis.
 ""I do not think we will see common euro zone bonds in the
foreseeable future. Such financial instruments can come to birth
in the future, but after further evolution in the way the
European Union is functioning,"" said Jean-Louis Mourier at
Aurel-BGC.
 Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jean Asselborn, said on
Monday the topic of joint euro zone bonds would not be on the
agenda at this week's EU summit and could be dropped altogether
if leaders move more decisively to defend the euro.

 * ECB to hold rates at 1.0 percent until at least early 2012
 * Inflation seen at 1.7 percent in 2011, 1.8 percent in 2012
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth will be
slow and steady over the coming two years and a subdued outlook
for inflation will give the European Central Bank scant reason
to shift rates from record lows, a Reuters poll showed.
 Forecasts in the poll of over 50 analysts for economic
growth remained virtually unchanged from last month's survey and
the 16-nation bloc is seen growing between 0.3 and 0.5 percent
per quarter through to the end of 2012.
 But the figures mask a growing divergence amongst member
countries, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, powering
ahead of smaller members like Ireland, and even Spain.
 The bloc escaped from its deepest recession in post-war
history in the third quarter of last year after the ECB pumped
billions of euros into the economy through unlimited funding at
money market operations and rock-bottom interest rates.
 The Reuters poll showed growth this year will average 1.7
percent but slow to 1.5 percent in 2011, revised up from 1.4
percent in last month's poll.
 Growth will then pick up to 1.8 percent in 2012, slightly
faster than the 1.7 percent predicted last month.
 ""While the risk of a double dip for the euro zone as a whole
has receded, recessionary conditions are likely to persist in
those economies suffering the after-effects of the excesses of
the pre-crisis era,"" said Ken Wattret at BNP Paribas.
 ""Conditions in the core countries, particularly Germany, are
very different.""
 Ireland agreed an 85 billion euro bailout deal from the
European Union and International Monetary Fund in November,
months after Greece obtained a similar rescue package. A Reuters
poll taken late last month suggested Portugal may be forced to
follow suit.
 The EU will also be compelled to increase the size of its
440 billion euro rescue fund next year, according to
three-quarters of analysts surveyed. The median forecast was for
a need to raise EU funds available to 700 billion.
 
 HOLD ON RATES
 To sustain the modest growth and avoid a double-dip from the
tough austerity measures introduced in member countries the ECB
will keep interest rates at their record low of 1.0 percent
through to early 2012, the poll showed. In last month's poll,
the consensus was for a rate rise in the final months of next
year.
 The poll predicted rates will rise in the first three months
of 2012 to 1.25 percent and then by 25 basis points every
quarter to round off the year at 2.0 percent.
 Inflation, which the central bank aims to keep just below
2.0 percent, is seen averaging 1.6 percent this year, 1.7
percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2012. All three forecasts
have been revised up by 0.1 percentage points from last month.
 That is the highest 2011 consensus inflation expectation
since Reuters began polling on it in January.
 Data due on Thursday are expected to confirm prices rose 1.9
percent last month, in line with October.
 ""It is definitely too early to talk of inflationary
tensions, but it still illustrates the schizophrenic situation
the ECB is now facing when setting monetary policy,"" said Peter
Vanden Houte at ING.

 * White House wants Senate vote, but faces delays
 
 By Conor Humphries
 MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - U.S. politics may again delay
Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation as the White
House struggles to get Congress to repeal Cold War trade rules,
the head of the top U.S. business lobby in Russia said.
 A U.S.-Russia bilateral deal is one of the last hurdles to
Russian membership in the WTO, which sets the parameters for
global trade. Russia, the largest economy outside the WTO, has
said it hopes to join within months.
 But U.S. Republicans trying to claw back the legislative
agenda after mid-term election gains could stall the bilateral
deal by refusing to scrap the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, the
head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow told Reuters.
 ""The administration would like assurances from Congress that
if the president signs the WTO agreement, that Congress will
simultaneously or shortly thereafter... abrogate Jackson-Vanik
as it applies to Russia,"" Andrew Somers said an interview.
 The White House needs Congress to repeal Jackson-Vanik
before Russia joins the WTO, because failure to do so would
prevent U.S. companies from enjoying the Russian tariff
reductions that membership would bring, he said.
 The White House is unlikely to push Jackson-Vanik until
higher priority legislation is passed, such as ratification of
the New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia and other trade
deals, Somers said. Delays to them would delay WTO too, he said.
 Speaking on Tuesday after several days of talks with
administration officials in Washington, he said the White House
appeared quietly confident that the legislative logjam in the
Senate was starting to clear, opening the way for a WTO deal.
 Democrats said on Tuesday that Senate consideration of START
could begin this week, raising the prospect that it could be
ratified during the current ""lame duck"" session, before the
newly elected Congress starts work next month.
 
 GEOPOLITICS TRUMPS TRADE
 But Somers said Republicans may use discussion of
Jackson-Vanik to register broad concerns about Russia given
accusations that President Barack Obama is being too soft on the
Kremlin.
 ""There are several politicians who have said we're going to
make this an issue on Russia, not on the economic issues. Human
rights, threats to neighbours, these kind of issues will be
raised by those who fear Russia. They will try to steer the
debate away from the economics and toward the geopolitics.""
 Jackson-Vanik tied normal trade relations with the Soviet
Union to the right of Jews and other religious minorities to
emigrate freely. Russia has been in compliance since 1994.
 Russia has long railed against the amendment, which Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin last year described as an anachronism
used ""to help solve narrow, selfish ... problems"".
 Somers predicted Jackson-Vanik would be repealed by
mid-2011, with Russia gaining WTO membership late next year.
 But if the U.S. administration fails to dispose of
Jackson-Vanik by next summer, the political equation will start
to change as 2012 presidential elections approach in both Russia
and the United States, shifting priorities.
 The trade issues, which U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said last week were 95 percent solved, are less likely to delay
WTO, Somers said, citing signs that Georgia, a U.S. ally that
could block Russian membership, is more open to a deal.
 The Kremlin, seeking to reduce Russian reliance on natural
resources, says WTO membership would improve access to global
markets for its goods. The World Bank has estimated that Russia,
by entering the WTO, could increase gross domestic product by as
much as 11 percent in the long term.
 But Somers said the main benefit would be a boost to
Russia's image among U.S. investors and multinationals.
 ""It's really more the geopolitics than tariffs. Business in
the U.S. feels that once Russia is in the WTO it will be more
open to world trade, more open to investment,"" he said.
 WTO entry, combined with the Kremlin's drive to modernize
Russia's economy, could double U.S. trade and investment in
Russia over five years, said Somers.
 But the impetus behind the deal for Obama is a
farther-reaching wish to anchor Russia-U.S. relations just as
they have created a foundation for U.S.-China ties, he said.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2010 08:00AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Fuel spikes in Europe unlikely this winter," * First wave of winter fuel buying is over, demand subdued
 * Fuel substitution for gas reduces oil demand elasticity
 * Cold winter legacy could be tighter supplies in 2011
 
 By Emma Farge
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Comfortable stocks and fuel
substitution are likely to prevent price spikes in the European
oil products market this winter but a lasting freeze could still
be a game-changer for global oil supply fundamentals in 2011.
 Temperatures in early December have been unusually low
across the northern hemisphere, with some forecasters predicting
that the cold spell will endure, boosting demand for heating
fuels in the two major demand hubs: Europe and the United
States.
 But while Brent crude prices have rallied over $90 a barrel
this month as an anticipated buying spree for heating fuels has
lifted sentiment, actual demand and refined product prices in
Europe have lagged.
 Gas oil stocks used for heating in the storage hub of
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp have risen for the past seven weeks
to a 15-month high near 3 million tonnes.
 ""Prices went up to $90 a barrel on the expectation of
heating oil demand but product prices haven't really reacted.
They (consumers) don't have to go out and buy yet since stocks
are comfortable,"" said Roy Jordan, analyst at Facts Global
Energy.
 A German buying spurt in early autumn has left stocks above
60 percent of capacity and high enough to cope with any extra
demand since the December cold spell began, traders said.
 ""The Germans don't care about the cold -- they bought back
in September and don't need to buy again until February or
March,"" said one London-based distillates trader.
 Rising refinery runs in both Europe and the United States
after planned maintenance to between 85-90 percent of capacity is
also helping to keep tanks topped up.
 Gas oil refining margins on the IntercontinentalExchange
(ICE) have traded near $11 a barrel for most of the past month
which, although still above last year due largely to the gloal
economic recovery, are still below October highs near $14.
 In another sign of supply comfort, the front month ICE gas
oil contract has moved to a deep discount to more distant
futures contracts in a structure known as contango.
 U.S. heating oil margins have so far this winter been higher
than in Europe at around $15 a barrel after hefty stock draws.
 
 DEMAND EROSION
 Another factor which could cap price rallies in the products
market is a high degree of fuel substition from oil to cheaper,
cleaner natural gas over the past 10 years, analysts said.
 Oil demand elasticity in cold weather has shrunk over the
past ten years and will theoretically rise by a maximum of just
140,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the event of a lasting freeze
compared with 350,000 bpd in previous years, the International
Energy Agency said in its latest monthly report.
 Utilities have switched on normally idle oil power plants
during December's cold spell to feed extra power onto grids, but
the price impact is limited since oil plants now only represent
a tiny portion of European capacity.
 Margins for fuel oil, used in power generation, have hovered
near two-year lows of minus $16 a barrel in December.
 
 STOCK DRAIN
 Still, a consistently cold spell could result in a
significant draw in the European stock overhang, supporting the
entire complex and potentially boosting both crude oil and
product prices next year.
 Germany restocking could again kick in at the start of
spring, traders said.
 ""The cold weather will definitely boost demand, it just
won't do it in a logical way. If we have the cold in December
and January, they (German consumers) may just run down stocks
and buy through February, March, April, May,"" said a products
trader with a European bank.
 The legacy of last winter -- one of the longest and coldest
on record in Europe -- was a sharp drop in distillates held in
floating storage from an all-time peak of 100 million barrels.
Distillates held in floating storage have fallen dramatically
over the past year, with about 20 million barrels left globally.
 ""If stockpiles start from a lower level (next year), then
there is less of a cushion if demand picks up more than expected
or if there is some supply-related disruption, making prices
more volatile and with risks to the upside,"" said Carsten
Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank.
 Record Chinese demand for diesel at 9.3 million bpd in
November -- could drag more flows from Europe and erode stocks
further in 2011, he added.

 * Euro debt worries lift Swiss franc to record vs euro
 * Dollar gains ground as Treasury yields rise

(Updates prices, adds detail)
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar
and hit a record low versus the Swiss franc on Wednesday after
Moody's said it may downgrade Spain's debt rating, refocusing
attention on contagion risks from the euro zone crisis.
 The Swiss currency gained as worries about debt problems in
some European countries encouraged investors to reduce exposure
to riskier euro zone assets and seek safer alternatives.
 Moody's put Spain's Aa1 ratings on review for a possible
downgrade, citing concerns about its mounting debt and 2011
funding needs, though it did not believe Spain would need an EU
bailout, as Greece and Ireland have.
 Contributing to the euro's fall, the dollar firmed after
upbeat economic data lifted U.S. bond yields, enhancing the
appeal of U.S. assets.
 Concerns lingered, however, that U.S. fiscal problems could
worsen due to a proposed extension to tax cuts even if the move
helps the economy. Traders said that for some investors this
made the Swiss franc a more attractive safe-haven asset than the
dollar.
 ""The U.S. story is still very important, and the extension
of the Bush tax cuts has enhanced the Swiss franc's safe haven
status,"" said Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in
Milan.
 He said the Moody's statement had weighed on the euro, but
that the euro was also weakening due to portfolio rebalancing
and investors reducing risks ahead of the end of the year.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.3351,
off an earlier low of $1.3285 where traders reported sovereign
demand for the single currency.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at 1.2814 Swiss francs, having
hit a record low of 1.2758 on trading platform EBS.
 The Moody's report on Spain pushed Spanish bond yields
higher.
 The focus is likely to remain on debt problems in the euro
zone periphery, with a Portuguese debt auction on Wednesday
showing yields rising, while Ireland's parliament is due to vote
on an 85 billion euro EU/IMF rescue package later in the day.
 ""There is an unwillingness among investors to hold riskier
euro zone bonds over the year end so they are selling and going
into Swiss francs,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at SEB
in Stockholm.
 He added that financial markets had not priced in the risk
of Spain needing financial aid, which left plenty of scope for
further falls in euro/dollar in the first half of 2011.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar gained 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 79.530, moving away from a three-week low of
78.819 plumbed on Tuesday.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a seven-month high just
above 3.50 percent in Asian trade, helped by above-forecast U.S.
retail sales data.
 The Federal Reserve reaffirmed after a policy meeting on
Tuesday its commitment to buy $600 billion in bonds as it
attempts to boost the economy.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 83.82 yen while the
higher-yielding Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to $0.9928,
hurt by risk aversion as stocks and commodity prices fell.
 U.S. data on Wednesday includes November consumer prices and
industrial output.

 * Painful for manufacturers initially
 * Will take years to catch up on competitiveness
 
 By Toni Vorobyova and Conor Humphries
 MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Russia's long-awaited WTO entry
is set to boost investor sentiment but also push domestic
manufacturers into a painful struggle to shape up against global
competition that could take them years.
 After 17 years of talks, Moscow hopes to join the World
Trade Organisation next year, having resolved key bilateral
issues with the United States and the European Union.
 The accession -- coupled with Russia winning the right to
host the 2018 soccer World Cup last month -- should help boost
investor confidence, enticing in foreign cash and know-how.
 ""The sentiment-related boost is going to be felt in terms of
capital inflows, which ultimately will benefit the equities
market, the rouble, the bond market,"" said Ivan Tchakarov, chief
Russia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 ""It is going to be more sentiment-related positives rather
than real changes, which will be felt in the medium term.""
 With the consumer sector back on track after a recession,
WTO approval should pave the way for investors to follow in the
steps of PepsiCo which last month bought juice and dairy maker
Wimm-Bill-Dann in the biggest foreign acquisition in Russia
outside the energy sector.
 ""Business in the U.S. feels that once Russia is in the WTO
it will be more open to world trade, more open to investment,""
said Andrew Somers, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Russia, who reckons that WTO entry and the Kremlin's
modernisation drive could double bilateral trade and investment
in five years.
 President Dmitry Medvedev wants foreign investors to help
modernise the economy and reduce the dependence on energy that
left Russia more vulnerable to the global crisis than its peers.
 France's Renault and Germany's Daimler are already at the
forefront of revitalising the car industry.
 But much remains to be done -- including by the government,
to make foreign investors feel more secure about sharing capital
and expertise -- and it will likely be years before some
domestic goods can compete against imports that are expected to
flood in with renewed force once Russia lowers tariffs on
joining the WTO.
 ""Seven years is the minimum timeframe necessary for our
carmakers to adjust to the reduction on import tariffs and the
increased competition from abroad,"" said Yaroslav Lissovolik,
chief strategist for Russia at Deutsche Bank.
 
 OUTDATED
 Russia ranks 63rd out of 139 countries in terms of
competitiveness, according to the World Economic Forum. That
puts it well behind both developed nations and emerging market
peers Brazil, India and China, which ranks 27th.
 Drags on Russia's overall rank include outdated technology,
underdeveloped financial markets and the state of institutions,
as well as the performance of the companies themselves.
 ""A combination of an overvalued real exchange rate, outdated
capital stock and inept management means that it (Russia's
manufacturing sector) is, for the most part at least,
uncompetitive,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
 Natural resources, whose exports are not generally covered
by WTO rules, accounted for some 68 percent of Russia's exports
in January-September, official data shows.
 Of the small selection of exported manufactured goods --
such as cloth, cars and machinery -- around three-quarters is
sold to the countries of the former Soviet Union.
 ""The first effect could even be negative, as opposed to
other countries, where manufactured goods dominate in the export
structure,"" said Julia Tsepliaeva, chief economist for Russia
and CIS at BNP Paribas. ""Competition on the domestic market
(from imports) will increase.""
 The World Bank estimates WTO entry could increase Russia's
gross domestic product by 3.3 percent in the medium term and 11
percent in the long term -- once industry has adjusted.
 To fully capitalise on the benefits, Russia would need to
cement the sentiment boost with more foreigner-friendly policies
and reduced corruption -- reform which could take years.
 ""WTO accession in itself is less likely to significantly
boost FDI unless it acts as an anchor for deeper reforms to
clean up the business environment and strengthen property
rights,"" Capital Economics said.

 * Structural factors to keep inflation relatively high
 * Harsh tightening still in reserve if inflation surges

 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 15 (Reuters) - China is striding into an era
where higher inflation will become a more permanent feature of
its economic landscape, a shift that the government, long
assumed to have zero tolerance for rising prices, is showing
signs of accepting.	
 That would be a good thing.	
 A little bit of inflation would go a long way in China,
providing lubricant for reforms from higher wages to more
market-based resource pricing that are essential to
restructuring the economy along consumption-driven lines.	
 But the ride will be bumpy, testing the government's nerve
and its ability to leave room for prices to rise while still
anchoring inflationary expectations.	
 ""This is not a crisis situation that requires bringing the
big guns out,"" said Andy Rothman, China macro economist with
CLSA in Shanghai.	
 
 ""We will have slightly higher structural inflation in the
next few years than we have had recently, but not dramatically
higher,"" Rothman said, noting that increasing labour, energy
and land costs would keep prices on an upward trend.	
 Chinese consumer prices rose 5.1 percent in the year to
November, a 28-month high. Though well below an 8.7 percent
peak in 2008 during the country's last bout with inflation,
the pace of increase is well above the 1.9 percent rate
averaged over the past decade.	
 
 RISING TOLERANCE	
 Inflation touches a raw nerve in Beijing. A trigger of
unrest throughout China's history, rising prices added to
discontent in widespread anti-government protests in 1989.	
 That sensitivity has led to steadfast hawkishness on
prices and, as an offshoot, inflation regularly running below
the 4-5 percent rate common in developing countries.	
 But evidence has accumulated in recent days that Beijing
is more relaxed -- or at least less panicked -- than in the
past.	
 First, the government has held off increasing interest
rates since October, despite a jump in inflation that many
analysts thought would trigger an automatic interest rate rise.	
 Second, it has raised next year's inflation target to 4
percent from this year's 3 percent. This in part is a
realistic outlook based on price trends, but it is also an
indication of what policymakers see as the ""new normal"", in
the words of Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch.	
 Third, official media has worked to counter expectations
of aggressive policy actions.	
 ""No comprehensive tightening is needed now"" was the top
economic story on Wednesday in the overseas edition of the
People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's main newspaper.
""Monetary conditions will not be tighter next year"" said the
front-page editorial in the China Securities Journal on the
day of latest upside surprise in inflation data.	
 Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Essence Securities, said
policymakers were aware that the causes of inflation this time
around were different and related to specific issues,
especially higher wages. That was making them wary of raising
interest rates, he said.	
 ""Compared to previous episodes of inflation, the current
one is the first not associated with economic overheating,"" he
said.	
 
 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS	
 Still, the government has certainly not been complacent.
It has raised banks' required reserves six times to a record
high and has also steered lending growth back on a path
towards the country's long-run average below 20 percent.	
 An open question, though, is whether this mix of medicine
stems from a careful diagnosis or simply indecision.	
 Fan Gang, a former adviser to the central bank, believes
it is the former.	
 ""We need controls that are targeted at excess liquidity,""
Fan said in the People's Daily on Wednesday. Quantitative
measures, not interest rates, are the right tools, he said.	
 Gao is not so certain.	
 ""They are wavering and haven't made up their minds. The
tone creates enough room for manoeuvre for next year,"" he said.	
 In other words, the softly, softly approach to tightening
may be a passing phase. It could yet morph into harsher
tactics if the expected slowdown in inflation in the coming
months does not materialise, said Ken Peng, a Citigroup
economist in Beijing.	
 ""This is the policy thinking at the moment. It will remain
the policy thinking until we have another surge in inflation,""
he said.

 * Euro debt worries lift Swiss franc to record vs euro
 * Dollar gains ground as Treasury yields rise
 
 (Updates prices, adds quote)
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar
and hit a record low versus the Swiss franc on Wednesday after
Moody's said it may downgrade Spain's debt rating, refocusing
attention on contagion risks from the euro zone crisis.
 The Swiss currency gained as worries about debt problems in
some European countries encouraged investors to reduce exposure
to riskier euro zone assets and seek safer alternatives.
 Moody's put Spain's Aa1 ratings on review for a possible
downgrade, citing concerns about its mounting debt and 2011
funding needs, though it did not believe Spain would need an EU
bailout, as Greece and Ireland have.
 Contributing to the euro's fall, the dollar rose broadly
after upbeat economic data lifted U.S. bond yields, enhancing
the appeal of U.S. assets.
 Concerns lingered, however, that a proposed extension to tax
cuts would worsen U.S. fiscal problems even if they help the
economy. Traders said that for some investors this made the
Swiss franc a more attractive safe-haven asset than the dollar.
 ""The U.S. story is still very important, and the extension
of the Bush tax cuts has enhanced the Swiss franc's safe haven
status,"" said Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in
Milan.
 He said the Moody's statement had weighed on the euro, but
that the euro was also weakening due to portfolio rebalancing
and investors reducing risks ahead of the year end.
 The euro was down 0.6 percent against the dollar at $1.3303
, two cents below a high of $1.3500 touched on Tuesday.
 Chartists said that if the euro could hold above support in
a band above $1.3280, it could re-test $1.3500. But if that
support band gave way, the euro was likely to slip into a
$1.3165-1.3500 range before testing its November low at $1.2969.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at 1.2799 Swiss francs, having
hit a record low of 1.2761.
 The Moody's report on Spain pushed Spanish bond yields
higher.
 The focus is likely to remain on debt problems in the euro
zone periphery, with Ireland's parliament due to vote on an 85
billion euro EU/IMF rescue package on Wednesday, a debt auction
in Portugal and a planned strike in Greece.
 ""There is an unwillingness among investors to hold riskier
euro zone bonds over the year end so they are selling and going
into Swiss francs,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at SEB
in Stockholm.
 He added that financial markets had not priced in the risk
of Spain needing financial aid, which left plenty of scope for
further falls in euro/dollar in the first half of 2011.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar gained 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 79.783, climbing above a three-week low of 78.819
plumbed on Tuesday.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a seven-month high just
above 3.50 percent in Asian trade, helped by above-forecast U.S.
retail sales data.
 The Federal Reserve reaffirmed after a policy meeting on
Tuesday its commitment to buy $600 billion in bonds as it
attempts to boost the economy.
 ""A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields is spurring
short-covering in the dollar,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX
spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank in Tokyo. 
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 84.01 yen, although
resistance was expected ahead of 84.50 yen. Support was pegged
around 82.50. The higher-yielding Australian dollar fell 0.8
percent to $0.9912, hurt by risk aversion as stocks and
commodity prices fell.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2010 06:32AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Atos shares hit 7-month high on Siemens unit buy," (Corrects to seven from six in first paragraph) 
 * Price tag positive, restructuring challenges ahead
* Atos shares up 10 percent to 37.22 euros 

(Writes through, adds detail and background) 
 By Lionel Laurent and Leila Abboud 
 PARIS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Atos Origin's bid to create a new
European IT powerhouse from the $1 billion purchase of Siemens'
SIS sent its shares to a seven-month high on Wednesday,
shrugging off concerns of a daunting integration process.
 Atos Origin stock rose as high as 38.50 euros, its highest
since May, and was up 10 percent at 37.22 euros by 1052 GMT, the
top gainer on the broader French SBF120 index, as the market
welcomed the deal in which Siemens will take on the bulk of
restructuring costs.
 French technology group Atos said it expected 2013 revenue
of between 9 billion euros ($12.07 billion) and 10 billion from
the combined entity, along with an operating margin of 7 to 8
percent. 
 Atos is paying 850 million euros in a mix of cash and
shares, with Siemens taking a 15 percent stake.
 Siemens Chief Executive Peter Loescher told a news
conference in Paris: ""Now we have the scale to really play for
the global contracts.""
 Atos and Siemens said late on Tuesday 1,750 jobs would be
cut from SIS in order to boost the unit's profitability, which
analysts say is below industry norms. Siemens is taking on 250
million euros of restructuring costs.
 ""This acquisition has genuine strategic interest ... And the
price paid is especially low given that Siemens is carrying
virtually all the integration and restructuring costs,"" CM-CIC
analyst Dov Levy said.
 ""But it carries the usual risks associated with a deal of
this size,"" Levy added.
 
 RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
 In the year through September, Siemens SIS made a loss of
537 million euros -- partly due to costs relating to job cuts --
on sales which fell 11 percent to 4.12 billion.
 Atos Origin Chief Executive Thierry Breton told analysts on
a conference call he was ""very comfortable"" with restructuring
cost estimates and forecasts on cost savings.
 ""SIS has a very strong footprint that we do not have today,
mainly in central Europe,"" Breton said.
 UBS analyst Michael Briest said the deal was transformative
and would give Atos Origin global reach.
 ""Today's 850 million-euro price appears attractive. CEO
Breton also has a good record on cost-cutting at Atos Origin,""
he wrote in a note.
 Atos Origin has a market value of 2.4 billion euros and
competes against the likes of Capgemini, IBM and Accenture.
 Atos has long had ambitions to expand in Germany and was
courting Siemens' IT unit, then called SBS, as long ago as 2005,
a source close to the matter told Reuters at the time -- but the
parties failed to reach a deal.
 Siemens tried hard in the early 2000s to sell or find a
partner for its loss-making IT unit, but in 2006 it said it
would keep the business and beef it up with staff from other
parts of the group to improve its efficiency and profitability.
 The company spent hundreds of millions of euros on
restructuring the unit, shedding thousands of staff and cutting
about 1.5 billion euros in costs, and sought to integrate SIS
into the group by giving it control of Siemens' internal IT.
 The unit, which employs more than 30,000, became a separate
legal entity carved out of Siemens AG on Oct. 1.
 Siemens reorganised its sprawling portfolio that ranges from
factory tools to turbines to x-ray machines in 2008 to focus on
three core areas -- industry, energy and healthcare -- which it
believes will allow it to capitalise on global trends.

 * EU leaders to back new rescue mechanism plan - Merkel
 * Euro bond idea rejected by Germany again

(Adds quotes, details, background)
 BERLIN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
approve a plan to create a permanent rescue shield for the euro
zone when they meet in Brussels later this week, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.
 Merkel said the bloc's leaders would back a deal struck last
month by EU finance ministers, who agreed to create the European
Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM) that is intended to replace a
temporary mechanism from mid-2013.
 In a speech to the lower house of parliament, Merkel
stressed Berlin's commitment to help its European partners but
again rejected the idea of issuing joint euro bonds.
 ""We know that the euro is our collective destiny, and Europe
is our collective future,"" Merkel said. ""Nobody in Europe will
be abandoned. Europe will succeed together.""
 A fund comprising up to 750 billion euros worth of support
from Europe and the International Monetary Fund expires at the
end of June 2013, and Merkel said the EU summit on Thursday and
Friday would back the plan to replace this with the ESM.
 ""The declaration of euro zone finance ministers from
November 28, in which the main features of the new mechanism
were agreed, will be agreed by the European Council,"" she said.
 To underpin the new mechanism, Germany has pressed for
small changes to the EU's treaty, which Merkel said she hoped
would be formally signed off by the bloc's leaders in March.
 These should then be ratified across the EU by 2012 in order
to dispel any doubts that a permanent mechanism would be in
place the following year, Merkel said.
 However, for the European project to work, countries needed
to pull in the same direction, she added.
 ""This is about deeper political integration, and in relation
to the euro, above all deeper integration on economic policy,""
Merkel said. ""That's why it's so important that we speak about
further political integration over the next few months.""
 ""But also that we don't make the mistake of seeing a
collectivisation of the risks -- which would happen with euro
bonds -- as the solution, because it isn't the solution at all.""
 ""The solution is more harmony and more competitiveness...
among EU member states and especially in the euro zone.""

 By Fiona Ortiz and Dave Graham
 MADRID/BERLIN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
warned Spain on Wednesday that its debt could be downgraded and
Portugal took steps to revive its economy amid concerns about
euro zone debt contagion on the eve of a European Union summit.
 Moody's said it was worried about Spain's high debt funding
needs, its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances, but
it did not expect Madrid would have to follow Greece and Ireland
in seeking an EU bailout.
 The Portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape
and boost growth, and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal
targets, part of a broad effort to convince EU officials and
financial markets it does not need a bailout.
 Spain and Portugal have come under intense pressure in bond
markets, raising concerns they could be driven into seeking an
EU/IMF rescue when they hit funding crunches next year.
 The cost of insuring Spanish debt against default and yields
on its 10-year government bonds rose on Wednesday, an indication
of the increased risk attached to Spain. The euro fell against
the dollar and European stocks lost ground.
 ""Europe remains very fragile. Everyone sees a major crisis
in the first few months of 2011 that would coincide with Spain's
refinancing operations,"" said Arnaud Poutier, deputy head of IG
Markets France.
 EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for
their end-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome the region's
year-long debt crisis at the heart of their agenda. 
 Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the Eurogroup
countries, said he regretted that discord among EU states over
how best to handle the debt crisis had led to tensions and
probably given markets more cause for concern.
 ""Unfortunately there are dissonances in public,"" he told
Germany's Hadelsblatt newspaper. Juncker and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel have publicly disagreed over anti-crisis steps.
 Leaders also face protests over austerity policies announced
by governments across Europe to repair their public finances.
 Greek protesters clashed with police and set fire to cars
and a hotel, as tens of thousands of people marched through
Athens in the largest and most violent anti-austerity protests
since May, when three people died.
 
 IRISH BUDGET PASSED
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen won parliamentary support
for Dublin's 85 billion euro ($113.2 billion) IMF/EU bailout on
Wednesday, clearing the way for the International Monetary Fund
to approve the first disbursement later this week.
 But opposition parties voted against the terms of the rescue
package and vowed to unpick them if, as expected, they oust
Cowen's unpopular government at an early election next year.
 The main opposition party said it felt no moral or legal
obligation to honour all Irish banks' debts to bondholders and
would try to renegotiate the EU/IMF loans.
 As well as approving a change to the EU's treaty demanded by
Germany to create a permanent system for handling crises from
mid-2013, EU leaders will discuss how they can improve the
current temporary financial safety net -- a 750 billion euro ($1
trillion) joint EU/IMF loan facility.
 One possibility is to increase the size of the fund, while
another would involve making it more flexible. 
 Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said the EU's
portion, 440 billion euros, could potentially be doubled to fend
off the threat of renewed market pressure on Portugal and Spain,
and Spain's economy minister backed the idea of a larger fund.
 The EU's leading powers, Germany and France, say less than
10 percent of the rescue funds have been committed so far, so
there is no urgent need to increase the money available.
 Merkel said no country in Europe would be left on its own,
and reiterated that the euro was a strong currency.
 ""We know that the euro is our collective destiny, and Europe
is our collective future,"" Merkel told parliament. ""Nobody in
Europe will be abandoned. Europe will succeed together.""
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso urged
leaders to act fast to reach a consensus.
 EU diplomats have worked to clear the decks of outstanding
issues before the summit so that discussions can focus on crisis
resolution. Officials fear financial markets may seize on a lack
of action when trading picks up again next year.
 The European Central Bank holds a regular, non-rate setting
meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, when it is expected to agree
to ask euro zone member states for more capital, a move to lower
its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis.
 That issue may be discussed among EU leaders on Thursday,
when they will be joined for dinner by ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet. The ECB has come under pressure to step up its
bond-buying programme to help the likes of Portugal, which is
struggling to fund itself in the market.
 
 ECB CAPITAL BASE
 Germany said it would support giving the ECB more capital,
with an official saying a bigger base would show financial
markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new
government bonds if needed.
 Portugal held its last debt auction of the year on
Wednesday, selling 500 million euros of three-month treasury
bills, but at a punitively high yield of 3.4 percent. Last month
it sold the same amount at 1.8 percent.
 Belgium, which saw the outlook on its sovereign debt lowered
by Standard & Poor's on Tuesday, with the threat of a downgrade
within six months, is also a growing concern for policymakers.
And Spain's regional banks have yet to resolve all their debts.
 Top EU officials have called for the euro zone to consider
issuing collective treasury bonds, or e-bonds, which would
effectively mean the 16 euro zone countries sharing credit risk.
 Germany opposes the proposal, which would expose its credit
risk to the influence of riskier peripheral euro zone countries
such as Portugal and Greece. The issue may be raised at the EU
summit, but no decisions are expected.

 By Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank raised
interest rates as expected on Wednesday for the fourth time this
year, saying economic uncertainty abroad meant forecasts for
only gradual future hikes still stood despite record growth at
home.
 The Riksbank tightened by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent
and upped its forecasts for Swedish economic growth this year
and next, pointing to expanding global trade, an improving
domestic labour market and higher consumption. 
 It left its forecasts for future tightening virtually
unchanged despite a dramatically improved picture for the
domestic economy, and analysts said the central bank may have to
step up the pace of rate hikes to prevent overheating.
 ""If the Swedish economy continues to develop as it is doing
now there is a risk for a higher rate path in the future,"" said
Michael Grahn, analyst at Danske Markets.
 The economy grew at its fastest pace on record in the third
quarter and the central bank raised its forecast for overall
output both this year and next.
 ""Currently we have what is an almost uniquely strong
economic development in Sweden,"" Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves
said. ""We have raised our repo rate today by a quarter percent
and we see continued rate hikes coming over the foreseeable
period ahead.""
 However, uncertain economic conditions abroad meant euro
zone and U.S. rates were likely to stay low for some time,
implying that Swedish rates should not rise too fast.
 ""In this situation we need to find something that is
balanced ... and suitable to conditions in Sweden,"" Ingves said.

 CROWN STRENGTH
 While many European nations face years of austerity as
governments attempt to restore good order to public finances,
Sweden has bounced back rapidly from last year's downturn.
 Neighbour Norway, buoyed by vast oil wealth, has also been
raising rates, though it is expected to announce no change in
borrowing costs when it meets later on Wednesday.
 Sweden's latest hike was seen as unavoidable given that the
economy grew 6.9 percent year-on-year in the third quarter.
 But the mismatch between record domestic growth and a muted
recovery in Europe and the United states presents problems.
 Swedish exports could be crimped by economic stagnation in
the European Union due to governments' budget cuts - a concern
highlighted on Wednesday by credit agency Moody's, which warned
it might cut Spain's debt rating amid tensions over funding.
If the Riksbank moves too far ahead of the European Central
Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve in tightening policy, it risks
pushing up the value of the crown.
 As was the case with the last rate hike in October, two
members of the bank's six-member board dissented from the
decision to hike by 25 points and the rate path saying it would
lead the crown to appreciate too much.
 This would threaten export-driven firms such as truck-maker
Volvo and tool maker Sandvik, reduce inflation and raise
unemployment.
 Norway's Finance Minister warned last week that his country
needs to avoid too big a gap developing between its rates and
those of its trading partners in order to keep its businesses
competitive.
 The Swedish crown initially slipped on the rate move but
recovered to stand at around 9.06 to the euro against around
9.09 prior to the announcement. Bond yields, which had risen
prior to the rate hike, dipped again to stand slightly higher on
the day.
 A Reuters survey showed that 18 out of 20 economists had
expected a 25 basis point rise, with most also seeing another
hike as very likely at the central bank's next meeting in
February.

 * Non-performing loans rise; mainly property risks

 By Suleiman al-Khalidi
 AMMAN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Jordanian banks are hoping for
strong economic growth in Gulf Arab states next year to help
turn around a struggling domestic economy and curb their
vulnerability to non-performing loans.
The country's 23 banks, which hold $31 billion of deposits,
saw their pre-tax profits fall 23 percent last year to 695.5
million dinars. Nine-month results for this year were mixed,
suggesting the banks were unlikely to bounce back quickly. 
 Bankers say prospects for 2011 hinge on stepped-up economic
growth in Gulf Arab states which are a main source of
remittances and foreign direct investment, particularly into the
real estate sector which has been hit hard by the slowdown.
 ""The speed of recovery in the sector will depend on the Gulf
economies recovering fully by reviving inflows, remittances and
improving business climate,"" said Marwan Awad, CEO of Ahli Bank
and chairman of Jordan's banking association.
 Jordan emerged at the start of 2010 from the worst economic
contraction in decades that halved growth to 3.2 percent.
 It followed years of boom during which banks saw loan growth
outpacing that of deposits, as the country's free market reforms
attracted billions of dollars of investments from both local and
foreign investors.
 The sharp slowdown was primarily caused by the global
finance crisis, but Jordanian banks have also faced a challenge
from more aggressive regional competitors such as Lebanon's Bank
Audi, which set up operations in Jordan to attract depositors
from neighbouring Iraq.
 
 NON-PERFORMING LOANS
 Prospects for an improved bottom line in 2011 depend on
whether the worst is over in terms of banks' provisions for
non-performing loans which rose to almost 8 percent of the total
$19.7 billion loans this year from 6 percent last year.
 Much of the lending has been channelled to commercial and
residential real estate projects, where bankers say the biggest
risks remain.
 ""Banks are a mirror of the economy and if there is a pickup
this will help clients to service their debts and this will
allow us to control the growth in non-performing loans we have
seen in the last few years,"" Awad said.
 Jordan's two largest lenders Arab Bank and Housing Bank,
which account for almost 40 percent of the total assets of the
banking sector, have already put aside hefty provisions, which
bankers say will cushion them.
 Many banks were also able to re-negotiate quickly company
debt with top clients such as Jordan's largest real estate firm
Taameer, to prevent defaults as falling share prices and lower
real estate collateral exacerbated a sense of crisis.
 
 STRONG LIQUIDITY
 Awad said non-performing loans were still lower than the
peak of 16 percent in 2001, and the banks have been shielded by
generally prudent lending, minimal exposure to Western markets
and a strong supervisory system by the Central Bank of Jordan.
 Although business has plummeted, most banks have proved
resilient and high profile bankruptcies have so far been
averted, bankers say.
 In a positive sign, risk averse banks flush with over 3.9
billion dinars ($5.5 billion) of liquidity in the domestic money
market were now again looking to lend rather than sit on idle
cash after a period of market uncertainty.
 ""Banks have liquidity. They have the ability to lend and
they have been looking for credible businesses and products to
finance,"" said Haethum Battikhi, assistant general manager of
Jordan-Kuwait Bank which has expanded its financing of
cash-short local firms to ease a liquidity crunch.
 With corporate business sharply lower, both conventional and
Islamic banks were turning their attention to growth potential
in retail, which had helped cushion banks such as Cairo-Amman
Bank and Islamic lender Jordan Islamic Bank both with strong
retail franchises.
 But even with a pick-up in Gulf money and capital inflows
next year, competition is likely to intensify next year.
 Many banks will continue to rely on wide interest rate
margin between deposit and lending rates and fee-based income to
improve banks' bottom line and average profitability.
 The downturn could push much needed consolidation as
family-dominated smaller banks that avoided mergers and
acquisitions during the boom years for fear of diluting their
ownership, bankers say.
 Those pressures would mount if the Central Bank of Jordan
(CBJ) moved to raise capital requirements beyond a 100 million
dinars minimum in a sector witnessing global players like HBSC
and regional banks such as Dubai Islamic Bank capturing a bigger
share in the retail sector.
 ""Consolidation of the sector will gather momentum ... but we
have ego problems within the banking sector that need to be
surmounted. A lot will on the Central Bank and its policy,"" said
Bassem Khalil Al-Salem, chairman of Capital Bank.

 * Industry group to develop more FX-based derivatives
* Will also introduce interest rate options
* To soon launch super short-term
commercial bills
(Recasts with interest rate options, details,
background)
SANYA, China, Dec 15 (Reuters) - China plans to
develop more derivatives linked to the yuan's exchange rate
and interest rates, the country's financial markets
industry association said on Wednesday.	
 The National Association of Financial Market Institutional
Investors (NAFMII) also aims to develop derivatives based on
yen , euro , the dollar, international bonds and
bank deposits, Feng Guanghua, deputy secretary general of
NAFMII, told a forum in Sanya, on China's southern island of
Hainan.
Derivatives in those foreign currencies will be based
on their Asian trading, Feng said, apparently because of the
differences in trading hours between China's interbank forex
market, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), and
European and American markets.
On the interest rate front, China will consider
long-awaited interest rate options, according to Feng.
""It is necessary to establish mechanisms that will
help quicken the innovations of financial derivatives,"" Feng
without giving details on the timing of these products.	
 China, under U.S. pressure to let its currency rise
faster, has vowed to make the yuan more flexible and market
oriented as the country gradually deregulates its capital
markets.	
 Developing derivatives based on exchange rates would give
Chinese banks and companies badly needed tools to hedge
currency risks as the yuan gradually becomes more
volatile in the future in line with those reforms.

 MORE PRODUCTS	
 The yuan has moved in an average range of about
100 pips each day since the People's Bank of China abolished a
nearly two-year peg to the dollar in mid-June. It has risen
2.5 percent since the depegging.	
 While the yuan's movements are now much wider than during
the time of the de facto peg, they are still far too small to
create real demand for hedging, and that has been one of the
reasons for a slow pace for the PBOC to launch new currency
derivative products.	
 China's official interest rate system is now completely
controlled by the central bank, with deposits allowed to be
set slightly lower than the PBOC's benchmarks, while lending
rates may be slightly higher.	
 CFETS now hosts derivatives including yuan and interest
rate swaps and forwards, but trading volume cannot be expanded
significantly due to the tight control over the products to
which they are linked.	
 But traders said an earlier launch of new products would
help promote China's reforms in both exchange and interest
rates.	
 ""Market conditions have improved to some extent, and if
regulators are determined to do that, new products could be
launched very soon,"" said a trader at a Chinese state bank.	
 In a related statement, Xu Zhen, head of NAFMII's clearing
house, said the association was about to start trading in
super short-term commercial bills to help corporate financing.	
 ""Three- and six-month paper are the key products to be
developed for now, although the market may need nine-month
paper even more due to official credit restrictions,"" Xu said.	
 NAFMII, which was set up under the central bank to help
regulate the interbank market, rolled out in October China's
own version of credit default swaps (CDS), called ""credit risk
mitigation"" (CRM) tools, to help market participants hedge
credit risks.	
 Under China's complicated corporate debt system, the PBOC
only has the right to manage new corporation-related debt in
the interbank market, such as short-term bills of up to one
year and medium-term bills of mainly three and five years.	
 The China Securities Regulatory Commission is in charge of
supervision of debt issuance by listed companies, while the
top economic planner, the National Development and Reform
Commission, is in charge of that for non-public firms.

 * Euro debt worries lift Swiss franc to record vs euro
 * Dollar gains ground as Treasury yields rise
 
 (Updates prices; changes byline, dateline; previous TOKYO)
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday after
ratings agency Moody's said it may downgrade Spain's debt,
refocusing the market's attention on the risks of contagion from
the euro zone crisis.
 The Swiss franc hit a record high against the euro as
worries about debt problems in some European countries
encouraged investors to reduce exposure to riskier euro zone
assets and seek safer alternatives.
 Contributing to the euro's falls, the dollar gained broadly
as upbeat U.S. economic data lifted U.S. bond yields, which
enhanced the appeal of the greenback.
 Moody's put Spain's Aa1 ratings on review for a possible
downgrade, citing concerns about its mounting debt and 2011
funding needs, though it did not believe Spain would need an EU
bailout, as Greece and Ireland have.
 ""There is an unwillingness among investors to hold riskier
euro zone bonds over the year end so they are selling and going
into Swiss francs,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at SEB
in Stockholm.
 He added that financial markets had not priced in the risk
of Spain needing financial aid, which left plenty of scope for
further falls in euro/dollar in the first half of 2011.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent against the dollar at $1.3315
, having dropped below $1.3300 to take it two cents below a high
of $1.3500 touched on Tuesday.
 Against the Swiss franc the euro was down 0.5 percent at
1.2772 francs, having hit a low of 1.2761.
 Chartists said that if the euro could hold above support in
a band above $1.3280, it could re-test $1.3500. But if that
support band gave way, the euro was likely to slip into a
$1.3165-1.3500 range before testing its November low at $1.2969.
 The Moody's report on Spain pushed Spanish bond yields
higher.
 The focus is likely to remain on debt problems in the euro
zone periphery, with Ireland's parliament due to vote on an 85
billion euro EU/IMF rescue package on Wednesday, a debt auction
in Portugal and a planned strike in Greece.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar gained 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 79.603, climbing above a three-week low of 78.819
plumbed on Tuesday.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield flew to a seven-month high
just above 3.50 percent in Asian trade, extending a move that
started on Tuesday after U.S. retail sales rose for a fifth
straight month in November.
 Despite improving growth prospects, the Federal Reserve
reaffirmed its commitment to buy $600 billion in bonds, which
may boost the economy further.
 ""A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields is spurring
short-covering in the dollar,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX
spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank. ""In the short term the
dollar could advance further.""
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 83.90 yen, but resistance was
expected ahead of 84.50 yen. Support was pegged around 82.50.
 Peter Frank, strategist at Societe Generale, said dollar/yen
looked at risk of an upward lurch from widening U.S./Japan rate
spreads, particularly if there was more upbeat U.S. data ahead.
 U.S. data on Wednesday includes November consumer prices. 
 The euro was steady against the Swedish crown at 9.0871
crowns. The Swedish currency rose briefly after the central bank
raised interest rates as expected and raised its rate forecast
for the first quarter, though it said underlying inflation
pressures were still low.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A downbeat assessment of the U.S.
recovery from the Federal Reserve weighed on global equities on
Wednesday while European shares and the euro came under tough
pressure from a threat to downgrade Spain's debt.
 Wall Street looked set to join in the stock selloff with
losses at the start.
 Yields on U.S. Treasuries climbed to seven-month highs in
Asian trading, partly because of concern about the U.S. deficit,
before later falling back.
 A warning from Moody's on a possible downgrade of Spain's
credit ratings served as a reminder to investors of the risks to
the global recovery heading into 2011, pushing the euro sharply
lower.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 stock index was down a half a percent,
albeit after a seven-session winning streak.
 In putting Spain's AA1 ratings on review, Moody's cited
concerns about its mounting debt and 2011 funding needs.
 Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore, said
the threat of a downgrade was not really a surprise given
Spain's 10-year yield spread was about 250 basis points over
Bunds.
 ""This just focuses attention back on Spain,"" he said,
referring to the rolling euro zone debt crisis.
 The euro zone debt crisis was also in focus in peripheral
economies Portugal and Greece.
 Three-month borrowing costs nearly doubled from a previous
sale in a Portuguese debt auction, but at 3.403 percent came in
lower than markets had expected. 
 In Greece, Athens police fired teargas at protesters who
threw petrol bombs at two luxury hotels near parliament as a
demnstration against government austerity measures escalated.
 
 EURO HITS LOW VS SWISS FRANC
 The euro hit a record low against the Swiss franc as
investors sought safety and avoided the dollar, which has been
highly volatile.
 ""There is an unwillingness among investors to hold riskier
euro zone bonds over the year-end, so they are selling and going
into Swiss francs,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at SEB
in Stockholm.
 Against the dollar, the euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.3332
. The dollar was up 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies.
 U.S. Treasury yields were slightly lower, recovering from a
sell-off in earlier Asian trading.
 The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose in Asia to just above
3.5 percent, its highest level since mid-May, having climbed
about 70 basis points so far this month. It was later yielding
3.428 percent.
 The benchmark notes could be on track for their worst month
since April 2004.
 
 FED HITS EQUITIES
 Investors have generally become more bullish about holding
equities as year-end approaches and sold off government bonds as
a result.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 But sentiment towards equities took a hit from the Federal
Reserve saying on Tuesday that the U.S. recovery was still too
slow to bring down stubbornly high unemployment. Investors were
also booking profits from a long autumn rally before year-end.
 At its last policy meeting of the year, the Fed offered only
a cautious nod to improving prospects for the U.S. economy and
reaffirmed its commitment to buy $600 billion in bonds to
stimulate growth.
 ""The very first line of the very first paragraph is
justification for what it's doing -- it talks about a recovery
that just isn't strong enough to bring down the unemployment
rate,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of research
at Brewin Dolphin Securities.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 0.4 percent.
 Oil prices fell 88 cents to $87.40 a barrel on worries about
the recovery and spot gold dipped to $1,388 an ounce, under some
pressure from the firming dollar after opening little changed at
just over $1,395.

 * Central bank expected to keep rates steady on Thursday	
 * Diesel increase would have broader inflationary impact
(Updates with details, quotes)	
 By Tony Munroe	
 MUMBAI, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Moves by Indian oil firms to
raise petrol prices and possible hikes in diesel fuel will
make the central bank's fight against inflation more difficult
and pile more pressure onto the beleaguered government.	
 Bharat Petroleum raised prices by about 5.6
percent on Wednesday and fellow state operators Hindustan
Petroleum and Indian Oil Corp were expected
to make similar moves by Thursday.	
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government is under attack
from the opposition for a slew of corruption scandals, which
all but paralysed the parliamentary session that ended this
week.	
 While India is keen to ease its subsidy burden, lifting
fuel prices in a country where hundreds of millions live in
poverty could anger the governing Congress party's core voter
base.	
 ""When the price of fuel goes up, everything goes up. If
the diesel rise happens, the general price rises across all
goods could have a big impact for Congress in 2011,"" said
Mahesh Rangarajan, a political columnist and professor at
Delhi University.	
 Congress suffered a drubbing in elections last month in
Bihar, but does not face another state election until May 2011.	
 ""They certainly waited until the day after the parliament
session ended as this would have further unified the
opposition,"" Rangarajan said.	
 Inflation has been moderating somewhat in recent months
but remains high, a problem the Reserve Bank of India will
wrestle with as it meets this week to review monetary policy. 
 While it is widely expected to refrain from raising
interest rates this time after six increases since March,
rising energy and other commodity prices make its target of
cutting headline inflation to about 5.5 percent by the end of
March harder to achieve.	
 
 Gasoline and diesel have weights of 1.09 percent and 4.67
percent, respectively, in the wholesale price index (WPI),
India's main inflation measure, and raising fuel prices has a
knock-on effect as farmers and manufacturers pass costs along.	
 The increase in petrol prices and a 2 rupee rise in diesel
would lift WPI inflation by 6 and 24 basis points,
respectively, with a cascading effect of the same degree over
three or four months, Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya
wrote.	
 ""We view these fuel price hikes (petrol and diesel) as
positive from an overall structural reform perspective in
government's effort towards reduction in subsidies,"" he wrote.	
 The government is expected to make a decision on state-set
diesel prices next week, with a 2 rupees per litre increase
foreseen by industry sources.	
 Wholesale price inflation fell to 7.48 percent in
November, its lowest in a year, data showed on Tuesday.
[ID:nSGE6BC09D]	
 But the fuel price increase put the spotlight back on
inflation in India's financial markets on Wednesday. Federal
bond yields and swap rates nudged higher, taking their cue
from a drop in U.S. Treasury prices and the prospect of higher
fuel prices. 
 At 2:43 p.m. (0913 GMT), the most benchmark 10-year bond
yield was up 1 basis point at 8.10 percent.	
 A Reuters poll conducted late on Tuesday showed just one
in 23 analysts expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to raise
rates this week, while 14 of 22 see at least a 25 basis point
rate increase by the end of the fiscal year in March.
[ID:nBMA009130]	
 ""If RBI pauses tomorrow then they will have to take more
aggressive actions in the future, especially post the fuel
price hike,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank
of Baroda and the lone poll participant to predict a rate rise
this week.	
 ""Inflation is looking good of late only because of the
statistical base effect,"" she said.	
 
 STEEPEST SINCE JUNE	
 The price rise would be the steepest since June when India
freed up petrol prices from government control. The decision,
which came along with a rise in prices of diesel and cooking
fuels, sparked political and street protests against the
Congress-led coalition government. [ID:nSGE6BE00K]	
 ""The parliament session is over and headline inflation is
trending down and with crude still manageable at $90, I think
the government thought it fit to hike petrol prices now. I
won't be surprised if diesel prices are also hiked,"" said a
finance ministry source who deals directly with energy and
fiscal policy.	
 ""These decisions are as much economic as they are about
political management,"" the person said.	
 The Hindu nationalist opposition party, the Bharatiya
Janata Party, demanded a rollback of the petrol price
increase, calling it ""totally unwarranted and unjustified,""
Press Trust of India reported, quoting party spokesman Prakash
Javadekar.	
 Shares in the three state refiners jumped more than 4
percent on news of the petrol price rises before paring some
of the gains, outperforming a broader market that
fell 0.8 percent.

 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against
other major currencies on Wednesday after upbeat U.S. economic
data helped to send U.S. Treasury yields higher, while the euro
fell after credit rating agency Moody's said it may downgrade
Spain's debt.
 Moody's put Spain's AA1 ratings on review for a possible
downgrade, citing concerns about its mounting debt and 2011
funding needs, sending the euro down to test support just below
$1.3300.
 The euro shed 0.5 percent on the day to $1.3309 and headed
down to 1.2808 Swiss francs, within range of a record low of
1.2765 francs set in September.
 Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore, said
the threat of a downgrade was not really a surprise given Spain's
10-year yield spread was about 250 basis points over Bunds.
 ""But this just focuses attention back on Spain,"" he said.
 Ireland's parliament is due to vote on an 85 billion euro
($114 billion) EU/IMF rescue package on Wednesday, which is
expected to get through the lower chamber.
 The government then hopes to tap the external funding early
next year, but the market is not convinced that the euro zone's
debt troubles are over.
 Chartists said if the euro could hold above support in a band
above $1.3280, it could retest $1.3500, its three-week high set
on Tuesday. But if that support band gives way, the euro is
likely to slip into a $1.3165-1.3500 range before eventually

above 3.50 percent in Asian trade on Wednesday, extending a move
that started on Tuesday after U.S. retail sales rose for a fifth
straight month in November, prompting economists to ratchet up
fourth-quarter growth forecasts.
 Despite improving growth prospects, the Federal Reserve
reaffirmed its commitment to buy $600 billion in bonds, a move
that could add fuel to the economic bonfire in coming months.
 The rise in yields helped the dollar to bounce on Tuesday to
reverse losses on the yen.
 Although the 10-year yield retreated to 3.414 percent later
on Wednesday, the dollar remained up near the 84.00 yen
resistance it has tussled with all month.
 ""A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields is spurring
short-covering in the dollar,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX
spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 ""I'm not sure whether this will be a long-term uptrend, but
in the short term the dollar could advance further.""
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 83.85 yen, helped by talk of
demand at the Tokyo fix but with resistance expected ahead of
84.50 yen, a level it has not seen since late September.
 Options barriers were expected up at that level, with
defensive selling expected on the way up. Support was pegged
around 82.50.
 Peter Frank, strategist at Societe Generale, said dollar/yen
looked at risk of an upward lurch from widening U.S./Japan rate
spreads, particularly if there was more upbeat U.S. data ahead.
 U.S. data on Wednesday includes November consumer prices.
 ""Positioning is also a risk for the yen with the latest IMM
data showing the speculative market is still clinging on to large
net long yen positions,"" Frank said.
 The low-yielding yen fell to its weakest in seven months
against the higher-yielding Australian dollar on Tuesday at 83.69
yen, but the Aussie backed off the high on Wednesday as it
retreated following a test of parity with the U.S. dollar.
 Mounting optimism about the U.S. recovery and recent solid
growth data from China, coupled with the fact that Beijing has so
far refrained from lifting interest rates, have put commodity
currencies back in the limelight.
 The Aussie was trading at $0.9922 after gaining 1-Â½ cents
this week to reclaim parity and reach a one-month high of $1.0030
on Tuesday. It rose to its highest in 28 years last month and
traders did not rule out another push.
 ""I think this will set us up for a retest of the highs near
$1.0200,"" a trader said.

 By Paul Day
 MADRID, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's put
Spain's debt on review for a possible downgrade on Wednesday,
highlighting concerns over a funding crunch next year and
sending bank shares sliding.
 The ratings agency said it did not expect Madrid to have to
follow Greece and Ireland into taking a European Union bailout,
but added that it could not rule out that scenario.
 ""Moody's does not believe that Spain's solvency is under
threat and in its base case assumptions does not expect the
Spanish government to have to ask for EFSF liquidity support,""
Moody's lead analyst on Spain Kathrin Muehlbronner said.
 ""We don't rule it out entirely but this is not the base
case,"" Muehlbronner told Reuters in a telephone interview.
 Spain's government has slashed spending to reduce its budget
deficit, reformed labour laws, forced weak savings banks to
merge and announced state asset sales to try to calm market
fears over its finances.
 Muehlbronner said Moody's expects Spain to achieve its
fiscal target and bring its deficit down to 6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) next year.
 The news knocked bank shares, but the key risk premium of
Spanish debt as measured by the spread on ten-year debt compared
with equivalent euro zone benchmark bunds ended the day lower at
around 245 basis points as markets positioned themselves before
two bond auctions on Thursday.
 Investors see financial trouble lurking in banks' exposure
to bad loans from Spain's burst real estate bubble and in high
deficits run by autonomous regional governments.
 Spain's government faces a bond redemption at the end of
April of 15.5 billion euros while its banks will be looking to
refinance around 35 billion euros in the Spring.
 Economy Minister Elena Salgado reiterated on Wednesday
pledges that autonomous regions would meet deficit cutting
targets and that banks would publish more detailed reports of
their finances.
 ""The declaration today (by Moody's)... is based on three
issues on which we believe we can resolve all doubts in the very
short term,"" Salgado said at a news conference.
 A pre-Christmas market lull may have taken some of the heat
out of the euro zone debt crisis but the ratings agencies see
risks unabated in 2011, and possibly spreading.
 Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Belgian debt to
negative on Tuesday, saying that if the country's inability to
form a government threatened deficit- and debt-reduction goals,
its AA+ rating could be cut within six months.
 
 EURO, BANK SHARES HIT
 The euro extended losses early in the day on the Moody's
announcement and Spanish banking shares fell with euro zone's
biggest bank Santander closing down 2.64 percent at 8.15 euros.
 Spain paid over one percentage point more to sell its
treasury bills at an auction on Tuesday compared with last
month, and yields are also expected to rise at Thursday's bond
sales.
 Moody's, which has an Aa1 rating on Spain, cited the
country's vulnerability to funding stresses, weak market
confidence and the possibility of greater public debt should the
banks need further capitalisation.
 Moody's cites ""issues that have been on the radar screens
for quite some time, but nonetheless at this particular juncture
it does have the potential to generate more negative impact on
market sentiment,"" said Nick Matthews, economist at RBS.
 Earlier this week, Moody's kept its negative outlook on
Spain's banks and estimated they might need to recapitalise by
an extra 17 billion euros.
 Spain's sovereign debt lost its last top-line triple-A
rating on Sep. 30 when Moody's became the last of the main three
ratings agencies to downgrade it by one notch.
 It has been under intense scrutiny from international
markets since Ireland was forced to take a 85 billion euro aid
package in November, due to worries over similarities between
the countries' property busts and banking systems.
 Spain's government has denied it would also need to apply to
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and rejected
any comparison between its economic position and Ireland's.

 SINGAPORE, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Yields on U.S. Treasuries
climbed to seven-month highs in Asia on Wednesday and the
dollar rebounded as upbeat retail sales data added to evidence
that America's economy is gathering steam.	
 But a warning from Moody's on a possible downgrade of
Spain's credit ratings served as a reminder of the risks to
the global recovery heading into 2011, pushing the euro
slightly lower. [ID:nL3E6NF0D8]	
 Earlier on Wednesday, a Bank of Japan tankan survey showed
Japanese manufacturers' business sentiment had worsened for
the first time in nearly two years, while Standard and Poor's
cut its outlook on Belgian debt on Tuesday, flagging a new
risk for markets as the euro zone's debt crisis continues to
fester.	
 Stocks in Asia slid after the Federal Reserve said the
U.S. recovery was still too slow to bring down stubbornly high
unemployment, and as investors continued to book profits from
a long autumn rally before closing their books for year-end.	
 European shares were expected to follow Asia
lower after gains in seven straight sessions.	
 Energy and resource stocks were under particular pressure
as oil prices retreated and as investors switched out of big
Australian miners which have outperformed in recent sessions.	
 At its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday, the Fed
offered only a cautious nod to improving prospects for the
U.S. Economy and reaffirmed its commitment to buy $600 billion
in bonds to stimulate growth, despite fears of some economists
that it could over time trigger an inflationary shock.
[ID:nN14232588]

U.S. would continue its quantitative measure. Combined with a

MSCI ex-Japan index of Asian stocks slid 1 percent, pressured
by a late-day selloff in U.S. markets overnight after the
Fed's assessment of the economy proved to be more sober than
many traders would have liked. 
 South Korean shares managed to buck the downdraft,
rising 0.4 percent to a fresh 37-month closing high, led by
shipyards and oil refiners.	
 
 TREASURY YIELDS EXTEND CLIMB	
 U.S. Treasury prices extended their recent losses as the
Fed showed no signs of curtailing its economic stimulus
measures.	
 The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose to just
above 3.5 percent, its highest level since mid-May, having
climbed about 70 basis points so far this month. It later
slipped back to around 3.45 percent, down 2 basis points on
the day.	
 The benchmark notes are on track for their worst month
since April 2004. 
 ""I still think the situation with the labour market and
prices has not changed in the United States, so recent moves
in the Treasury market are a bit overdone,"" said Junko Ikeda
of Sumitomo Trust Bank Asset Management.	
 ""Treasuries look attractive from the prospect of the
widening short- and long-term yield spreads."" 
 The U.S. dollar index against a basket of other
major currencies rose 0.44 percent, having climbed off a
three-week low plumbed on Tuesday.	
 The euro slipped to $1.3314 after the Moody's warning on
Spain from around $1.3340 before the news, testing support at
$1.3280-1.3325. Failure to hold that level could open the way
for the single currency to test its November lower at $1.2969.	
 Oil prices fell 70 cents to $87.58 a barrel after the Fed
dampened expectations for a faster recovery, which is seen as
critical to reigniting oil demand in the world's largest
energy user.

 By Ian Chua and Chikafumi Hodo
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against
other major currencies on Wednesday after upbeat U.S. economic
data helped to send U.S. yields higher, although thinning volumes
into the year-end meant trading was choppy.
 The 10-year Treasury yield flew to a seven-month high just
above 3.50 percent, extending a move that started on Tuesday
after U.S. retail sales rose for a fifth straight month in
November, prompting economists to ratchet up fourth-quarter
growth forecasts.
 Despite improving growth prospects, the Federal Reserve

that could add fuel to the economic bonfire in coming months.
 The rise in yields helped the dollar to reverse losses on the
yen, taking it back up near the 84.00 yen resistance it has
tussled with all month, and abruptly ended a short squeeze in the
euro, which rose on Tuesday partly on talk of heavy buying by
Asian central banks.
 ""A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields is spurring
short-covering in the dollar,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX
spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 ""I'm not sure whether this will be a long-term uptrend, but

 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 83.85 yen, helped by talk of
demand at the Tokyo fix but with resistance expected ahead of
84.50 yen, a level it has not seen since late September.
 Options barriers were expected up at that level, with

 The euro retreated from a three-week high at $1.3500 to trade
at $1.3350, failing to stay above $1.3470, which is roughly the
38.2 percent retracement of its November fall.
 Chartists said that, if it can hold above support at
$1.3280-1.3325, it could retest $1.3500. But if that support band
gives way, the euro is likely to slip into a $1.3165-1.3500 range
before eventually breaking down to test its November low at
$1.2969.
 The dollar gained 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 79.55, having climbed off a three-week low plumbed
on Tuesday.

 By Leika Kihara and Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business
sentiment worsened for the first time in nearly two years this
quarter but the gloom was not as severe as expected, giving the
Bank of Japan breathing room before pondering its next move.
 But big manufacturers expect conditions to deteriorate over
the next three months, the BOJ's closely watched tankan survey
showed on Wednesday, keeping up pressure on the central bank to
support the fragile economy with its ultra-easy monetary policy.
 ""The figures show the economic recovery is in line with the
BOJ's scenario, in that a slowdown is one-time and a recovery
will resume next year,"" said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist
at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
 ""One trigger for further BOJ monetary easing would be for the
economy to show signs of deterioration, such as negative growth
in GDP for the January-March quarter.""
 The headline index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment
fell to plus 5 from September's plus 8, marking the first decline
in seven quarters. But it exceeded a median market forecast of
plus 3.
 The index for March next year was seen at minus 2, showing
that the murky economic outlook was making companies cautious
about business conditions in the coming three months.
 BOJ policymakers are expected to scrutinise the tankan at
their rate review next week, although the central bank is seen
holding off on easing monetary policy further after having taken
action in October.
 ""The BOJ is likely to stick with its current status for a
while,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute.
 ""Rather than economic indexes, the trigger is likely to come
from the market, such as stocks falling greatly or the yen
strengthening even more due to overseas events.""
 MURKY OUTLOOK
 Financial markets were swayed more by Federal Reserve policy
than the tankan. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
yield hit a seven-month high of 1.295 percent on Wednesday,
tracking gains in U.S. Treasury yields after the U.S. central
bank showed no signs of curtailing its stimulus measures.
 The pain from the yen's surge to a 15-year high against the
dollar in November was evident with big manufactures, many of
which are reliant on exports, cutting their dollar/yen forecasts
and profit estimates for the latter half of fiscal 2010/11.
 Still, corporate capital spending held up relatively well and
some analysts said the damage was contained by solid demand for
Japanese goods in fast-growing Asia.
 ""Big manufacturers are cautious about the outlook as the
economy is likely to be in a lull in the first half of next year,
but their profits have stayed firm probably because solid demand
from emerging economies offset the negative impact of the yen's
rise,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, an economist at Japanese trading
house Itochu Corp.
 Big firms plan to increase capital spending by 2.9 percent in
the year to March 2011, slightly more than a median forecast for
a 2.7 percent rise and recovering from a 15.5 percent decline in
the year ended in March.
 Japan's economy is expected to have contracted slightly in
the October-December quarter on slowing overseas growth and
slumping factory output after the September expiry of government
incentives for purchases of low-emission cars.
 Analysts expect the country's economic growth to pick up
early next year with support from exports to fast-growing Asia,
but only modestly.
 The BOJ has pledged to keep interest rates effectively at
zero until the end of deflation is in sight and rolled out a 5
trillion yen ($60 billion) pool of funds to buy assets ranging
from government bonds to corporate debt.
 The central bank has said topping up the fund is a strong
option if the economy worsens more than expected but it does not
want to do so too soon.
 The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the
percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those
who say they are good. Positive readings mean optimists outnumber
pessimists.

for the Andean region and about 130 other developing countries
could expire, at least temporarily, at the end of year unless
Congress takes action in coming days.
 The looming expiration creates uncertainty for foreign
companies who rely on the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA)
and the much larger Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)
program for duty-free access to the United States.
 Colombian officials, in particular, are worried that even a
temporary expiration would add to the problems the country
faces after heavy rains and flooding that drove nearly 2
million people from their homes.
 The government of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on
Monday estimated damages from the country's worst natural
disaster could reach 10 trillion pesos, which is approximately
$5.2 billion.
 The Colombian flower industry is a major beneficiary of
APTA, which slashes duties on imports of clothing,
vegetables, plastics, aluminum products and other goods from
the region to support jobs.
 An expiration would also hurt U.S. companies and consumers
that benefit from lower-cost imports from the countries.
 Representative Sander Levin has introduced a bill to extend
the two programs and a third known as Trade Adjustment
Assistance (TAA), which helps retrain workers who have lost
their jobs because of trade competition.
 Levin, the outgoing Democratic chairman of the House of
Representatives' Ways and Means Committee, hopes for a vote in
the House on his package by the end of the week.
 But Senator Charles Grassley, a senior Republican, opposes
the Levin bill because it does not address his objections to a
Labor Department rule that requires TAA to be administered by
unionized state employees.
 Grassley wants the final deadline for states to comply with
the rule to be postponed and the Levin bill does not do that.
 ""So, Senator Grassley doesn't support the Levin bill,"" a
Grassley spokeswoman said.
 A second congressional aide said ""the Levin bill has no
chance at all of passing the Senate and would be dead in the
water the minute it arrives.""
 But ""the Senate is actively working to find a solution to
extend all of the expiring trade programs before the end of the
year,"" the aide said.
 Congress is unlikely to let the programs lapse permanently,
even if it fails to pass an extension by Dec. 31.
 However, work could be delayed in 2011 because of the time
it would take to educate new members on the issue.
 President Barack Obama's administration supports extending
both ATPA and GSP and has been working with Congress toward
that end, said Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade
Representative's office.

 By Al Yoon and Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eked out gains and
U.S. Treasuries prices slumped on Tuesday after the U.S.
Federal Reserve showed no signs of curtailing its economic
stimulus measures and U.S. retail sales data signaled an
accelerating economic recovery.
 The dollar edged higher against the euro and the yen after
the Fed modestly upgraded its evaluation of the U.S. economic
recovery and reaffirmed its commitment to purchase $600 billion
in government bonds to boost the economy.
 ""The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that
has been insufficient to bring down unemployment,"" the Fed said
in a statement at the conclusion of a one-day meeting.
 The Dow Jones industrial average touched a more than
two-year high, and world stocks inched closer to overall
two-year highs. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields hit
their highest levels in since May on signs of accelerating
economic growth.
 The government on Tuesday reported that U.S. retail sales
rose for a fifth straight month, and the producer price index,
a measure of business costs, increased more than expected, seen
as a positive sign of demand. For details see [ID:nN14261708].
 ""I'm slightly disappointed that the (Fed) doesn't see the
world in the same light that investors do,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in
Greenwich, Connecticut.
 ""The Fed continues to say that the outlook for employment
and spending isn't as strong as the market perceives it.""
 Investors also kept their sights on a deal worked out
between U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican lawmakers to
extend tax cuts, jobless benefits and a payroll tax credit,
which is expected to also boost the economy.
 Wall Street did temporarily turn negative, weighed by
declining bank shares after the Fed statement as hurt by a
plunge in the stock of Best Buy Inc , the top U.S.
electronics retailer that is seen a bellwether in consumer
electronics. Best Buy shares fell 15 percent after it reported
a drop in quarterly profit and sales and cut its full-year
outlook, citing weak demand in its key U.S. market.

(Adds quote from Carstens)
 By Patrick Rucker and Luis Rojas
 MEXICO CITY, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund is set to boost its credit line to Mexico to more than $70
billion as a safety net for Latin America's No. 2 economy in
case of more global financial market turmoil.
 President Felipe Calderon said on Tuesday Mexico had asked
the IMF to extend the country's current credit line from about
$48 billion to about $72 billion over two years.
 ""This is a financial insurance policy that will fully
protect the economy from any external turbulence,"" Calderon
said after meeting with the IMF's managing director, Dominique
Strauss-Kahn.
 ""This is a credit line of a precautionary nature that, just
like in past instances, Mexico does not plan to use,"" Calderon
added.
 Strauss-Kahn said he planned to push ahead quickly to get
IMF executive board approval for the request. He praised
Mexico's economic policies during the global financial crisis
and said the country was one of the IMF's ""platinum members.""
 The extension, which he said would be worth about $73
billion, was a precaution that would help maintain external
confidence in Mexico given the uncertain global environment,
characterized by uneven growth.
 ""When you look at Europe you can see that things are not
that good, especially because of the debt crisis,"" Strauss-Kahn
said. ""When you look at the U.S. it is unclear, so far, how
(things) will be in 2011 and 2012. It is not bad, but not as
good as expected. It will remain uncertain.""
 Central bank governor Agustin Carstens said slow economic
growth in Europe and the United States were among the main
risks to the outlook, along with protectionist pressures.
 ""A protectionist war, a war of monetary policy measures
where you start to close markets ... a tariff war or a currency
war between the U.S. or Europe or other countries like China,
that would be very costly for world growth,"" he told local
radio.
 ""It is a very uncertain, volatile world with very clear
spots of danger in the euro zone, in the United States, in
China that could eventually effect us,"" Carstens said.
 Mexico has yet to tap its credit line with the IMF, which
first set up the facility in early 2009 when the global
financial crisis knocked the country's peso currency to a
record low. Poland and Colombia have similar precautionary
credit lines.
 Mexico's currency commission, made up of the central bank
and Finance Ministry, said the credit line, when added to the
central bank's dollar reserves, would provide Mexico with close
to $200 million to defend its currency from external shocks.
 The IMF forecasts the Mexican economy will grow 5.0 percent
this year and 3.9 percent in 2011, compared with expected
global growth next year of 4.2 percent.
 Mexico and other emerging market economies are concerned
about what will happen when the United States and other rich
nations eventually raise interest rates and rein in government
spending.
 Higher U.S. rates could lead investors to pull money out of
emerging markets like Mexico to invest them in safe-haven U.S.
Treasury debt.

 * Investors see rise in U.S. yields as overdone

(Adds comment, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against
the euro and yen on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said
the economic recovery was still too slow to bring down
unemployment and reaffirmed its commitment to buy $600 billion
in bonds to stimulate growth and create jobs.
 U.S. Treasuries extended losses after the Fed statement
showed no signs of curtailing its economic stimulus measures,
raising the prospect of accelerating growth and inflation.
 Trading was volatile after the announcement but the euro
had already pared gains and retreated from a three-week high
against the dollar after stronger-than-expected U.S. retail
sales data lifted bond yields and optimism about the economy.
 The data, coupled with U.S. President Barack Obama's deal
last week to extend tax cuts for all earners, had left traders
on alert to see if the Fed would give any hint at its Tuesday
meeting of altering a $600 billion bond-buying program designed
to push long-term interest rates lower.
 But the statement by the Fed's Open Market Committee
ultimately did nothing to change investor expectations.
 ""The good thing is they are keeping it as is, and I take
that to be moderately dollar positive,"" said Greg Salvaggio,
vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 The euro, which began the week at $1.32, hit a three-week
high near $1.35 overnight after rising above the 38.2 percent
retracement of its November decline. It was last at $1.3379,
down 0.1 percent on the day.
 ""The Fed not expanding the program gives them wiggle room
to get out of it next year if they see the situation
improving,"" said Salvaggio, who expects the euro to begin a
decline toward $1.30 by year end.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 83.63 yen
while the Australian dollar hit a one-month high above parity
with the greenback as oil prices rose but then eased.
 Traders also said year-end positioning and low trading
volume was exaggerating some price swings.
 U.S. YIELDS STILL IN FOCUS
 The tax cut deal has prompted economists to upgrade U.S.
growth forecasts but it also pushed up bond yields for fear it
will swell the deficit.
 The dollar rose with yields last week but fell on Monday
when Moody's warned the tax cuts could move it a step closer to
cutting the United States' triple-A credit rating.
 Bond yields extended their rise after the Fed statement.
 ""The Fed is not offering anything new with the statement,
but the reaffirmation of the second round of QE has probably
carried some importance in itself,"" said Vassili Serebriakov,
currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York, referring to
the Fed's bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing.
 Some strategists said fear of imminent U.S. inflation and
higher long-term rates was premature.
 ""The recent rise in front-end U.S. yields looks overdone as
core inflation isn't going to pick up quickly,"" said Gavin
Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital in London.
 The euro also hit a three-week high against the yen,
shrugging off the weaker-than-forecast current conditions
element of the German ZEW survey.
 But it pared gains after the S&P rating agency said Belgian
sovereign debt could be downgraded within six months, sparking
fear of contagion from the euro zone crisis.
 The U.S. dollar and euro both fell to session lows against
the Swiss franc ahead of the Federal Reserve announcement.
 Earlier in the global trading day, the Swiss government
raised its 2011 economic growth forecast, saying solid
consumption growth and robust construction spending would help
soften a slowdown in exports.

 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - World stocks firmed and U.S.
Treasuries prices slumped on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal
Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to purchase $600 billion in
bonds to boost the economy, following the positive track set by
stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer spending numbers.
 The dollar edged higher against the euro and the yen after
the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- modestly upgraded its
evaluation of the U.S. economic expansion.
 ""The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that
has been insufficient to bring down unemployment,"" the Fed said
in a statement at the conclusion of a one-day meeting.
 World stocks neared a two-year high set last month, and
benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields hit their highest levels
in more than six months on signs of accelerating economic
growth. Data released on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales
rising for a fifth straight month and the producer price index
beating expectations. For details see [ID:nN14261708].
 However Wall Street stocks faded late in the trading day.
 ""I'm slightly disappointed that the (Fed) doesn't see the
world in the same light that investors do,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in
Greenwich, Connecticut.
 ""The Fed continues to say that the outlook for employment
and spending isn't as strong as the market perceives it.""
 Investors are also eyeing another potential boost to the
economy in the form of a deal worked out between U.S. President
Barack Obama and Republican lawmakers to extend tax cuts,
jobless benefits and a payroll tax credit.

bellwether, tumbled 16 percent, weighing on the market. Best

 * Intensive negotiations start in mid-January
(adds timetable, Davos, scheduling)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Members of the World Trade
Organization are showing new energy and determination to reach a
global trade deal but must now abandon fixed positions to clinch
the agreement, the head of the WTO said on Tuesday.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said it was no longer
enough to have ""answering machines"" around the table as the
WTO's 153 members respond to a call by leaders of the G20 and
APEC to finish the Doha round trade talks next year.
 ""We are at the point where we must have negotiators, and all
negotiators have to be prepared to move out of their comfort
zones towards agreement,"" Lamy told the WTO's General Council.
 He was speaking as trading powers ready for a bout of
intensive negotiations starting Jan. 10, after the G20 and APEC
leaders said 2011 offered a narrow window of opportunity to
conclude the long-running Doha talks.
 The Doha round was launched nine years ago to boost the
world economy by freeing up global commerce and help poor
countries prosper through more trade, and has already missed a
whole series of deadlines.
 One senior African official said WTO members had set
themselves another tough timetable. They would have to agree
draft texts by April to reach an outline deal by July -- leaving
enough time to fill in the details by the end of the year.
 As a result some members are already talking about a
""post-Doha work programme"", carrying questions such as regional
trade agreements and non-tariff barriers forward to a new set of
negotiations after a Doha deal, he told reporters.
 Economists differ about the size of the boost to the world
economy from a deal, but say it would help business sentiment by
keeping markets open and resisting protectionism.
 The United States wants big emerging countries like China,
Brazil and India to open up more to American businesses, while
developing countries say the United States, Europe and other
rich countries are not doing enough to open up their markets to
farm goods and end trade-distorting agricultural subsidies.
 A series of meetings of small groups of ambassadors in
recent months to brainstorm on ways to break the deadlock has
raised hopes that a deal could be done if members are flexible.
The U.S. ambassador to the WTO, Michael Punke, told Reuters
last week he was encouraged by China's approach in those
discussions and was waiting to see whether that would translate
into real negotiations.
 Lamy said he would call a meeting of the WTO on Feb. 2 to
review progress on January's intensified talks.
 That will be preceded by a meeting on Jan. 26 of key members
-- the biggest trading powers, those representing groups of
smaller countries, and those chairing areas of negotiation --
timed just before a traditional meeting of trade ministers at
the Davos business summit in Switzerland.
 In one indication of how seriously members are taking the
renewed push, several small and poor countries spoke up at the
council to warn that they could not handle too many meetings at
once in the coming months. Lamy promised to ensure that there
were no scheduling clashes.
 Most members agreed that at some point the negotiations need
to move from a focus on individual areas such as agriculture and
industrial goods to a sense of what the overall package offers,
allowing countries to make cross-cutting trade-offs, he said.

 By Dave Graham and Sakari Suoninen
 BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Dec 14 (Reuters) - European Union
paymaster Germany said on Tuesday it would support giving the
European Central Bank more capital to help fight a sovereign
debt crisis that continues to shake the euro zone.
 ECB sources told Reuters the bank's governing council would
consider at a meeting on Wednesday and Thursday whether to seek
a capital increase from euro zone members to cover the risk of
losses on government bonds it has bought to support the
16-nation single currency area.
 A Berlin government official, briefing reporters ahead of an
EU summit on Thursday and Friday, said ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet might raise the matter at a dinner with EU leaders.
 ""The government supports the ECB in all that it deems
important ... If such a request comes, we will judge it
positively,"" said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The ECB declined comment.
 The German official said a bigger capital base would show
financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy
new government bonds if needed.
 One euro zone central bank source said the ECB was eyeing a
doubling of its subscribed capital of almost 5.8 billion euros,
which compares to a balance sheet of 138 billion euros,
according to its latest annual report.
 The summit is due to approve a German-driven treaty change
to create a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism that could
force private investors to share losses with taxpayers if a euro
zone country was unable to repay its debt after 2013.
 Trichet called in comments released on Tuesday for EU
leaders to give maximum flexibility in size and scope to the
euro zone's existing financial safety net, known as the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 The rescue fund is limited by rules that specify it can only
be used as a last resort and a requirement to maintain a cash
buffer to preserve its top-notch AAA credit rating.
 
 MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY
 A senior EU source said experts were exploring ways around
both restrictions to ensure the full 440 billion euros earmarked
for the fund can be lent, and to provide a flexible credit line
before a country is shut out of capital markets.
 ""On the EFSF, I can say we are calling for maximum
flexibility and I would say maximum capacity quantitatively and
qualitatively,"" Trichet said at a Frankfurt International
Business Journalists' Club event late on Monday.
 Ireland became the first country to seek assistance from the
EFSF this month as part of an 85 billion euro EU/IMF rescue
after a banking crash swelled its public debt. Greece received a
110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout in May just before the rescue
fund was created.
 The German official said no other country was in imminent
need of EFSF aid. But Portugal and Spain are under bond market
pressure to follow suit due to their high budget deficits and
loss of economic competitiveness.
 Spain had to pay a sharply higher yield than last month to
sell 2.51 billion euros in 12- and 18-month bills on Tuesday
after a renewed market sell-off that has driven up borrowing
costs for Madrid and other vulnerable euro zone sovereigns.
 In another sign of ebbing confidence in euro zone
sovereigns, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its
outlook for Belgian debt to negative on Tuesday, flagging a new
risk for money markets. The wealthy west European country has
been run by a caretaker government since elections six months
ago and has a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 100 percent.
 Germany and its allies are seeking to prevent any discussion
at the EU summit of a proposal by two veteran finance ministers
for common euro zone bonds as a way to prevent speculation
against member states' debt and reduce their borrowing costs.
 Berlin fears such bonds would raise its borrowing costs and
reduce pressure on heavily indebted governments to put their
finances into better order.
 Slovakian Prime Minister Iveta Radicova said the ""E-bonds""
idea, raised by Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of euro zone
finance ministers, and Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti,
was not on the summit agenda and was ""permanently unacceptable"".
 
 LOSSES FEARED
 ECB sources suggested the central bank wanted more capital
chiefly to protect itself against potential losses rather than
fund any major increase of euro zone government debt purchases.
 ""The issue is that the ECB is worried about potential losses
from its bond buying,"" one source said.
 ""At the moment we are buying very modest amounts, but what
if that is increased, and what if the bonds you buy are suddenly
worth 30 percent less?"" the source said, referring to the risk
of a writedown on a euro zone government's debt.
 The ECB disclosed on Monday that it had increased purchases
of euro zone government bonds to 2.667 billion euros ($3.5
billion) last week from 1.965 billion euros the previous week.
It was the biggest weekly total since June but well below levels
seen at the height of the euro zone crisis.
 Altogether, the ECB has bought 72 billion euros in bonds --
exclusively Greek, Irish and Portuguese, analysts believe --
since it began intervening in May to stabilise markets. 
 ECB policymakers have repeatedly signalled that the central
bank cannot bear the brunt of fire-fighting against bond market
attacks on highly indebted euro zone states, urging governments
to increase reform efforts and boost EU contingency funds.
 Trichet urged euro zone countries to take action to ensure
their banking sectors are ""appropriately restructured"". The ECB
is worried that ailing banks in weaker euro area countries have
become totally dependent on central bank funding, making it
harder to withdraw emergency liquidity support measures.
 Figures released on Tuesday showed Spanish banks borrowed
less from the ECB last month as funding conditions continued to
improve. But Greek banks became even more dependent on the ECB
lifeline, borrowing 95.1 billion euros in November, the Bank of
Greece said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from a
three-week high against the dollar on Tuesday as data showing
U.S. retail sales rose by more than forecast last month,
boosting bond yields and optimism about the U.S. economy.
 The data, coupled with U.S. President Barack Obama's deal
last week to extend tax cuts for all earners, left traders on
alert to see if the Federal Reserve gives any hint at its
Tuesday meeting of altering a $600 billion bond-buying program
designed to push long-term interest rates lower.
 ""The Fed could be interesting depending on how vocal they
are in either committing to the full amount now that they've
got additional fiscal stimulus or whether they feel they have
to step on the gas to get rates back down,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The euro, which began the week at $1.32, hit a three-week
high near $1.35 overnight after rising above the 38.2 percent
retracement of its November decline. It was last at $1.3389
, little changed on the day. Dolan said a close above
$1.3450 could set up a near-term rally to $1.37.
 The euro ""may have room to run higher if the Fed reasserts
its commitment to purchasing $600 billion, citing the weakness
in inflation and spare capacity weighing on unemployment,""
Brown Brothers Harriman strategist said in a note to clients.
 For more on retail sales and the Fed meeting, see
[ID:nN14261708] and [ID:nN14232588].
 Elsewhere, the Australian dollar  hit a one-month
high above parity with the greenback as oil prices rose, but
then eased, while the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 83.55 yen
.
 Traders also said year-end positioning and low trading
volume was exaggerating some price swings.
 U.S. YIELDS STILL IN FOCUS
 The tax cut deal has prompted economists to upgrade their
U.S. growth forecasts, but it also pushed up bond yields for
fear it will swell the deficit.
 The dollar rose with yields last week but fell on Monday
when Moody's warned the tax cuts could move it a step closer to
cutting the U.S. triple-A credit rating. [ID:nN13105751]
 Some strategists said fear of imminent U.S. inflation and
higher long-term rates was premature.
 ""The recent rise in front-end U.S. yields looks overdone as
core inflation isn't going to pick up quickly,"" said Gavin
Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 ""Also euro zone bond spreads seem to have stabilized on the
back of the recent ECB buying, which has helped the euro.""
 The European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of
government bonds last week, although the amount bought was
still well below levels reached last spring.
 The euro also hit a three-week high against the yen
, shrugging off the weaker-than-forecast current
conditions element of the German ZEW survey. [ID:nDEP003410]
 But it pared gains after the S&P rating agency said Belgian
sovereign debt could be downgraded within six months, sparking
fear of contagion from the euro zone crisis. [ID:nWEA7396]

 The ECB also said new regulations covering rating agencies

United States.
 But it said there may still be sizable problems in credit
rating agencies' ability to issue unsolicited credit ratings,

 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - World stocks rose, nearing a
two-year high set in November, and the dollar rebounded after
stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer spending boosted optimism
of a lasting global economic recovery.
 U.S. benchmark Treasury yields jumped to their highest
levels in more than six months after U.S. retail sales rose for
a fifth straight month.
 The U.S. producer price index also increased more than
anticipated, further evidence to suggest economic growth was
accelerating. For details, see [ID:nN14261708]
 European shares pared losses after the U.S. data, which
affirmed a stocks rally that has pushed up the S&P 500 index by
6 percent since Nov. 29. Investors also expected the U.S.
compromise U.S. plan that includes an extension of tax cuts and
jobless benefits and a payroll tax credit, to boost the
economy.
 ""The hand-off to 2011 looks very promising,"" Tom Porcelli,
chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, said. ""Very solid
... there is no other way to describe the retails sales
report.""
 The rise in retail sales showed that consumers are ramping
up spending in the thick of the critical holiday shopping
season, said Jim Baird, partner and chief investment strategist
at Michigan-based Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
 Investors also awaited a meeting of the U.S. Federal
Reserve, with policymakers expected to assess the central
bank's $600 billion bond-buying program but not signal any
shift in its monetary easing program.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 54.57 points,
or 0.48 percent, to 11,483.13. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> climbed 4.19 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,244.65 and
the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 10.66 points, or 0.41
percent, to 2,635.57.
 Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Inc  reported
a decline in quarterly profit and sales, pushing its shares
down 14.7 percent. The company also cut its full-year outlook,
citing weak demand in its key U.S. market. [ID:nN13207737]
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> and the Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> both rose about a
one-third of a percent. The MSCI index is just below a two-year
high set in November.
 China's extension of special reserve requirements for top
banks also supported world stocks and commodities as
expectations rose that Beijing was unlikely to aggressively
cool down its economy, with the rest of the world relying on
China's robust growth. [ID:nLDE6BC0ET]
 Chinese stocks rose 0.1 percent <.SSEC>. A leading official
newspaper reported China will probably target a limit of about
7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) in new loans next year, an
indication that policy could be slightly looser than expected.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.2
percent near its close of trading. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF>
added 0.6 percent.
 Treasuries dropped, adding to a sharp selloff since the tax
deal between U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican
lawmakers sparked concerns over a widening federal budget gap
and the inflationary impact of faster growth.
 ""A more robust U.S. growth outlook has taken over the
mantle of market leadership,"" Goldman Sachs wrote to clients.
 U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields, which influence consumer
and corporate borrowing costs, rose 0.08 percentage point to
3.36 percent.
 The euro gave up gains against the dollar as U.S. bond
yields edged higher and investors squared positions ahead of
the Fed's final meeting for 2010. The euro earlier hit a

 * Intensive negotiations start in mid-January
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Members of the World Trade
Organization are showing new energy and determination to reach a
global trade deal but must now abandon fixed positions to clinch
the agreement, the head of the WTO said on Tuesday.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said it was no longer
enough to have ""answering machines"" around the table as the
WTO's 153 members respond to a call by leaders of the G20 and
APEC to finish the Doha round trade talks next year.
 ""We are at the point where we must have negotiators, and all
negotiators have to be prepared to move out of their comfort
zones towards agreement,"" Lamy told the WTO's General Council.
 He was speaking as trading powers ready for ready for a bout
of intensive negotiations starting Jan. 10, after the G20 and
APEC leaders said 2011 offered a narrow window of opportunity to
conclude the long-running Doha talks.
 The Doha round was launched nine years ago to boost the
world economy by freeing up global commerce and help poor
countries prosper through more trade, and has already missed a
whole series of deadlines.
 Economists differ about the size of the boost to the world
economy from a deal, but say it would help business sentiment by
keeping markets open and resisting protectionism.
 The United States wants big emerging countries such as
China, Brazil and India to open up more to American businesses,
while developing countries say the United States, Europe and
other rich countries are not doing enough to open up their
markets to farm goods and end trade-distorting agricultural
subsidies.
 A series of meetings of small groups of ambassadors in
recent months to brainstorm on ways to break the deadlock has
raised hopes that a deal could be done if members are flexible.
The U.S. ambassador to the WTO, Michael Punke, told Reuters
last week he was encouraged by China's approach in those
discussions and was waiting to see whether that would translate
into real negotiations.
 Lamy said he would call a meeting of the WTO on Feb. 2 to
review progress on January's intensified talks, preceded by a
meeting on Jan. 26 of key members -- the biggest trading powers,
those representing groups of smaller countries, and those
chairing areas of negotiation.
 Most members agreed that at some point the negotiations need
to move from a focus on individual areas such as agriculture and
industrial goods to a sense of what the overall package offers,
allowing countries to make cross-cutting trade-offs, he said.
 But that give-and-take could only take place once there was
substantive progress in the negotiating groups handling the
individual areas, he said.

 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
against the dollar on Tuesday but gave up gains as U.S. bond
yields edged higher and investors squared positions ahead of
the last Federal Reserve meeting of the year.
 After last week's deal to extend U.S. tax cuts for all
earners and the subsequent rise in long-dated yields, traders
said the market will watch closely for any sign that the Fed
could speed up or alter a $600 billion bond-buying program
designed to push long-term interest rates lower.

 Dolan said the euro, which began the week at $1.32 and hit
a three-week high near $1.35 overnight, could rally further if
it closes above $1.3450, with a move to $1.37 possible.
 But traders said that would likely require the Fed to sound
an aggressive note on its easing program. Markets expect the
central bank to reaffirm policy when it meets at 2:15 p.m.
while acknowledging improved economic data. [ID:nFEDAHEAD]
 The euro was last changing hands at $1.3383 ,
unchanged on the day. Earlier, it hit a three-week high of
$1.3498 after breaking $1.3475, the 38.2 percent retracement of
its November decline,

"
167,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2010 09:48AM ET</span>","FACTBOX-EU summit on treaty change, debt crisis steps"," Dec 14 (Reuters) - European Union leaders meet on Dec. 16-17
to approve a change in the EU's treaty that should lead to the
creation of a permanent mechanism for handling euro zone
financial and debt crises from mid-2013.
 The year-end, two-day summit will also discuss ways to
prevent the euro area's debt crisis escalating, given fears that
it could soon spread from Greece and Ireland to Portugal and
Spain. No firm decisions are expected on that front.
 Following is a look at what has been decided ahead of the
summit, what's formally on the agenda for the meeting and other
topics that could be raised by any of the 27 heads of state and
government attending.
 
 TREATY CHANGE
 The leaders will agree to amend the EU's Lisbon treaty,
which came into force a year ago, by adding the following
sentences to the existing article 136:
 ""The member states whose currency is the euro may establish
a stability mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro
area as a whole. The granting of financial assistance under the
mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality."" 
 Germany had demanded the change in large part out of concern
that its constitutional court could soon rule that bailouts of
euro zone countries are illegal.
 Three months ago, such a change to the treaty so soon after
it was passed was unthinkable. But after a deal was struck
between France and Germany in Deauville, France, in October, the
possibility of treaty change gained substantial currency.
 The aim is for the treaty amendment to be formally adopted
by member states in March 2011, allowing ratification by all 27
countries to take place by the end of 2012, so that the measures
can come into force from Jan. 1, 2013. 
 Lawyers and officials say that since the change is small and
adopted through a simplified procedure, no country should need a
national referendum to ratify it, smoothing its passage.

 EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM (ESM)
 This permanent aid mechanism will replace the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a 750 billion euro ($1
billion) EU-IMF-backed mechanism, when the EFSF expires in
mid-2013. At the same time, a smaller fund called the European
Financial Stability Mechanism will be absorbed into the ESM.
 Unlike the current aid facilities, the ESM will open the
possibility of private sector investors taking a loss in case of
a sovereign debt restructuring. The change is designed to
increase the pressure on euro zone governments to reduce
deficits and conduct sound fiscal policies so as to avoid the
threat of market-driven uncertainty.
 The ESM will provide financial support to euro zone
countries that suffer liquidity, but not solvency problems, so
its size is likely to be bigger than the EFSF.
 Finance ministers will discuss details of the fund in 2011.
 The threat of private bondholders taking a haircut -- or
writedown -- on sovereign bonds in the case of a default or
restructuring under the ESM has helped drive yields on the debt
of riskier countries such as Portugal and Spain higher in recent
weeks, exacerbating the crisis.
 
 EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY
 There are no formal plans to discuss the current aid
mechanism for the euro zone. But some leaders may privately
mention some ideas floated recently, such as increasing the size
of the fund, using it to buy government bonds or to provide
credit lines.
 European Central Bank Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said on
Tuesday the EFSF, of which the EU provides 440 billion euros,
should have ""maximum flexibility"" in its size and scope.
 The fund is being used to lend cash to countries that can no
longer borrow at normal rates on financial markets. The fund,
guaranteed by euro zone members, raises funds on international
markets at competitive rates as it enjoys a top credit rating.
There are strict conditions for receiving aid.
 So far, Ireland has been granted around 20 billion euros
from the EFSF to help its deficit and bank debt problems. Greece
has received aid via separate, bilateral EU loans.
 
 E-BONDS?
 The summit is not expected formally to discuss joint euro
area bonds, an idea resurrected last week by Italy and
Luxembourg. Germany opposes the plan firmly and is adamant that
it will not be raised for debate. So-called e-bonds would
effectively mean all euro zone member states sharing their
credit risk and debt issuance, which would drag Germany down.

 ECB'S CAPITAL INCREASE?
 Central bank sources have told Reuters the European Central
Bank is considering requesting an increase in its capital to
help cope with the rising costs of fighting the debt crisis.
 Although not on the summit's agenda formally, the leaders
may have an informal exchange on the issue.
 
 PENSION REFORM COSTS
 The leaders will briefly discuss demands of Poland and some
other countries that have overhauled their pension systems to be
allowed to write off part of the reform's costs from their
budget deficits and public debt, so as not to face EU budget
discipline steps.
 Details of the plan will be worked out by finance ministers
early in 2013 after Poland and the European Commission reached a
deal on the issue last week.
 
 EU BUDGET
 British Prime Minister David Cameron may reiterate his
demands for cuts in the EU budget in the bloc's next long-term
spending plan that will begin in 2014. This year's EU budget is
worth some 123 billion euros ($165 billion).
 At the EU summit in October, Cameron secured a leaders'
statement that the budget should reflect fiscal consolidation
carried out by many national governments.
 Some diplomats say Britain would like the budget to be cut
to 0.85 percent of the EU's economic output, from 1.0 percent
currently, but London has not confirmed this.
 The EU's 2011 budget has been put off the agenda since
governments and the European Parliament have reached a
last-minute deal on the spending plan.

 * FinMin to offer OFZ bonds to wider number of investors
 * Cbank to start basket repo operations in St Petersburg

 By Elena Fabrichnaya
 MOSCOW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Russia plans to upgrade its
financial markets in 2011, launching unified clearing system and
a bourse for big forex and debt players, opening up OFZ treasury
bond trading to more investors and offering simpler repo deals.
 ""The major project for the next year is a creation of the
treasury bourse,"" central bank board member Sergei Shvetsov told
a Repo-forum on Tuesday.
 Underdeveloped financial markets and the absence of a
centralised clearing system are among the problems faced by
investors in Russia, and reform is a key to President Dmitry
Medvedev's goal of developing it as a financial centre.
 Shvetsov said the new treasury bourse will be formed by
consolidating existing markets and will feature a common
clearing system for forex and bond trading, as well as for repo
and deposit operations and the central bank's loan auctions.
 ""It is a separate segment of the infrastructure, which
provides services for treasuries of the major banks without the
presence of internet brokers that service individuals,"" said
Shvetsov. ""It is implemented at Deutsche Bourse.""
 In December Deutsche Bourse  started talks with
Russia's two largest stock exchanges RTS and MICEX to form an
alliance to extend its clients' market reach. [ID:nLDE6B2104]
 Meanwhile MICEX and RTS have been in long-term talks about
the possibility of merging but an agreement between shareholders
has yet to be reached.
 ""We want to make a consolidated money market. If the merger
between MICEX and RTS succeeds, it will be even better,""
Shvetsov said.
 
 LIQUID OFZs
 A shake-up of Russia's markets will also see the Finance
Ministry choosing an exchange to hold its OFZ treasury bond
auctions, thus boosting access, Shvetsov said.
 The main bulk of government bonds trade currently takes
place on a separate section of the MICEX and only a limited list
of banks have access to it. This section is also used by the
Finance Ministry for primary placement of OFZ bonds.
 Shvetsov said the Finance Ministry will hold a contest among
Russian exchanges, including MICEX, to choose a platform for OFZ
placement once necessary amendments to the legislation are made.
 ""If such amendments are adopted, the door for OFZ placement
at exchanges will be opened and in one-two years' time the MICEX
section for government bonds will be dismantled,"" Shvetsov said.
 The RTS has repeatedly expressed interest in trading in OFZ
bonds, which are widely used by investors to park excessive
rouble liquidity.
 ""The main issue is to enhance the liquidity of government
papers. It will attract more investors as corporate and
government bonds will be traded at a common exchange,"" said
Vladimir Kolychev, an analyst at Rosbank.
 The government plans to place up to 200 billion roubles
worth of OFZ bonds in December to finance the budget, in
addition the around 680 billion roubles already placed since the
start of the year. [ID:nLDE6B91HI]
 
 REPO IN PETERSBURG
 Russia also plans to simplify repo operations with the
central bank -- a key source of money during periods of tight
market liquidity -- by trialling a new tool in St Petersburg.
 The central bank plans to start repo operation at the Saint
Petersburg currency exchange (SPCEX) by the middle of 2011,
taking a basket of securities as a collateral for transactions.
 ""The collateral will be a basket rather than a single paper.
There will be the possibility to replace securities within the
basket,"" Shvetsov said.
 Currently the central bank carries out repo transactions on
the MICEX exchange and on the interbank market on a straight
forward collateral basis.
 Shvetsov said the so-called ""basket repo"" will be later
implemented at the MICEX exchange.

 LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Investors have been sharply
cutting their exposure to bonds this month, concerned by higher
inflation expectations and as their appetite for riskier assets
has grown, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday.
 The U.S. investment bank's December survey of 302 fund
managers also showed rising confidence among investors about
future economic growth and corporate earnings growth.
 ""Investors feel almost compelled to invest in risk assets at
the moment, and that's down to the Fed,"" said Garry Baker, the
firm's European equity strategist.
 The Federal Reserve announced a $600 billion asset-buying
programme in November designed to pump ample liquidity into the
U.S. economy and hence global financial system.
 One ""victim"" of the return of risk appetite on financial
markets has been government bonds.
 The fund manager survey found that investors had cut their
exposure to bonds in December to the lowest level since April.
 Respondents to the survey were a net 47 percent underweight
in bonds versus 36 percent a month earlier, a number derived by
subtracting underweight positions from overweight ones.
 BofA-Merrill does not differentiate between bonds in its
questionnaire, but said there was widespread negativity towards
the asset class as a whole. The average position over the past
nine years has been 33 percent underweight.
 ""The overall message is still very optimistic on growth,""
Baker said.
 In contrast to bonds, investors were relatively bullish on
equities.
 A net 40 percent were overweight in equities in the survey,
slightly lower than the 41 percent in November but well above
the levels of summer.
 
 GROWTH
 Elsewhere in the survey, there was a large jump in the
percentage of respondents expecting higher economic growth over
the next 12 months.
 A net 44 percent now fit into this category compared with a
net 35 percent in November and 0 percent three months ago.
 Corporate profit expectations have also risen, with a net 51
percent expecting profits to improve over 12 months versus 36
percent last month.
 BofA-Merrill's composite risk appetite indicator, based on
the poll, was steady in the month, but at plus 45 was higher
than its long-term average of plus 40.

 * Central bank may seek funds to ward against bond losses
 * Trichet calls for more flexible euro zone rescue fund
 * Euro bonds off agenda at EU summit
 By Dave Graham and Sakari Suoninen
 BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Dec 14 (Reuters) - European Union
paymaster Germany said on Tuesday it was willing to give the
European Central Bank more capital if needed to help fight a
sovereign debt crisis that continues to shake the euro zone.
 ECB sources told Reuters on Monday that the central bank was
considering requesting a capital increase from euro zone states
to cover the risk of losses on government bonds it has bought to
support the 16-nation single currency area.
 A Berlin government official, briefing reporters ahead of an
EU summit on Thursday and Friday, said ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet might raise the matter at a dinner with EU leaders.
 ""The government supports the ECB in all that it deems
important ... If such a request comes, we will judge it
positively,"" said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He said the ECB had not yet made a formal request.
 The German official said a bigger ECB capital base would
show financial markets that the central bank had enough capital
to buy new government bonds if needed.
 One euro zone central bank source said the ECB was eyeing a
doubling of its subscribed capital of almost 5.8 billion euros,
which compares to a balance sheet of 138 billion euros,
according to its latest annual report.
 A euro zone financial source in Brussels confirmed that
raising the ECB's capital was one of the crisis management
options under discussion. The ECB declined comment.
 However, Trichet called in comments released on Tuesday for
EU leaders to give maximum flexibility in size and scope to the
euro zone's financial safety net, known as the European
Financial Stabiility Facility (EFSF).
 The rescue fund is limited by rules that specify it can only
be used as a last resort and a requirement to maintain a cash
buffer to preserve its top notch AAA credit rating.
 
 MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY
 A senior EU source said experts were exploring ways around
both restrictions to ensure the full 440 billion euros earmarked
for the fund can be lent, and to provide a flexible credit line
before a country is shut out of capital markets.
 ""On the EFSF, I can say we are calling for maximum
flexibility and I would say maximum capacity quantitatively and
qualitatively,"" Trichet said at a Frankfurt International
Business Journalists' Club event late on Monday.
 Ireland became the first country to seek assistance from the
EFSF this month as part of an 85 billion euro EU/IMF bailout
after a banking crash swelled its public debt. Heavily indebted
Greece received a separate 110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout in
May just before the rescue fund was created.
 The German official said no other country was in imminent
need of EFSF aid. But Portugal and Spain are under bond market
pressure to follow suit due to their high budget deficits and
loss of economic competitiveness.
 Spain had to pay a sharply higher yield than last month to
sell 2.51 billion euros in 12- and 18-month bills on Tuesday
after a renewed market sell-off that has driven up borrowing
costs for Madrid and other vulnerable euro zone sovereigns.
 Germany and its allies are seeking to prevent any discussion
at the summit of a proposal by two veteran EU finance ministers
for common euro zone bonds as a way to prevent speculation
against member states' debt and reduce their borrowing costs.
 The German official said the idea raised by Jean-Claude
Juncker, chairman of euro zone finance ministers, and Italian
Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti, would not be on the agenda.
 
 LOSSES FEARED
 ECB sources suggested the central bank wanted more capital
chiefly to protect itself against potential losses rather than
fund any major increase of euro zone government debt purchases.
 ""The issue is that the ECB is worried about potential losses
from its bond buying,"" one source said.
 ""At the moment we are buying very modest amounts, but what
if that is increased, and what if the bonds you buy are suddenly
worth 30 percent less?"" the source said, referring to the risk
of a writedown on a euro zone government's debt.
 The ECB disclosed on Monday that it had increased purchases
of euro zone government bonds to 2.667 billion euros ($3.5
billion) last week from 1.965 billion euros the previous week.
It was the biggest weekly total since June but well below levels
seen at the height of the euro zone crisis.
 Altogether, the ECB has bought 72 billion euros in bonds --
exclusively Greek, Irish and Portuguese, analysts believe --
since it began intervening in May to stabilise markets. 
 ECB policymakers have repeatedly signalled that the central
bank cannot bear the brunt of fire-fighting against bond market
attacks on highly indebted euro zone states, urging governments
to increase reform efforts and boost EU contingency funds.
 Trichet urged euro zone countries to take action to ensure
their banking sectors are ""appropriately restructured"". The ECB
is worried that ailing banks in weaker euro area countries have
become totally dependent on central bank funding, making it
harder to withdraw emergency liquidity support measures.
 Figures released on Tuesday showed Spanish banks borrowed
less from the ECB last month as funding conditions continued to
improve. But Greek banks became even more dependent on the ECB
lifeline, borrowing 95.1 billion euros in November, the Bank of
Greece said.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit three-week highs
versus the dollar and yen in thin trade on Tuesday, as investors
took the view that a recent rise in front-end U.S. yields had
gone too far, prompting a squeeze of euro shorts.
 The Australian dollar jumped to a one-month high above
parity with the U.S. dollar, helped by a rise in prices of gold
and other commodities such as copper and by broad dollar
weakness.
 Traders said investors were trimming positions ahead of a
U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting later on Tuesday. 
 The dollar's decline this week has coincided with a pullback
in U.S. Treasury yields and a Moody's warning it could move a
step closer to cutting the U.S. triple-A credit rating if a tax
and unemployment benefit package becomes law. [ID:nN13105751]
 ""We are still seeing the fallout from the potential
extension of a U.S. stimulus package, which has switched the
near-term focus for the dollar from a pro-growth story to
worries about fiscal stability,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 The euro edged off highs, however, after the S&P rating
agency said Belgium's sovereign debt could be downgraded within
six months, reminding investors of the risk of contagion from
the euro zone crisis. [ID:nWEA7396]
 The euro  rallied to $1.3500 on EBS trading platform,
up 0.7 percent on the day, its highest since Nov. 23, having
opened the week in Asia around $1.3205. It broke above key
resistance at $1.3475, the 38.2 percent retracement of the
euro's November decline.
 The euro also hit a three-week high at 112.22 yen
, shrugging off the weaker-than-forecast current
conditions element of the German ZEW survey. [ID:nDEP003410]
 By 1220 GMT it had edged back to $1.3465 and to 111.80 yen.
 Traders reported euro/dollar stop-loss orders lurking at and
above $1.3500, adding the rally looked to be driven by
speculators in a thin year-end market.
 ""The recent rise in front-end U.S. yields looks overdone as
core inflation isn't going to pick up quickly,"" said Gavin
Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 ""Also euro zone bond spreads seem to have stabilised on the
back of the recent ECB buying which has helped the euro.
 The European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of
government bonds last week, although the amount bought was still
well below levels reached last spring.
 The dollar fell broadly, hitting a three-week low versus a
currency basket at 78.819 <.DXY>. It slipped 0.5 percent to
82.97 yen  after eroding demand at 83.00.

(Adds details, background, quotes)
 By Ben Deighton
 BRUSSELS, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's cut its
outlook for Belgian debt to negative on Tuesday, flagging a new
risk for money markets as investors weighed prospects of higher
borrowing costs for one of the euro zone's most indebted states.
 If the country's inability to form a government threatened
deficit- and debt-reduction goals, S&P said Belgium'S AA+ rating
could be downgraded within six months.
 The strong warning places Belgium, which has a debt-to-GDP
level of almost 100 percent, among the riskier states in a
region being pummelled by a debt crisis that has led to bailouts
for Greece and Ireland amid concerns Portugal and Spain might
need rescuing too.
 In the latest in a series of negative rating moves on euro
zone states by the three main agencies, S&P said it was lowering
the outlook from stable to negative largely because of Belgium's
failure to form a new government since elections in June. 
 Analysts said they were not surprised by S&P's decision,
which was a clear sign the country needed to come up with a
comprehensive deficit-reduction plan soon.
 ""The key issue when it comes to Belgium, in contrast to most
other euro zone countries, is they don't really have a serious
fiscal consolidation package in place and obviously there's the
political uncertainty,"" said Nick Kounis at ABN Amro.
 ""The deficit doesn't look that bad, but of course the
government debt levels are high ... There is the contagion risk
in what is still quite a vulnerable environment.""
 The yield on Belgium 10-year government bonds rose, with the
spread over benchmark German Bunds -- a key indicator of
investment risk - widening by 10 basis points to 110 bps.
 That rise mirrored recent gains in equivalent yields on
peripheral euro zone bonds, but Belgium's spreads remain far
below those of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
 
 PROLONGED POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
 ""We believe that Belgium's prolonged domestic political
uncertainty poses risks to its government's credit standing,""
S&P said in a statement.
 ""We could lower the sovereign rating on Belgium one notch if
we conclude that the lack of consensus will result in the
government not being able to stabilise its debt trajectory. If
Belgium fails to form a government soon, a downgrade could
occur, potentially within six months.""
 S&P also had concerns about Belgium's ability to bring its
budget deficit down to a target of 4.1 percent next year, and a
gross borrowing requirement of about 11 percent of GDP.
 Belgium has been without a government since June, when a
parliamentary election failed to produce a clear winner.
Negotiations over forming a coalition administration have failed
to clinch an agreement and there is now the possibility of a new
election being held.
 Belgian officials have played down the risks, saying most of
the debt is 'Belgian-to-Belgian' rather than being money
effectively owed to foreign banks and other creditors. But those
reassurances may not hold if the debt crisis deepens further.
 ""Looking at the fundamentals, the Belgian economy does look
to be much more shielded than a country like Portugal,"" said
Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING. ""Nevertheless, having no
government... does contribute to instability and uncertainty.
Belgian politicians need to get their act together.""
 The International Monetary Fund said on Monday Belgium
needed to articulate a plan to reduce its deficit to prevent
debt market concerns undermining its economic recovery.
 Belgium's gross domestic product is expected to grow by 1.7
percent in 2011 versus about 2 percent in 2010 -- a rate driven
by strong exports and inventory rebuilding.
 ""Financial market concerns about sovereign risks in the euro
area, Belgium's high public debt and political uncertainty could
dampen confidence, increase financing costs for the economy, and
undermine the recovery,"" the IMF said.
 Among other debt agencies, Fitch has Belgium at AA+ with a
stable outlook amd Moody's at Aa1.
 S&P cut its outlook on Portugal's A- rating on November 30
while Fitch slashed Ireland by three notches to BB+ last week.

 * Targets reflect relatively dovish stance
 * China to aim for 8 pct GDP growth again

 By Langi Chiang and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China will set a 4 percent
target for consumer inflation next year, up from this year's 3
percent objective, state television said on Tuesday, an
indication that the government will desist from aggressive
tightening even as price pressures mount.	
 The slightly higher threshold for inflation was consistent
with another report in official media earlier in the day that
China will aim to cap new loans at about 7.5 trillion yuan
($1.1 trillion) next year, a more generous ceiling than many
in the market had been expecting.	
 ""The main targets for economic and social development set
by the central government for next year are that GDP will grow
by about 8 percent and the consumer price index will be capped
at about 4 percent,"" CCTV quoted Zhang Ping, head of the
powerful National Development and Reform Commission, as saying.	
 The 8 percent growth target is, as in past years, likely
to be a moot point. Most economists think the world's
second-largest economy will grow about 9 percent next year.	
 And although the 4 percent consumer price target is higher
than this year's, it is not new ground for China. In 2008
Beijing targeted an average of about 4.8 percent inflation and
it aimed for about 4 percent in 2009.	
 The comments by the NDRC's Zhang were the first official
statement of numerical targets for 2011 following the Central
Economic Work Conference, an annual leaders' meeting that
ended on Sunday and is key for setting policy for the coming
year.	
 Chinese leaders put more emphasis on the fight against
inflation in their statement after the conference, but also
vowed to strike a balance between ensuring price stability and
maintaining growth.	
 
 A 7.5 trillion yuan target for new loans next year, the
same as its target this year, would be one way for the
government to make clear it is not willing to sacrifice growth.	
 Control of credit issuance is one of the most important
monetary policy tools in China and many in the market had
assumed that Beijing would lower the new lending objective
next year as a way of tamping down on inflationary pressures.	
 But a report on the front page of the China Securities
Journal, citing an unnamed source described as authoritative,
suggested otherwise.	
 ""The Chinese economy is very big now and a target of 7.5
trillion yuan in new loans will not trigger all-round
inflation,"" the newspaper quoted the source as saying.	
 A Reuters poll of 26 economists forecast on Monday that
Beijing would aim to reduce the new lending target to 7
trillion yuan next year. [ID:nL3E6ND0QB]	
 
 RAISING RATES?	
 Most also forecast that the central bank would raise rates
before the end of 2010 and twice again in 2011 as part of a
campaign to control inflation, which quickened in November to
a 28-month high of 5.1 percent.	
 The newspaper also said the government would likely aim
for growth in the wider M2 measure of money supply of 16
percent in 2011, which would mark a slowdown from this year's
pace of roughly 20 percent.	
 ""The two targets are consistent with one another and the
logic is right, although we still need to wait for the
official announcement,"" said Hu Yuexiao, economist with
Shanghai Securities.	
 China will also use regulatory tools to restrict lending
next year, including ordering banks to raise their capital
adequacy ratios and to set aside more provisions for bad
loans, he said.	
 China's growth has been a bright spot in an otherwise
sluggish world economy following the global financial crisis.
But inflationary pressures have also picked up, prompting the
central bank to increase bank reserve ratios several times
this year and raise interest rates once.	
 
 MILD INFLATION	
 In its report, the China Securities Journal said the
country's policy focus would change over the course of the
year, with the battle against inflation likely to top the
agenda in the first half but supporting growth to remain the
overriding objective.	
 ""China's inflation will probably be higher in the first
half of next year and then ease in the second half. It may
peak in the second quarter. So policies in the next three to
six months will mainly to curb inflation,"" it said.	
 ""But inflation next year will not be as high as expected.
So monetary policy will favour quantitative measures. China
will be very cautious in raising interest rates. It will only
raise interest rates when inflation deteriorates,"" it added.	
 Hu at Shanghai Securities agreed with the inflation
outlook, but added that the new loan target of 7.5 trillion
yuan would add to price pressures, making it a must for the
central bank to raise interest rates.

 * Obama imposed duties on Chinese tyres in Sept. 2009

(Adds comments, details, background)
 BEIJING/GENEVA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China plans to appeal a
World Trade Organisation ruling that the U.S. was entitled to
impose extra safeguard duties on Chinese tyres, the Ministry of
Commerce said on Tuesday.
 China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its
website that it was ""deeply concerned"" about negative
consequences from the Monday ruling and condemned the U.S.
safeguard measures.
 ""The U.S. safeguard measures adopted toward Chinese tyres
are trade protectionism intended to shift domestic political
pressure. They are not in line with WTO rules and have been
widely criticized,"" the statement said.
 President Barack Obama imposed the 35 percent duties on
Chinese tyres in September 2009 after the United Steelworkers
union complained that surging imports of Chinese tyres were
hurting U.S. producers.
 WTO rules allow members to impose temporary extra tariffs on
goods to counter a destabilizing flood of imports.
 ""Facts have shown that safeguard measures do not fit with
China's interests and will not bring benefits to the U.S.,"" the
ministry statement said.
 It noted that employment rates in the U.S. tyre industry had
slid and tyre prices had risen since the measures were
implemented, hurting American consumers.
 The U.S. hailed the 219-page WTO dispute panel ruling when
it was released, just a day before the U.S.-China Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade is to convene in Washington.
 Those talks, chaired by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke
and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk for the U.S., with
Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan leading the Chinese delegation,
are likely to feature Washington's concerns about China's
""indigenous innovation"" policies which encourage government
bodies to buy technology developed domestically.
 Foreign companies are worried that in light of China's weak
enforcement of intellectual property, those policies which
require registering patents in, or shifting development
operations to China, would open the door to theft and
competition from lower-cost manufacturers.
 China is likely to voice similar concerns over what is sees
as protectionist U.S. policies and a closed investment
environment.
 In China's eyes, the U.S. may have ceded the moral high
ground with the 'Buy American' provision attached to U.S.
stimulus spending and the rejection of past Chinese investment,
including a 2005 CNOOC bid for Unocal that was blocked by U.S.
lawmakers.
 China has also made repeated calls for the U.S. to ease
high-tech export controls, arguing that it would help to balance
the massive U.S. trade deficit with China.

revealed the first nine electric vehicles that will be eligible
for their purchasers to receive subsidies of up to 5,000 pounds
($7,935) under a plan to promote low-carbon transport.
 Under the scheme, the government has pledged 43 million

 By Una Galani
 LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices consolidated on
Tuesday ahead of U.S. inventory data as investors were bullish
on the outlook for demand but wary over the prospect of a
Chinese rate rise.
 U.S. crude oil stocks were expected to have fallen last
week, according to a Reuters survey of analysts. Crude stocks
were estimated to be lower by 2.2 million barrels, with
distillate stockpiles seen down 500,000 barrels.
 Gasoline stockpiles were expected to be have risen by 1.8
million barrels.
 Implied oil demand in China rose to record high last month,
up 13.7 percent from a year earlier to nearly 9.3 million
barrels per day, Reuters calculations based on preliminary
official data showed.
 Signs of strong fundamentals and the absence of an interest
rate hike despite data which showed that inflation in China rose
to a 28-month high, up 5.1 percent in the year to November,
continued to support commodities, analysts said.
 U.S. crude for January slipped 3 cents to $88.58 a barrel by
0940 GMT. ICE Brent climbed 10 cents to $91.29 The dollar fell
0.22 percent against a basket of currencies.
 
 COLD WEATHER
 ""If nothing is going to be slowing their (China's) economy
down in the short term, the market views that as a positive,""
said David Taylor, analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
 Very cold weather across much of the northern hemisphere is
expected to keep heating energy demand above average for this
time of year, with temperatures in Europe forecast to fall
further in the coming days.
 While it is unclear how quickly China will move to tackle
inflation, the market appears to agree that monetary tightening
will not be aggressive.
 Investors polled by Reuters expect China to raise interest
rates before the end of this year, but then to increase them
just twice more in 2011.
 That echoes comments made to Reuters on Tuesday by Chen
Dongqi, a senior government researcher, who said that China will
steer clear of an aggressive increase of benchmark interest
rates because higher rates will only attract additional hot
money inflows.
 Analysts are gradually raising their oil price forecasts.
 Credit Suisse said on Tuesday it had raised its 2011
forecast for U.S. crude futures to $85 per barrel, an increase
of $12.50, citing a recovery in global oil demand.
 The price forecast was raised ""to reflect a recovery in OECD
demand (notably in North America) and continued strength in the
non-OECD (notably Asia)"", it said in a note.
 It also increased its 2011 outlook for ICE Brent by $12.7
per barrel to $84.5.

 * 2011 profit forecast raised to $9.1 billion from $5.3 bln
 GENEVA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The world's airlines will return
to profit this year and next at higher levels than previously
expected, due to an upturn in the market and better capacity
usage, industry association IATA said on Tuesday.
 However, margins remain low and the sector's recovery is
patchy, with European airlines underperforming those in other
regions, the International Air Transport Association said in its
latest financial forecast.
 ""Our profit projections increased for both 2010 and 2011
based on an exceptionally strong third-quarter performance,""
IATA Director-General Giovanni Bisignani said.
 ""But despite higher profit projections, we still see the
recovery pausing next year after a strong post-recession
rebound,"" he said in a statement predicting ""tougher
conditions"".
 IATA, representing 230 airlines covering 93 percent of
scheduled international traffic, almost doubled its estimates of
2010 and 2011 net profit for the sector from forecasts made in
September.
 It now sees 2010 net profit at $15.1 billion, against
September's forecast of $8.9 billion, and 2011 net profit of
$9.1 billion against a previous $5.3 billion. Last year, the
industry lost $9.9 billion.
 Net margins will fall to 1.5 percent in 2011 from 2.7
percent this year, after minus 2.1 percent in 2009.
 The return to profit should be set against industry revenues
forecast at $598 billion in 2011 and $565 billion this year, up
from $482 billion in 2009.
 ""Any increase in profits is a welcome step in the right
direction. But the fact that we can increase our profit forecast
by 70 percent and still be left with a net margin of just 2.7
percent shows just how far this industry has to go to achieve a
normal level of profitability,"" Bisignani said.
 This year's profit was based on an improved forecast of
passenger traffic growth of 8.9 percent, up from a previous
estimate of 7.7 percent, while average oil prices were in line
with previous projections of $79 a barrel.
 With fixed costs constant but higher passenger volumes
resulting in increased capacity utilisation, the increased
revenues went straight to the bottom line, said IATA.
 IATA trimmed its forecast for air cargo growth -- an
important indicator of world trade and hence economic recovery
-- to 18.5 percent this year from a previous 19.8 percent, as
the post-recession rebound from restocking abated.
 IATA sees passenger and cargo demand increasing by 5.2
percent and 5.5 percent respectively in 2011, both slightly
better than previous forecasts, while the average oil price was
expected to rise to $84 a barrel next year.
 It said European airlines, already industry laggards, would
remain barely in profit overall next year, under pressure from
recession and austerity measures in the region and increased air
travel taxes in some countries.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit three-week highs
versus the dollar and the yen in thin trade on Tuesday, as
investors took the view that the recent rise in front-end U.S.
yields had gone too far, prompting a squeeze of euro shorts.
 Traders said the market was lightening positions ahead of
the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later on Tuesday.
 ""The recent rise in front-end U.S. yields looks overdone as
core inflation isn't going to pick up quickly,"" said Gavin
Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 ""Also euro zone bond spreads seem to have stabilised on the
back of the recent ECB buying which has helped the euro,"" he
said.
 The European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of
government bonds last week, although the amount was still well
below levels reached last spring.
 The dollar's decline this week has coincided with an abrupt
drop in U.S. Treasury yields and a Moody's warning that it could
move a step closer to cutting the U.S. triple-A credit rating.
 The euro rallied to $1.3476 on trading platform EBS, its
highest since Nov. 23, having opened the week in Asia around
$1.3205. It stood at $1.3446, up 0.4 percent on the day, after
being capped by resistance at $1.3475, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the euro's November decline.
 ""It looks like it was more a squeeze of positioning than
anything else, particularly in the euro because we know the
market is well short,"" a trader at a U.S. investment bank said.
 Traders reported stop-loss orders lurking at $1.3490/1.3500,
adding the move looked to be driven by speculators in a thin
year-end market.
 The dollar fell broadly, hitting a three-week low versus a
currency basket at 78.952. It slipped 0.2 percent to 83.25 yen
after shedding 0.6 percent on Monday, with traders seeing
decent bids from 83.20 to 83.00.
 
 U.S. YIELDS FALL BEFORE FOMC
 Buyers for U.S. bonds emerged after benchmark Treasury
yields surged to six-month highs on Monday. This helped knock
the 10-year yield down to 3.28 percent from 3.39 percent.
 The yields fell even as Moody's said that if U.S. President
Barack Obama's tax and unemployment benefit package became law,
in a plan agreed last week, debt levels could rise, making a
negative outlook on the rating more likely.
 ""The dollar is under pressure as Treasury yields,
especially in the medium-term zone, have dropped quite
significantly ahead of the FOMC meeting,"" said Gen Kawabe,
manager at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.
 The Federal Reserve policy board meets later on Tuesday and
is expected to reaffirm its quantitative easing policy while
acknowledging the recent better run of data.
 ""The Fed will continue ploughing on with its QE stance. It
won't divert from its intention to buy $600 billion in
government debt until next spring at least,"" said Friend at
nabCapital.
 The Australian dollar was at $0.9973, near a one-month high
of $0.9983 hit on Monday.
 The Aussie rose above NZ$1.3250 for the first time since
late 2000, with the kiwi dollar coming under pressure after New
Zealand retail sales fell in October, leading the market to
further push out the timing of any hike in interest rates.

 By Phumza Macanda	
 JOHANNESBURG, Dec 14 (Reuters) - South Africa has eased
exchange controls further to let local institutions invest more
abroad in an attempt to offset a surge in foreign inflows which
have strengthened the rand.	
 But analysts saw limited immediate rand impact from the 5
percentage point rise in the amount institutional investors can
take offshore, announced by Treasury late on Monday ""as part of
a package of measures to respond to surging portfolio inflows"".	
 The rand is up nearly 30 percent against the dollar since
early 2009 as investors seek higher yields in emerging
economies
such as South Africa, putting pressure on government for steps
to stop currency strength harming business and costing jobs.	
 ""A move by government to free up offshore opportunities for
South African money is likely an attempt to ease appreciation
pressure on the rand by generating more two-way flows,"" said
Absa Capital in a note.	
 ""The increased prudential limits, in our view, are unlikely
to generate any significant depreciation pressure on the
currency, in our view, given that many fund managers in South
African have not used their existing limits.""	
 The new limits will allow different types of institutions
to
take between 25 and 35 percent of assets abroad.	
 ""Current analysis shows that a number of institutions, in
particular retirement funds, representing a significant portion
of the industry investable assets, could be constrained by the
current prudential foreign asset limit,"" Treasury said.	
 ""The prudential approach to regulating foreign exposure
aims
to manage and encourage two-way flows of capital, whilst
allowing a small, open economy such as South Africa, to respond
to external shocks with appropriate policy instruments.""	
 
 GRADUAL EASING	
 South Africa has gradually eased exchange controls in
recent
years and announced its intention of relaxing them further in
its medium-term budget statement in October. Reserve Bank
spokesperson Hlengani Mathebula said further details of the
measures would be released ""in the next few days"".	
 Inflows into the bond market have tripled this year,
compared with last year, pushing the rand to levels around
6.85 to the dollar. The rand was a touch stronger on Tuesday
after news of the policy change.	
 The strong rand has hurt exports by making them less
competitive and the manufacturing sector has shed thousands of
jobs -- prompting demands from union allies of the ruling
African National Congress to demand a weaker rand.	
 But the government has taken no drastic steps to weaken the
currency.	
 In September, the ANC rejected the idea of introducing a
tax on foreign inflows and the government has opted to support
the Reserve Bank to build reserves, which rose to $43.351
billion by the end of November.

weaken the rand by cutting interest rates, but it is seen as
unlikely to gain support in government and would not increase
competitiveness. [ID:nLDE6BC1YJ]

 * Parliament delays switch to allow for more preparation
 * Government says move will add to inflation in 2011
 * Analysts: healthier budget improves rating upgrade chance
(Updates with analyst quotes)	
 By Rieka Rahadiana	
 JAKARTA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament on
Tuesday approved a government proposal to stop private cars
using subsidised fuel but delayed its start, with the plan
expected to add to inflation and change gasoline buying by
Asia's top motor fuel importer next year. 
 The country's parliament argued state energy firm
Pertamina was not yet ready for the switch and delayed its
implementation for gasoline in the capital Jakarta until
end-March at the earliest, before the move is rolled out
across most of the archipelago by 2013.	
 The government bill, which had aimed to start limiting
cheap fuel use in the Jakarta area from the start of January,
will reduce the burden of costly oil imports on the budget,
but political analysts said it may prove unpopular in a
country that has previously seen huge protests over fuel price
hikes.	
 It is likely to curb imports of low-octane gasoline from
Asia's oil market, estimated at 6 million barrels a month. But
traders say any impact may be temporary while Pertamina may
have to increase imports of higher quality non-subsidised fuel
to cope with the change in demand. Indonesia imports about 2
million barrels of better quality 92-octane gasoline each
month. 
 While the move to wean motorists off subsidised fuel will
add to inflation, it will stabilise government finances and
reduce worries that a spike in global oil prices  could
force the government to sharply hike fuel prices.	
 ""The risk of surprise inflation due to abrupt fuel hikes
such as in 2005 and in 2008 is mitigated, "" said Helmi Arman,
economist at Bank Danamon in Jakarta. ""A healthy budget
structure will also help smooth Indonesia's road to investment
grade status."" 
 
 Analysts say the government needs to use the money spent
on subsidies to improve infrastructure, which would help draw
further foreign direct investment and improve the chances of
getting a coveted investment grade sovereign rating.	
 Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo, who hopes for
investment grade status for Southeast Asia's biggest economy
by next year to join BRIC nations such as Brazil and China,
told a heated and lengthy debate in parliament that the
postponement will add 7 trillion rupiah ($775.9 million) in
costs to the 2011 budget.	
 
 MAY FORCE RATE HIKE	
 The government said the move in the Jakarta region will
add to average inflation by 0.15 percent, with the rollout to
the rest of Java and Bali adding 0.29 percent, though its
budgeted target for inflation in 2011 was 5.3 percent, steady
with this year.	
 However, economists expect the plan to take inflation over
the central bank's upper target of 6 percent for 2011,
reinforcing expectations Bank Indonesia will need to raise
interest rates from a record low of 6.5 percent in coming
months. 
 ""What this new policy would certainly do to the economy is
to push inflationary pressures even higher, and support our
view that inflation may surge to 7 percent and above by
mid-2011,"" said Gundy Cahyadi, an economist at OCBC in
Singapore, who forecasts Bank Indonesia will hike rates by 100
basis points to 7.5 percent in 2011. 
 Juniman, an economist at Bank Internasional Indonesia in
Jakarta, said the delay to March would ease the inflationary
impact since that was the main harvest season and so increased
fuel costs would be offset by deflation in food prices.	
 The government planned to roll out the scheme to diesel in
Jakarta in July, to the rest of Java and Bali in July for
gasoline and October for diesel, with Sumatra island following
in 2012 and Borneo and Sulawesi by 2013. Motorbikes and public
transport will still be able to use subsidised fuel.	
 Analysts say the move could temporarily dampen record car
sales by firms such as Toyota and PT Astra
International . Investors have been betting on firms
exposed to strong domestic demand that is driving the economy.	
 ""We think the risk on growth is manageable. There is still
plenty of excess capacity in the economy, and given the
relatively high amount of financing sources and investment
potential, we believe that Indonesia should still chalk at
least a 6 percent growth next year,"" said OCBC's Cahyadi.

 * Level target would reflect view that inflation manageable
(Adds comments, background)	
 By Langi Chiang and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China will probably target a
limit of about 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) in new loans
next year, the same as this year's target, a leading official
newspaper reported on Tuesday, an indication that policy could
be slightly looser than expected.	
 Control of credit issuance is one of the most important
monetary policy tools in China and many in the market had
assumed that Beijing would lower the new lending objective
next year as a way of tamping down on inflationary pressures.	
 But the report on the front page of the China Securities
Journal, citing an unnamed source described as authoritative,
suggested otherwise.	
 ""The Chinese economy is very big now and a target of 7.5
trillion yuan in new loans will not trigger all-round
inflation,"" the newspaper quoted the source as saying.	
 A Reuters poll of 26 economists forecast on Monday that
Beijing would aim to reduce the new lending target to 7
trillion yuan next year. [ID:nL3E6ND0QB]	
 Most also forecast that the central bank would raise rates
before the end of 2010 and twice again in 2011 as part of a
campaign to control inflation, which quickened in November to
a 28-month high of 5.1 percent.	
 
 The newspaper also said the government would likely aim
for growth in the wider M2 measure of money supply of 16
percent in 2011, which would mark a slowdown from this year's
pace of roughly 20 percent.	
 ""The two targets are consistent with one another and the
logic is right, although we still need to wait for the
official announcement,"" said Hu Yuexiao, economist with
Shanghai Securities.	
 China will also use regulatory tools to restrict lending
next year, including ordering banks to raise their capital
adequacy ratios and to set aside more provisions for bad
loans, he said.	
 China's growth has been a bright spot in an otherwise
sluggish world economy following the global financial crisis.
But inflationary pressures have also picked up, prompting the
central bank to increase bank reserve ratios several times
this year and raise interest rates once.	
 Chinese leaders gave greater prominence to the fight
against inflation in their statement on Sunday at the end of
the Central Economic Work Conference, an annual meeting at
which they chart policy for the coming year. [ID:nTOE6BB00G]	
 But at the same time as vowing to focus on price
stability, they also said that they will strike a balance
between controlling inflation and maintaining growth.	
 
 MILD INFLATION	
 In its report, the China Securities Journal said the
policy focus would change over the course of the year, with
the battle against inflation likely to top the agenda in the
first half but supporting growth to remain the overriding
objective.	
 ""China's inflation will probably be higher in the first
half of next year and then ease in the second half. It may
peak in the second quarter. So policies in the next three to
six months will mainly to curb inflation,"" it said.	
 ""But inflation next year will not be as high as expected.
So monetary policy will favour quantitative measures. China
will be very cautious in raising interest rates. It will only
raise interest rates when inflation deteriorates,"" it added.
Hu at Shanghai Securities agreed with the
inflation outlook, but added that the new loan target of 7.5
trillion yuan would add to price pressures, making it a must
for the central bank to raise interest rates.
He added that he expected Beijing to set an
annual inflation target of 3 percent for 2011, the same as
this year, so as to anchor expectations.
""The government has shown no tolerance for the
current level of inflation. So it will not set a higher target
and risk guiding expectations upwards,"" he said.
The China Securities Journal said that China's
five biggest lenders were aiming to maintain new lending at
unchanged levels next year from this year, while smaller banks
were talking about an expansion.	
 The newspaper said the targets had not yet been finalised.

 * More violent moves seen in thin year-end markets
 * Aussie hits 10-year highs vs kiwi after NZ data disappoints
 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near its
high for December against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday with
traders citing solid buying from accounts including Asian central
banks that overwhelmed hedge fund selling.
 The sudden jump triggered a wave of stop-loss buying and
forced some traders to lighten their dollar long positions ahead
of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later in the day.
 ""The upswing in euro caught many flatfooted,"" said David
Watt, a currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The sharp moves, however, highlighted the thin and choppy
year-end trading conditions that are likely to persist as more
and more investors close their books for the upcoming holidays.
 ""Many players are absent, leaving the market driven by
short-term trading,"" said a trader at a European bank in Tokyo.
 The dollar's decline also followed an abrupt drop in U.S.
Treasury yields and Moody's warning that it could move a step
closer to cutting the U.S. triple-A credit rating.
 Improved appetite for riskier assets on growing optimism
about the U.S. economy and China keeping interest rates on hold
all conspired to push the greenback down more than 1 percent
against a basket of major currencies.
 ""It looks like it was more a squeeze of positioning than
anything else. Particularly in the euro because we know the
market is well short,"" a trader at a U.S. investment bank said.
 ""I'd suggest a lot of that very short hot money positioning
has been taken out of play, so we should get back to quieter
ranges in Asia.""
 The euro was at $1.3395, little changed on the day and off
Monday's high of as $1.3434.
 The trader said he expected the euro to struggle above
$1.3400 and resistance ahead of parity to cap the Aussie.
 Its Dec. 6 high of $1.3452 is also seen as near-term
resistance.
 A break of that level would take it to a three-week high,
though persistent worries over the debt of peripheral countries
in the euro zone means the euro faces an uphill battle to clear
that point.
 Indeed The European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of
government bonds last week, although the amount was still well
below levels reached last spring.
 Hideki Amikura, forex manager at Nomura Trust and Banking,
said he expected the euro to keep falling in the longer term
towards parity against the dollar
 But he added that strength in the German economy could be
expected to counter the effect of debt worries from time to time,
making the euro highly volatile.
 ""Germany has had negative interest rates for quite a long
time. German manufacturers are doing very well now and the DAX
index has been rising sharply. That should certainly worry
(European Central Bank policy maker and Bundesbank head Axel)
Weber,"" he said.
 The dollar was little moved against the yen at 83.48 yen
after shedding 0.6 percent on Monday.
 ""The dollar is under pressure as Treasury yields, especially
in the medium-term zone, have dropped quite significantly ahead
of the FOMC meeting,"" said Gen Kawabe, manager at Chuo Mitsui
Trust and Banking.
 BOND BUYERS EMERGE
 Buyers for U.S. bonds emerged after benchmark Treasury yields
surged to six-month highs. This helped knock the 10-year yield
down to 3.28 percent from 3.39 percent.
 The yields fell even as Moody's said if U.S. President Barack
Obama's tax and unemployment benefit package became law, in a
plan agreed by Obama and Republican leaders last week, debt
levels could rise lifting the likelihood of a negative outlook on
the rating.
 The Federal Reserve policy board meets later on Tuesday and
is expected to reaffirm its quantitative easing policy even while
acknowledging the better run of data recently.
 Commodity currencies shone on record high copper prices and
gains in other metals such as gold.
 The Australian dollar put on nearly 1.5 cents on Monday to
come close to testing parity. It was last at $0.9959, near a
one-month high of $0.9983 hit on Monday.
 The Aussie hit NZ$1.3258 for the first time since late 2000,
with the kiwi dollar coming under pressure after New Zealand
retail sales slumped in October, leading the market to further
push out the timing of any hike in interest rates.

 By Ronald Popeski	
 SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks advanced on
Tuesday, supported by optimism that China would shun
aggressive measures to curb inflation that could inhibit its
strong economic growth or blunt its voracious demand for raw
materials.	
 The euro hovered near three-week highs against a broadly
weaker dollar, with traders citing solid buying from accounts,
including Asian central banks, though year-end trading was
thin and choppy. 
 European stocks were seen mostly unchanged, halting a
two-week rally, as traders awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's
last scheduled meeting of 2010 later in the day. 
 Analysts expected the Fed to remain in a holding pattern
as officials evaluate the recent launch of a bond-buying
programme and the health of the U.S. economic recovery after a
spate of encouraging data. Fed officials will likely revise
their economic outlook to reflect stronger growth after the
White House and Republicans agreed to extend tax breaks and
provide a payroll tax cut. [ID:nN13201941]	
 ""Sentiment is decidedly more upbeat now than it was a few
weeks ago,"" said Austock senior client adviser Michael
Heffernan.	
 ""China didn't increase rates, Ireland has settled down,
America has given the tick to the tax bill and there is no
major domestic data out."" 
 The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside of Japan
rose 0.4 percent, bringing its gains so far
this year to around 13 percent, while the Nikkei edged
up 0.2 percent.	
 South Korean stocks hit a fresh 37-month high,
breaching the psychologically significant 2,000-point level,
fuelled by gains in key technology issues and automakers such
as Hyundai Motors , which rose 1.4 percent.	
 Shares of resources companies in Asia were also bolstered
by a jump in metals prices after Chinese weekend data showed
industrial production remained buoyant.	
 Many investors had feared China would raise interest rates
last week to curb mounting inflationary pressures, but the
central bank opted instead to further increase the amount of
extra capital top banks must hold. [ID:nL3E6ND0F6]	
 An official newspaper said on Tuesday China would probably
target the same level of new loans next year as in 2010, a
further indication that policy could be slightly looser than
expected.	
 ""The Chinese economy is very big now and a target of 7.5
trillion yuan in new loans will not trigger all-round
inflation,"" the front-page report in the Chinese Securities
Journal said.	
 A Reuters poll released on Monday showed economists still
see a rate rise in China in coming months, but expect
policymakers to rely more on lending controls in 2011 as their
weapon of choice in the fight against mounting price
pressures. [ID:nL3E6ND0QB]	
 
 MOODY'S WARNING RATTLES DOLLAR	
 The dollar remained soft after a warning from Moody's
overnight. 
 The credit ratings agency said it could move a step closer
to cutting America's triple-A rating if the Obama
administration's deal to extend tax cuts wins Congressional
approval and pushes up already bloated debt levels.

 The dollar index against a basket of other major
currencies slipped marginally to 79.24, having plumbed
a three-week low of 79.101 on Monday. The euro was at $1.3386,
having risen as high as $1.3433 . 
 Helped by high metals prices, commodity currencies shone.
The Australian dollar almost hit a month high and could come
close to testing parity. It hovered at $0.9959 . 
 In New York on Monday, the broad S&P 500 index
closed flat and the Dow ended just above break-even
amid signs U.S. stocks may be nearing overbought levels, and
on investor caution about staking out new positions heading
into year-end.

Commissioner Mario Monti joined the euro zone debt crisis
debate on Tuesday by proposing in the Financial Times four
""improvements"" to stop Europe's ""short term tendencies.""
 Monti, the president of Bocconi University in Milan, said
in a column in the newspaper that Germany should ""lead the
adoption in Europe of structurally correct and long-term
oriented policies, rather than policies inspired by short-term
concerns.""
 EU leaders are due to discuss the debt crisis at a summit
on Thursday and Friday but are not expected to announce any new
measures to ease some investors' concerns about the region's
debt.
 The role of the European Commission, the EU's executive
arm, should be increased more than already envisaged, Monti
said in the column, at the expense of the body that represents
member states.
 ""The place where enforcement measures tends to be bent by
national influences is not the commission, as implied by the
framework, but the council itself,"" he said.
 The region should also refrain from considering that all
public spending is inherently bad and that public investment to
boost growth prospects should not be financed by debt, he
said.
 Another improvement would be to design adjustment paths for
debt-laden countries that maintain pressure to adopt structural
belt-tightening measures without triggering recessions.
 Monti also supported the creation of common European
sovereign bonds, which has been suggested by Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and Italy's Finance Minister
Giulio Tremonti but rejected by Germany and France.
 ""If the European parliament pushes the council to introduce
these improvements, the EU will have shown it can indeed make
progress under the pressures of crises,"" he said.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A stock rally fizzled on Wall
Street on Monday as investors took profits and the dollar fell
after Moody's warned it may change its U.S. outlook if a
tax-cut deal is adopted.
 Strong Chinese economic data lifted commodity prices, with
copper prices setting a record high and crude oil surging
before meeting resistance above $89 a barrel on concern about
further anti-inflation measures by China. For details see
[ID:nL3E6ND071]
 The broad S&P 500 index closed flat and the Dow ended just
above break-even as optimism faded over China's move to tame
inflation and on concerns about a 5.1 percent run-up in the S&P
so far in December. [ID:nN13224361]
 The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 5.1 percent so far in
December.
 ""We've had a decent run-up over the last week or so and the
market started out strong, but we saw a bit of profit-taking at
the end,"" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at Oakbrook

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 18.24
points, or 0.16 percent, at 11,428.56. The Standard & Poor's

 The dollar slid after Moody's said it could move a step
closer to cutting the United States' Aaa rating if President
Barack Obama's tax and unemployment benefit package becomes
law.
 The plan agreed to by Obama and Republican leaders last
week could push up debt levels, the ratings agency said.
 ""This move is coming as the market starts to price in the

218,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2010 05:32PM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-Canada warns on rising risk of debt," * Ottawa concerned by rising Canadian personal debt 
 * Low interest rates bring risks, Bank of Canada warns
 * Canada could tighten mortgage rules-Flaherty
 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Mounting personal debt levels
pose a significant threat to Canada's economy and borrowers
must recognize that interest rates are only going to rise,
Canada's top policy makers warned on Monday.
 In an assault on the spendthrift habits of a generation,
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, Prime Minister Stephen
Harper and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty all warned of the
risks that debtors will face once interest rates climb steeply
from their still historically low post-recession levels.
 ""Household debt in Canada is now at a record high, is now
higher than it is in the United States,"" Carney told a news
conference in Toronto.
 ""At a minimum for us at the bank we have to think about
what the implications of this are for how the economy performs
if there is an adjustment to housing prices. Because then the
wealth is less...and what's the impact of that on consumption
in Canada.""
 Data from Statistics Canada on Monday showed Canadian
household debt has risen to a record C$6.1 trillion ($6.04
trillion), or 148 percent of disposable income, although
households have recovered the C$552 billion of net worth lost
in the downtown. [ID:nN13203720]
 Canada, like other countries, slashed interest rates to
rock-bottom levels as the recession hit, and while the Bank of
Canada has nudged rates up since, borrowing costs remain low.
 Harper said it is up to individuals to decide how much debt
they can carry, but he highlighted new mortgage rules designed
to discourage a sharp rise in household debt. [ID:nN13211532]
 ""We continue to warn Canadian households that interest
rates are unlikely to go down in the future,"" he said.
 Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said the government would
tighten mortgage rules further if needed, but he was not
concerned enough now to take immediate action. [ID:nN13222199]
 ""There is no reason for extreme concern now. There is
reason for concern, so I watch,"" he said in Ottawa. ""Part of
what I have to do is balance the amount of credit we see out
there with the job creation that we see in the economy as
well.""
 But BMO Capital Markets said household finances are not
nearly as weak as headlines would suggest and there is room for
a soft landing for spending.
 ""Amid the cacophony of warnings, balance sheet repair is in
fact quietly underway among Canadian households thanks to a
slight rise in savings and firmer equity markets, while
debt growth is poised to slow more meaningfully amid the clear
cooling in the housing market,"" Deputy Chief Economist Doug
Porter said in a report.
 CHEAP MONEY NOT A GROWTH STRATEGY
 Carney warned on the risks of what is likely to be a
prolonged period of low interest rates in advanced economies
and said banks, firms and individuals should be aware that the
era of cheap money would inevitably end. [ID:nN13195274]
[ID:nN13208981]
 ""Low rates today do not necessarily mean low rates
tomorrow,"" Carney said. ""Cheap money is not a long-term growth
strategy.""
 In its financial system review last week, the bank said the
rapid growth of household debt is the main domestic source of
risk, with system-wide disruption more likely if more people
become incapable of paying off their debt. [ID:nN09234033]
 The Bank of Canada raised rates three times this year, but
held its benchmark rate steady at 1 percent last week, citing
European debt concerns and weak exports as drags on growth.
 Carney said any further interest rate hikes in Canada would
require careful consideration, but he also distanced Canada's
situation from in the United States. The Canadian economic was
stronger, so deserved a different monetary policy.

 * Traders say LatAm, East Europeans favoring euro
(Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Dec. 13 (Reuters) - U.S. deficit concerns
returned to the forefront of foreign exchange trading on
Monday, pushing the dollar lower after Moody's said a tax-cut
deal reached last week by the White House and Republicans could
shift its outlook on the United States' top credit rating.
 A U.S. tax cut deal could swell the budget deficit at a
time when the Federal Reserve is committed to accommodative
monetary policy.
 U.S. trade and budget deficit concerns have traditionally
worried investors but they have been overshadowed in recent
years by the collapse of the housing market, bad mortgages and
their weight on the banking and financial system.
 Now, as the economy appears to be recovering, investor
focus has shifted back to the budget deficit.
 ""This move is coming as the market starts to price in the
impact of the tax cut deal, and while Moody's saying it
increases the chances of a negative outlook on U.S. ratings
isn't new, traders can't help but contemplate the 'what if'
scenario,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 strategy
at BofA Merrill Lynch.
 The budget concerns follow a rise in U.S bond yields that
began last week, with the 10-year yield hitting a six-month
high, though important support levels held so far on Monday.
 The euro was up 1.2 percent at $1.3390, while the dollar
fell 1.3 percent against the Swiss franc to 0.9679 francs, a
typical safe haven. The dollar also fell against the yen, down
0.6 percent to 83.41 yen.
 HOLIDAYS APPROACH
 Volume was lower than usual as the holidays approached, and
traders said the euro could run into resistance.
 Some said the market was wary of getting stretched ahead of
a European Union summit this week that some hope will result in
a permanent support mechanism for troubled euro zone countries.
The euro's rise pushed the single currency back through the
38.2 percent retracement of the move from June to November, but
three-month risk reversals hinted at euro weakness.
 Three-month euro/dollar risk reversal was at -2.101 on
Monday, according to Reuters data, with a bias to euro puts and
dollar calls. A negative risk reversal shows greater demand for
put options relative to calls and shows more options players
betting the currency will fall than rise.
 But the focus Monday was squarely on U.S. tax cuts.
 While the tax cut deal has led many economists to upgrade
their U.S. growth forecasts and boosted equities, traders say
the rise in U.S. yields was also driven by debt worries.
 Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said
markets are confident the deal will indeed boost growth, and
that helped lift the dollar last week.
 But he said they also fear that with unemployment near 10
percent, the U.S. central bank will nonetheless press on with a
$600 billion bond-buying program to keep long-term rates low.
That, together with tax cuts, may swell a budget deficit
already in excess of $1 trillion.
 ""You may see growth in the 3-4 percent area next year, but
that will cause inflation."" he said. ""And it's going to take an
act of God to get the Fed to trim its bond buying. That's what
people are concerned about.""
 The Fed holds its last policy meeting of the year on
Tuesday.
 The EU's two-day summit begins on Thursday, and leaders are
expected to tweak the EU treaty, paving the way to create a
European Stability Mechanism from 2013, when a temporary
mechanism expires.

 * Deal to allow diversification of trade revenue
 BRASILIA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Nearly a dozen developing
countries led by Brazil and India will sign an accord this week
to cut tariff barriers and boost trade among themselves, a
senior Brazilian government official said on Monday.
 Negotiations under the Global System of Trade Preferences
Among Developing Countries were relaunched in 2005 in an
attempt to diversify developing countries' trade revenue and
reduce their dependence on rich countries.
 Around 43 countries are signatories to the original GSTP
agreement from 1988, and 11 countries will sign the updated
accord in southern Brazil this week.
 Under the deal, countries will cut applied tariffs by 20
percent on 70 percent of their products.
 ""So far the GSTP had no importance at all ... it was more
political, now it has become an instrument for opening trade,""
Carlos Marcio Cozendey, head of the Brazilian foreign
ministry's department of economics, told a news conference.
 The agreement covers fast-growth economies with combined
gross domestic product of around $5 trillion and nearly
one-third of the world's population.
 The other signatories are Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay,
Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Morocco, Egypt and Cuba.
 But the accord's ability to generate large new trade flows
is likely to be limited, as countries are granted significant
exemptions and tariffs could remain prohibitive if they were
high to begin with.
 In addition, some countries do not have proper trade ties
or adequate infrastructure to act on the new incentives.
 ""It's an accord that allows you to protect your sensitive
goods but gives you a larger number of small preferences on a
big array of products,"" said Cozendey.
 ""It's an agreement to open new opportunities, it doesn't
focus on existing trade.""
 In Brazil, manufacturers are more likely than farmers to
benefit from new access to markets in Asia and elsewhere.
 Critics say the administration of outgoing President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva focused too much on building stronger ties
with other developing countries, while neglecting its
traditional partners in Europe and the United States.

 WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators, armed
with a new report on piracy and counterfeiting in China, urged
Beijing on Monday to step up efforts to protect American
movies, software and other goods from illegal copying.
 ""China continually fails to protect and enforce American
intellectual property rights and discriminates against American
businesses,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said
in a statement accompanying the U.S. International Trade
Commission study.
 Baucus and Senator Charles Grassley, who requested the
report earlier this year, timed its release to coincide with
high-level U.S.-China talks taking place in Washington.
 ""Small steps and empty promises won't cut it when American
jobs are on the line. This week's U.S.-China trade talks are
the perfect opportunity for China to make serious commitments
to address these issues. It is time for action,"" Baucus said.
 Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan is leading a delegation of
nearly 100 officials in the U.S.-China Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade meeting, led on the U.S. side by Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk.
 The report is the first of two the ITC is doing for the
Senate Finance Committee.
 In the second one, due in May, the ITC will try for the
first time to estimate the damage done to the U.S. economy by
Chinese piracy and counterfeiting.
 It will also try to quantify the impact of China's
""indigenous innovation"" policies, a set of regulations designed
to promote innovation within China and to reduce the country's
dependence on foreign technology and companies.
 Those policies could require foreign companies to transfer
ownership and development of intellectual property to China in
order to participate in that country's huge government
procurement market, the ITC said.
 ""China has committed to protect U.S. intellectual property.
But this report shows that China isn't living up to its
commitments. It's a serious problem,"" Grassley said.
 The ITC report found serious problems with the enforcement
of intellectual property rights laws throughout China.
 The low number of criminal prosecutions and relatively
small damage awards in civil cases contributes to widespread
piracy of software, music and movies, both over the Internet or
in physical form such as CDs and DVDs, the ITC report said.
 ""Similarly, trademarks for goods and service of all kinds
are routinely counterfeited; from luxury goods to high-volume
commodities, few products are immune from illegal imitation in
China. The patents and trade secrets of U.S. firms are also
infringed in China,"" the report said.
 U.S. companies see China's indigenous innovation policies
""as potentially reducing business opportunities in China's
fast-growing economy,"" it said.
 The polices, in the works since last year, are often
embedded in government procurement, technical standards,
anti-monopoly, and tax regulations or laws.
 ""The indigenous innovation 'web of policies' is expected to
make it difficult for foreign companies to compete on a level
playing field in China,"" the report said.

 * Partial mutualisation of debt would lower borrowing costs
 * Blue Debt proposal keeps incentive for sound fiscal policy
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Angela Merkel was so determined to
kill off the idea of issuing common European bonds that, having
tried to squelch it, the German chancellor reversed over it
several times last week to make sure it was dead.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, anxious to stay in
Germany's slipstream and avoid any threat to France's top notch
credit rating, joined her in swatting the suggestion, for now.
 But the ""E-bond"" proposal championed by Jean-Claude Juncker,
the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, and Italian Economy
Minister Giulio Tremonti won't go away because it makes sense.
 ""I'm convinced we'll end up doing it, because it's obviously
the most effective solution,"" said Jean-Herve Lorenzi, president
of the Cercle des Economistes, a French economic think-tank.
""Everyone thinks it's a good idea but it can't be brought into
play for the moment.""
 The euro zone debt crisis may have to get much worse before
Germany, Europe's chief paymaster and stickler for budget
discipline, is prepared to accept such a quantum leap in
European fiscal integration.
 For weeks, financial markets and the International Monetary
Fund have been sending European governments the message that
piecemeal country-by-country bailouts, with loans at punitive
rates tied to draconian austerity, won't solve the problem.
 ""Rescued"" countries such as Greece and Ireland risk being
trapped in a debt deflation spiral of pay cuts, public spending
cuts and tax rises leading to economic stagnation or contraction
that yields smaller revenues, forcing still harsher cuts.
 Even if Athens and Dublin apply EU/IMF adjustment programmes
to the letter, despite popular protest, they will end up with
smaller economies to pay off larger debts.
 Small peripheral euro zone countries and their banks may
remain shut out of credit markets, forcing them towards default
if the European Central Bank withdraws emergency cash lifelines.
Larger states such as Spain and Italy that may be ""too big to
save"" risk being sucked into the morass.
 By creating a large, liquid eurobond market almost as big as
the market for U.S. Treasuries, the Juncker/Tremonti plan could
deter speculation against individual member states and reduce
their governments' borrowing costs.
 A European Debt Agency would issue collectively guaranteed
""E-bonds"" to cover part of member states' borrowing at a uniform
low interest rate. But countries would have to emit the rest of
their debt nationally, without a European guarantee, and pay
correspondingly higher market rates.
 French economist Jacques Delpla and German colleague Jakob
von Weizsaecker made a similar proposal in a paper issued by the
Bruegel think-tank, suggesting EU countries pool national debt
worth up to 60 percent of gross domestic product -- the limit
set in the EU treaty -- as senior ""Blue Bonds"".
 The remaining junior ""Red Bonds"" would be issued nationally,
with clauses allowing for an orderly default. An independent
stability council would propose the allocation of ""Blue Bonds""
based on a review of national budgets.
 Most euro zone countries have public debt well over the 60
percent limit and rising. Greece is set to reach 143 percent of
GDP this year, Italy around 118 percent, Belgium 100 percent,
Ireland's bank liabilities have pushed public debt up to 95
percent, while France is uncomfortably high at 83 percent.
 Germany fears ""E-bonds"" would raise its own borrowing costs
-- the lowest in the EU -- and make it subsidise profligate
states. It also believes a common euro bond would reduce market
discipline on countries to reduce their budget deficits.
 But neither concern is entirely justified. The European
Primary Dealers Association -- bond-market professionals with no
political axe to grind -- reckoned in a 2008 study that a common
European bond would lower borrowing costs for all, including
Berlin, because of the scale and liquidity of the market.
 The fact that member states would have to pay a higher
interest rate on national borrowing beyond the European limit
should preserve a strong incentive for sound fiscal policy.
 The costs to Germany of further, bigger euro zone bail-outs,
or of defaults by states that owe billions to German banks, not
to mention wider the economic damage from a worsening European
crisis, should make ""E-bonds"" seem a cheaper alternative.
 The main legal hurdle to any common bond issuance or mutual
credit guarantee is the principle of national liability for
public debt, enshrined in the EU treaty's ""no bailout"" clause.
 There is no European sovereign to emit European sovereign
bonds. But there are legal precedents for collective borrowing.
 The European Commission already issues bonds guaranteed by
the community budget to fund a balance of payments facility,
which has lent money to EU members Hungary, Latvia and Romania.
 The European Investment Bank borrows with a joint guarantee
of EU states to finance regional development projects.
 Berlin got around the ""no bailout"" principle to lend money
to Greece in a multilateral bailout in May, arguing that
Germany's own financial stability was at stake. The Federal
Constitutional Court approved.
 Clever lawyers will find a way.
 The biggest political challenge for any system of E-bonds is
to agree on who should determine the allocation of credit and
set the fiscal conditions.
 Germany does not trust the European Commission to enforce
budget discipline, which is one reason why it insisted the IMF
must be a key player in bailout programmes in Europe.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a pro-European
veteran, who has been less dismissive of ""E-bonds"" than Merkel,
questioned whether EU governments would be willing to accept the
degree of intrusion in their budget policies which such fiscal
integration would require.
 But they too may soon fine the alternatives more expensive
and frightening.

(Recasts; updates prices, adds details, comment)
 NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - U.S. deficit concerns returned
to the forefront of foreign exchange trading on Monday, pushing
the dollar lower after Moody's said a tax-cut deal reached last
week by the White House and Republicans could shift its outlook
on the United States' top credit rating.
 A U.S. tax cut deal could swell the budget deficit at a
time when the Federal Reserve is committed to accommodative
monetary policy. [ID:nN13291856]
 U.S. trade and budget deficit concerns have traditionally
worried investors but they have been overshadowed in recent
years by the collapse of the housing market, bad mortgages and
their weight on the banking and financial system.
 Now, as the economy appears to be recovering, investor
focus has shifted back to the budget deficit.
 ""This move is coming as the market starts to price in the
impact of the tax cut deal, and while Moody's saying it
increases the chances of a negative outlook on U.S. ratings
isn't new, traders can't help but contemplate the 'what if'
scenario,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 strategy
at BofA Merrill Lynch.
 The budget concerns follow a rise in U.S bond yields that
began last week, with the 10-year yield hitting a six-month
high, though important support levels held so far on Monday.
 The euro was up 1.4 percent at $1.3418 , while the
dollar fell 1.5 percent against the Swiss franc to 0.9653
francs , a typical safe haven. The dollar also fell
against the yen, down 0.9 percent to 83.18 yen .
 HOLIDAYS APPROACH
 Volume was lower than usual as the holidays approached, and
traders said the euro could run into resistance. Some said the
market was wary of getting stretched ahead of a European Union
summit this week that some hope will result in a permanent
support mechanism for troubled euro zone countries.
 The euro's rise pushed the single currency back through the
38.2 percent retracement of the move from June to November, but
three-month risk reversals hinted at euro weakness.
 Three-month euro/dollar risk reversal was at -2.101 on
Monday, according to Reuters data, with a bias to euro puts and
dollar calls. A negative risk reversal shows greater demand for
put options relative to calls and shows more options players
betting the currency will fall than rise.
 But the focus Monday was squarely on U.S. tax cuts.
 While the tax cut deal has led many economists to upgrade
their U.S. growth forecasts and boosted equities, traders say
the rise in U.S. yields was also driven by debt worries.
 Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said
markets are confident the deal will indeed boost growth, and
that helped lift the dollar last week.
 But he said they also fear that with unemployment near 10
percent, the U.S. central bank will nonetheless press on with a
$600 billion bond-buying program to keep long-term rates low.
That, together with tax cuts, may swell a budget deficit
already in excess of $1 trillion.
 ""You may see growth in the 3-4 percent area next year, but
that will cause inflation."" he said. ""And it's going to take an
act of God to get the Fed to trim its bond buying. That's what
people are concerned about.""
 The Fed holds its last policy meeting of the year on
Tuesday.
 The EU's two-day summit begins on Thursday, and leaders are
expected to tweak the EU treaty, paving the way to create a
European Stability Mechanism from 2013, when a temporary
mechanism expires.

 NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Monday,
lifted by U.S. merger activity and China's moves to curb
inflation without raising interest rates, while commodities
advanced on China's positive economic outlook.
 German bund prices fell as the prospect for stronger growth
and higher interest rates in 2011 boosted the appetite for
riskier assets at the expense of safe-haven government debt.

 * Push comes as top Chinese official in town for talks
(Adds detail on Senate procedures)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Monday
launched a last-ditch effort to pass legislation to pressure
China to raise the value of its currency by trying to attach it
to a tax plan headed toward expected approval.
 The move would require the backing of all senators, making
it a long shot.
 But U.S. steel, textile and some other manufacturers hailed
the attempt by Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and Olympia Snowe, a
Republican, to win Senate approval of a currency bill already
passed by the House of Representatives
 The two senators are seeking to persuade their colleagues
to pass the currency bill as part of an unrelated $858 billion
package agreed between President Barack Obama and Republicans
to extend tax breaks that expire at the end of the year.
 ""Addressing Chinese currency manipulation is vital to
getting our economy back on track, which is why the Senate
should act quickly,"" Brown said.
 Beijing's currency policies long have been a sticking point
in U.S.-Sino relations. It is likely to be one of the top
issues when U.S. President Barack Obama meets with Chinese
President Hu Jintao in January.
 The House currency bill, passed in late September,
addresses concerns that China undervalues its yuan currency by
anywhere from 15 percent to 40 percent to give its companies a
price advantage in international trade.
 China held the yuan steady against the dollar for nearly
two years but relaxed its peg against the dollar in mid-June.
Since then it has risen about 2.4 percent.
 Many U.S. lawmakers blame Beijing's currency practices for
the huge trade deficit with China, although most economists say
it is only one of many factors.
 BIG DEFICIT
 The U.S. trade deficit with China is the largest with any
country and this year could top $270 billion, surpassing the
2008 record of $268 billion.
 The deficit totaled nearly $229 billion in the first 10
months of 2010, up 20 percent from the same period in 2009.
 ""Our amendment would, at long last, make certain our
government is prepared to investigate currency manipulation
policies and penalize violators of global trade rules, whose
distortions and inequities have undercut the ability of our
nation's workers to thrive and compete both nationally and
world-wide,"" Snowe said.
 The House bill will die if it is not approved by the Senate
during the current Congress, which ends by Jan. 5.
 It was not yet certain what, if any, amendments Senate
leaders would allow to be considered as part of the tax bill.
 ""We are working out the amendment process"" with Senate
Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, said a spokesman for Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid.
 However, Senate rules esssentially would require all
senators to support bringing the amendment to the floor for a
vote, giving a single senator the power to block it.
 The Fair Currency Coalition, which represents U.S. steel,
textile, labor and other groups, said approval of the amendment
was ""crucial to America's economy. Currency misalignment has
diverted the investment need to sustain a productive economy,
leading to the loss of good jobs and sound economic growth.""
 However, many other business groups, such as the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, worry approval of the bill could spark
retaliation by Beijing.
 The push by the two senators came as Chinese officials were
gathering in Washington for high-level trade talks under an
annual forum called the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce
Trade, or JCCT.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the Obama
administration's official in charge of currency policy, will
meet Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan on Tuesday before the
formal JCCT meetings, a Treasury spokeswoman said.
 The House passed its currency bill in late September by a
solid bipartisan vote of 348-79.
 The bill clarifies the Commerce Department's authority to
treat currency undervaluation as a subsidy under U.S. trade law
so that companies could apply for offsetting countervailing
duties against imports from China on a case-by-case basis.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec. 13 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Monday, partly on concern a U.S. tax cut deal could swell a
large budget deficit at a time when the Federal Reserve is
committed to accommodative monetary policy.
 That China refrained -- for now -- from raising interest
rates to quell inflation also helped stoke risk appetite, which
boosted stock and commodity prices and currencies such as the
Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.
 But traders said the broad-based dollar decline was being
driven at least partly by financing concerns. The euro was up
1.1 percent at $1.3382. while the dollar fell 1.3 percent to
0.9673 Swiss francs, a typical safe haven. The dollar fell 0.4
percent to 83.55 yen.
 Volume was lower than usual as the holidays approached, and
traders said the euro could run into resistance around $1.34.
Some said the market was wary of getting stretched ahead of a
European Union summit this week that some hope will result in a
permanent support mechanism for troubled euro zone countries.
 MOODY'S CHIMES IN
 After buying the dollar against the euro for fear the euro
zone's debt crisis could spread, traders were reminded the
United States also faces debt problems of its own.
 Moody's said a deal cut last week by the White House and
Republicans to extend Bush-era tax cuts could shift its outlook
on the country's AAA rating, the highest for sovereign debt.
 That followed a rise in U.S bond yields that began last
week, with the 10-year yield hitting a six-month high, though
important support levels have held so far on Monday.
 ""This move is coming as the market starts to price in the
impact of the tax cut deal, and while Moody's saying it

 FOCUS ON FED, EU MEETING
 While the tax cut deal has led many economists to upgrade
their U.S. growth forecasts and boosted equities, traders say
the rise in U.S. yields was also driven by debt worries.
 Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said

 The EU's two-day summit begins on Thursday, and leaders are
expected to tweak the EU treaty, paving the way to create a
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) from 2013, when a temporary
mechanism expires.
 Fear Portugal and possibly others could follow Greece and
Ireland in seeking emergency bailouts prompted speculators to
more than double bets against the euro, according to weekly
data issued on Friday.
 ""The more they talk and try to come up with a solution, the
more positive it is for the euro,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.

* US said production, jobs lost in face of Chinese imports
(Adds details, U.S. steelworkers comment)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The United States was entitled
to impose extra safeguard duties on Chinese tires, a World
Trade Organization dispute panel said in a ruling published on
Monday, rejecting a Chinese complaint.
 The dispute contrasted the commitments of governments to
fight protectionism with their right to defend local industries
from floods of damaging imports, particularly from China.
 ""We find that in imposing the transitional safeguards
measure on 26 September 2009 in respect of imports of ... tires
from China, the United States did not fail to comply with its
obligations,"" WTO panel said in its 219-page report.
 The United States hailed the decision as Chinese officials
were gathering in Washington for high-level trade talks.
 ""This is a major victory for the United States and
particularly for American workers and businesses,"" U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement.
 A Chinese trade official in Geneva had no immediate
comment.
 President Barack Obama imposed the 35 percent duties on
Chinese tires in September last year after the United
Steelworkers union complained that surging imports of Chinese
tires were hurting U.S. producers.
 WTO rules allow members to impose temporary extra tariffs
on goods to counter a destabilizing flood of imports.
 Additional provisions were introduced to cover Chinese
imports for a 12-year transitional period when China joined the
WTO in 2001.
 Obama was widely criticized at the time for his decision,
which many saw as protectionist.
 They argued it would drive up costs for consumers, hurt
businesses involved with Chinese imports and simply open the
market to cheap tires from other foreign producers.
 The WTO ruling spared Obama the embarrassment former
President George W. Bush faced in 2003 when a WTO panel ruled
against tariffs he slapped on steel imports from around the
world. The panel said the safeguard duties Bush imposed under a
different provision of U.S. law weren't justified.
 ""We applaud the Obama administration for standing up and
defending American jobs in its original decision to impose
relief and in its strong defense of that action at the WTO,""
Steelworkers president Leo Gerard said.
 The United States told the WTO that imports of Chinese
tires had increased both in overall terms and in market share,
and it was entitled to impose the safeguard under the terms of
China's accession.
 It said the volume of Chinese tire imports had more than
tripled in four years, to reach $1.8 billion in value, while
U.S. production had shrunk by more than 25 percent in the same
period, with 14 percent of U.S. workers in the industry losing
their jobs.
 But China said the U.S. measures ran counter to the
agreement by G20 leaders to resist protectionism, adding that
its own figures showed a much smaller increase. Beijing said
the changes in the U.S. industry were due to a move to focus on
more expensive up-market products.
 China had argued that the U.S. law under which the
safeguard was imposed, section 421 of the Trade Act, imposed a
narrower definition of injury than required under China's
accession agreement to the WTO in 2001.
 The three-year duty, imposed on top of a standard 4 percent
tariff on car and light truck tires, fell to 30 percent in the
second year and will drop to 25 percent in the third year.
 Both sides now have up to 60 days to appeal.

 * Patel's influence on policy still unclear
 * Weaker rand would not solve problems
 By Phumza Macanda
 JOHANNESBURG, Dec 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's economic
development Minister Ebrahim Patel's plan to weaken the rand by
cutting interest rates is unlikely to gain support in government
and would not increase the country's competitiveness.
 His proposals on the rand are at odds with the policy
articulated by both the central bank and the Finance Ministry
and raise old questions over who exactly is driving policy.
 Patel released his ""new growth path"" last month, a set of
policy measures aimed at quickening South Africa's economic
growth to create jobs for millions that continue to live in
poverty, even 16 years after the end of apartheid.
 ""I do not think it's a good idea,"" said Tony Twine,
economist at Econometrix. ""Weakening the rand is an inflationary
tactic which simply camouflages the inability of the economy to
work efficiently.""
 The rand has gained nearly 30 percent against the dollar
and the euro since the start of last year, helping to push
inflation to 5-year lows and keep it within the Reserve Bank's 3
to 6 percent target.
 But exports have been depressed, especially those destined
to South Africa' largest trading partner, the eurozone as that
region's growth has been sluggish.
 Partly due to rand gains, the manufacturing sector has
shrunk and shed hundreds of thousands of jobs, pushing
unemployment to an official figure of 25.3 percent of the
working force. The unofficial rate may be as high as 40 percent.
 The rand is seen maintaining its gains into 2011, weighing
on the manufacturing sector and the broader economy. At 5.5
percent, South Africa's rates remain attractive to investors.
 
 POLICY CONFUSION
 President Jacob Zuma appointed Patel to reward the powerful
COSATU trades union grouping for helping him clinch the ANC's
leadership from Thabo Mbeki. But so far, Patel, a former trade
unionist, has not influenced policy and the ""new growth path"" is
his attempt.
 COSATU helped Zuma unseat Mbeki, hoping Zuma would be more
sympathetic to their leftist stance, but he has maintained those
market-friendly policies, which has increased tensions in the
ANC alliance. 
 After the establishment of the National Planning Commission
headed by former finance minister Trevor Manuel, analysts say it
is unclear who has the power to drive policy in Zuma's cabinet.
 ""There is some confusion about boundaries between national
planning and economic planning and there is nothing I'm aware of
that clarifies what separates the two,"" said Adam Habib, deputy
vice chancellor of the University of Johannesburg.
 ""There is not doubt that Patel's influence in part emanates
from the unions, and if the unions are rejecting his proposals
then he's got a serious problem,"" said Habib of union criticism
of Patel's plan to put caps on wage increases.
 For now, policy remains the responsibility of Finance
Minister Pravin Gordhan, to the chagrin of COSATU.
 The power to change the Reserve Bank's mandate rests with
Gordhan and setting a new rand policy would also be his
prerogative, guided by the ANC's agenda.
 Tensions have increased in recent months due to COSATU's
frustration with the ANC and analysts say eyes will be on
whether Zuma will provide leadership and clarify roles.
 Although some have speculated the alliance is near breaking
point and COSATU may break away and contest elections, both the
ANC and its union ally have said they are committed to making
the alliance work.
 To keep COSATU happy, the ANC may compromise on some of
Patel's proposals, including increasing targeted support for
struggling industries such as manufacturing.
 
 WEAKER RAND NO ANSWER
 The Reserve Bank and the National Treasury have said the
rand is no silver bullet that will solve South Africa's problems
with competitiveness, preferring a multi-pronged policy approach
that includes tackling industrial policy and education.
 The Reserve Bank has already reduced interest rates to
historical lows in the past two years, cutting the repo rate by
a cumulative 650 basis points to 5.5 percent and is less
inclined to reduce them further.
 Governor Gill Marcus said after the November MPC meeting
there was limited room for further easing and the bank was not
cutting rates to weaken the rand.
 To deal with the rand, the Bank has opted to build reserves
as and when appropriate, with the help of the National Treasury.
 Analysts have long said that blaming the rand for all of
South Africa's woes is a scapegoat and targeting it will not
work.
 ""Monetary policy that targets the exchange rate will not
address unemployment and the inequalities,"" said Lumkile Mondi
chief economist at the Industrial Development Corporation.
 ""Such policies are very much appealing but dangerous and do
not do anything for competitiveness,"" he added.
 Nobel economic laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who is also on
Patel's advisory panel, said in a statement that managing the
exchange rate would be an appropriate policy for South Africa as
it would help the economy to develop a diversified productive
base.

2.8 million people, not 5 million, in next five years)
 
 * South Africa has asked to join BRIC, investors sceptical
 * South Africa bigger economy, Nigeria larger population
 * Nigeria growth to outstrip S.Africa, capital markets weak
 
 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - South Africa, the largest economy
in Africa, is eager for elevation to the coveted BRIC status of
emerging markets, but investors say Nigeria is a more probable
African contender, even if promotion for either is some way off.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, at last month's G20
meeting in South Korea, said South Africa had ""applied"" to join
the four-member BRIC grouping of fast-growing emerging economies
-- Brazil, Russia, India and China.
 Turkey, Mexico and Indonesia are typically the countries
investors eye as an addition to the BRICs, which have grabbed an
outsize slice of emerging market investment in recent years due
to their scale, growth and impact on the global economy.
 But resource-rich Africa, boasting some of the
fastest-growing countries in the world, has become a focus for
investors looking for high returns over a longer timeframe.
 Investment flows into Nigeria are tiny compared with South
Africa. Nigeria saw equity fund flows of just $216 million for
the first 10 months of this year, compared with $3.4 billion for
South Africa, according to fund tracker EPFR.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^For graphic showing EPFR comparison of 2009 and 2010 inflows
into South African and Nigerian equity and bond funds, see
http://r.reuters.com/dyx79q
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 Yet while South Africa is the larger economy, Nigeria is
expected to catch up in the next few years.
 ""In Nigeria, you still have 70 percent of the population
living on a dollar a day, but there is a demographic impact. In
the next five years, Nigeria will add another 23 million people
and South Africa will add another 2.8 million,"" said Razia Khan,
head of Africa research at Standard Chartered.
 Nigeria's economy may overtake South Africa's by 2023,
Standard Chartered says, assuming South Africa grows by 4
percent and Nigeria by 7 percent on a purchasing power parity
basis.
 Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O'Neill, who
coined the term BRIC nine years ago, told last week's Reuters
2011 Investment Outlook Summit he was constantly getting e-mails
suggesting he added or subtracted countries from the acronym.
 South Africa, at a population of under 50 million people, is
just too small to join the BRIC ranks, O'Neill says.
 ""How can South Africa be regarded as a big economy? And, by
the way, they happen to be struggling as well.""
 Meanwhile, recent policy changes in Nigeria, including the
appointment as finance minister of former Goldman Sachs banker
Olusegun Aganga, could present new possibilities.
 ""Nigeria has shown some vague signs. If they could impose
the level of leadership, a whole new way of governance in which
corruption is dramatically reduced, Nigeria is I think very
interesting,"" O'Neill said. 
 ""It's 20 percent of Africa's population, which means it
could be pretty powerful."" 
 Nigeria's population already totals more than 150 million,
larger than Russia's, and on some estimates could double in the
next 20 years.
 Investors are already targeting the African consumer and
growing middle class, and a rising population would increase
consumer demand.
 Acha Leke, a Lagos-based director at consultancy McKinsey,
is cautiously optimistic on the power of population.
 ""Demographics is a double-edged sword -- you have a massive,
massive market, but you have a bunch of people to educate and
create jobs for. This could be a great opportunity, it has to be
carefully managed.""
 
 CORRUPTION WATCH
 Nigeria may have an edge over South Africa, but it still has
a long way to go.
 Corruption is a deterrent, with the country coming 134th out
of 178 countries in Transparency International's 2010 Corruption
Perceptions Index, compared with 54th for South Africa.
 Some of Nigeria's biggest challenges include its inadequate
power grid and other infrastructure shortages.
 In the short term, political uncertainty is also an issue
for Nigerian investors ahead of April elections, with southerner
President Goodluck Jonathan facing a tough battle securing the
ruling party nomination because of a pact in the party that
power rotates every two terms between the mostly Moslem north
and largely Christian south. 
 And in capital markets, South Africa is far and away the
winner, as the biggest financial market in Africa. 
 South Africa is a regular borrower in international debt
markets, while Nigeria last week delayed a debut sovereign bond.
 South Africa is also a constituent of the benchmark MSCI
global emerging equities index, while Nigeria is only in the
less liquid frontier markets index.
 Andrew Brudenell, a frontier markets fund manager at HSBC
Asset Management, says Nigeria's elevation to major emerging
market status is not likely to be any time soon.
 ""There is potential for Nigeria in macro-economic terms, the
stock market is a little bit further behind. The question is
whether it becomes an emerging market as there are all these
checks and balances -- liquidity and other financial criteria
have to be met.""

(Adds details)
 By Emmanuel Jarry
 PARIS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
said on Monday that his G20 agenda to reform the international
monetary system would look at widening the role of the IMF's
Special Drawing Rights and tackling international capital flows.
 France, which took over the presidency of the G20 group of
industrial and developing nations last month, is sounding out
governments on ways to reform a monetary system dominated for
decades by the U.S. dollar with the aim of creating greater
global stability.
 ""We need to start thinking about the relevance of a system
based on accumulation of dollar reserves,"" Sarkozy said, adding
that France would float proposals during the next year.
 ""Does not this system make part of the world dependent on
American monetary policy? Should we not reflect on the role of
the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) and on the internationalisation
of other currencies?"" asked Sarkozy, in a speech to mark the
50th anniversary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD).
 French officials have said they hope to encourage greater
use of the Chinese yuan as a reserve currency during their G20
presidency, including talks on a possible timetable for its
inclusion in the basket of currencies which underpin the
International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights.
 Other ideas include encouraging a greater role for the SDR
itself as a reserve currency, in an effort to move away from
dollar hegemony.
 China is keen for the IMF to broaden the currencies that
make up its SDR international reserve assets from the current
basket of dollars, euros, yen and sterling.
 China wants to promote the use of SDRs for pricing
commodities and in global trade. Russia has championed SDRs and
recruited fellow emerging heavyweights China, Brazil and India
to promote it as a reserve currency.
 
 DOLLAR'S ""EMINENT"" ROLE 
 Sarkozy said his agenda was not aimed at harming the dollar,
which he insisted should remain strong and retain an ""eminent""
role.
 ""But eminent does not mean exclusive,"" he said, noting the
system needed to reflect the emergence of new economic powers.
""Our monetary organisation cannot sustainably continue to
reflect the world of yesterday in which neither India, nor China
nor Brazil were the economic powers that they are today.""
 The 34 countries of the OECD -- which do not include big
developing economies like China -- will account for just 50
percent of the global economy by 2015, versus 65 percent in
1975, he said.
 France's G20 aims also include measures to curb the
volatility of commodity prices and to discuss ways of improving
global economic governance.
 Sarkozy said that G20 leaders should consider means of
controlling the damaging effects of massive capital flows,
including the creation of ""financial safety nets"".
 ""Experience has shown us that uncontrolled financial
liberalisation can expose our countries to systemic financial
crises,"" Sarkozy said. ""We need clear international rules of the
game and institutions to make them respected.""
 With regard to commodities, Sarkozy said there was no
question of reversing free market principles, but rather France
would seek ways of ""discouraging speculation and offering
transparency of the evolution of supply and demand.""

 By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer
 TOULOUSE, France, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Airbus raised its
forecast for aircraft demand over the next 20 years, citing the
travel needs of 6 billion people in emerging economies as
airlines stage a stronger-than-predicted rebound from recession.
 By 2029, a third of all passenger traffic will be in Asia,
compared with 27 percent now, while skies over North America
will see their share of the global air travel market shrink to
20 percent from 28 percent.
 ""Demand for travel is doubling every 15 years ... but in
places like India and China we expect to double in the next six
years,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy told a news conference on
Monday.
 The world's largest planemaker, ahead of rival Boeing,
forecast deliveries of 25,850 new passenger and freight aircraft
worth $3.2 trillion from 2010-29, an increase of 899 planes from
its previous annual forecast.
 The EADS subsidiary forecast average annual growth in
passenger traffic of 4.8 percent over the period, up from 4.7
percent previously.
 Latest forecasts from Boeing, which measures demand for
aircraft of 90 seats and upwards compared with the Airbus
cut-off point of 100 seats, were for 30,900 aircraft worth $3.6
trillion over the next 20 years.
 Both planemakers face growing competition from Canada, China
and, potentially, Brazil and Russia for sales of their smallest
but most popular aircraft, the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.
 Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries of these
single-aisle passenger jets as well as small freighters by
around 900 planes to 17,870 aircraft over the forecast period.
 
 A320 UPGRADE DEFENDED
 Leahy defended a recent decision to upgrade the company's
A320 single-aisle aircraft with new engines from 2016. 
 Leahy said new engines to be supplied by U.S. company Pratt
& Whitney, or a partnership between U.S. group General Electric
and French group Safran, would provide each plane with fuel
savings equivalent to the consumption of 1,000 cars a year.
 ""It would be ridiculous for us not to offer that to the
market,"" Leahy said.
 Leasing companies have expressed concerns about the impact
on resale values of existing planes and Boeing has said it was
in no hurry to match its European rival by upgrading its 737.
 Leahy also said he would clear his name in a French legal
probe over insider trading allegations dating back to the
announcement of severe delays to the A380 superjumbo in 2006.
 A French judge has placed Leahy under formal investigation
along with six other current and former executives who were
cleared by the French AMF market regulator last year.
 Leahy said the AMF had reviewed thousands of documents and
interviewed witnesses at length.
 ""To have a sole independent judge and an assistant decide
that maybe the AMF got it wrong: I think the polite thing for me
to say is that it is disappointing, and disappointing to be told
also that the process could take another two years.""
 Leahy, an American who has been at Airbus for 26 years, said
the ongoing legal process would be a burden but he was certain
he and fellow suspects would be cleared.
 EADS backed Leahy and other people involved in the case on
Saturday.
 Leahy also delivered a swipe to British enginemaker
Rolls-Royce over its handling of a recent engine blowout on a
Qantas A380 superjumbo, but said he believed the engine maker
would resolve problems with its Trent 900 engines 
 ""Rolls could improve their communication and their PR but
they are a good manufacturer; they will get it fixed,"" he said.
 A gleaming A380 in Qantas livery rolled up to an Airbus
parking stand shortly after Leahy spoke, ready for delivery.
 The aircraft, on which a Rolls engine was changed following
an oil pipe inspection last week, will be the airline's seventh
superjumbo and the 18th A380 delivered by Airbus this year.
 Airbus has said it may seek compensation from Rolls-Royce
over disruption caused by the blowout which has been blamed on a
faulty oil pipe inside the turbine section of one engine.

 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - South Africa, the largest economy

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, at last month's G20

 BRATISLAVA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Slovakia should draft a plan
to potentially exit the euro zone if the currency club fails to
bring its debt crisis under control, the country's parliamentary
speaker and leader of a junior coalition party said on Monday.
 Slovakia, the most recent adherent to the single currency,
joined in January 2009 in the hope of ducking under its shield
in times of crisis but has instead had to help out richer peers
and dissented from proposals to bail out Greece. [ID:nLDE68915I]
 Richard Sulik, head of the Freedom and Solidarity (SaS)
party, criticised the purchase of state bonds by the European
Central Bank (ECB).
 In a column in daily Hospodarske Noviny, he said any attempt
to use the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue
fund to help Spain, which is struggling to reassure investors it
is in better fiscal shape than Greece or Ireland, would pose a
risk to the euro.
 ""It is irresponsible for other countries to take on the debt
of indebted countries with euro resources and then get into
problems themselves,"" Sulik, co-author of Slovakia's flat tax
system introduced back in 2002, wrote.
 ""Because of this, it is time for Slovakia to stop
unquestionably trusting in the euro zone leaders' words and
prepare a plan B. This would be a re-introduction of the Slovak
crown.""
 The bloc's poorest member, Slovakia agreed to the creation
of the EFSF but refused to contribute to a loan to Greece,

 * Inventories recede, down 35 percent since February
 
 By Pratima Desai
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Healthy demand from top consumer
China and an excess of money market liquidity are expected to
propel prices of industrial metal copper to record highs of
$10,000 a tonne or above.
 The latest trigger for the surge came on Friday as investors
piled in after China raised banks' reserve requirements to mop
up excess cash in the economy and rein in inflation pressures.
 But the decision not to raise interest rates means the
authorities have opted for a softer form of monetary tightening,
suggesting they believe price pressures are under control.
 ""The key motivator is accommodative Chinese monetary policy,
interest rates did not go up as expected,"" said Dan Brebner,
analyst at Deutsche Bank.
 ""People are confident about keeping their long positions and
the overall issue is that there is lots of money out there ... I
think we will see $10,000 at some point.""
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading at
$9,195 at 1351 GMT at 1350 GMT.
 The metal used in power and construction hit a record high
of $9,210 a tonne on Monday, up more than 50 percent since early
June when markets were worrying about sovereign default in euro
zone countries such as Ireland, Greece or Portugal.
 China's 50 basis point reserves hike, effective Dec. 20,
will leave required reserve ratios at 18.5 percent, a record
high for the majority of the country's banks.
 China is the world's largest consumer of copper accounting
for nearly 40 percent of global demand estimated this year at
around 19 million tonnes.
 The country's appetite for copper surprised the market on
Friday, when data showed imports of the metal jumped 28.5
percent in November.
 Central banks and governments around the world have since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 flooded money markets
with cash, which is looking for a home, to help growth.
 Much of that cash is finding its way to the copper market,
where supplies are tight due to falling ore grades, disruptions
such as strikes and project delays and cancellations.
 
 DOLLAR WEAKNESS
 Also boosting copper in recent years has been the weaker
dollar, which although it seems to have stabilised in recent
days, is still a prominent support, analysts say.
 Falling stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses -- at
350,000 tonnes and down more than 35 percent since February --
have helped boost sentiment.
 Strong global demand over coming months and mine
utilisation runs near full capacity have reinforced expectations
of deficits, possibly starting this year.
 ""We expect these drivers will be sufficient to exhaust
nearly all exchange inventories (during) 2011, forcing the
market back into a period of demand rationing characterized by
extreme levels of backwardation,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.
 ""Further, this backwardation will likely come on top of
well-supported long-dated prices given the overwhelming need for
investment in new mine capacity to meet rising global trend
demand fuelled by emerging economies.
 The backwardation or premium for cash delivery of copper
rose to $47 a tonne on Monday from levels around $30 early last
week and $62 at the start of December.
 Prices for copper for delivery in December 2011 are around
$8,785 a tonne, up about 7 percent so far this month.
 Analysts say the launch of physically backed copper exchange
traded funds could also potentially help boost demand and
prices.
 The listings in London by UK-based ETF Securities are aimed
mainly at institutional investors such as pension funds and
insurance companies looking for exposure to hard assets such as
copper, used in power and construction.
 ""The fundamentals no doubt about it are very strong and
should continue to tighten over coming months,"" said Robin Bhar,
analyst at Credit Agricole. ""Demand is strengthening globally,
while low stocks and a constrained supply chain should continue
to boost prices.
 However, Bhar thinks a sell-off before the end of the year
could be on the cards as traders and funds take profits and
could mean that copper prices may not reach $10,000 this year.
 ""Certainly likely in 2011 though,"" he said.

 * Move reflects growing risks of buying sovereign bonds
* ECB bond buying rose last week, but not massively
 * BIS, EIB say talk of haircuts for investors spooked market
 * E-bonds, bigger bailout fund off EU summit agenda

(Recasts with ECB mulling capital increase, changes dateline
from previous PARIS/BRUSSELS)
 FRANKFURT, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is
considering requesting an increase in its capital to help cope
with the rising costs of fighting the euro zone debt crisis,
euro zone central bank sources told Reuters.
 ""The issue is that the ECB is worried about potential losses
from its bond buying,"" one source said.
 ""At the moment we are buying very modest amounts, but what
if that is increased, and what if the bonds you buy are suddenly
worth 30 percent less?"" the source said, referring to the risk
of a writedown on a euro zone government's debt.
 The central bank declined to comment.
 The ECB disclosed on Monday that it had increased its
purchases of euro zone government bonds to 2.667 billion euros
($3.5 billion) last week from 1.965 billion euros a week
earlier. It was the biggest weekly total since June but well
below levels seen at the height of the euro zone crisis.
 Altogether, the ECB has bought 72 billion euros in bonds --
exclusively Greek, Irish and Portuguese, analysts believe --
since it began intervening in May to stabilise markets. 
 ECB policymakers have repeatedly signalled that the central
bank cannot bear the brunt of fire-fighting against bond market
attacks on highly indebted euro zone states, urging governments
to increase reform efforts and boost EU contingency funds.
 The Frankfurt-based central bank headed by Jean-Claude
Trichet has greatly expanded its lending since the start of the
global financial crisis in 2007. It has a subscribed capital of
almost 5.8 billion euros compared to a balance sheet of 138
billion euros, according to its latest annual report.
 All 27 of the European Union's national central banks
contribute to the ECB's capital. The 16 countries already using
the euro make up 70 percent with other EU members -- including
Britain and Denmark which have opt-outs -- making up the rest.
 One source said a doubling of the ECB's capital was among
the options being discussed. Another said it was not clear how
much the bank would ask for. Both said the request would go to
euro zone member states.
 
 CRISIS AGGRAVATED
 EU leaders are due to discuss the relentless crisis at a
summit on Thursday and Friday but are not expected to announce
any new measures to ease concerns about the region's debt.
 However, one senior EU source said intense efforts were
under way behind the scenes to find ways to shield Spain from
market pressure expected to mount early next year.
 Two major international financial institutions said EU
paymaster Germany had aggravated the crisis with talk about
making bond investors pay in future, but Berlin seems set to get
its way on that issue at this week's European Union summit.
 The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the head of
the European Investment Bank (EIB) both said German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's drive to make private bondholders share losses
in any future euro sovereign default had intensified the crisis.
 ""The surge in sovereign credit spreads began on Oct. 18,
when the French and German governments agreed to take steps that
would make it possible to impose haircuts on bonds should a
government not be able to service its debt,"" the Basel-based BIS
said in its quarterly review.
 EIB president Philippe Maystadt said Merkel was absolutely
right to demand a private sector contribution to financial
rescues after an emergency safety net expires in 2013, ""but the
way it was presented created total confusion"".
 EU leaders are set to approve a two-sentence amendment to
the 27-nation bloc's Lisbon treaty that would create a permanent
European Stabilisation Mechanism to lend to distressed member
states on strict conditions.
 They will also endorse a statement by euro zone finance
ministers that private sector investors will be expected to
contribute, on a case-by-case basis, in any sovereign debt
restructuring after 2013.
 But at the insistence of Berlin and Paris, they are unlikely
to increase the existing rescue fund or to take any action on a
proposal for common European bonds to help resolve the crisis.
 EU sources said euro zone finance ministers would work in
January on a more systemic response to the crisis, which has
already forced Greece and Ireland to take EU/IMF bailouts and
threatens to spread to Portugal, Spain and even Italy.
 
 NO ACTION ON E-BONDS
 Euro zone bond markets have entered an end-of-year lull as
investors close their books, with yield premiums on peripheral
debt just a touch wider on Monday. But EU officials fear another
potential wave of selling early in the new year.
 A German government spokesman said indications were that the
summit would not take up a proposal for common euro zone bonds
made by Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the currency area's
finance ministers, and Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti.
 The spokesman also told a news briefing he was not aware of
any examination of an extension of the existing European
Financial Stability Facility, as reported by the Financial
Times.
 The senior EU source said experts were working on ways to
make European crisis management instruments more flexible and
better able to help countries before they get shut out of credit
markets.
 The crucial aim was to ringfence Spain, the fourth largest
euro zone economy. Madrid was taking energetic measures to avoid
being sucked down with the crisis, the source said.
 The EU source said experts were studying how to access the
EFSF's full 440 billion euros ($580 billion) if necessary,
despite pledges to maintain a cash buffer given to secure a top
notch AAA credit rating for the rescue fund.
 Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the 'E-bond'
proposal, designed to reduce the borrowing costs of troubled
euro zone states and prevent speculation against their debt, had
been excluded from the EU summit agenda.

 * UK banks safe on ""very adverse"" losses from euro periphery

 (Adds detail, comment from Q&A)
 By Peter Griffiths and David Milliken
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Bank of England may need to
inject more money into the economy if growth shows clear signs
of slowing or if the euro zone crisis has a big impact, BoE
Deputy Governor Charles Bean said on Monday.
 The central bank was concerned that high recent inflation
would drive up price expectations and wage demands, although the
main scenario was for inflation to fall back to target in two
years, Bean also said.
 The economic recovery faced significant risks from the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone -- the UK's biggest
trading partner -- as well as heavy government spending cuts at
home, he said.
 ""It is certainly possible that we may well want to undertake
a second round of quantitative easing if there is a clear sign
that UK output growth and with it inflation prospects are
slowing,"" Bean told a business audience in London.
 ""Equally at some juncture it will be appropriate to start
withdrawing monetary stimulus. There are risks on both sides.""
 ""But equally there are very significant downside risks,
particularly from the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. If that
unfolds in an unhappy fashion, I think it is quite plausible
that it would have a significant adverse impact on the UK.
 ""Under those circumstances, we might well want to undertake
a further round of quantitative easing."" 
 The BoE bought 200 billion pounds of government bonds and
corporate debt between March 2009 and February this year and
slashed interest rates to a record low 0.5 percent to help pull
Britain out of its deepest recession in its post-war history.
 The asset purchase programme, also known as quantitative
easing, has been on hold since February, and growth has
rebounded strongly since then.
 
 INFLATION WORRY
 Inflation has been above the BoE's 2 percent target
throughout this year, and Bean said policymakers would watch
price risks next year closely due to the threat of higher
commodity prices and the danger from rising inflation
expectations.
 However, the moderate pace of growth and the fading effects
of sterling's past depreciation should mute inflation pressures.
 Moreover, the economy faced significant challenges in the
year ahead, with Britain's prospects depending on private-sector
final demand and net exports, he said.
 Bean's speech was broadly in line with past BoE statements
-- which point to upside risks to inflation and downside risks
to growth -- though it highlighted two inflation dangers for
2011 more starkly than usual.
 ""First ... strong global growth continues to generate upward
pressure on the prices of commodities and tradable goods more
generally,"" Bean said. ""Second (there is a risk) that the period
of elevated inflation causes medium-term inflation expectations
to drift up, leading to higher rates of increase of both wages
and prices,"" he said.
 ""We shall be watching these indicators, and their impact on
wages and prices, like proverbial hawks,"" he continued.
 Bean said the risk of a wage-price spiral had risen because
inflation had been above target throughout 2010. The BoE does
not expect it to fall below 2 percent until 2012, due to a rise
in value-added tax planned for next month.
 ""Rapid recovery in emerging markets has reawakened global
inflationary pressures. And here in the United Kingdom,
inflation has been running above the MPC's target for an
uncomfortably long time. It may be some while yet before
normality is restored,"" he said.
 However, Bean saw plenty of threats to growth next year that
may cause inflation to undershoot rather than overshoot the
BoE's forecasts of over 3 percent CPI for 2011.
 Households had probably not finished reducing their spending
in response to the recession, public spending would fall and
demand for British financial services overseas may continue to
be weak.
 Overall, though, British banks were well placed to weather
direct losses from adverse events in Greece, Ireland, Portugal
and Spain and the lower level of sterling should also boost
exports of goods.
 ""Even under a very adverse scenario, (banks) should be able
to absorb the likely losses on their direct exposures to Greece,
Ireland, Portugal and Spain without too much difficulty. There
is, though, the possibility of further indirect effects ...
which could amplify the impact,"" Bean said.

 * Aims to boost foreign ETF offerings to 60 from 42 by March
 * Sees overall Japan ETF market doubling in 3 years
 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings plans to add more
foreign and domestic exchange traded funds to its line-up in
Japan, eyeing growth in a market it hopes will double in three
years, an executive at Japan's largest brokerage said.
 Nomura has recently established a team dedicated to marketing
ETFs, aiming to attract a wider range of retail and institutional
investors and stoke growth in Japan's ETF market, which has
shrunk 12 percent since peaking at around $35 billion in 2006.
 ""The number of ETFs listed on Japanese exchanges has
increased over the last three years, but we think things
shouldn't end there. We need to make a better effort to attract
more investors,"" Makoto Shiota, head of the ETF market group at
Nomura Securities, told Reuters in an interview.
 Shiota manages a team of six, including two former executives
of the Japanese unit of BlackRock Inc, the world's top ETF
provider.
 The global ETF market size has expanded by more than 10 times
to $1.24 trillion in total assets in October, from $104.8 billion
nine years ago, according to data by BlackRock.
 The Japanese ETF industry has also expanded rapidly over the
past decade. Assets totalled $30.5 billion in October, up from
$6.6 billion in 2001, though down from a peak of $34.6 billion in
2006, BlackRock data showed.
 ETFs are popular among passive investors as it is a
cost-effective way to get exposure to benchmark indicies, such as
Japan's Nikkei stock average and Brazil's Bovespa index, as well
as commodities like gold and oil.
 Nomura hopes to gain more attention from traditional retail
investors and institutions by offering a variety of ETFs.
 Nomura plans to increase the distribution of foreign ETFs to
60 by the end of March from 42 now, focusing mainly on foreign
bond funds, Shiota said.
 ETFs linked to Japanese government bonds could also draw
interest from foreign investors, Shiota said, adding that it
would be suitable for the broker's asset management arm, Nomura
Asset Management, to launch one over the long-term.
 Nomura believes the Japanese ETF market could double to 5
trillion yen in three years from the current 2.5 trillion yen,
helped by news that Japan Post Bank (Yucho), the world's biggest
bank, and Japan's central bank were investing in ETFs.
 ""The BOJ will use ETFs in their (money market) operations and
Yucho will also treat ETFs as an investment tool. These moves are
extremely important,"" Shiota said.
 Japan Post Bank was reported to have invested about 50
billion yen in ETFs of emerging market equities, while the BOJ
set up a 5 trillion yen asset buying scheme in November that
included the purchase of ETFs.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2010 08:24AM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-WRAPUP 3-China extends special RRR hike for top banks," * Reserve ratio to be record high 19 pct for biggest banks
 * Extension follows official reserves hike on Friday
 * Higher reserve ratio key part of China's inflation battle
 * China leaders stress inflation risks at weekend meeting

 (Adds poll results, paragraphs 6-7)
 HONG KONG/BEIJING, Dec 13 (Reuters) - China's central bank
has told six of the country's biggest lenders that a special
increase in required reserves will be extended, the latest
attempt to quell inflation in a campaign that looks set to
intensify.
 Three industry sources told Reuters on Monday that a special
increase in reserves that had been due to expire this week will
be renewed for three months. That followed an official reserve
requirement increase for all banks -- the third in a month --
that was announced on Friday.
 By locking up a chunk of cash that banks would otherwise
have been able to lend, the moves help absorb some of the
liquidity that drove inflation in November to a 28-month peak of
5.1 percent, higher than analysts had been expecting.
 Inflation data on Saturday showed signs that price pressures
are broadening beyond food, raising the prospect that the
government will soon roll out bigger ammunition in the form of
interest rate increases, currency appreciation and lending
restrictions.
 That seemed to be on the cards as Chinese leaders, in a
meeting chaired by President Hu Jintao to map out the country's
economic agenda, made stabilising prices a more prominent task,
state media reported on Sunday.
 A Reuters poll on Monday forecast that China is poised to
raise interest rates before the end of this year and will
increase them twice more in 2011, though it will rely mostly on
lending controls to rein in inflation.
 Beijing is expected to set a target for 7 trillion yuan in
new loans next year, down about 7 percent from this year's goal.
 The extension of the reserve requirement increase, which was
initially ordered in October, acts as a holding measure while
Beijing weighs more aggressive policy options.
 ""There are only about two weeks left before the end of the
year, so it's not that likely that the central bank will
announce or implement further RRR hikes. That's why it is
choosing to extend the selective ratios,"" said Lu Zhengwei,
chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai.
 The extension affects six of China's biggest lenders,
including China Commercial Bank and Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China, the sources said.
 
 RECORD RESERVES
 The required reserve ratio (RRR) for most of these banks
will stand at a record high of 19 percent and locks up about 180
billion yuan ($27 billion) in deposits that the banks would
otherwise have had available to lend.
 China officially raised banks' required reserves for the
third time in a month on Friday, so far its preferred tightening
tool. It has only raised interest rates once this year, but has
officially raised reserve requirements six times.
 On top of that, it has also used unofficial, selective
increases twice this year, targeting banks that have been
especially heavy lenders or that are systemically important.
 Alongside the rise in consumer prices, producer prices rose
6.1 percent in the year to November and 1.4 percent from
October, the fastest month-on-month rate since July 2008.
 ""Mainstream economists were not on high enough alert for
this round of inflation. It will last a long time,"" Gao Shanwen,
chief economist at Essence Securities, said.
 
 MAPPING POLICY
 Chinese leaders gave greater prominence to the fight against
inflation in their statement on Sunday at the end of their
annual Central Economic Work Conference.
 ""Greater policy emphasis should be given to price
stability,"" the statement said.
 The conference also reaffirmed a shift, announced by the
Communist Party's ruling body last week, to a ""prudent"" monetary
policy from the previous ""appropriately loose"" stance.
 That change in wording, coupled with heightened concerns
over inflation, could pave the way for a more aggressive course
of interest rate increases and lending restrictions, analysts
say.
 ""The governments' prudent monetary policy stance suggests
imminent rate hikes to anchor inflation expectations and
aggressive RRR hikes to 22 percent to normalise quantitative
conditions,"" Isaac Meng, an economist with BNP Paribas, said in
a note.
 But not all analysts interpreted the outcome of the economic
conference in the same light.
 Shen Minggao, an economist with Citigroup, noted that the
government said it wanted to strike a balance between taming
inflation and maintaining fast growth. The economy expanded 9.6
percent in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier.
 ""The relatively mild language suggests that Chinese
authorities believe that inflation is still under control and
have not planned to slow GDP (gross domestic product) growth
significantly in 2011 from its current level,"" he said.

(Adds detail, updates prices)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The euro trimmed losses against
the dollar on Monday, helped by East-European and Latin-American
demand but hampered by uncertainty about how the euro zone would
deal with its debt problems.
 Trading volumes were reduced by the approach of the
year-end, while few investors were willing to take on big
positions before a Federal Reserve meeting this week and a
European Union summit on Thursday and Friday.
 Further selling in Treasuries pushed the benchmark 10-year
U.S. yield to a six-month high, supporting the dollar on the
view that rising yields would make U.S. assets more attractive.
 Speculation remains high that Portugal and others may follow
Ireland and Greece in seeking a bailout and European leaders are
expected to agree to tweak the EU treaty, paving the way to
create the ""European Stability Mechanism"" (ESM) from 2013, when
the current temporary rescue mechanism expires.
 Off the agenda is the controversial topic of joint euro zone
bonds, supported by some member states while opposed by many
officials in Germany, the bloc's dominant economy.
 Stephen Gallo, head of markets analysis at Schneider Foreign
Exchange, said the euro was unlikely to change its general
downward trend.
 ""The market is still poised to favour the dollar,"" he said.
 ""Speculative and leveraged money is still more inclined to
be short of euros and they will stay this way through December
and the first quarter of next year.""
 Speculators trimmed short positions against the dollar last
week but more than doubled their bets against the euro,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
signalling growing bearishness on the currency.
 Some analysts said a quick decision on the ESM may provide a
boost to the euro as it would remove at least one layer of
uncertainty about the stability of the euro zone.
 Fed officials meeting on Tuesday are expected to assess its
second round of quantitative easing announced in November, the
prospect of which dragged the dollar lower in September and
October. 
 But they are not expected to signal any shift away from
their intention to buy $600 billion in government debt, which is
seen limiting any significant dollar upside.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3282, having hit a session
low of $1.3182. Traders said Russian and Latin-American demand
had helped it to bounce into positive territory, while next
resistance was the 20-day moving average at $1.3336.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar index, which tracks its movements against a
currency basket, was down 0.2 percent at 79.880, while the U.S.
currency trimmed earlier gains to stand unchanged at 83.95 yen.
 The dollar has been helped by a rise in Treasury yields
which climbed as high as 3.39 percent after a U.S. proposal to
extend Bush era tax cuts. This is seen helping the economy even
as it raises issues about mounting U.S. deficits.
 Analysts said weekly data on bond purchases by the European
Central Bank later in the day would offer clues on how much the
central bank has been supporting the bond markets of fiscally
weak euro zone countries.
 ""If the ECB data shows heavy bond-buying it would mean that
the compression in the peripheral yield spreads has not been a
sign that markets are willing to take on the risk of buying
bonds of weaker euro zone countries,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

said, adding that France would float proposals on the matter
during its turn at the G20 helm over the year ahead.
 French officials have said one area of discussion is how to
encourage greater use of China's yuan as a reserve currency in
the future, including talks on a possible timetable for its
inclusion in the basket of currencies which underpin the
International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights.
 Other ideas include encouraging a greater role for the SDR
itself as a reserve currency, in an effort to move away from
dollar hegemony.
 China is keen for the IMF to broaden the currencies that
make up its SDR international reserve assets from the current
basket of dollars, euros, yen and sterling.
 China wants to promote the use of SDRs for pricing
commodities and in global trade. Russia has championed SDRs and
recruited fellow emerging heavyweights China, Brazil and India
to promote it as a reserve currency.

 BRUSSELS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The euro zone is not discussing
making changes to the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF) or the scope of its operations, including purchases of
bonds, euro zone sources said on Monday.
 The Financial Times reported on Monday that European
officials were considering plans to overhaul the EU's portion of

sovereign bonds of distressed governments.
 ""This is not being seriously considered,"" one senior euro

 Such a step would make it easier to aid debt-laden countries
without resorting to fully-fledged bailouts, the newspaper said,
citing people involved with the deliberations.
 ""There are no changes to the EFSF or its remit under
discussion,"" a second senior euro zone source said.
 Only the European Central Bank has so far purchased bonds of
embattled peripheral euro zone countries such as Ireland and
Portugal to lower their borrowing costs, a move that proved
controversial even within the bank itself. 
 The FT also reported that the EFSF, which is set to be
replaced by a permanent fund in 2013, could be modified to
provide short-term credit to countries struggling to borrow on
the market but not in need of a multi-year bailout package.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2010 06:52AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Hungary's unorthodox fiscal policies,"Dec 13 (Reuters) - Hungary's new government is expected to
push controversial pension changes through parliament later on
Monday, allowing the state to effectively seize up to $14
billion in private pension assets to reduce the budget gap.
 Led by the centre-right Fidesz party, the government has
confounded markets with its unorthodox policies since taking
power after a landslide election win in April.
 The pension change and new taxes on banks and mostly
foreign-owned businesses will help Prime Minister Viktor Orban
avoid implementing new austerity measures.
 With a two-thirds majority in parliament, the government has
a mandate to change any laws, including the constitution. Orban
has used this power partly to consolidate his grip on key
institutions.
 Here is a collection of the major moves that have unnerved
investors, as well as European and international institutions.
 For the main story please see:
* ENDING EU/IMF DEAL
 On taking power, Orban said he would not extend a 20 billion
euro loan deal with the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.
 He said Hungary would no longer submit its policies to
oversight other than that of the EU and, in the first review of
the deal, talks ended prematurely on July 17 and the Fund's
delegation returned to Washington.
 Orban said in September that the move was meant to ""regain
financial independence and economic sovereignty"".
 
 REVERSING PENSION REFORM
 The government announced in October it would halt the
transfer of employee contributions to the mandatory private
pension system, a key piece of Hungary's post-communist reforms,
to save 420 billion forints ($1.99 billion) over 14 months.
 Subsequently it moved to eliminate the mandatory private
second pension pillar altogether and take over the assets of 3
million people worth a total of about $14 billion, from private
funds, leaving only the state system and voluntary pension
funds.
 It plans to spend most of the proceeds by 2012. State bonds,
which represent about half of the assets, will be cancelled and
the rest will be used to plug holes in the public pension fund's
deficit.
 
 COMMUNICATION BLUNDERS
 Fidesz and government officials have surprised investors
with a communication strategy that has not swayed from an
anti-austerity, pro-growth tack focusing heavily on voters.
 One of its first announcements was that Hungary's 2010
budget gap would be 7 percent of GDP, versus the planned 3.8
percent. It did not commit to the original target until
September.
 The party's vice chairman also sent the forint to a 2010 low
by likening Hungary to crisis-stricken Greece. Later, Orban said
credit downgrades were likely, but his government would still
prioritise growth over austerity.
 
 WINDFALL TAXES
 The government levied a windfall tax on banks, from which it
wants to collect an annual 200 billion forints this year and
next. It has also moved to collect an annual 161 billion forints
from the energy, telecoms and retail sectors.
 The cabinet has promised to phase out the extra taxes after
2012, but its plans depend on further revenues from the taxes at
least until 2014. Analysts and many of the affected companies
say the move will undermine profitability and dissuade them from
making investments, leading to slower growth in the coming
years.
 
 CURBING TOP COURT'S POWERS
 After the Constitutional Court annulled a government motion
to put a 98 percent tax on severance packages paid in the public
sector since 2005, the government changed the constitution and
the law governing the top court, stripping its powers to judge
on matters of public finance.
 The move was designed to neutralise the court in a far more
weighty issue -- the pension funds. Fidesz did not want to allow
the court to interfere with the pension legislation, a reversal
of which could cost the budget hundreds of billions of forints.
 
 CONFRONTATIONS WITH CENTRAL BANK
 Fidesz has criticised the central bank for keeping policy
too tight and called for Governor Andras Simor to step down for
keeping investments in a Cyprus-based account. It slashed his
salary by 75 percent and has submitted a plan that will let it
name four of the bank's seven rate setters on March 1.
 The government has not denied media reports that it wants to
pack the council with dovish members to ease monetary policy and
also raise the central bank's inflation target to 3.5 percent
from 3 percent, allowing lower interest rates.
 
 BUDGET WATCHDOG
 Parliament last week approved a government proposal to strip
the independent Fiscal Council, created in 2008 to oversee
budget planning, of most of its funding and all of its staff.
The Council has been a vocal critic of the government's
policies.
 The new council will include the central bank governor and
two people seen as very close to Fidesz: Laszlo Domokos, Fidesz
stalwart and chairman of the State Audit Office, and a nominee
of President Pal Schmitt, a former Fidesz vice chairman.
 
 POLITICAL NOMINATIONS
 Orban and Fidesz have made sweeping changes at the top
levels of nearly all areas of public administration, dismissing
previous figures and replacing them with party loyalists.
 Among other changes, Fidesz loyalists now run the State
Audit Office, the financial authority PSZAF, the national media
authority, and the state prosecutor's office. Critics of the
government say the moves will reduce policy transparency.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2010 06:48AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Dutch NSI turns back home with VastNed approach," * NSI says offer pre dividend is at 9.7 percent premium
 * Companies facing tough domestic office market
 * VastNed shares up 6.2 percent, Nieuwe Steen down 4.5
percent

(Adds VastNed, NSI, analyst comments, details, shares)
 By Aaron Gray-Block
 AMSTERDAM, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Dutch real estate group Nieuwe
Steen Investments (NSI) unveiled details of an all-share offer
for VastNed Offices/Industrial, a surprise move to deepen
exposure to its troubled home market.
 The deal, which NSI said was at a 9.7 percent premium to
VastNed O/I's closing price on Friday, would mark a change in
strategy, NSI having looked to Switzerland, France and Germany
to expand abroad and build a portfolio of office and retail
properties since Israeli investment group Habas bought a 21
percent stake in 2007.
 Petercam analyst Stephan Van Weeren said he believed NSI had
realised it was late into France, where office property yields
were falling below acceptable levels for NSI, while Switzerland
was expensive and it had struggled to get a sizeable portfolio
in Germany.
 Both VastNed O/I, worth about 220 million euros at Friday's
closing price, and NSI are facing a tough domestic office market
hit by oversupply, slow economic growth, a problematic
demographic spread and a rising trend of flexible working.
 NSI said the deal would create a company with 2.4 billion
euros in assets and a balanced portfolio of high-yielding
offices and retail space, while rental income would amount to
more than 200 million euros.
 It added the combined group would rebalance towards a 50-50
mix between retail and office properties, and the deal would
provide annual synergies of at least 3.5 million euros.
 ""NSI looks forward to constructive and expeditious
discussions with VastNed O/I going forward,"" NSI said.
 VastNed O/I did not respond to requests for comment, but
told news agency ANP it was surprised NSI had publicly detailed
the proposed offer prior to talks on Monday. A spokesman for
Habas was not immediately available.
 Shares in VastNed O/I were up 6.2 percent at 12.28 euros at
1022 GMT, an almost eight-month high in a slightly positive
Amsterdam market, while NSI shares fell 4.5 percent.
 
 'DISCOUNT OFFER'
 Detailing its offer late on Sunday, NSI said it was
proposing an exchange ratio of 0.85 NSI share for every VastNed
O/I share, valuing VastNed shares at 12.72 euros, a 9.7 percent
premium to the closing price of 11.6 euros on Friday.
 The final price would be 13.33 euros per share, including
VastNed O/I's direct investment result of 0.61 euros per share
for the nine months to Sept. 30, which it usually pays out as a
dividend.
 That would represent an exchange ratio 0.9, or a 15 percent
premium to VastNed O/I's Friday's close, NSI said.
 ING analyst Pieter van der Meijden said the offer price
would be immediately accretive on a net asset value (NAV) basis
for NSI, but was at a discount to the NAV of 16.36 euros
reported by VastNed O/I on Sept. 30 at its nine-month results.
 ""I doubt VastNed Offices will accept the bid as it ...
implies quite a large discount to NAV,"" Van der Meiden said.
 He added VastNed O/I shareholders would likely realise the
company was caught in a negative cycle and would not demand an
offer price at NAV, but NSI might still have to sweeten its bid.
 NSI, which has a market capitalisation of 650 million euros,
said all assets and liabilities of VastNed would be transferred
to NSI, and VastNed shareholders would receive new NSI shares,
but it is still uncertain whether a deal will materialise.

 * Dollar supported on higher Treasury yields
 * Investors await Fed meeting, EU summit

 (Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Monday, dogged by uncertainty about how euro zone
countries will deal with their debt problems, while the U.S.
currency remained supported by rising U.S. Treasury yields.
 Overall currency movements were limited because few
investors were willing to take on big positions before a Federal
Reserve meeting this week and a European Union summit, and
liquidity is drying up as the year comes to a close.
 Further selling in Treasuries pushed the 10-year yield to a
six-month high and supported the dollar on the view that rising
yields would make U.S. assets more attractive, while the euro
struggled before the two-day EU summit beginning on Thursday.
 As speculation remains high that Portugal and other
countries may follow Ireland and Greece in the bailout queue,
European leaders are expected to agree to tweak the EU treaty,
paving the way to create the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
from 2013, when a temporary mechanism expires.
 Off the agenda is the controversial topic of joint euro zone
bonds, supported by some member states while opposed by many
officials in Germany, the bloc's dominant economy.
 With few surprises expected from the summit, Stephen Gallo,
head of markets analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange, said the
euro was unlikely to change its general downward trend.
 ""The market is still poised to favour the dollar,"" he said.
 ""Speculative and leveraged money is still more inclined to
be short of euros and they will stay this way through December
and the first quarter of next year.""
 Speculators trimmed short positions against the dollar last
week but more than doubled their bets against the euro,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
signalling growing bearishness on the currency.
 Some analysts said a quick decision on the ESM may provide a
boost to the euro as it would remove at least one layer of
uncertainty about the stability of the euro zone.
 Before that, the Fed meets on Tuesday. Officials are
expected to assess its second round of quantitative easing
announced in November, the prospect of which dragged the dollar
lower in September and October. 
 But they are not expected to signal any shift away from
their intention to buy $600 billion in government debt, which is
seen limiting any significant dollar upside.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.3220, having
touched a session low of $1.3182. Traders said options expiries
around $1.3200 were acting as a magnet for the currency pair
around that level.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar index, which tracks its movements against a
currency basket, rose 0.1 percent to 80.183, while the U.S.
currency rose 0.4 percent to 84.25 yen.
 The dollar has been supported by a rise in Treasury yields
which climbed as high as 3.39 percent after a U.S. proposal to
extend Bush era tax cuts. This is seen helping the economy even
as it raises issues about mounting U.S. deficits.
 JPMorgan analysts said firmness in the dollar due to rising
yields was unlikely to continue in the longer term.
 ""The current surge in UST yields should have partly
reflected an expected deterioration in the U.S. fiscal
situation, but a rise in long-term yields backed by concern on
fiscal policy should not be supportive for the currency in the
mid/long-term,"" they said in a note.
 Analysts said weekly data on bond purchases by the European
Central Bank later in the day would offer clues on how much the
central bank has been supporting the bond markets of fiscally
weak euro zone countries.
 ""If the ECB data shows heavy bond-buying it would mean that
the compression in the peripheral yield spreads has not been a
sign that markets are willing to take on the risk of buying
bonds of weaker euro zone countries,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2010 06:28AM ET</span>",Slim majority see China rate rise before end 2010-Reuters poll," By Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 13 (Reuters) - China is poised to raise
interest rates before the end of this year, but will then
increase them just twice more in 2011, relying instead on
using lending controls as its weapon of choice in the fight
against inflation, a Reuters poll shows.	
 The 26 economists contacted over the past three days
revealed an emerging consensus that Beijing will try to get
away with a milder course of policy tightening than many in
the market had assumed it would implement.	
 All of the economists said that China would raise rates in
the coming few months.	
 A narrow majority of 55 percent said an increase of 25
basis points was likely before the end of 2010, while the
remaining 45 percent saw the next rate rise in the first
quarter of 2011.	
 One-year benchmark deposit rates currently stand at 2.5
percent, putting real rates well into negative territory after
consumer inflation sped to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in
the year to November.	
 The median forecast was for the Chinese central bank to
raise deposit rates 75 basis points to 3.25 percent by the
midpoint of 2011.	
 ""Consumer price inflation is going to be about 3 percent
in the medium to long term, so it is quite necessary for
deposit rate to follow that and return to the 3 percent
level,"" Wang Han, an economist at CEBM in Shanghai, said.	
 One-year lending rates were seen following deposit rates
in lock-step. Currently 5.56 percent, they will rise to 6.31
percent around the middle of next year, the poll suggests.	
 
 
 LENDING CONTROLS, RESERVE REQUIREMENTS	
 China has raised interest rates just once over the past
year, but has officially increased banks' required reserves
six times, preferring to use this quantitative control as a
way of limiting the amount of cash in the economy.	
 The median forecast was for another three reserve
requirement increases by the end of next year. But none of the
economists in the poll thought these alone would be sufficient.	
 ""Any reluctance to avoid using more potent policy tools
looks increasingly untenable given the speed with which price
pressures are building,"" said Brian Jackson, an economist with
Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.	
 But rather than relying on interest rates alone, China
will weigh on its state-owned banking system, an essential arm
of its monetary policy, to cap the flow of credit into the
economy.	
 Beijing will order banks to restrict new loans to 7
trillion yuan next year, down about 7 percent from this year's
credit target, according to the median forecast.	
 Chinese leaders gave greater prominence to the fight
against inflation in their statement on Sunday at the end of
the Central Economic Work Conference, an annual meeting at
which they chart policy for the coming year. [ID:nTOE6BB00G]	
 But at the same time as vowing to focus on price
stability, they also said that they will strike a balance
between controlling inflation and maintaining growth. Some
analysts have read this as relatively soft language,
indicating that officials believe inflation is under control
and harsh tightening will not be necessary.

 * Investor tolerance could give way as policy risk rises
 * Hungary a poster child for 'Beijing consensus'
 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Elements of China's
all-controlling state capitalism have always been envied by
developing economies keen to emulate its spectacular growth but
its appeal is growing among embattled policymakers everywhere.
 Whether Brazil's capital tax to discourage hot money flows
or Hungary's unorthodox deficit-slashing plans, states are
adopting policies that have less to do with the 'Washington
consensus' espoused by the U.S. and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and more in common with China's particular brand of
state activism in the economy.
 This so-called 'Beijing consensus' eschews liberal
capitalism in return for the state's hold on the exchange rate
and an ability to mobilise state-owned firms -- an alluring
alternative for emerging economies trying to limit destabilising
capital flows and currency appreciation that threatens to erode
their competitive advantage.
 The tide of cheap money arising from ultra-low interest
rates in the developed world have also given policymakers leeway
to flirt with free-market heterodoxy.
 ""The rule book has been thrown out the window. Because
capital flows are so strong, there's a sense markets implicitly
endorse more unorthodox economic policies,"" said Deutsche Bank
emerging markets strategist John-Paul Smith.
 
 BEIJING TO BUDAPEST
 Hungary offers a stark example of how far some states have
strayed from the free-market orthodoxy that has dominated much
of the global economy since the end of the Cold War.
 The European Union member has ruled out further IMF aid and
defied conventional economic wisdom arguing for austerity by
opting to grow its way out of a deficit with tax cuts, paid for
in part by windfall taxes on banks.
 A radical pensions overhaul, reminiscent of Argentina's
nationalisation of its private pensions industry late 2008, will
also see the state effectively seize 10 billion euros from
private pensions.
 Muted investor reaction reveals how far opinion has evolved.
 While Moody's cut Hungary's credit rating by two notches to
just above 'junk', the forint  remains well above its
record low last March and 2010 lows in July. [ID:nLDE6B50BT]
 Budapest last week managed to sell more local debt than
planned and the cost of insuring the country's debt
 is down from its 2010 peak.
 Given the scale of fiscal pressures elsewhere, particularly
in the euro zone, investors are braced for similar unorthodox
moves albeit on a more modest scale.
 Poland is seeking to reduce private pension contributions to
rein in public debt and Ireland is raiding its national pension
fund to help support its banks. [ID:nLDE6B50P8]
 ""Governments will become more inventive. You'll see measures
to cut deficit and debt levels that you've never seen before,""
said Cheuvreux strategist Simon Quijano-Evans.
 The financial meltdown triggered by the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in 2008 immediately made investors keener on state
involvement in the economy -- both to bail out the financial
sector and try and revive growth from the fallout. 
 ""There's an element of social contract; a recognition that
the state may intervene in the economy for social stability,""
said Cambridge-based academic Stefan Halper.
 ""There's growing global acceptance of state capitalism.
Venezuela and Chile are adapting portions of it. In Saudi Arabia
and the UAE, public/private sector decision-making are blurred,""
said Halper, author of 'The Beijing Consensus: How China's
Authoritarian Model Will Dominate the Twenty-First Century'.
 
 PULLING LEVERS
 The shift in thinking adds up to a reassessment of whether
and to what extent governments can justifiably place barriers to
capital, a central theme for markets and Group of 20 talks in
recent months. 
 An IMF paper this year said capital controls could be part
of a policy mix to cope with sudden capital surges while the G20
last month endorsed ""carefully designed macro-prudential
measures"" for emerging economies coping with investment flows.
 Instead of automatically triggering capital flight, recent
capital controls adopted by economies from Brazil to Taiwan to
slow foreign inflows have had limited effect, with investors
willing to pay higher costs in their search for yield.
 But a pullback in liquidity may hit markets where the
state's encroachment into the economy has been most acute.
 Deutsche's Smith says investors are increasingly aware of
the risks of state involvement in the economy. This could be why
China and Brazil stock markets underperformed relatively more
open markets in Turkey and Thailand this year, he said.
 And as politicians face increasing pressure to protect
domestic jobs, the temptation is to resort to more unorthodox
economic measures that may finally scare investors. 
 ""Policy risk is getting larger...The more economic levers
the authorities can pull, the greater the danger of them pulling
the wrong one,"" said Nick Timberlake, Head of emerging equities
at HBSC Global Asset Management.

 * Will launch LePad tablet PC within the ""next few weeks""
 * Plans smartphone to run on China Mobile's 3G network
 * Will not enter data services until it has critical mass
 By Kelvin Soh and Don Durfee
 HONG KONG/BEIJING, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Lenovo, the world's No.
4 PC maker, expects its operating profit margin to trend upwards,
helped by easing component shortages and an appreciating Chinese
currency, its CFO said on Monday at the Reuters China Investment
Summit.
 ""With an appreciating RMB and falling component prices,
obviously managing such a business will be easier than having to
deal with a depreciating RMB and rising component prices,"" CFO
Wong Wai Ming said in an interview at Reuters offices in Beijing.
He declined to give a forecast.
 Lenovo's operating profit margin, a key performance indicator
in the PC sector, rose to 1.9 percent in the July-September
quarter this year, up from 1.58 percent in the preceding quarter.
 Separately, Wong said the company will launch its LePad
tablet PC in China within the next few weeks and is planning to
have a smartphone that will run on China Mobile's TD-SCDMA 3G
network, as it moves beyond its traditional PC base.
 The company already produces smartphones for use in 3G
networks operated by China's two smaller operators, but has yet
to make one for China Mobile, which controls more than two-thirds
of the world's biggest mobile market.
 ""We obviously plan to have a product for each operator,"" he
said.
 PC companies such as Lenovo, Dell and HP have been
increasingly looking to mobile devices such as the smartphone to
diversify away from the heavily commoditised personal computer,
where net margins can fall into the low single digits for brands
such as Acer.
 A supply shortage in LCD panels crimped sales of Lenovo's
first smartphone, the LePhone, in the few months following its
launch in May. But the shortage has eased as Lenovo began
sourcing from other LCD manufacturers, Wong said.
 Overall component prices were also beginning to fall across
the board as suppliers such as LCD makers and chipset makers
begin ramping up production in response to the stronger demand
seen earlier this year.
 However, the company was seeing PC shipment growth slow from
the numbers recorded earlier this year, during which companies
frequently recorded shipment growth of higher than 20 percent,
according to figures from research firm IDC said.
 ""We're seeing that demand for PCs is starting to slow,"" Wong
said. ""By that I mean the market is still growing, but not at
such a high percentage year-to-year.""
 Lenovo saw the biggest improvement among the top PC brands in
the third quarter of this year, with shipments up 33 percent
during those three months and outperforming the overall market's
11 percent rise, according to IDC figures.
 Its shares have risen about 14 percent in the past three
weeks and closed at HK$5.37 on Friday, about 13 percent below the
HK$6.06 average target price of 25 analysts polled by Thomson
Reuters StarMine.
 Lenovo is also staying off corporate data services for the
time being until it has reached the critical mass needed in
mature markets such as the United States and Europe, Wong said.
 Rivals such as HP and Dell have been investing heavily to
grow their presence in the area, most recently engaging in a $2.4
billion bidding battle for high-end storage maker 3PAR.
 ""Longer term, that is obviously an area we will look at,""
Wong said. ""Looking at opportunities in China versus
opportunities outside China, we still need to build up the
critical mass before we can do it outside China.""

 * Move is latest pro-growth policy to raise market doubts
 * Economists: fiscal plan depends on growth; reforms lacking

(Adds vote on pension law, graphics)
 By Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Hungarian lawmakers voted to
roll back a 1997 pension reform on Monday, effectively allowing
the government to seize up to $14 billion in private pension
assets to cut the budget deficit while avoiding austerity
measures.
 With financial markets on edge across Europe over debt and
deficits, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has spurned international
advice to cut budget costs, as Ireland and Greece have done, in
favour of unconventional policies meant to revive Hungary's
moribund economy.
 Parliament passed the pension legislation with 250 votes
for, 58 votes against and 43 abstentions. Orban's ruling Fidesz
party has a two-thirds parliamentary majority.
 By plugging its budget shortfall with the pension funds and
new taxes on banks and mostly foreign-owned businesses, Orban
has promised to end years of austerity and bolstered the
popularity of his right-of-centre Fidesz party in opinion polls.
 But the strategy -- which also includes regaining ""financial
sovereignty"" by ending a 20 billion euro ($26.38 billion) safety
net deal with the European Union and International Monetary Fund
-- has worried investors, caused losses in Hungarian assets, and
prompted a downgrade by Moody's ratings agency last week to
Baa3, the lowest investment grade.
 The government has also criticised the independent central
bank for raising interest rates last month, and is poised to
change the central bank law so it can fill the rate-setting
Monetary Council with its own candidates.
 Economists say that by raiding private funds, Orban will cut
the deficit to below 3 percent of gross domestic product next
year. But he will also only delay reforms which they say are
vital to tackle a debt pile equivalent to 80 percent of GDP --
just above the EU average but higher than any other country in
the bloc's post-communist East.
 The plan depends heavily on economic growth -- a problem if
Europe's recovery slows next year as expected -- and analysts
have also warned of risks to long-term fiscal sustainability.
 ""While the country's headline deficit is forecast to move
only to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2011, it has achieved this
through myriad short-term policies that mean the budget will be
unsustainable after 2012 with a hole of some 500 billion forints
($2.38 billion),"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura in
London.
 
 DOUBT ON REFORMS
 The legislation imposes stiff penalties on Hungarians who do
not transfer their pension assets back into the state system by
the end of January.
 The government will sell the assets and use the income to
cut debt, plug holes in the state pension fund, and create room
for tax cuts for households and small companies. 
 It hopes tax cuts, including a 10 percent corporate tax rate
for all companies from 2013, will boost growth to 5.5 percent by
2015, a faster pace than any achieved in the past 20 years.
 The pension change -- which pension funds said amounted to
nationalisation -- has not hurt Fidesz's popularity so far, as
most Hungarians had not expected to get proper pensions anyway.
""I haven't worked in a fully registered job for more than 10
years. What kind of pension savings do you think I have? Take
it, please, if it's good for the country,"" said Tamas Kemeny,
37, a radio technician.
 Some Hungarians, however, are shocked by the lack of choice
offered by the government.
 ""I have no idea whether the state system is better than the
private pension system but now they tell me I can say goodbye to
half of my pensions if I'm not in the state pension system. This
is like choosing between a kiss or a smack in the face,"" said
Gabriella Kiss, 21, a student.
 Investors are sceptical. The forint has lost 5 percent
against the euro since Fidesz's April election victory, and 3-
and 5-year bond yields have jumped more than 2 percentage points
to almost 8 percent. 
The government has promised to unveil a structural reform
plan worth 600 billion-800 billion forints in February, but
little is known about the details.

 (Adds details)
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - British manufacturers' input
costs rose last month at their fastest annual rate since July,
contrasting with data on Friday which showed a surprise slowdown
in producer output price inflation.
 The Office for National Statistics said annual producer
input price inflation picked up to 9.0 percent from 8.2 percent
in October, above economists' forecasts of a rise to 8.5
percent. There were also upward revisions to the monthly and
annual figures for October.
 Consumer price inflation data for November will be released
on Tuesday, and is forecast to show inflation remaining more
than one percentage point above the Bank of England's 2 percent
target. However, the BoE expects inflation pressures to subside
over the next two years and is not expected to raise interest
rates for another year at least.
 ""The figures suggest that cost pressures in the
manufacturing sector are still building,"" said Samuel Tombs at
Capital Economics.
 ""Consumer price inflation may be a little slower to fall
than first hoped next year and in 2012.""
 A rise in crude oil costs was the biggest driver, accounting
for more than a third of the annual rise. Imported metals and
chemicals were the second and third biggest contributors.
 On the month, manufacturers' input prices rose 0.9 percent,
with crude oil and fuel accounting for almost 90 percent of
that.
 Despite the slightly faster than expected rise in input
prices, Bank of England policymakers will be reassured by
Friday's output price figures which were slightly softer than
expected. 
 Producer output price inflation fell unexpectedly to 3.9
percent in November from October's 4.0 percent, after the cost
of petroleum products rose more slowly than in November 2009.
 The input price figures had been planned for release
alongside Friday's producer output price data but last minute
concern about potential errors delayed the release.

 BERLIN, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The topic of joint euro zone

said.
 ""The issue of euro bonds will be excluded ... at the summit

 EU leaders meeting in Brussels this week aim to set out
changes to the bloc's treaty and agree on a permanent mechanism
for defending the euro against financial upheavals.
 Asselborn said Europe's major powers needed to show
solidarity with smaller nations and urged the EU to present a
unified front at the summit in order to reassure markets.
 ""We have a euro crisis and we have to deal with this crisis
together. We need to approach it as Europeans, not nationally,""
he said, noting there was no alternative to defending the euro.
 Asselborn said half of Germany's exports were to its EU

 * Dollar supported on higher UST yields
 * Investors await Fed meeting, EU summit

 (Adds comment, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Monday, dogged by uncertainty about how euro zone
countries will deal with their debt problems, while the U.S.
currency remained supported on rising U.S. Treasury yields.
 The euro clung to the $1.32 region, where options expiries
were seen, and overall currency movements were limited as few
investors were willing to take on big positions before a Federal
Reserve meeting this week and a European Union summit.
 Ongoing selling in Treasuries pushed the 10-year yield to a
six-month high and supported the dollar on the view that rising
yields would make U.S. assets more attractive, while the euro
struggled before the two-day EU summit beginning on Thursday.
 Analysts said weekly data on bond purchases by the European
Central Bank later in the day would offer clues on how much the
central bank has been supporting the bond markets of fiscally
weak euro zone countries.
 ""If the ECB data shows heavy bond-buying it would mean that
the compression in the peripheral yield spreads has not been a
sign that markets are willing to take on the risk of buying
bonds of weaker euro zone countries,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 As speculation remains high that Portugal and other
countries may follow Ireland and Greece in the bailout queue,
European leaders are expected to come up with a permanent
mechanism to aid debt-stricken euro zone countries this week.
 Leuchtmann said a quick decision would remove much
uncertainty from the market, which may boost the euro.
 Before that, the Fed meets on Tuesday. Officials are
expected to assess its second round of quantitative easing
announced in November, the prospect of which dragged the dollar
lower in September and October. 
 But they are not expected to signal any shift away from
their intention to buy $600 billion in government debt, despite
Washington's proposal to extend tax cuts, which has been a
driver of the sell-off in Treasuries.
 In early European trade, the euro slipped 0.3 percent on the
day to $1.3201. Market participants said a large number of
options around $1.3200 seen expiring later in the day was acting
as a magnet for the currency pair around that level.
 Speculators trimmed short positions against the dollar last
week but more than doubled their bets against the euro,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
signalling growing bearishness on the currency.
 
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar index, which tracks its movements against a
currency basket, rose 0.3 percent to 80.269, while the U.S.
currency rose 0.4 percent to 84.27 yen.
 The dollar has been supported by a rise in Treasury yields
following a U.S. proposal to extend Bush era tax cuts, which is
seen helping the economy even as it raises issues about
Washington's mounting deficits.
 At the same time, economic indicators have improved, if
unevenly, and some in the market say this has buoyed the dollar.
 The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.39 percent, This has
supported the dollar versus the yen, as the pair often tracks
the move in the 10-year U.S./Japanese yield spread, but the U.S.
currency's rise has been relatively limited.
 JPMorgan analysts said an upbeat assessment of the U.S.
economy by the Fed would support higher Treasury yields, while
adding that firmness in the dollar due to rising yields was
unlikely to continue in the longer term.
 ""The current surge in UST yields should have partly
reflected an expected deterioration in the U.S. fiscal situation
but a rise in long-term yields backed by concern on fiscal
policy should not be supportive for the currency in the
mid/long-term,"" they said in a note.
 The Australian dollar shook off earlier losses against the
dollar and hit a seven-month high versus the yen around 83.15
yen, boosted by higher commodity and equity prices.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Selling pressure on 10-year U.S.
Treasuries drove yields to fresh six-month highs on Monday as
investors threatened to undo this year's bond rally on signs of
global economic recovery and deeper U.S. deficits.
 World shares added to an end-of-year rally, with gains in
Japan and Europe, and Chinese stocks posted their biggest gains
in two months as prospects of interest rate increases eased.
 The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies,
 U.S. Treasury yields were up around 4 basis points to just
3.365 percent, having earlier hit levels not seen for six
months. Yields -- which move inversely to prices -- had shot up
as much as 20 basis points last Wednesday alone on a combination
of expectations that the U.S. economic climate will improve and
worries that proposed extensions of tax cuts will bloat the
fiscal deficit further.
 Investors have also begun reappraising the likelihood of
further bond-buying by the U.S. Federal Reserve after its
current $600 billion quantitative easing programme is completed.
 Monday's selling had some impact on short-term U.S. paper,
suggesting investors may begin pricing in raised expectations of
higher interest rates next year.
 ""If the market really thinks there will be a rate hike
within a year, then the two-year yield could rise near 1
percent,"" said Tomoaki Shishido, a fixed-income analyst at
Nomura Securities in Tokyo, adding that he did not believe there
would be such a rate rise.
 The two-year note was yielding 0.66 percent, up two basis
points but off its highs.
 Wariness about holding low-yielding U.S. government debt had
little impact on Europe, where the 10-year German Bund was flat.
 
 FX AND STOCKS
 European bonds are trading against the complex backdrop of
the euro zone debt crisis, set to be the main topic later in the
week at an EU summit that will seek some way of easing fiscal
pressures weighing on currency bloc's weaker economies.
 The euro was up a third of a percent against the dollar at
$1.3233 (EUR=. The shared currency had earlier come under
pressure from expectations that U.S. assets will yield higher
returns.
 Currency speculators trimmed short positions against the
dollar last week but more than doubled their bets against the
euro, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, signalling growing bearishness.
 On stock markets, investors were building up gains before
the Christmas/New Year break.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was up 0.4 percent for
a more than 8.5 percent year-to-date gain.
 ""Market sentiment is bullish because of strong economic data
and some positive policy announcements in the United States in
the past weeks,"" said Koen De Leus, strategist at KBC
Securities, in Brussels.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 gained 0.5 percent and Japan's
Nikkei closed up 0.8 percent.
 China's key stock index closed up 2.9 percent on relief that
the central bank raised lenders' reserve requirements to curb
inflation last week instead of hiking benchmark interest rates.
 The market had been worried about a rise in rates, thus the
increase in bank reserve requirement ratios (RRR) late on Friday
was greeted with more active buying.

 * Higher reserve ratio key part of China's inflation battle
(Adds source of quote in paragraph 7)	
 HONG KONG/BEIJING, Dec 13 (Reuters) - China's central bank
told six of the country's biggest lenders that a special
increase in required reserves will be extended, the latest
step to try to quell inflation in a campaign that leaders this
weekend suggested would be intensified.	
 Three industry sources told Reuters that the special
increase in reserves that had been due to expire this week
will be extended for three months. That followed an official
reserve requirement increase for all banks -- the third in a
month -- that was announced on Friday.	
 By locking up a chunk of cash that banks would otherwise
have been able to lend, the moves help absorb some of the
liquidity that drove inflation in November to a 28-month peak
of 5.1 percent, higher than analysts had been expecting.	
 Inflation data on Saturday showed signs that price
pressures are broadening beyond food, raising the prospect
that the government will soon roll out bigger ammunition to
temper the rising costs of living in the form of interest rate
increases, currency appreciation and lending
restrictions.[ID:nTOE6BA009]	
 That seemed to be on the cards as Chinese leaders, in a
meeting chaired by President Hu Jintao to map out the
country's economic agenda, made stabilising prices a more
prominent task, state media reported on Sunday.	
 The extension of the reserve requirement increase, which
was initially ordered in October, acts as a holding measure
while Beijing weighs more aggressive policy options.	
 ""There are only about two weeks left before the end of the
year, so it's not that likely that the central bank will
announce or implement further RRR hikes. That's why it is
choosing to extend the selective ratios,"" said Lu Zhengwei,
chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai.	
 
 The extension affects six of China's biggest lenders and
includes Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China , the sources said.	
 The required reserve ratio (RRR) for most of these banks
will stand at a record high of 19 percent and locks up about
180 billion yuan ($27 billion) in deposits that the banks
would otherwise have had available to lend.	
 China officially raised banks' required reserves for the
third time in a month on Friday, so far its preferred
tightening tool. It has only raised interest rates once this
year, but has officially raised reserve requirements six times.	
 On top of that, it has also used unofficial, selective
increases twice this year, targeting banks that have been
especially heavy lenders or that are systemically important.	
 
 MAPPING POLICY	
 Alongside the rise in consumer prices, producer prices
rose 6.1 percent in the year to November and 1.4 percent from
October, the fastest month-on-month rate since July 2008.	
 ""Mainstream economists were not on enough high alert for
this round of inflation. It will last a long time,"" Gao
Shanwen, chief economist at Essence Securities, said.	
 Chinese leaders gave greater prominence to the fight
against inflation in their statement on Sunday at the end of
the Central Economic Work Conference, an annual meeting at
which they chart policy for the coming year. [ID:nTOE6BB00G]	
 ""Greater policy emphasis should be given to price
stability,"" the statement said.	
 The conference also reaffirmed a shift to a ""prudent""
monetary policy from the previous ""appropriately loose"" stance
announced by the Communist Party's ruling body last week.	
 That change in wording, coupled with heightened concerns
over inflation, could pave the way for a more aggressive
course of interest rate increases and lending restrictions,
analysts say.	
 ""The governments' prudent monetary policy stance suggests
imminent rate hikes to anchor inflation expectations and
aggressive RRR hikes to 22 percent to normalise quantitative
conditions,"" Isaac Meng, an economist with BNP Paribas, said
in a note.	
 But not all analysts interpreted the outcome of the
economic conference in the same light. 
 Shen Minggao, an economist with Citigroup, noted that the
government still said it wanted to strike a balance between
taming inflation and maintaining fast growth. The economy
expanded 9.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with a
year earlier.	
 ""The relatively mild language suggests that Chinese
authorities believe that inflation is still under control and
have not planned to slow GDP growth significantly in 2011 from
its current level,"" he said.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday, looking
set to remain in its downtrend for now, while the dollar edged
up, supported by higher Treasury yields after improving U.S. data
late last week.
 The euro has been under steady pressure in recent weeks on
concerns over debt levels in peripheral euro zone states, and
many in the market expect that pressure to remain, with some
looking for a re-test of this month's low at $1.2969.
 There was talk of a mixture of automatic stop-loss sell
orders and take-profit orders on the euro in the $1.3165-80 area,
just below the day's low of $1.3182, and then euro bids at
$1.3150 and more sell stops below that.
 Currency speculators trimmed short positions against the
dollar last week but more than doubled their bets against the
euro, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, signalling growing bearishness on the currency.
 ""Euro positioning made a determined incursion into short
territory last week, for the first time since early September,
suggesting the escalating sovereign debt saga continues to take
its toll,"" wrote Gareth Berry, a FX strategist at UBS in
Singapore.
 A trader at a Canadian bank cautioned, however, that if the
market was too heavily short on the euro at this point there was
a risk of a short-covering rebound.
 On the charts, resistance was expected up at $1.3280.
 The euro was 0.3 percent down from U.S. trading levels, at
$1.3196 on trading platform EBS.
 European Union leaders meet later this week.
 But while core euro countries Germany and France have pledged
to better align tax and labour policies to foster convergence,
they rejected calls for a rescue fund to be increased or for
joint sovereign bonds, and the lack of unity over a solution is
expected to keep pressuring the currency sporadically.
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar has been supported by a rise in Treasury yields
following a proposal in the United States to extend Bush era tax
cuts, which is seen as helping the economy, and economic
indicators have been improving, if unevenly.
 Consumer sentiment data on Friday showed confidence at its
highest in six months. The data fits into a pattern of an economy
that is gaining traction after a slowdown and is likely to
intensify the debate on whether the Federal Reserve needs to keep
stimulating the economy through asset purchases.
 The Fed meets on Tuesday and officials are expected to assess
its second round of quantitative easing announced in November,
the prospect of which dragged the dollar lower in September and
October. But they are not expected to signal any shift away from
their intention to buy $600 billion in government debt, despite
Washington's proposal to extend tax cuts.
 The benchmark Treasury yield has touched its highest in six
months, at 3.39 percent, but the dollar, while supported by the
more attractive returns, has not gunned much higher against the
yen in the same period.
 Robert Ryan, an FX and interest rate strategist at BNP
Paribas in Singapore, said the two-year yield was probably a
better gauge of economic and dollar recovery prospects at this
stage as the 10-year yield response could be complicated by
longer term concerns about the U.S. budget deficit.
 The two-year yield climbed to 0.67 percent on Monday, its
highest since July.
 Dollar/yen has a mildly positive 90-day rolling correlation
with the two-year yield of just below 0.7 at the moment, less
pronounced than in July and September when both yields and the
dollar were falling.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 84.10 yen. The 84 yen level is
a barrier it has struggled to hold above in the past few couple
of weeks.
 Traders reported that Japanese exporters had been selling
dollars at 84.00 to 84.05 yen, with more offers expected above
84.50. The dollar has resistance up at 84.41 yen, a two-month
high set in late November.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 80.26 but is still below a
two-month high of 81.44 set in late November.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar, which has export ties to
China, was steady at $0.9845.
 It showed little reaction to a jump in China's inflation rate
reported at the weekend after the Asian giant on Friday hiked its
reserve requirement ratio, the amount of money lenders must keep
in reserve, for the third time in a month.

 BEIJING (Reuters), Dec 13 - Inflation in China is more
broad-based and stubborn than many economists had expected,
forcing the central bank to rely on a mix of tightening measures
to rein in prices, Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Essence
Securities, said on Monday at the Reuters China Investment
Summit.
 In an interview with Reuters, Gao pointed to worrying signs
that China's consumer inflation is spreading beyond food, with
production costs soaring in some sectors.
 ""Mainstream economists are not on enough of a high alert for
this round of inflation. It will last a long time and recur now
and then,"" he said.
 ""People think inflation is caused by shortages in farm goods,
but there are some other factors behind it, which has not been
given enough attention,"" he said.
 Chinese leaders gave greater prominence to the fight against
inflation in their statement on Sunday at the end of the Central
Economic Work Conference, an annual meeting at which they chart
policy for the coming year. [ID:nTOE6BB00G]
 China officially raised banks' required reserves for the
third time in a month on Friday.
 Gao said the People's Bank of China would use a combination
of higher interest rates, banks' reserve requirements and faster
yuan appreciation to try to put a lid on prices.
 The PBOC may have to raise interest rates three times from
now to the end of 2011 and increase reserve requirements 4-5
times, while letting the yuan  appreciate 4-5 percent,
he said.
 China will probably target new local currency lending of 7
trillion-7.5 trillion yuan in 2011, he said, higher than the
other recent estimates ranging from about 6.5 trillion to 7
trillion yuan.
 Gao cited rising prices for clothing, healthcare and Chinese
medicine as evidence that higher wages were also contributing to
broader inflation. Annual consumer inflation hit a 28-month high
of 5.1 percent in November.
 Annual inflation will probably peak at 5-6 percent in June or
July next year before easing in the second half, he predicted.
 Recent government measures to curb food prices may achieve
some short-term results, but inflation tends to be stubborn, he
said.

 Dec 10 (Reuters) - India has seen China as a military
threat since its defeat in a 1962 war, but with both emerging
as uneven economic powers, New Delhi now fears Beijing will
use its massive clout to block its global ambitions. 
 Here is a list of issues that bedevil ties as Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao arrives in India on Wednesday for a 2-day
trip. [ID:nTOE6B400E]	
 
 ECONOMIC RIVALRY	
 China and India are scouring the globe -- from Asia to
Africa and Latin America -- to secure resources and food
supplies to keep powering their burgeoning economies, a
rivalry that is partly reshaping global business systems and
foreign policy priorities.	
 India is playing catch-up, trying to chip away at China's
decade-long head start in the race for resources. It trails
China, for instance, in Africa where Beijing's investments in
one country alone, Ghana, topped the entire Indian investment
in the continent in 2006.	
 
 TRADE	
 Despite decades of mistrust stemming in part from their
territorial rivalry, trade is booming and China is now India's
biggest trade partner. The value of bilateral deals is
expected to pass $60 billion next year, a 30-fold increase
since 2000, raising the stakes in maintaining peace. But the
balance of trade is heavily in China's favour. India's trade
deficit with China rose from $1 billion in 2001-2 to $16
billion in 2007-8, according to Indian central bank data.	
 No other country has initiated more anti-dumping
investigations with the World Trade Organisation against China
than India.	
 India has sought to diversify its trade basket, but raw
materials and other low-end commodities such as iron ore still
make up about 60 percent of India's exports to China. By
contrast, high-value manufactured goods form the bulk of
Chinese exports.	
 As an example of how India is still heavily dependent on
Chinese equipment, Chinese power equipment maker Shanghai
Electric Group Co. in late October agreed to sell
power equipment and related service contracts worth $8.29
billion to India's Reliance Power over a 10-year
period.	
 
 BORDER DISPUTE	
 While a new war is very unlikely, the unsettled border
between the world's two most populous countries remains the
biggest single impediment to better relations.	
 The Asian giants still claim vast swathes of each other's
territories along their 3,500 km (2,173 mile) Himalayan border
which has largely remained peaceful since a border war in 1962.	
 The border was never demarcated. In the years before
Indian independence in 1947, the former British colonial
rulers saw little need to demarcate such a remote area and
later the two sides were unable to agree on a common border.	
 India also says Beijing is illegally holding 5,180 sq km
of northern Kashmir ceded to it by Pakistan in 1963.	
 China claims 90,000 square km on the eastern sector of the
border. Historians have said China's claim on the eastern
sector was to use as a bargaining chip in order to keep
control of the strategically important region Aksai Chin.	
 
 DALAI LAMA	
 Beijing's longest running grudge with India is over its
granting of asylum to Tibetan leader Dalai Lama, who fled to
India in the 1950s following a failed uprising, setting off a
chain of events that eventually led to the war between India
and China. Beijing, which brands the Dalai Lama a separatist,
worries that Tibet's spiritual leader is using his base in the
northern hill town of Dharamsala to keep separatist fires alive.	
 Last year, China reacted angrily to New Delhi's decision
to allow the Dalai Lama to visit the border state of Arunachal
Pradesh disputed by China. For the first time in years, it
also criticised a visit by Prime Minister Singh to the state,
suggesting it was raising the stakes there.	
 The Dalai Lama is due to visit Sikkim, an Indian state on
the Chinese border, during Wen's visit, something that could
inflame tensions.	
 
 DIPLOMACY	
 Tensions between Asia's two rising powers have simmered
since their border war in 1962, but in recent years Beijing
and New Delhi have mostly managed to compartmentalise their
differences.	
 The relationship has matured to the point that while they
can jointly advocate for the interests of emerging economies
through forums such as the Group of 20 and climate talks,
India has the confidence to criticise Beijing's currency policy.	
 Still, India remains deeply wary of its bigger and more
powerful neighbour. China, a long-time ally of India's bitter
rival Pakistan, is feared to be encircling India in a ""string
of pearls"" by investing in its neighbours such as Sri Lanka
and Myanmar. Navy officials say increasing numbers of Chinese
ships are sailing just outside Indian waters, and the two
still spar over their disputed Himalayan border.	
 A Chinese decision to provide stapled visas to residents
of the disputed Indian Kashmir region has ruffled New Delhi
which bristled at any suggestion that the Himalayan province
also claimed by Pakistan is not its territory.

 BEIJING/NEW DELHI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao faces a tough task when he arrives in India next week
to allay New Delhi's fears over China's rise as a global
power, and to smooth tensions in an often fractious
relationship.	
 Despite a boom in bilateral commerce in the past decade
and cooperation on global issues such as climate change, India
and China remain suspicious of each other's growing
international clout and influence.	
 ""The relationship is a mixture of third-world solidarity
and strategic rivalry. Those two elements are here to stay,""
said Jean Pierre Cabestan, an international relations
professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.	
 ""But India will need to balance China's growing power even
more tomorrow than today.""	
 Wen plans to spend Dec. 15-16 in New Delhi, after which he
will travel to Pakistan, India's closest rival, for another
two nights.	
 The growing economic interdependence between China and
India is likely to head Wen's agenda for the trip.	
 Analysts say he could announce more Chinese investments in
India or lower trade barriers to assuage the worries of Indian
politicians, peeved that the Sino-Indian trade balance is
heavily in China's favour.	
 
 
 
 India's deficit with China could reach $24-25 billion this
year, said Srikanth Kondapalli, head of East Asian studies at
Jahawarlal Nehru University.	
 The deficit rose to $16 billion in 2007-08, from $1
billion in 2001-02, according to Indian customs data.	
 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to press
Wen for reassurances that China will open its market wider,
especially in value-added sectors such as financial services
and information technology.	
 China is India's biggest trading partner, with bilateral
trade expected to pass $60 billion this year.
But even with greater market access, it is
likely to be a long time before India can close the trade gap.
""I don't see the deficit narrowing rapidly,""
said Dibyesh Anand, an international relations professor at
London's University of Westminster. ""Even if tariffs are
lowered on manufactured products, India can't compete with
China on manufactured products.""	
 
 TRADE IMBALANCE	
 India has sought to diversify its trade basket, but raw
materials and other low-end commodities such as iron ore still
make up about 60 percent of its exports to China.	
 In contrast, manufactured goods -- from trinkets to
turbines -- form the bulk of Chinese exports.
In an illustration of India's dependence on
Chinese manufacturing, Shanghai Electric Group Co
agreed in October to sell power equipment and related services
worth $8.3 billion to India's Reliance Power .
[ID:nSGE69S02V]	
 Even if India and China are the world's two largest
emerging economies, the development gap between them remains
large, due in part to a decade's head start for Chinese
economic reforms.
""India's at a phase of capital expenditure that
is 15 years behind China. That's just the way it is,"" said
Chetan Ahya, a Morgan Stanley economist in Singapore.	
 ""China also was importing a lot of capital goods in the
initial period of growth takeoff in the 1980s with periods of
trade deficit.""	
 India and China said in October that they would pursue a
free trade agreement, but talks could be protracted because
trade relations are overlaid with political and strategic rifts.	
 ""When it comes to economic ties, because there's a general
suspicion of Chinese motives in India, that would play into
the hands of those sceptical of China and probably filter down
into the Commerce Ministry,"" said Westminster University's
Anand .
""The trade deficit does not have a long-term
effect on relations,"" he added. ""But they want a scapegoat.
China is an easy one to blame because it is seen as a
political and military rival.""	

 GO-TO NEIGHBOUR
India and China have clashed repeatedly over a
raft of issues including their long-disputed border, China's
increasingly close relationship with Pakistan, and fears of
Chinese spying.	
 No other country has initiated more anti-dumping
investigations against China at the World Trade Organisation
than has India.	
 In May, India barred its mobile phone operators from
placing orders with China's Huawei Technologies and
ZTE Corp because of national security
concerns.	
 Still, both sides have something to gain from the
relationship.	
 ""The visit comes at a time when the Chinese are really
keen that the Indians do not become a fully fledged member of
the U.S. camp,"" said Manoj Joshi, the opinion editor of
India's Mail Today newspaper.	
 India needs Chinese backing for a permanent seat on the
U.N. Security Council and both countries have stood together
to resist Western demands in world trade and climate change
talks.
Singh is not expected to talk tough on China,
but this softer strategy could backfire at home. Indian
military officials have turned increasingly hawkish toward
China and are suspicious of China's intentions in the Indian
Ocean.	
 Nearly half a century after war broke out between them,
mistrust persists, especially over the 90,000 sq km (35,000
sq. miles) of land in Arunachal Pradesh state claimed by
Beijing.	
 China was incensed when the Dalai Lama visited the state
last year and saw it as proof of the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader's separatist machinations.
""I think the border dispute is still a festering
sore, which would continue to create disputes for the
relationship,"" said Pradeep Taneja, a lecturer in Asian
politics at the University of Melbourne. ""As long as the
nationalists on both sides continue to stir the pot, then any
settlement would not be easy.""

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday, looking
set to remain in its downtrend for now, while the dollar held
steady, supported by higher Treasury yields after improving U.S.
data late last week.
 The euro has been under steady pressure in recent weeks on
concerns over debt levels in peripheral euro zone states, and
many in the market expect that pressure to remain with some
looking for a re-test of this month's low at $1.2969.
 There was talk of a mixture of automatic stop-loss sell
orders and take-profit orders on the euro in the $1.3165-80 area,
just below the day's low of $1.3182, and then euro bids at
$1.3150 and more sell stops below that.
 Currency speculators trimmed short positions against the
dollar last week but more than doubled their bets against the
euro, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, signalling growing bearishness on the currency.
 ""Euro positioning made a determined incursion into short
territory last week, for the first time since early September,
suggesting the escalating sovereign debt saga continues to take
its toll,"" wrote Gareth Berry, FX strategist at UBS in Singapore.
 A trader at a Canadian bank cautioned, however, that if the
market was too heavily short euros at this point, there was the
risk of a short-covering rebound.
 On the charts, resistance was expected up at $1.3280.
 The euro was 0.3 percent down from U.S. trading levels, at
$1.3193 on trading platform EBS.
 European Union leaders meet later this week.
 But while core euro countries Germany and France have pledged
to better align tax and labour policies to foster convergence,
they rejected calls for a rescue fund to be increased or for
joint sovereign bonds, and the lack of unity over a solution is
expected to keep pressuring the currency sporadically.
 U.S. YIELDS
 The dollar has been supported by a rise in Treasury yields
following a proposal in the United States to extend Bush-era tax
cuts, which is seen as helping the economy, and economic
indicators have been improving, if unevenly.
 Consumer sentiment data on Friday showed confidence at its
highest in six months. The data fits into a pattern of an economy
that is gaining traction after a slowdown and is likely to
intensify the debate over whether the Federal Reserve needs to
keep stimulating the economy through asset purchases.
 The Fed meets on Tuesday and officials are expected to assess
its second round of quantitative easing announced in November,
the prospect of which dragged the dollar lower in September and
October. But they are not expected to signal any shift away from
their intention to buy $600 billion in government debt, despite
Washington's proposal to extend tax cuts.
 The benchmark Treasury yield has touched its highest in six
months, at 3.36 percent, but the dollar, while supported by the
more attractive returns, has not gained much ground against the
yen in the same period.
 Robert Ryan, an FX and interest rate strategist at BNP
Paribas in Singapore, said the two-year yield was probably a
better gauge of economic and dollar recovery prospects at this
stage as the 10-year yield response could be complicated by
longer term concerns about the U.S. budget deficit.
 The two-year yield climbed to 0.67 percent on Monday, its
highest since July.
 Dollar/yen has a mildly positive 90-day rolling correlation
with the two-year yield of just below 0.7 at the moment, less
pronounced than in July and September when both yields and the
dollar were falling.
 The dollar tested ground above 84.00 yen on Monday, up 0.2
percent on the day at 84.10. The 84 yen level is a barrier it has
struggled to hold above in the past few couple of weeks.
 Traders reported Japanese exporters selling dollars at 84.00
to 84.05 yen, and with more offers above 84.50. It has resistance
up at 84.41 yen, a two-month high set in late November.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, rose 0.2 percent to 80.225 but is still below a
two-month high of 81.44 set in late November.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar, which has export ties to
China, was steady at $0.9845.
 It showed little reaction to a jump in China's inflation rate
reported at the weekend after the Asian giant on Friday hiked its
reserve requirement ratio, the amount of money lenders must keep
in reserve, for the third time in a month.

(Updates prices throughout)	
 SYDNEY, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Asian stocks chalked up modest
gains on Monday, buoyed by upbeat U.S. data, while Chinese
shares rose nearly 3 percent as investors reacted with relief
that Beijing's policy moves to cool inflation did not include
an interest rate rise.	
 The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield hit a six-month high in
response to the best consumer sentiment read-out in six
months, helping shore up the dollar.	
 MSCI's index for Asia Pacific stocks was last up 0.28
percent, while the index excluding Japan put
on 0.11 percent, having earlier approached one-week highs.	
 Financial bookmakers expected similar modest gains in
Europe, calling Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX
and France's CAC-40 to rise 0.3-0.4 percent.
Eurostoxx 50 Futures  were up 0.4 percent.	
 
 Chinese leaders said on Sunday they would ratchet up
efforts to quell inflation in 2011 in response to data showing
the country's rate of inflation soared past forecasts to a
28-month high of 5.1 percent in November.	
 Ahead of the data, the Chinese central bank raised the
minimum amount of money lenders must keep in reserve for a
third time in a month. Beijing, however, held back from
lifting interest rates, a relief for some but a move many
still expect will happen at some stage.	
 ""I don't see a high chance of an interest rate rise by the
end of this year now,"" said Huaxi Securities analyst Cao
Xuefeng in Chengdu, adding this would probably help the
Chinese stocks regain ground in the short term. 
 Shanghai's benchmark share index closed up 2.9
percent, its biggest one-day percentage gain in two months. 
 
 CONSUMER SENTIMENT	
 The dollar edged up 0.24 percent versus a basket of major
currencies . Against the yen, it rose to 84.16 ,
not far from a two-month high around 84.40 set recently.	
 The greenback was underpinned by gains in U.S. Treasury
yields, which saw the 10-year reach highs of 3.391
percent last seen in June.	
 Markets were heartened by U.S. data on Friday which showed
consumer sentiment was its best six months, and a 3.2 percent
increase in exports, figures that pointed to a firmer economic
recovery, though trading was subdued as year-end holidays
approached. 
 ""On the whole, the market is winding down and people are
not inspired to put in large positions,"" said Carey Wong, an
investment analyst at OCBC Investment Research. 
 So far this year, Asia Pacific stocks are
up around 10 percent, outperforming an 8 percent rise in
global equities .	
 Among the best performing assets are commodities.
Industrial metal copper , which hit a record high of
$9,129.50 a tonne on Monday, has gained 23 percent this year,
and U.S. crude oil  at around $88 a barrel has risen 11
percent since the start of 2010.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index , Australia's S&P 200
index and Japan's Nikkei average were all up
between 0.2 and 0.6 percent.	
 In Australia, investors snapped up top bank shares,
relieved that reform measures to boost the banking sector,
unveiled on Sunday, were no harsher than feared.

posted gains of more than 1 percent. [ID:nL3E6ND00K]

 * Move latest pro-growth policy raising market doubts
 * Economists: fiscal plan depends on growth, reforms lacking
 
 By Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Hungarian lawmakers will roll
back a 1997 pension reform on Monday, allowing the government to
effectively seize up to $14 billion in private pension assets to
reduce the budget gap while avoiding painful austerity measures.
 With markets on edge across Europe over debt and deficits,
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has spurned international advice to
cut costs, like Ireland and Greece, in favour of unconventional
policies meant to revive Hungary's moribund economy.
 By plugging its budget shortfall with the pension funds and
new taxes on banks and mostly foreign-owned businesses, Orban
has promised to end years of austerity and bolstered the
popularity of his right-of-centre Fidesz party in opinion polls.
 But the strategy, which also includes ending a 20 billion
euro safety net deal with the European Union and International
Monetary Fund, has spooked investors, caused losses in Hungarian
assets, and prompted a downgrade by Moody's ratings agency.
 Economists say the pension law will almost certainly allow
the central European state of 10.5 million people to meet a
pledge to cut its budget deficit to below 3 percent of annual
output next year, as well as potentially lift growth.
 But they also say that by raiding private funds, Orban will
only delay reforms vital to tackling a debt pile equal to 80
percent of gross domestic product, just above the EU average but
higher than any of Budapest's peers in the bloc's emerging East.
 The plan depends heavily on growth, a problem if the
recovery in Europe slows next year as expected.
 ""A possible leap in growth should be factored in as an
upside risk when planning the budget, not serve as the baseline
assumption,"" said analyst Zsolt Kondrat at MKB Bank. 
 
 DOUBT ON REFORMS
 Budapest and eight other mostly new, ex-communist EU states
have complained their pension reforms have unfairly driven up
debt and deficits under EU accounting rules. They have asked for
exemptions from Brussels but have not yet come to a deal.
 ""This experiment, through which the Hungarian pension system
was transformed, resulted in the country sinking in debt up to
its ears,"" Orban said in a video on his Facebook page on Sunday.
 Despite a legal challenge by pension funds, the government's
two thirds majority is expected to pass the law, which will
impose stiff penalties on Hungarians who do not transfer their
pension assets back into the state system by January.
 The government will sell the assets and use the income to
cut debt, plug holes in the state pension fund, and create room
for tax cuts for households and small companies. 
 It hopes tax cuts, including a 10 percent corporate tax rate
for all companies from 2013, will slash a jobless rate of 10.9
percent and boost growth to 5.5 percent by 2015, a faster pace
than any achieved in the past 20 years.
 Markets expect economic growth to accelerate to 2.7 percent
next year, well above 1 percent projected for 2010, but below
the government's forecast for growth over 3 percent.
 Investors are sceptical. The forint has lost 5 percent
against the euro since Fidesz's April election victory, and 3-
and 5-year bond yields have jumped more than 2 percentage points
to almost 8 percent. 
 They worry Orban's pro-growth approach means he will eschew
painful reforms such as public sector job cuts, which would
complicate rising debt repayments from 2011. 
 The government has pledged to unveil a structural reform
plan worth 600 billion-800 billion forints ($2.9 billion-$3.8
billion) in February, but little is known about the details.
 ""The entire market is waiting for this reform package but
there are some doubts over it, which are based on the government
saying growth will help us reduce our fiscal deficit,"" said
analyst Zoltan Arokszallasi at Erste Bank.
 ""This would indicate the government wants to implement
reforms on a much smaller scale than necessary.""

 * Sees stronger political union in Europe in 10 years time
 
 BERLIN, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Germany is open to a discussion
over whether countries that share the euro currency should
harmonise their fiscal policy, German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said.
 In an interview published on Sunday in Bild am Sonntag
newspaper, Schaeuble said the decision made at the euro's
creation to not integrate state finances into a European
framework could be addressed anew.
 ""The basic decision was for fiscal and budgetary policy to
be decided on the national level. If that is to be changed, then
we can talk about it,"" he said.
 Berlin has opposed calls by Spain and other countries to
move towards a full-fledged ""fiscal union"" in the 16-nation bloc
but appeared last week to have agreed to a limited form of
policy coordination.
 Looking forward, Schaeuble predicted that member states of
the European Union would come ever closer politically.
 ""In ten years we will have a structure that corresponds much
stronger to what one describes as political union,"" he said.
 In an advance portion of the interview released on Saturday,
Schaeuble said the euro currency is here to stay, and warned
those betting against its survival that they are making a
mistake.
 European leaders meet next week to discuss ways to solve a
euro zone debt crisis which has triggered bailouts for Greece
and Ireland and which analysts say could engulf other countries.
They are expected to agree the terms of a permanent rescue
mechanism for the bloc.
 Germany and France have pledged to better align their tax
and labour policies to foster convergence in the euro zone, but
have rejected calls for an increase in the bloc's rescue fund
and joint sovereign bonds.
 Pressure on high-deficit euro members eased slightly over
the past week after the European Central Bank bought government
bonds in a thin end-of-year market, pushing down the borrowing
costs of countries on Europe's southern periphery.

 Asked whether there is a date for talks, a Hochtief
spokeswoman said, ""We are currently concentrating on our
statement to shareholders.""
 As part of German takeover rules, the management and
supervisory board must make a formal recommendation to
shareholders whether or not to accept a takeover offer. 
 The statement is expected to be published in the coming
week, in line with the deadline set by markets regulator BaFin.
 Hochtief told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel that it
does not regard the takeover bid by Spanish builder ACS as
hostile and will agree to talks with them ""as a shareholder"".
Hochtief management reacted to the ACS bid by seeking
authority from its board of directors to explore measures to
fend off ACS, and by selling a 9.1 percent stake to the emirate
of Qatar. 
 ACS saw its 29.9 percent Hochtief stake diluted to around 27
percent after the move.
 Hochtief Chief Executive Herbert Luetkestratkoetter said he
is sceptical about a strategy which relies on merely combining
the portfolios of ACS and Hochtief to achieve economies of scale
and better regional diversification.
 ""Size alone is not an advantage. It's about know-how. It's
about having a presence in economically attractive parts of the
world. Hochtief is in a good position. I cannot see where ACS
can help us,"" he told Der Spiegel.

* ESM to replace existing EFSF, EFSM in June 2013
* Non-euro EU states to take part in ESM actions if they want

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
agree next week to insert two sentences into the EU treaty to
pave the way for the creation of the European Stability
Mechanism from 2013, draft conclusions of the summit showed.
 The ESM is to open the way for private sector investors to
take a loss in case of a sovereign debt restructuring, which
will put market pressure on governments to conduct sound fiscal
policies and prevent another sovereign debt crisis.
 The ESM would also provide financial support to euro zone
countries which suffer liquidity, but not solvency problems,
through a fund that is likely to be bigger than the current 750
billion euros bailout fund the euro zone has at its disposal.
 But to create the ESM, Germany and France insisted that the
EU's highest law, the EU treaty, has to be amended so that its
operations are not deemed unconstitutional by German courts.
 The conclusions, obtained by Reuters, said leaders of the
27-nation bloc would agree to amend the treaty by adding the
following sentences to the existing article 136:
 ""The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish
a stability mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro
area as a whole. The granting of financial assistance under the
mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality.""
 The ESM will be based on the agreement reached by euro zone
finance ministers on November 28. For a full text of the
agreement see:
http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/118050.pdf
 
 MEMBERS' POWERS
 The leaders' conclusions, which are always prepared in
advance of a summit and almost never changed, said the amendment
did not increase the powers conferred on the European Union by
member states.
 This means that the change would not have to be subject to a
referendum in Ireland and also satisfies Britain which insisted
the change should not entail any transfer of power to Brussels.
 The leaders, who meet on Thursday and Friday in Brussels,
will also agree that the ESM would replace the European
Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial
Stability Mechanism, which will be operational until June 2013.
 The leaders would like consultations with the European
Parliament, the European Commission and the European Central
Bank on the change to the treaty to end in March 2011 and for
approvals in individual countries to finish by end 2012, so that
the new law would be in place from the start of 2013.
 Euro zone finance ministers are also to finish work on
setting up the ESM through an intergovernmental arrangement by
March 2011.
 ""The mechanism will be activated by mutual agreement of the
euro area Member States in case of risk to the stability of the
euro area as a whole,"" the draft leaders' conclusions said.
 The EU summit will also decide that while the mechanism will
be for euro zone members, other EU countries can be involved in
the work setting it up if they want to and can take part in ESM
operations on an ad hoc basis.
This is similar to the case of Ireland, where the euro zone
countries, acting through the EFSF, lent to Dublin, but Britain,
Sweden and Denmark, all non-euro zone members of the EU, also
provided bilateral loans.

 * France has no ready-made solutions to flaws in system
 
 By Catherine Bremer
 PARIS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - France wants a wide international
debate as it takes over the G20 presidency to drive its plans
for an overhaul of the global monetary system and economic
governance, Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Saturday.
 Lagarde told a meeting of some of France's top economic
policymakers and thinkers that the 2008-09 crisis had shown the
need to rethink a monetary framework based on 40-year-old ideas
that are increasingly outdated.
 France wants to focus on ways to control the huge and
erratic shifts in capital that buffet emerging economies and on
moving away from the dollar as a reserve currency to a
diversified system that would reduce imbalances.
 Lagarde suggested the International Monetary Fund could act
as a referee to control capital flows, rather than having
countries unilaterally impose restrictions. She also said France
would push the idea of the IMF's Special Drawing Right
accounting tool playing a bigger role as a reserve unit.
 ""I'm convinced at this point in time, now that the height of
the crisis is behind us, that we need to step back, we need to
take stock and we need to work now towards more substantial,
more structural changes that are needed,"" Lagarde told a forum
hosted by the Paris-based Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee.
 ""France does not have the ambition to propose ready-made
solutions ... We don't have a magic stick,"" she added.
 ""Everybody will have a bias because you look at the world
from your own angle and we need to take all angles into
perspective ... So it will be an interactive, inclusive process
that will take us to other places around the world to get
views.""
 
 G20 A PERMANENT FORUM
 Since taking the reins of the Group of 20 last month
President Nicolas Sarkozy has met the leaders of China and India
to discuss his plans, and China has agreed to host a seminar of
experts early next year on redrawing the monetary framework.
 Some critics are sceptical about how much headway Sarkozy
can make in a year -- particularly with a debt crisis wreaking
havoc in the euro zone -- but Lagarde said some 42 crises of
""sudden stops in international capital flows"" in the last 20
years showed the need to address flaws in the system.
 ""The year 2010 was a transition year probably to a more
permanent forum for enhanced economic cooperation,"" she said of
the role of the G20, which has eclipsed the G7 in economic
matters due to its incorporation of developing-world countries.
 The French government is expected to lay out its G20 plans
in more detail toward the end of January.
One element Paris wants to push is weaning the world off its
reliance on the dollar, something it has support on from
emerging powers such as China and Brazil.
 Regarding controls on capital flows in and out of emerging
economies, Lagarde said they should be used in exceptional
circumstances and in a coordinated way to stem damaging swings.
 ""Who will have the ability and the authority to say (that a
particular) capital control is appropriate, adequate and is the
right response to a capital surge?"" she said.
 ""This very fine balancing point has to be decided by someone
who acts as a referee. Who can that referee be? I don't know.
One of the options is clearly the IMF which has the technical
expertise to do so.""

(Updates with U.S. markets' close)
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A rise in U.S. consumer
sentiment in December prompted investors to sell off benchmark
U.S. debt on Friday on expectations the economy will continue
to grow, but U.S. stocks rose modestly on the news.
 U.S. data showed consumer sentiment rose more than
expected in early December to the highest level in six months,
according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
survey, while the government said the country's trade deficit
shrank much more than expected in October.
 Early strength in the U.S. dollar, which put downward
pressure on commodity prices, eroded after comments from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet supported
the euro.
 The dumping of U.S. Treasury debt caps off a week of
relatively aggressive selling that drove the benchmark 10-year
note's yield to a six-month high, and marked its biggest
weekly rise since August 2009.
 ""Yields are going to remain biased higher, but not in a
straight line,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global
fixed-income analysis at Action Economics in San Francisco.
 Rupert also cited the rising U.S. deficit and inflation
fears as well as a more robust outlook for economic growth as
the reasons for the Treasury bond market's losses.
 The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell 31/32 of a
point in price, driving the yield up to 3.327 percent. The
yield is up 31.5 basis points for the week.
 Equity markets scraped their way higher, pushing the S&P
500 to its highest level since the week that Lehman Brothers
collapsed in September 2008. The Nasdaq Composite closed at
nearly a three-year high.
 While significant levels were reached, the moves on the
day were muted by a stronger greenback squeezing the operating
margins for U.S. exporters. That fed into the recent inverse
correlation between the currency and U.S. stocks.
 Another factor was a decision by China's central bank to
raise lenders' required reserves by 50 basis points while
leaving interest rates on hold. This eased concerns that
aggressive policy tightening could slow China's growth down
too much, but at the same time it did keep investors in
check.
 European shares edged up to a fresh 26-month closing
high.
 Peripheral European sovereign credit deteriorated on
Friday as prices wax and wane while uncertainty remains over
whether policymakers can put to rest the concerns the debt
crisis is under control.
 In the credit markets, the premium that investors demand
to hold peripheral government bonds rather than benchmark
German debt rose on Friday with investors keeping to the
sidelines as the European Central Bank's bond buying slowed
down to a trickle.
 The difference between Portuguese and German 10-year
yields widened 18 basis points on the day to 346 basis points
with traders pointing to little buying interest from the ECB.
 The equivalent yield spread for Irish debt widened to 540
basis points, out 9 basis points on the day.
 The euro  fell 0.12 percent to $1.3226. The U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar against a
basket of major trading partner currencies, gave up early
gains to trade flat, up just 0.04 percent at 80.104. Against
the yen, the greenback rose 0.29 percent to 83.92 yen.
 Commodities priced in U.S. dollars weakened on the
currency's gains. Spot gold  fell $1.06 to $1,386.20 an
ounce, while January U.S. crude oil futures  fell 58
cents to settle at $87.79 a barrel.
 S&P 500 STAYS ABOVE 1,228
 On Wall Street, the bulls took heart when the S&P 500
managed to hold above 1,228, a closely watched technical
resistance, for the second straight day.
 In April and again in early November, the S&P 500 had ""met
some significant resistance"" when it tried to rise above 1,228
and failed, according to Art Hogan, chief market analyst at
Jefferies & Co in Boston. Both of those failed runs by the S&P
500 to top 1,228 were followed by steep declines.
 ""So closing above there and staying above there is a
pretty good sign,"" Hogan said.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 7.40 points,
or 0.60 percent, to end at 1,240.40 -- its highest close since
mid-September 2008.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 40.26
points, or 0.35 percent, to finish at 11,410.32. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 20.87 points, or 0.80 percent,
to close at 2,637.54, its best finish since Dec. 31, 2007.
 Industrial shares led the pack, with General Electric
 up 3.4 percent at $17.72 after it raised its dividend
for a second time this year.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
shares rose 0.16 percent to 1,125.59, its best close since
September 2008, aided by the U.S. data and led by automakers.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index fell 0.7 percent to
close on Friday at 10,211.95 due to profit-taking. But the
Nikkei was up 0.3 percent for the week.
 The MSCI All-Country World stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
gained just 0.34 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The euro should extend losses
against the dollar next week as a meeting of European Union
leaders will likely heighten concerns about deepening divisions
within the bloc over how to solve its debt crisis.
 The euro slipped toward $1.3150 on Friday and ended the
week down 1.2 percent versus the dollar. Charts suggest the
euro could fall back to its December low of $1.2970, while
positioning data showed more bearishness as speculators more
than doubled bets against the currency in the latest week.
 EU heads of state and government meet on Dec. 16-17 to
discuss the region's spreading debt crisis. Expectations of
meaningful progress are low after Germany and France on Friday
rejected calls for an increase in the bloc's rescue fund and
joint sovereign bonds. For details, see [ID:nLDE6B90K3]
 ""Clearly, there's been much less consensus on the long term
stability mechanism such as the euro bond proposal,"" said Aroop
Chatterjee, currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New
York. ""We expect the euro/dollar to continue to be pressured
lower until some solutions are put in place.
 ""Our view is that the euro will make it out of this
sovereign debt issue, but it's going to obviously require
political will,"" he said.
 The euro last traded 0.1 percent lower at $1.3227
, after hitting a session low of $1.3178 on trading
platform EBS. Support is at $1.3150, followed by its 200-day
moving average around $1.3115, traders said.
 Short positions on the euro jumped to 15,290 contracts from
7,248 contracts in the week ended Dec. 7, data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday. Currency
speculators trimmed bets against the dollar for a fifth
straight week. For details, see [ID:nN10113473]
 Ireland's government will seek parliamentary approval for
an 85-billion-euro IMF/EU rescue package next week, though
there were concerns as the opposition Labour Party pledged to
vote against it. [ID:nLDE6B81XS]
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 83.94
 and was up 1.6 percent this week.
 The sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the past week
has boosted the dollar versus the yen on the view that the
Obama administration's proposed tax cut extension would spur
economic growth. Higher bond yields tend to boost the greenback
as they increase the return on dollar-denominated assets.
 ""We suspect the path of U.S. yields will remain the key
driver of the U.S. currency's path in the near-term,"" said Nick
Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in New
York.
 FOMC, U.S. DATA
 In the United States, focus will be on the Federal
Reserve's monetary policy meeting on Tuesday and investors
expect no change to the central bank's $600 billion bond
purchase program.
 The Fed will likely continue highlighting risks to the
labor market in its post-meeting statement after data earlier
this month showed employment barely grew in November. However,
analysts don't expect a very downbeat Fed as other data such as
consumer sentiment and jobless claims have been more positive.
 A wide range of data next week could shed more light on the
U.S. economy, with highlights including retail sales, consumer
and producer prices, and housing starts.
 ""We expect U.S. data to continue to remain firm,"" said
Barclays' Chatterjee. ""U.S. yields will likely go higher and
risky assets will likely remain firm, so you probably would
expect the dollar to do better against the lower yielding
currencies such as the yen and euro.""
 Some analysts say dollar/yen could play catch up as U.S.
yields rise further. Given current rate spreads at the 10-year
sector of the curve, there is a growing consensus that
dollar/yen spot should perhaps be trading closer to the 87-88
range.
 Dollar/yen is also the standout performer in the options
market with apparently high demand for bullish structures.
""The yen is simply overvalued,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis,
macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset Management LLP in London.
Fulcrum oversees about $900 million in assets. Gkionakis
expects the dollar/yen to trade around 85 in the short term and
said the fair value for dollar/yen is probably around 100-104.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Canadian currency eked out
a small gain against the U.S. dollar on Friday, trapped in the
tightest trading range in several weeks and uninspired by
firmer equity markets and data that showed the country's trade
deficit shrank in October.
 The currency remained stuck in its recent narrow band,
moving in just a 21-point range during the North American
session. The range has compressed in each of the last three
sessions and it was the most compact span since Nov. 29 when
the currency traded in a 48-point range.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0094 to the
greenback, or 99.07 U.S. cents, up from Thursday's close at
C$1.0105 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.96 U.S. cents. For the week,
the Canadian dollar fell 0.6 percent.
 ""The data this morning was fairly positive for Canada in
the sense that exports are looking relatively strong. We have
commodities very close to where they closed the day before and
equities slightly stronger,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 ""So not a lot of real movement out of Canada. We're just
sticking around parity but unable to really break through. We
need a material catalyst to push us through the C$0.9980 level
on a sustainable basis.""
 That level above parity was reached on Oct. 14, one of a
handful of times that the Canadian dollar has returned to a
one-for-one level with the U.S. dollar since April. There was
also a brief run in November where the currency struggled to
hold above par.
 With no top tier domestic data expected next week,
attention will look to the United States for a possible
catalyst, notably the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision
and November reads on retail sales and the consumer price
index. 
 In economic news on Friday, higher exports helped cut
Canada's October trade deficit to a smaller than expected
C$1.71 billion from a revised C$2.31 billion in September,
Statistics Canada reported.
 Market analysts had predicted a deficit of C$2.1 billion in
October. In recent months the high Canadian dollar and weak
U.S. economy have cut demand in the United States, Canada's
biggest export market by far. [ID:nN10267094]
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told Reuters
Insider on Friday that Canada needs to get used to upward
pressure on its dollar. [ID:nN10294555]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reuters Insider show on: http://link.reuters.com/vet59q
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The currency's muted reaction to Friday's data was probably
offset by the unexpectedly large contraction in the U.S. trade
deficit, analysts said. Toronto's main stock index advanced
0.55 percent in a broad-based rally.
 Separately, data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators added to bets in favor of the
Australian and Canadian dollars. [ID:nN10116786]
 BONDS HOLD LOWER
 Long-dated government bond prices mirrored the drop in
comparable U.S. Treasuries after data showed the U.S. trade
deficit narrowed much more than expected in October.
 The 10-year bond  fell sharply, down 61 Canadian
cents to yield 3.320 percent, as the smaller than expected
trade deficit could boost estimates of U.S. fourth-quarter
economic growth.
 ""(Yields) quite quickly jumped on the story of stronger
U.S. growth. To be honest, it's probably not worth that much
more in terms of additional growth in U.S. numbers, but there
just seems to be a bias in the market of that,"" said Mark
Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy
at RBC Capital Markets.
 The U.S. trade gap totaled $38.7 billion, compared with a
forecast of about $43.6 billion, and down from a revised
estimate of $44.6 billion for September. [ID:nN09288102]
 The two-year bond  was down 6 Canadian cents to
yield 1.724 percent. Canadian government bonds put in mixed
performance against their U.S. counterparts with the front- and
back-end of the curve underperforming. The belly of the curve
outperformed.

 * Consumer sentiment improves in December
 * Trade gap shrinks as exports rise 3.2 percent in October
 * Smaller deficit could boost 4th-quarter growth estimates
 By Edward Krudy and Doug Palmer
 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A rise in U.S.
consumer confidence to its highest in six months and a much
bigger-than-expected contraction in the country's trade deficit
pointed to a firmer economic recovery on Friday.
 The boost in consumer confidence on the back of an
improving jobs outlook was another indication consumers are
willing to spend over the holidays while a rise in exports
looks set to lift economic growth this quarter.
 The data fits into a pattern of an economy that is gaining
traction after a slowdown in the summer and is likely to
intensify the debate over whether the Federal Reserve needs to
keep stimulating the economy through asset purchases.
 ""We are in the gradual recovery camp and are definitely on
the upper side of that now,"" said Pierre Ellis, senior global
economist at Decision Economics in New York. ""It adds to a
growing number of economic indicators that are looking better
than expected.""
 Consumer sentiment in December rose to its highest level
since June and was at its third-highest since the start of
2008, according to a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
survey. Government data showed U.S. exports in October rose a
robust 3.2 percent while imports declined slightly.
 U.S. stock indexes closed higher, with the S&P 500 at its
highest level since the week Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.
U.S. Treasury bond prices lost ground while the dollar gained.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The survey's preliminary December reading for consumer
sentiment came in at 74.2, up from 71.6 in November. That was
above the median forecast of 72.5 among economists polled by
Reuters.
 Consumers cited a more favorable jobs outlook, chiming with
recent data pointing to some improvement in the labor market.
But slow jobs growth and high unemployment is still one of the
biggest impediments to the recovery.
 Although the unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent in
November, new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than
expected last week and the four-week moving average slipped to
a fresh two-year low.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has hinted that the
U.S. central bank may increase its current $600 billion bond
purchasing program if unemployment continues to stay high.
 The sentiment survey's barometer of current economic
conditions rose to its highest since January 2008, just after
the economic downturn began. The index for December came in at
85.7, up from 82.1 in November and above a forecast of 83.1.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit for October totaled $38.7
billion, down from a revised estimate of $44.6 billion for
September. Analysts surveyed before the report had expected the
deficit to narrow just slightly to about $43.60 billion.
 Record exports to China and Mexico helped push the overall
export tally to $158.7 billion, the highest since August 2008.
Exports to the European Union and Japan also grew.
 Despite record exports to China in October, the U.S. trade
deficit with that country in the first 10 months of 2010 was
$226.8 billion, up 20.3 percent from the year-earlier period.
 The sharp rise is likely to keep China's trade and currency
policies on the minds of U.S. lawmakers in 2011.
 The smaller-than-expected trade deficit could boost
estimates for U.S. fourth-quarter economic growth because it
implies a larger share of U.S. demand is being met by domestic
production.
 ""This suggests that the economy is accelerating,"" said Neil
Dutta, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New
York, raising his forecast for fourth-quarter economic growth
to about 3.0 percent.
 On an annual basis, the trade deficit has widened sharply
this year and could surpass $500 billion when final figures for
2010 are available. Last year, in the midst of the global
financial crisis which put a squeeze on world trade, the U.S.
trade gap narrowed about 46 percent to $374.9 billion.
 The United States posted a larger-than-expected budget
deficit in November, the Treasury Department said, as President
Barack Obama tries to sell a compromise made earlier in the
week with Republicans on Capitol Hill over a two-year extension
of tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush.
 The $150 billion shortfall in November was the 26th
straight monthly deficit, the longest streak on record and the
largest budget gap for any November.
 Last week, a bold plan to slash the U.S. budget deficit
fell short of winning the support needed to trigger legislative
action in Congress, shifting the fiscal responsibility issue to
the White House and lawmakers.
 The grim budget outlook will be a major challenge for House
Republicans, who have promised budget cuts when they officially
take control of the lower House next month.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The euro should extend losses
against the dollar next week as a meeting of European Union
leaders will likely heighten concerns about deepening divisions
within the bloc over how to solve its debt crisis.
 The euro slipped toward $1.3150 on Friday and was on track
to post a decline of 1.2 percent versus the dollar this week.
Technical charts point to more downside, suggesting the euro
could fall back toward its December low of $1.2970 in the
coming weeks.
 EU heads of state and government meet on Dec. 16-17 to
discuss the region's spreading debt crisis. Expectations of
meaningful progress are low after Germany and France on Friday
rejected calls for an increase in the bloc's rescue fund and
joint sovereign bonds. For details, see [ID:nLDE6B90K3]
 ""Clearly, there's been much less consensus on the long term
stability mechanism such as the euro bond proposal,"" said Aroop
Chatterjee, currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New
York. ""We expect the euro/dollar to continue to be pressured
lower until some solutions are put in place.
 ""Our view is that the euro will make it out of this
sovereign debt issue, but it's going to obviously require
political will,"" he said.
 The euro last traded 0.1 percent lower at $1.3227
, after hitting a session low of $1.3178 on trading
platform EBS. The next key target is $1.3150, followed by its
200-day moving average around $1.3115, traders said.
 Ireland's government will seek parliamentary approval for
an 85-billion-euro IMF/EU rescue package next week, though
there were concerns about political infighting as the

[ID:nLDE6B81XS]
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 83.86
 and was up 1.5 percent this week.
 The sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the past week
has boosted the dollar especially versus the yen on the view
that the Obama administration's proposed tax cut extension
would spur economic growth.
 Higher bond yields tend to boost the greenback as they
increase the return on dollar-denominated assets.
 ""We suspect the path of U.S. yields will remain the key
driver of the U.S. currency's path in the near-term,"" said Nick
Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in New
York.
 The U.S. dollar <.DXY> index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was flat at
80.043, struggling to break through the 80.00-81.50 barrier
that capped its November rally.
 FOMC, US DATA
 In the United States, focus will be on the Federal
Reserve's December monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, though
investors expect few surprises from the post-meeting
statement.
 The Fed committed to buy $600 billion in government bonds
at its November meeting in an effort to support a struggling
economy.
 A wide range of economic data will also be released next
week, including retail sales, consumer and producer prices, and
housing starts.
 ""We expect U.S. data to continue to remain firm,"" said
Barclays' Chatterjee. ""U.S. yields will likely go higher and
risky assets will likely remain firm, so you probably would
expect the dollar to do better against the lower yielding
currencies such as the yen and euro.""
 Some analysts say dollar/yen could play catch up as yield
increases further. Given current rate spreads at the 10-year
sector of the curve, there is a growing consensus that
dollar/yen spot should perhaps be trading closer to the 87-88
range, they said.
 Dollar/yen is also the standout performer in the options
market with apparently high demand for bullish structures.
 ""From a valuation perspective, the yen is simply
overvalued,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at
Fulcrum Asset Management LLP in London. Fulcrum oversees about
$900 million in assets.
 Gkionakis expects the dollar/yen to trade around 85 in the
short term and said the fair value for dollar/yen is probably
around 100-104.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar pared gains
against the euro on Friday after the head of the European
Central Bank said euro zone recovery was on track, but an
improving economic outlook should keep the greenback firm.
 The euro came back after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
said that since the start of the recovery in the third quarter
of 2009 the bank has revised upward every growth projection for
the euro zone.
 In early afternoon New York trade, the euro was 0.12
percent lower at $1.3226, but above the session's low of
$1.3179.
 U.S. Treasuries fell in price, capping off a week of
relatively aggressive selling spurred by rising growth outlooks
and deficit worries which may have bonds on track for even
higher yields.
 The sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the past week
has boosted the dollar on the view that the Obama
administration's proposed tax cut extension would spur economic
growth. Lower Treasury prices bode well for the dollar as it
increases demand for higher yielding assets.
 Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo
in New York, said U.S. developments are supportive for the
greenback, with the October trade deficit narrowing more than
expected, while U.S. bond yields are higher.
 ""While the week appears to be ending on a better note for
the greenback we continue to watch U.S. yields very closely,""
he wrote. ""We suspect the path of U.S. yields will remain the
key driver of the U.S. currency's path in the near-term.""
 The U.S. trade deficit narrowed much more than expected in
October, a Commerce Department report showed. 
 A Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers' preliminary December consumer sentiment index rose
to 74.2 from 71.6 in the final November reading, according to a
report. Economists in a Reuters survey expected a preliminary
December reading of 72.5.
 ""The strength of the U.S. dollar could be viewed as waning
if it can be demonstrated credibly that U.S. deficits will rise
and conversely the euro could rise comparatively,"" said Tim
Speiss, chairman, Personal Wealth Advisors at EisnerAmper LLP
in New York.
 ""However, the EU has it's hands full with financing costs
related Ireland and Greece, and potentially Spain and Portugal,
so we see no dramatic negative dollar impact tied to this
legislation at this juncture,"" he said.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.03
percent to 80.097, struggling to break through the 80.00-81.50
barrier that capped its November rally.
 Against the Japanese currency, the greenback was up 0.29
percent at 83.92 yen. but below the session's high of 84.01.
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR VULNERABLE
 The Aussie -- which is most sensitive to monetary
tightening in China given Australia's close trading links with
the country -- dipped briefly after Beijing increased the
reserve requirement by 50 basis points.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.05 percent to $0.9848, but
below the session's high of $0.9896. Analysts warned, however,
that a China rate rise was still possible as the country
battles to stem inflationary pressures.
 Meanwhile, Germany and France pledged on Friday to better
align their tax and labour policies to foster convergence in
the euro zone. They rejected calls for an increase in the
bloc's rescue fund and joint sovereign bonds.
 Earlier on Friday, European central bankers told euro zone
governments they could not count on the ECB alone to solve a
debt crisis which has forced bailouts of Greece and Ireland,
and heaped pressure on countries like Portugal and Spain.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy presented a united front ahead of a crucial summit next
week where EU leaders are expected to agree the terms of a
permanent rescue mechanism for the bloc.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Upbeat U.S. consumer
sentiment data on Friday pushed investors to sell off
benchmark U.S. debt on expectations the economy will continue
to grow, but U.S. stocks found little traction in the data.
 Early strength in the U.S. dollar, which put downward
pressure on commodity prices, eroded after comments from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet supported
the euro.[ID:nLDE6B91G8]
 The sell-off in U.S. Treasury debt caps off a week of
relatively aggressive selling that has the benchmark 10-year
note's yield on track for its biggest rise in this year.
 ""Yields are going to remain biased higher, but not in a
straight line,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global
fixed-income analysis at Action Economics in San Francisco.
 Rupert also cited the rising U.S. deficit and inflation
fears as well as a more robust outlook for economic growth as
the reasons for the Treasury bond market's losses.
 The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell
21/32 of a point in price, driving the yield up to 3.288
percent.
 Equity markets made gains globally but their upward move
was mild. Contributing to the muted performance was a stronger
greenback squeezing the operating margins for U.S. exporters,
feeding into the recent inverse correlation between the
currency and U.S. stocks.
 In addition, China's central bank raised lenders' required
reserves by 50 basis points, but left interest rates on hold.
While this eased concerns that aggressive policy tightening
could slow China's growth down too much, it did keep investors
in check. [ID:nTOE6B907U]
 European shares edged up to a fresh 26-month closing
high.
 ""People are keeping an eye on economic numbers, but until
they all start moving in the same direction across the board,
traders are still going to be a bit jittery,"" said Manoj
Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital.
 The MSCI All-Country World stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
gained just 0.24 percent.
 Peripheral European sovereign credit deteriorated on
Friday as prices wax and wane while uncertainty remains over
whether policymakers can put to rest the concerns the debt
crisis is under control.
 The euro fell 0.10 percent to $1.3229 . The U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY> , which measures the dollar against a
basket of major trading partner currencies, gave up early
gains to trade flat, up just 0.01 percent at 80.079. Against
the yen, the greenback was up 0.29 percent at 83.92 yen
.
 Commodities priced in U.S. dollars weakened on the
currency's gains. Spot gold prices  fell $4.89 to
$1,382.50 an ounce, while U.S. crude oil futures  lost
86 cents, or 0.97 percent, to $87.51 a barrel.
 STOCKS SCORE MODEST GAINS
 U.S. data showed consumer sentiment rose more than
expected in early December, according to the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan survey, while import prices in
November rose at their fastest pace in a year. In another

the government said the U.S. trade deficit narrowed much more

 By Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A top Russian government
economist said on Friday he hoped negotiations will be done by
mid-2011 for Russia to join the World Trade Organization, a
move the Obama administration has said it would welcome.
 Arkady Dvorkovich, chief economic adviser to Russian
President Dmitri Medvedev, also said the 2007-2009 financial
crisis had pushed Russian authorities to speed reforms to make
their economy more competitive and open to innovation.
 ""We are hopeful that by the middle of next year we can
actually announce that all negotiations are completed"" for
entry to the WTO,"" Dvorkovich said.
 He was speaking by satellite from Moscow to a meeting of
the European Institute in Washington.
 On Thursday, President Barack Obama voiced strong support
for Russian membership in the global trade body and said the
United States would make every effort see it happen.
 ""Welcoming Russia to the WTO would be good for them, but it
would also be good for us and good for the global economy,""
Obama said at a meeting of his Export Council advisers.
 BIGGEST ECONOMY OUTSIDE WTO
 Russia has a $1.2 trillion economy, compared with the
United States' $13 trillion one, and is the largest outside the
WTO. Moscow wants to join by the end of next year and has
largely resolved bilateral issues with the United States and
the European Union.
 Dvorkovich described negotiations as ""on track.""
 Answering questions later, Dvorkovich played down concerns
that large-scale capital flight was a continuing problem for
Russia. He said that U.S. firms that had invested in industries
as diverse as pharmaceuticals, energy and high technology were
in fact planning to expand in Russia.
 ""We are expecting a major inflow of foreign direct
investment over the next two to three years,"" he said.
 He said plans were proceeding for privatizing some
businesses in Russia, including some airports, and said that
Russia sees privatization as a way to introduce more
competition and transparency into its economy.
 He said modernizing its financial system was a priority.
 ""We are working on the development of a financial center in
Moscow to improve financial markets and financial services to
our companies and our people and to provide better conditions
to attract capital to Russia,"" Dvorkovich said.
 He told another questioner the country was making major
investments in ""human resources,"" aiming to bolster education
and the health-care system as part of a broader effort to
increase productivity and said measurable progress was being
made.

 By Erik Kirschbaum and Emannuel Jarry
 FREIBURG, Germany, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Germany and France
pledged on Friday to better align their tax and labour policies
to foster convergence in the euro zone, but rejected calls for
an increase in the bloc's rescue fund and joint sovereign bonds.
 Earlier on Friday, European central bankers had told euro
zone governments they could not count on the ECB alone to solve
a debt crisis which has forced bailouts of Greece and Ireland,
and heaped pressure on countries like Portugal and Spain.
 At a news conference in the southwestern city of Freiburg,
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
presented a united front ahead of a crucial summit next week
where EU leaders are expected to agree the terms of a permanent
rescue mechanism for the bloc.
 Berlin has opposed calls by Spain and other countries to
move towards a full-fledged ""fiscal union"" in the 16-nation bloc
but appeared on Friday to have agreed to a limited form of
policy coordination, although little detail was offered.
 ""We have agreed to the convergence of German and French tax
policies and I thank the German chancellor for this opening,""
said Sarkozy.
 Merkel said it was up to Germany and France to set an
example on questions of competitiveness, showing partners how
far the bloc's biggest economies could cooperate in areas
""beyond pure budget policy"".
 ""We are talking about labour law, about tax law and if we
are to improve the coherence of the economic aspects of the euro
zone, then we should target these issues step by step and
propose solutions,"" Merkel said.
 The two leaders said they would present ""structural""
proposals next year in the area of economic coordination, but
declined to elaborate.
 ""We will defend the euro, because the euro is Europe,""
Sarkozy said. ""Our determination, both German and French, is
total.""
 
 ECB WARNINGS
 Pressure on high-deficit euro members eased slightly over
the past week after the ECB bought government bonds in a thin
end-of-year market, pushing down the borrowing costs of
countries on Europe's southern periphery.
 But the ECB said its responsibility was to ensure price
stability, while dealing with the crisis was ultimately up to
the euro zone governments.
 ""We expect all other authorities to be up to their
responsibilities,"" ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told a news
conference in Madrid.
 Bank of Italy Governor and ECB Governing Council member
Mario Draghi told the Financial Times the ECB could go only so
far in helping weaker members by buying their bonds.
 ""I'm only too aware that we could easily cross the line and
lose everything we have, lose independence, and basically
violate the (EU) treaty,"" said Draghi, a leading candidate to
replace Trichet.
 The euro, which fell to a 10-week low under $1.30 late last
month as the euro crisis deepened, edged higher in the wake of
Trichet's comments to trade at $1.3232.
 The risk premiums investors demand to hold Portuguese and
Spanish debt instead of German benchmarks edged higher on the
day.
 The EU summit is expected to finalise plans to introduce a
permanent rescue mechanism for the euro zone to replace the 750
billion euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) that
it set up in May after bailing out Greece.
 German demands that the new mechanism include the
possibility of so-called ""haircuts"" for holders of euro zone
sovereign debt have been blamed for exacerbating the crisis by
scaring bond investors with the prospect of not getting all
their money back.
 European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch
said expanding Europe's financial stability fund would be
preferable to issuing euro area bonds in the short term to
tackle any debt problems.
 But Merkel rejected calls to increase the EFSF.
 ""I'd say for us in Germany that the question of expanding
the rescue mechanism is not now on the table,"" Merkel said.
""Less than 10 percent of the rescue mechanism has been used for
Ireland. It is not on the agenda,"" she said.
 Sarkozy also supported Merkel by coming out against a
proposal pushed by Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker and
Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti for so-called E-bonds,
or joint euro zone sovereign debt issues.
 ""I don't think we were consulted before this idea was
proposed, so it shouldn't insult anyone if we say we are not in
agreement with it,"" Sarkozy said, saying neither German nor
French citizens could accept ""mutualising"" euro zone debt.
 Trichet asked that proposals on the bonds ""be floated when
we have a decision to communicate"", which was not yet the case.

 * U.S. trade officials tight-lipped on what to expect
(Adds data, U.S. trade officials comments)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers urged top
Obama administration officials to press for commitments from
China next week that would set targets for imports of U.S.
software and other goods.
 The pressure came as new trade data showed the U.S. trade
deficit with China could surpass the record of $268 billion set
in 2008, and as top Chinese officials were due in Washington on
Tuesday and Wednesday for the annual U.S.-China Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade.
 The bipartisan group of 33 members of the House of
Representatives, in a letter released on Friday, complained
that Beijing's past promises at the JCCT ""have failed to lead
to commercially meaningful market access for U.S. companies.""
 ""We write to urge you to press China for meaningful
objective commitments and metrics to increase U.S. market
access in China and protect intellectual property rights,"" the
lawmakers said.
 It was written to U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and
U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, who will co-chair the
high-level talks next week with the Chinese.
 Commerce Department figures released on Friday showed the
U.S. trade deficit with China for the first 10 months of 2010
totaled $226.8 billion, a 20 percent increase from the same
period last year. At that pace, the bilateral trade gap would
total about $272 billion for the entire year.
 The lawmakers were led by Representatives Dave Camp and
Sander Levin, the incoming Republican and outgoing Democratic
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
 To achieve better results in the talks next week in
Washington, ""we urge the administration to measure progress on
greater U.S. market access into China and protection of U.S.
intellectual property rights by objective criteria,"" the
lawmakers said.
 'INFRINGING PRODUCTS'
 ""These criteria should include commercially meaningful
metrics, such as increased U.S. exports to and sales in China
that increase U.S. jobs, a significant decrease in the theft of
intellectual property rights caused by infringing products sold
in and exported from China, and an objective means to verify
such results,"" they said.
 They called for ""robust commitments"" for U.S. industries
such as software, entertainment and technology, which they said
have been ""harmed by the continued massive theft of their
intellectual property and onerous and discriminatory market
access restrictions in China.""
 The lawmakers took aim at other Chinese trade practices,
including its restraints on exports of rare earth minerals,
which they said ""frustrate the operations of many U.S.
companies.""
 U.S. trade officials, at a background briefing for
reporters, offered few details of what new commitments to
expect from next week's talks.
 They said they have been working with China to encourage
greater use of legal software, but declined to say whether they
were pressing for specific sales targets as advocated by the
Business Software Alliance.
 BSA, which represents Microsoft and other U.S. software
manufacturers, wants China to commit to increasing purchases of
licensed U.S. software by at least 50 percent over two years.
It also wants a system in place to verify that China's
commitments have been met.
 The U.S. trade officials said a big focus of next week's
meeting would be China's ""indigenous innovation"" policies which
threaten to force foreign companies to transfer intellectual
property to China to participate in the country's vast
government procurement sector.
 China's barriers to U.S. beef and other agriculture exports
will also be on the agenda, the U.S. officials said.
 China's export restrictions on rare earth minerals is ""a
very important issue,"" one of the trade officials said. ""It's
something we need to look very carefully at.""
 A second U.S. official noted the United States has
challenged other Chinese export restraints as a violation of
commitments Beijing made to the World Trade Organization.

 * Skill shortage, currency rise boosting pay levels
 * Results defied executives' own expectations
 By Stuart Grudgings
 RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Top company bosses in
Brazil are earning higher salaries than their developed-world
counterparts in New York and London as the Latin American
country's economy and currency surge ahead.
 A chief executive in Brazil's financial capital Sao Paulo
can on average expect to pocket $620,000 a year excluding
bonuses, a survey by Brazilian firm Dasein Executive Search
found. That was comfortably ahead of the $574,000 average
salary of top bosses in New York and $550,000 in London, the
next two top-ranking cities for executive pay.
 The results partly reflect a shortage of executive talent
in Brazil as the education system has failed to keep pace with
the booming economy.
 The dollar value of salaries has also been pushed higher by
Brazil's supercharged currency, which has risen 11 percent
against the greenback since May and been described by bank
Goldman Sachs as the most overvalued in the world.
 As a rare bright sport in the global economy, Brazil has
been the destination of choice for global investors looking to
park funds and escape paltry returns in the developed world.
 Latin America's largest economy is on course to grow 7.5
percent this year, driven by vibrant consumer demand and record
high employment that has led to skill shortages in some
industries. Inflation is a growing worry for policy makers, who
nonetheless deny that Brazil is showing signs of an asset
bubble.
 The Dasein survey questioned 80 executives in multinational
firms in the industrial sector, including car, steel and mining
firms, with between 1,000 and 15,000 employees.
 A parallel survey carried out by the New York-based
Association of Executive Search Consultants (AESC), of which
Dasein is a member, also put Sao Paulo ahead of New York,
London and Hong Kong.
 The AESC survey found that the results were the exact
opposite of what the executives themselves expected -- 82
percent of the 42 people surveyed believed that Sao Paulo would
come last.
 David Braga, business manager at Dasein, said Brazil's
humming economy and the prospect of higher salaries were
drawing back to Brazil executives who had left in search of
higher salaries as well as attracting a growing number of
foreigners.
 ""We're seeing a strong trend of repatriation. Lots of
Brazilians who left to work in other countries are now trying
to come back because they can get salaries as high as anywhere
else,"" he said.
 With mergers and acquisitions in Brazil reaching record
volumes for two straight years, and bond and stock issuance
surging, banks in the country are hiring at a breakneck pace to
keep up with demand, driving salaries higher.
 Brokerages and banks such as Barclays Capital ,
Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley  have hired more
research analysts, investment bankers and traders, increasing
competition for top talent in the country.
 A report by AESC earlier this year found that there was an
""acute shortage"" of executive leadership talent in Brazil,
partly due to the country's notoriously poor school system.
 ""The neglect of the public educational system and flight of
the best talent to opportunities abroad over the last 30 years
has left Brazilian organizations with a leadership pool
insufficient to meet today's requirements,"" it said.

(Adds details on wider generic drugs row, UN comment)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The European Union and India
resolved a dispute over generic drugs on Friday which should
remove obstacles to Indian drugs manufacturers exporting
products to the developing world, officials said.
 Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma told
Reuters the EU's trade chief, Karel De Gucht, told Indian
negotiators during an EU-India summit in Brussels that the issue
had been resolved, and De Gucht confirmed the agreement.
 ""This is a great breakthrough which will of course lead to a
suspension of WTO (World Trade Organisation) proceedings. So the
dispute is over,"" said Sharma. 
 India and Brazil brought a case to the WTO in 2009 saying
the EU was wrongly stopping and inspecting shipments of generic
drugs in transit, with some shipments being turned away rather
than being allowed to continue to their final destination. 
 The EU is still in legal proceedings with Brazil.
 ""I reconfirmed we are going to amend present regulation so
as to put into practice what has been agreed,"" De Gucht told
Reuters. ""Transports in transit will no longer be checked,
except for counterfeiting.""
 The EU said it will amend customs codes that have led to
numerous seizures of generic drugs shipments in transit from
India to countries in South America via Europe.
 The agreement will benefit leading drugs makers such as Dr
Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, whose generic drugs -- legal in India
but not recognised in Europe -- have been stopped en route to
countries such as Brazil.
 It is unclear when WTO legal proceedings will be suspended
as Friday's agreement needs approval from the EU's parliament.
 
 TRADE TALKS CONTINUE
 Agreement over the WTO dispute sweetened an EU-India summit
that failed to provide major breakthroughs in negotiations over
a free trade agreement.
 Indian and EU leaders on Friday said they would seal a free
trade pact early next year. But concerns continue over EU
demands that India -- a rapidly growing economy that is battling
high levels of rural poverty -- should open up vulnerable market
sectors and follow EU patent rules.
 Market openings could hurt subsistence farmers and
shopkeepers, critics say, prompting public protests in India and
Brussels against the trade agreement.
 The United Nations warned on Friday that an EU-India trade
deal could raise the price of Indian generic drugs that provide
cheap treatment for HIV and malaria in poor countries in Africa,
South America and Asia.
 ""Millions in the developing world depend on India for
generic medicines at affordable costs. Restriction of generic
drug production in India will have a devastating public health
impact around the world,"" United Nations Special Rapporteur
Anand Grover said in a statement.
 The EU wants India to follow strict and costly registration
procedures for its drugs, and observe EU terms of patent
validity, which are longer than in India and give pricey branded
drugs a longer shelf life.
 India's Sharma told Reuters in an interview he will protect
the ability of India to produce and export pharmaceuticals and
generics.

sentiment data on Friday boosted the U.S. dollar on confidence
the economy was steadily gaining strength, in turn pushing
down the prices of U.S. Treasury debt, oil and gold.
 Share prices globally were flat to marginally higher on
the day. A stronger greenback squeezes the operating margins
for U.S. exporters, feeding into the recent inverse
correlation between the currency and U.S. stocks.

 European shares gained on the U.S. data, but are off their
highs for the day.
 Peripheral European sovereign credit deteriorated on
Friday as prices wax and wane while uncertainty remains over
whether policymakers can put to rest the concerns the debt
crisis is under control.
 ""The strength of the U.S. dollar could be viewed as waning
if it can be demonstrated credibly that U.S. deficits will
rise and conversely, the euro could rise comparatively,"" said
Tim Speiss, chairman, Personal Wealth Advisors at EisnerAmper

 ""However, the EU has its hands full with financing costs
related to Ireland and Greece, and potentially Spain and
Portugal, so we see no dramatic negative dollar impact tied to
this legislation at this juncture,"" he said.
 The euro fell 0.18 percent to $1.3218 . The U.S.

 Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist for Prudential
Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey, said the market is likely
to be stuck in a range as sentiment vacillates between
optimism and pessimism.
 ""Basically the market, after being excessively
pessimistic, is having to re-evaluate following the
announcement of QE2, better-than-expected data, and the
stimulus from the extension of the tax cuts. So the market had
a big swing in sentiment,"" Tipp said.

 By David Ljunggren
 OTTAWA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Canadian trade deficit was
smaller than expected in October, with stronger international
exports of industrial goods and materials helping to overcome a
shrinking surplus with the United States, by far Canada's
largest trading partner.
 The deficit in October was C$1.71 billion ($1.69 billion),
down from a revised C$2.31 billion in September, Statistics
Canada said on Friday. Market analysts had predicted a deficit
of C$2.1 billion in October.
 In recent months the high Canadian dollar and weak U.S.
economy have cut demand in the United States, which as recently
as a few months ago was taking around 75 percent of Canada's
exports every month.
 In October, the trade surplus with the United States was
just C$1.13 billion, the smallest since September 1992. The
United States took 70.0 percent of Canada's exports, the lowest
level since the 69 percent recorded in July 1982.
 TD Economics economist Diana Petramala said Canada
accounted for just 14 percent of imports bought by the United
States, down from almost 20 percent in 2001.
 ""While we think that this is as low as it can get, the high
Canadian dollar will likely constrain exporters from regaining
much of the ground lost during the crisis,"" she noted.
 Both the government and the Bank of Canada have highlighted
the difficulties posed by the weak U.S. economy.
 In New York, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told Reuters
that ""we realize our economy won't have substantial recovery
without recovery in the United States"". [ID:nN10294555]
 Exports to the rest of the world, excluding the United
States, increased by 10.1 percent from September.
 Ottawa, stressing the need to diversify its exports, is
pressing ahead with plans to negotiate free trade agreements
with major nations and trading blocs such as India and the
European Union.
 Friday's trade data barely affected the Canadian dollar,
which was at C$1.0100 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.01 U.S. cents,
at 10:20 a.m. (1520 GMT), up from Thursday's North American
close at C$1.0105 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.96 U.S. cents.
 October marked the sixth consecutive month that Canada has
run a trade deficit.
 Exports rose by 3.1 percent to C$33.77 billion on higher
shipments of industrial goods and materials.
 Eric Lascelles of TD Securities said he was heartened by
the report, while pointing out that copper exports soared by
243 percent. Copper prices are hovering near record highs, in
part due to increased Chinese demand and a supply shortage.
 ""It is worth noting that this category is always volatile,
and encounters triple digit adjustments several times each
year,"" he said.
 Imports grew by 1.2 percent to C$35.49 billion, pushed
higher by shipments of energy and automotive products.

 * Funding gap on UK property seen at $54 bln in 2011-13
 * Mezzanine funds chase refinancing returns of 8-15 percent
 
 By Andrew Macdonald and Nia Williams
 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Specialist debt funds are poised
to pour cash into the multi-billion pound UK property funding
hole left by retreating senior lenders and tumbling prices,
nabbing hefty returns and a side-door stake in the sector.
 ""Mezzanine (debt) provides investors with the opportunity to
get exposure to those types of properties they like, without
having to buy them,"" said Andrew Radkiewicz, managing director
of Pramerica Real Estate Investors.
 The trend uses mezzanine funds -- traditionally a short-term
high-interest bearing bridging loan -- to fill a longer term
funding gap. The debt will be subordinated by holders and may
have some call on the asset itself through prearranged deals
with the remaining senior creditors.
 This new type of funding will usually fill the gap between
the first 60 percent of value in the asset, covered by senior
debt, and the final 20 percent, covered by equity. This gap is
known as the 60-80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) band.
 Property consultant DTZ estimates there is a $12 billion
60-80 percent LTV opportunity in 2011, growing to $18 billion in
2012 and $24 billion in 2013.
 This new type of funding is already happening -- U.S.-based
Beacon Capital Partners' 200 million pounds ($317 million) o
ongoing refinancing of its Mid City Place offices in London
includes about 50 million pounds of mezzanine.
 Separately, more than 1 billion pounds of mezzanine
refinancing over five deals on prime London property are up for
grabs in first-quarter 2011, industry sources said.
 ""It's taken a while for real estate investing institutions
to identify this (refinancing opportunity) as falling within
their umbrella of being a real estate investment,"" Radkiewicz
said, noting these include institutional investors, sovereign
wealth funds, pension plans and hedge funds.
 Already several mezzanine funds -- Pramerica, Duet Capital
and LaSalle Investment Management -- have taken commitments
totalling several hundred million pounds, with material hikes in
inflows predicted for 2011 and 2012. Now, others funds are
trying to catch some of the action.
 Dale Lattanzio, chief investment officer of Duet Group's
European Real Estate Debt Fund, noted a strong desire among
property investors to use mezzanine beyond its more traditional
role of helping fund big-ticket direct investments.
 ""We've seen some property investors using that to get
exposure to strategic assets,"" Lattanzio said, referring to
prime assets that needed refinancing but were not for sale.
 On average, fund managers expect returns of 8-10 percent for
prime-grade assets, and up to 15 percent in some cases. 
 Returns on mezzanine refinancing of selected secondary
properties -- those on and beyond the periphery of blue-chip
business hubs -- is seen starting at 12-15 percent, reflecting
the cost of higher risk.
 ""The total returns depends on where you sit on the risk
profile ... but mezzanine is still cheaper than a lot of equity
at the moment,"" said Phil Cropper, an executive director at
property consultancy CB Richard Ellis.
 
 RISK BECOMES LIQUIDITY
 Radkiewicz said the market is starting to treat mezzanine as
less than high risk because many of the funds providing it are
using pure equity, rather than leverage, and are keeping the
deals on their balance sheets without syndication.
 As a result, the new funding neither disturbs nor dilutes
existing equity. ""It's really about the provision of new forms
of capital into deals,"" said one fund manager.
 Mezzanine ranks below senior debt, and before a refinancing
deal goes ahead, the two providers agree what actions a
mezzanine provider can take -- including injecting capital and
becoming an equity holder -- in the event of a defaults or
breach its covenants.
 Mezzanine debt will continue to be used in its traditional
role of direct investment in prime property, but a shortage of
stock coming to market means that role will be limited, even
though many blue-chip investors have built up capital to buy
discounted assets.
 ""If you take that wall of capital and try and put it into
buildings that aren't for sale, it's not going to happen. That's
where two-thirds to three-quarters of our business will be, this
wall of capital just can't do these deals,"" Radkiewicz said.
 The new role for mezzanine, along with low interest rates,
means owners of prime property are already seeking to refinance
debt due in 2011 and 2012 and tie in good terms while they
exist, said Rick Gambetta, of Matrix Property Fund Management.
 ""The days of waiting until the week before getting a loan
are gone,"" Gambetta said, noting Matrix would provide junior and
bespoke mezzanine debt via its ungeared mortgage fund.
 ""Mezzanine and junior funds are in a nascent market and to
jump in straight away to the secondary (property) market would
be very brave,"" Gambetta said.

 NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar firmed against
the euro on Friday as better-than-expected U.S. economic data
increased the allure of the greenback, with gains expected to
continue if Treasury yields keep rising.
 The U.S. trade deficit narrowed much more than expected in

 U.S. Treasury prices widened losses after the data.
[ID:nN10358024] The drop in prices bodes well for the dollar as
it increases demand for higher yielding assets.
 The rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the last three

growth.

 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR RALLIES
 The Australian dollar staged a relief rally on Friday after
China increased the reserve requirement for banks but kept

 The Australian dollar rose 0.10 percent to $0.9853
, but below the session's high of $0.9896. Analysts
warned, however, that a China rate rise was still possible as
the country battles to stem rising inflationary pressures.
""In recent weeks people have been talking about the
possibility of a rate hike in China,"" said Niels Christensen,
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""Given they only announced a reserve requirement hike we
are seeing a bit of a relief rally as it has given a small

 By Erik Kirschbaum and Emannuel Jarry
 FREIBURG, Germany, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Germany and France
pledged on Friday to better align their tax and labour policies
to foster convergence in the euro zone, but rejected calls for
an increase in the bloc's rescue fund and joint sovereign bonds.
 Earlier on Friday, European central bankers had told euro
zone governments they could not count on the ECB alone to solve
a debt crisis which has forced bailouts of Greece and Ireland,
and heaped pressure on countries like Portugal and Spain.
 At a news conference in the southwestern city of Freiburg,
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
presented a united front ahead of a crucial summit next week
where EU leaders are expected to agree the terms of a permanent
rescue mechanism for the bloc.
 Berlin has opposed calls by Spain and other countries to
move towards a full-fledged ""fiscal union"" in the 16-nation bloc
but appeared on Friday to have agreed to a limited form of
policy coordination, although little detail was offered.
 ""We have agreed to the convergence of German and French tax
policies and I thank the German chancellor for this opening,""
said Sarkozy.
 Merkel said it was up to Germany and France to set an
example on questions of competitiveness, showing partners how
far the bloc's biggest economies could cooperate in areas
""beyond pure budget policy"".
 ""We are talking about labour law, about tax law and if we
are to improve the coherence of the economic aspects of the euro
zone, then we should target these issues step by step and
propose solutions,"" Merkel said.
 The two leaders said they would present ""structural""
proposals next year in the area of economic coordination, but
declined to elaborate.
 ""We will defend the euro, because the euro is Europe,""
Sarkozy said. ""Our determination, both German and French, is
total.""
 
 ECB WARNINGS
 Pressure on high-deficit euro members eased slightly over
the past week after the ECB bought government bonds in a thin
end-of-year market, pushing down the borrowing costs of
countries on Europe's southern periphery.
 But Bank of Italy Governor and ECB Governing Council member
Mario Draghi told the Financial Times that responsibility for
dealing with the crisis ultimately lay with euro governments and
the ECB could go only so far in helping weaker members by buying
their bonds.
 ""I'm only too aware that we could easily cross the line and
lose everything we have, lose independence, and basically
violate the (EU) treaty,"" said Draghi, a leading candidate to
replace Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB president.
 The euro, which fell to a 10-week low under $1.30 late last
month as the euro crisis deepened, weakened slightly on Friday
to trade at $1.3215.
 The risk premiums investors demand to hold Portuguese and
Spanish debt instead of German benchmarks edged higher on the
day.
 The EU summit is expected to finalise plans to introduce a
permanent rescue mechanism for the euro zone to replace the 750
billion euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) that
it set up in May after bailing out Greece.
 German demands that the new mechanism include the
possibility of so-called ""haircuts"" for holders of euro zone
sovereign debt have been blamed for exacerbating the crisis by
scaring bond investors with the prospect of not getting all
their money back.
 European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch
said expanding Europe's financial stability fund would be
preferable to issuing euro area bonds in the short term to
tackle any debt problems.
 But Merkel rejected calls to increase the EFSF.
 ""I'd say for us in Germany that the question of expanding
the rescue mechanism is not now on the table,"" Merkel said.
""Less than 10 percent of the rescue mechanism has been used for
Ireland. It is not on the agenda,"" she said.
 Sarkozy also supported Merkel by coming out against a
proposal pushed by Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker and
Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti for so-called E-bonds,
or joint euro zone sovereign debt issues.
 ""I don't think we were consulted before this idea was
proposed, so it shouldn't insult anyone if we say we are not in
agreement with it,"" Sarkozy said, saying neither German nor
French citizens could accept ""mutualising"" euro zone debt.

 By Edward Krudy and Doug Palmer
 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. economic data
painted a picture of a firming recovery on Friday as consumer
confidence rose to its highest level in six months and the
country's trade deficit narrowed much more than expected.
 Consumer sentiment in December rose to its highest level
since June and was at its third-highest since the start of
2008, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
survey. Government data showed U.S. exports in October rose a
robust 3.2 percent while imports declined, which may bode well
for fourth quarter economic growth.
 The consumer sentiment report was another sign consumers
could be ready to spend this holiday season.
 ""This is an indication of the favorable development we are
seeing so far with the year-end holiday shopping season,"" said
Pierre Ellis, senior global economist at Decision Economics in
New York. ""It adds to a growing number of economic indicators
that are looking better-than-expected"".

 The survey's preliminary December reading for consumer
sentiment came in at 74.2, up from 71.6 in November. That was
above the the median forecast of 72.5 among economists polled
by Reuters.
 Chiming with recent signs of improvement in the labor
market, consumers cited more favorable news about changes in
the employment situation. Slow jobs growth is seen as one of
the biggest impediments to economic recovery.
 At the same time, the survey's barometer of current
economic conditions rose to its highest reading since January
2008, just after the economic downturn began. The index for
December came in at 85.7, up from 82.1 in November and also ,
above a forecast of 83.1.
 Although the unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent in
November, weekly data have shown new U.S. claims for
unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week and the
four-week moving average slipped to a two-year low.
 The sentiment survey was taken before a tentative deal on
extended tax cuts reached earlier this week. However, compilers
point to a widespread expectation the cuts would be extended
and say confidence could fall again if the cuts are blocked.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit for October totaled $38.7
billion, down from a revised estimate of $44.6 billion for
September. Analysts surveyed before the report had expected the
deficit to narrow just slightly to about $43.60 billion.
 The smaller-than-expected deficit could boost estimates for
U.S. fourth-quarter economic growth because it implies a larger
share of U.S. demand is being met by domestic production.
 Imports declined slightly in the face of slackening demand
for industrial and petroleum products, the report from the
Commerce Department showed.
 ""This suggests that the economy is accelerating,"" said Neil
Dutta, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New
York, raising his forecast of fourth-quarter economic growth to
about 3.0 percent.
 But one big reason the trade deficit is shrinking is
""because we're still in a slower-growth economy. You'd imagine
that a smaller number would be a good thing, but it's because
people still have to contend with a slower economy"" said Robert
Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in New
York.
 U.S. stock indexes were marginally higher after the
reports, hovering close to new recent highs. U.S. Treasury bond
prices added to losses while the dollar gained.
 On an annual basis, the trade deficit has widened sharply
this year and could surpass $500 billion when final figures for
2010 are available. Last year, in the midst of the global
financial crisis which put a squeeze on world trade, the U.S.
trade gap narrowed about 46 percent to $374.9 billion.
 Record exports to China and Mexico in October helped push
the overall export tally to $158.7 billion, the highest since
August 2008. Exports to the European Union and Japan also
showed growth.
 Despite record exports to China in October, the U.S. trade
deficit with that country in the first 10 months of 2010 was
$226.8 billion, up 20.3 percent from the year-earlier period.
 The sharp rise is likely to keep China's trade and currency
policies on the minds of U.S. lawmakers in 2011.

 PRAGUE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank may start
lifting interest rates from record lows in the middle of the
next year, earlier than assumed in the bank's staff forecast, a
central banker was quoted as saying on Friday.
 ""Our latest forecast says that the period of interest-rate
increases will probably start near the end of next year, but I
think that it will start earlier, maybe at around the middle of
next year,"" Robert Holman told new agency Bloomberg.
 The key two-week repo rate has stood at 0.75 percent since a
quarter-point cut in May and Holman told the agency the current
monetary-policy setting was appropriate.
 ""There aren't such inflation risks that would require an
increase in rates at the next monetary meeting, or at the
beginning of next year, and I don't think it will happen,""
Bloomberg quoted him as saying.
 The bank next meets on rates on Dec. 22.
 Holman also said he considered the bank's forecast for next
year's growth of 1.2 percent, a sharp deceleration from this
year's expected 2.3 percent, as too pessimistic.
 ""My personal view, which is slightly differing from our
official forecast, is that economic growth will be stronger next
year. I wouldn't be so conservative in estimating investments,""
he said.""
 Many analysts said they were surprised the bank's outlook
for next year was so bleak. 
 The bank has said government austerity plans, including
public sector wage cuts and lay-offs, and an end of a boom in
solar power plant investment, would be the main brakes for
growth in 2011.
 Czech growth has benefited from a jump in the construction
of new solar power plants fuelled by a generous state subsidy
and rapidly falling costs for solar panels, which led to rising
imports and investments.

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - India will not agree on social
or environmental targets as part of an EU trade agreement, and
does not support EU plans to help flood-ravaged Pakistan with
export concessions, the country's trade minister said.
 Although the 27-trading bloc places high importance on the
targets, India's objections to binding rules on sustainability,
tying Indian and EU operators there to strict labour rights and
environmental protection, are unlikely to stall the talks.
 ""There can be no binding commitments on sustainability (in
an EU-India trade agreement). Extraneous issues do not fit
here,"" Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma told
Reuters in an interview ahead of an EU-India summit on Friday.
 Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, told
journalists he expected a trade deal between India and the EU,
its largest trading partner, to be sealed in 2011.
 A work around was expected on the sustainability issues.
 EU efforts to stabilise regions of Pakistan ravaged by
floods this year should be through direct aid payments -- not
through tariff cuts to Pakistani exporters, Sharma said.
 ""We're all for assistance to Pakistan, but let these two
issues not be mixed,"" he said in the interview conducted on
Thursday. ""These are separate issues.""
 Negotiations for a free trade pact between the EU and India
are in the final stages, Sharma said. 
 Europe hopes such a deal will open India's booming markets
to EU banking, telecoms and consumer goods; India hopes it will
give exporters and back office service providers access to
Europe's half a billion population.
 But the 27-nation EU also wants to tie Indian producers and
EU operators there to rules ensuring labour rights and guarding
against unfettered pollution.
 Concerns have been growing among development activists and
EU lawmakers that EU demands in closed-door negotiations will
extract concessions from India, opening up vulnerable farm,
services and retail sectors to harsh foreign competition and
forcing price rises for Indian-made generic drugs used in
treating HIV and malaria.
 A legal battle at the World Trade Organization over EU
seizures of generic drugs shipped from India to Brazil through
European ports was likely to end with Europe backing down,
Sharma said.
Sharma, a 57-year old lawyer and former anti-apartheid
activist, also rejected calls by 25 European parliamentarians
that India should secure preferences as a developing country,
rather than an equal partner in the trade talks.
 ""We've never claimed we are not a developing country. But
India is the fastest-growing economy in the world. If it is not
as equal partners there cannot be any negotiations.""
 India is home to global players in the automobile,
pharmaceuticals and backoffice service sectors, and is listed by
the World Bank as one of the world's fastest growing economies,
although many Indians live in poverty.
 
 DOHA TRADE TALKS
 On stalled talks for an international trade accord at the
WTO, Sharma said these could be finalised in 2011 if there is
""perseverance and optimism, and a spirit of mutual
accommodation"" from key negotiators.
 One of the main barriers to a deal has been a call by the
United States for big emerging countries such as China, India
and Brazil to do more to open their markets to competition.
 India has in the past resisted calls to make significant
cuts to tariffs in several sectors -- a position from which it
might be willing to shift, Sharma said.
 ""Sectoral (cuts) for developing countries are voluntary, but
that doesn't mean that this is a no-go area,"" he said.
 But he was dubious that U.S. negotiators would offer
significant concessions demanded by developing countries.
 ""We have to take their word for it that they are now
seriously engaged, but I cannot say anything beyond that, about
their domestic dynamics and bipartisan consensus in Congress.""

362,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2010 07:12AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Hold the bubbly for another week," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - All the ingredients of the year's
biggest conundrums pepper the coming week, making chances of
investors being able to slip away early for the Christmas/New
Year break slim.
 The final full week of trading for 2010 brings a Federal
Reserve meeting that will update on asset-buying quantitative
easing, a European Union summit on stabilising the euro zone
debt crisis, and a slew of data to sound check global recovery.
 It comes amid signs that investors are increasingly
expecting 2011 to be relatively good for riskier assets, with an
improving global economy, good corporate balance sheets, and
plentiful liquidity driving things forward.
 The Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in the past week
showed many investment managers banking on more gains from
emerging markets, with other stock regions, including Wall
Street, also doing well.
 Commodities and credit were also cited as part of the
reflation trade.
 This can be seen already in the performance of the MSCI
all-country world stock index, up only around 8 percent for this
year, but gaining close to 3 percent in less than two weeks of
December.
 The volatility of 2010 has helped make stocks seem cheap to
investors. Data from Thomson Reuters Datastream suggests a
12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 times for the
all-country index. It compares with a 10-year average of 15.
 ""The equity risk premium is so high, it's easy for equities
to go up and we have at least 20 percent more to look forward to
in the next year or two,"" Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, told the Reuters summit.
 By contrast, the sustainability of ultra-low yields being
offered by benchmark government bonds is suddenly being
questioned.
 The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury shot up as much as 20
basis points on Wednesday as a combination of the expectations
about an improving U.S. economic climate and worries about
increasing deficits prompted a sharp selloff.
 Bond markets, already jittery in Europe over the potential
for default in some euro zone peripheral economies, will be
under particularly scrutiny in the coming week.
 
 QE, EU, PMI
 For investors to see their 2011 predictions take concrete
form, a few things will have to take place or be avoided. Three
of them are on display in the coming week.
 First, the Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday to discuss their
plan to spend $600 billion in government debt to pump more
liquidity into the system.
 It is not expected to change the plan -- which is seen as
supporting riskier assets through stimulus -- but the past
week's deal between the White House and Republicans in Congress
to extend Bush-era income taxes, including a surprise reduction
in payroll taxes, has injected a new element into the debate.
Some economists have said the extra boost from the tax deal
reduces the likelihood of the Fed having to expand the QE
programme, which has implications for bond investors at the
least.
 Next up for investors is the end-of-year EU summit on
Thursday and Friday in Brussels. Top of the agenda will be the
euro zone debt crisis, which has haunted financial markets twice
this year -- first in May/June when Greece needed a bailout,
then in November when Ireland did.
 A 750 billion euro ($1 trillion) EU/International Monetary
Fund temporary package is already in place, but markets have
questioned whether that is enough should the crisis spread to
Portugal, Spain and even Italy.
 Debate is expected mainly to be about a new, permanent
mechanism for handling crises after 2013.
 Consensus, drawn from the Reuters summit and various
investment bank outlooks, appears to be that EU authorities will
do what is needed to stop the crisis getting out of hand. But
few, if any, expect it is going away for good.
 ""While the European debt crisis will probably continue to
generate volatility, it is not likely to be the trigger that
ends the recovery in economic growth and financial markets,""
Barclays Capital said in their 2011 outlook.
 That said, any perception of inaction from the leaders in
the coming week could set off the market jitters again, as could
too much emphasis on investors taking the hit in the case of a
default.
 The third of the week's key events is a raft of economic
data including European PMI manufacturing data and U.S. retail
sales, industrial production and inflation reports.
Given that much of the investment flows for next year are
predicated on a recovering global economy, investors will be
watching for any last minute -- or, at least, last month of 2010
-- unpleasant surprises.

 By Noah Barkin
 BERLIN, Dec 10 (Reuters) - European central bankers told
euro zone governments on Friday not to count on the ECB to solve
the single currency bloc's debt crisis alone as the leaders of
Germany and France met to plot strategy before a key EU summit.
 Pressure on high-deficit euro members like Portugal and
Spain has eased slightly over the past week after the ECB bought
government bonds in a thin end-of-year market, pushing down the
borrowing costs of countries on Europe's southern periphery.
 But to prevent further contagion, following their agreement
to bail out Ireland last month, European leaders may need to
send a strong signal to sceptical investors when they gather in
Brussels for a Dec. 16-17 summit.
 ECB Executive Board Member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell wrote in
a column in Austria's Format magazine that the bank's bond buys
had been successful because they ""gave countries time to prepare
and decide on budgetary measures"".
 Meanwhile, Bank of Italy Governor and ECB Governing Council
member Mario Draghi told the Financial Times that responsibility
for dealing with the crisis ultimately lay with euro zone
governments and the ECB could go only so far.
 ""I'm only too aware that we could easily cross the line and
lose everything we have, lose independence, and basically
violate the (EU) treaty,"" said Draghi, a leading candidate to
replace Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB president.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy met on Friday in the southwestern German city of
Freiburg to agree a common stance ahead of the EU summit and
were due to hold a joint news conference at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT).
 Ahead of their meeting, Sarkozy's office voiced support for
Merkel's stance against issuing joint euro zone bonds -- an idea
pushed by Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker and Italian
Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti -- or increasing the size of
the bloc's stability fund to stem the crisis.
 German coalition leaders who met on Thursday evening
rejected the euro bond idea as unacceptable.
 ""There was a broad consensus that Eurobonds as Mr. Juncker
has proposed them are out of the question for us,"" Hans-Peter
Dietrich, a leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU)
in parliament told reporters after the meeting.
 
 EURO STEADIES, SPREADS EDGE UP
 The euro, which fell to a 10-week low under $1.30 late last
month as the euro crisis deepened, was steady at $1.3260. The
risk premiums investors demand to hold Portuguese and Spanish
debt instead of German benchmarks edged higher on the day.
 Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado said in Madrid that
she expected the country's cost of borrowing to rise at a bond
auction scheduled for next week, but said this was a temporary
phenomenon and not alarming.
 ""It's true that we might have to pay a little more for bond
issues than we have in the past. For that reason we have said we
will reduce the volume until the markets stabilise,"" she said.
 Madrid is due to sell 10-year and 15-year bonds on the same
day the EU summit starts next week.
 The summit is expected to finalise plans to introduce a
permanent rescue mechanism for the euro zone to replace the 750
billion euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) that
it set up in May after bailing out Greece.
 German demands that the new mechanism include the
possibility of so-called ""haircuts"" for holders of euro zone
sovereign debt has been blamed for exacerbating the crisis.
 But ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on
Friday that it was important for private investors to share the
costs of any future bailouts.
 ""I think it is important to have a permanent safety net, a
permanent instrument,"" Nowotny, who also head the Austrian
Central Bank, told reporters. ""I think it is also correct that
in this whole European stability mechanism the aspect of private
investor involvement is covered.""
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told parliament that
Dublin would start tapping an 85 billion euro EU/IMF bailout
from early next year to meet its sovereign borrowing
requirements.
 Data released on Friday showed Ireland's central bank had
lent the country's crippled banks nearly 45 billion euros in
special funding up until the end of November, a 10 billion euro
increase on the prior month.

(Updates prices, adds detail, quote)
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The euro held steady against the
dollar on Friday while the Australian dollar staged a relief
rally after China increased the reserve requirement for banks
but kept interest rates on hold.
 The Aussie -- which is most sensitive to monetary tightening
in China given Australia's close trading links with the country
-- dipped briefly after Beijing increased the reserve
requirement by 50 basis points.
 But it soon pushed back up, taking the euro and other
perceived higher risk currencies with it on relief that China
had not opted to raise interest rates as well given another jump
in Chinese exports last month.
 The euro underperformed, however, holding up against the
dollar but falling against other currencies, including sterling
and the Swiss franc as concerns over the debt crisis in the euro
zone continued to dampen sentiment.
 ""In recent weeks people have been talking about the
possibility of a rate hike in China,"" said Niels Christensen,
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""Given they only announced a reserve requirement hike we are
seeing a bit of a relief rally as it has given a small boost to
risk appetite. This has especially helped the Aussie and the New
Zealand dollar.""
 The euro was steady at $1.3244, staying above a low of
$1.3164 on trading platform EBS on Thursday.
 Sentiment towards the euro was shaky after Moody's said on
Thursday it may downgrade the ratings of some Portuguese banks.
The announcement followed Fitch's earlier decision to slash
Ireland's rating by three notches. 
 Technical analysts said the euro remained on a downward
trend as intraday highs have been getting lower since Monday.
 The next key target for the euro is seen at $1.3150,
followed by its 200-day moving average around $1.3115. Traders
said the euro may fall back to its December low of $1.2970 in
the coming weeks.
 Ireland's government will seek parliamentary approval for an
85-billion-euro IMF/EU rescue package next week, though there
were concerns about political infighting as the opposition
Labour Party pledged to vote against it.
 Traders say no end is in sight for the debt crisis with
European leaders now clashing over the idea of joint euro zone
bonds. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela
Merkel meet in Freiburg on Friday to prepare joint Franco-German
positions for next week's EU summit.
 
 AUSSIE GAINS
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $0.9883 ,
recovering after a brief dip to around $0.9845 after China's
announcement, though it stayed away from Tuesday's three-week
high of $0.9966.
 Analysts warned, however, that a China rate hike was still
possible as the country battles to stem rising inflationary
pressures. 
 ""Everyone is on watch for China, especially ahead of the CPI
figures this weekend. Rumours are that CPI could be north of 5
percent; if that's the case it will underline the scale of the
inflation problem,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at
CIBC.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, dipped 0.2 percent to
79.936, struggling to break through the 80.00-81.50 barrier that
capped its November rally.
 The dollar was off a high of 80.405 reached earlier this
week as healthy demand at a 30-year auction of U.S. Treasuries
on Thursday pushed U.S. yields down after a recent spike that
has boosted the appeal of the greenback.
 Against the Japanese currency, the greenback was down 0.1
percent at 83.56 yen.
 The dollar's repeated failure since late last month to take
out resistance around 84.40 yen is encouraging many traders to
take profits near that level, leading to expectations that its
83.50-84.50 range will persist for now.

 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 10 (Reuters) - China's central bank on Friday
increased the amount of money that lenders must keep on
reserve for the third time in one month, a move to mop up
excess cash in the economy and rein in inflation.	
 But the decision to raise banks' required reserves rather
than interest rates means that officials have opted for a
milder form of monetary tightening for the time being,
suggesting that they believe prices pressures are still well
within their ability to control.	
 The 50 basis point increase, which takes effect on Dec 20,
will leave required reserve ratios at 18.5 percent, a record
high for the majority of the country's banks.	
 The People's Bank of China offered no explanation.	
 ""We expected the RRR rise this time, and I think it is
perfectly timed to help manage excessive liquidity,"" said Lu
Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai.	
 ""There is still much scope for the central bank to raise
reserve ratios next year. We expect several increases in the
first quarter of next year and the ratio could reach as high
as 23 percent in 2011,"" he added.	
 The move came just one week after China's top leaders
announced a shift to a ""prudent"" monetary policy from the
previous ""moderately loose"" stance. Analysts said the change
of wording could pave the way for more interest rate increases
and lending controls.	
 Chinese stock markets have shed more than 10 percent over
the past month on concerns that the government would ratchet
up its monetary policy tightening in face of rising inflation.	
 Chinese consumer price inflation may have hit 5.1 percent
in the year to November, a 28-month high, state media reported
on Friday. The figure is due to be published on Saturday.	
 Along with playing a key role in the fight against
inflation, policy tightening also signals the government's
confidence that the world's second-largest economy is on solid
ground, even as the U.S. and European recoveries remain fragile.

lower than expected figure for third quarter growth.
 Growth came in at 5.5 percent year-on-year compared with
consensus expectations for a 6.6 percent expansion. The lira
 eased slightly to 1.5015 against the dollar after the
data, compared to around 1.5 immediately before and 1.5010 on
Thursday.
 ""We don't think (the data) will have much of an impact on
financial markets because although the headline figure was below
expectations the details were positive,"" said HSBC
Istanbul-based strategist Fatih Keresteci.
 ""As we do not think it will change the Central Bank's policy
stance, we take the view that it will not have a significant
impact on secondary market interest rates,"" he said.
 The yield on Turkey's benchmark bond <0#TRTSYSUM=IS> edged
up to 7.67 percent from 7.66 percent before the GDP data's
release and compared with 7.65 percent on Thursday.
 Economists noted that the growth was import-driven, exports
remained weak, while investment spending picked up.
 ""We are thus going to see whole year GDP growth at around
7.5-8 percent. Nice, but again the one problem Turkish equities
have (is) namely dealing with high base effects from 2010,"" said
Simon Quijano-Evans, economist at C.A. Cheuvreux, based in
Vienna.
 Istanbul's main share index <.XU100> was down 0.28 percent
to 65,728 points, having been down 0.51 percent beforehand. The
index, which has surged by more than a quarter this year, had
dropped 2.64 percent on Thursday.
 It slightly underperformed the MSCI emerging markets index
<.MSCIEF>, which dipped 0.17 percent.
 Shares were led lower by banks on concerns about lower
sector profits next year, with the banking index <.XBANK> down
0.51 percent after a slide of more than 4 percent on Thursday.
 The banking regulator this week said the sector's profits in
2011 would be lower than this year, and that it would prefer
banks to conserve strength and not pay dividends this year.
 Most actively traded Garanti Bank  was 0.71
percent lower at 8.36 lira.
 Isbank  was down 0.7 percent after it said it had
applied to Turkey's banking regulator for permission to issue up
to 5 billion lira worth of lira-denominated corporate bonds.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2010 04:56AM ET</span>",Italy output weaker than expected after France drop," ROME, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Italian industrial output was
weaker than expected in October, slipping 0.1 percent from a
month earlier after a 2.1 percent fall in September and pointing
to sluggish growth going into the new year.
 The data followed a 0.8 percent monthly fall in France
reported earlier on Friday, and a 2.9 percent surge in Germany,
the euro zone's largest economy, which continues to outperform
its neighbours, according to data released on Wednesday.
 Germany, France and Italy make up at least two thirds of the
euro zone's economic output.
 ""This is quite a disappointing number and it's clear that
the economy has lost momentum after the strong first half,"" said
Citbibank's Giada Giani.
 ""We see Italian GDP rising just 0.2 percent in the last
quarter, like in Q3.""
 The median forecast of a Reuter's poll of 17 analysts had
projected a monthly output reading of +0.7 percent. Forecasts
spanned +0.2 percent to +1.4 percent.
 While Germany and France's recoveries seem to be steaming
ahead, there is concern that other weaker euro zone economies
are struggling and that worse is to come when cutbacks forced on
them by the sovereign debt crisis begin to bite next year.
 Marco Stringa of Deutsche Bank said Italy's data was ""in
line with his downbeat outlook on the Italian economy"" going
into 2011.
 ""Still, this doesn't compromise the fundamentally sound
outlook for Italy's public debt, which is the thing that really
matters at the moment,"" he added.
 On Dec. 14 Eurostat will issue aggregate data for the euro
zone as a whole. The median forecast in a Reuters survey
conducted prior to the latest national data pointed to a 1.3 per
cent monthly rise, following a 0.9 percent drop in September.
 On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, Italian output in
October was up 2.9 percent, compared to a 4.4 percent increase
in September.

 * But expectations of Chinese rate hike overwhelm
 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The euro was steady against the
dollar on Friday, staying soft on concerns over the sovereign
debt crisis in the euro zone while talk of the possibility of
more monetary tightening in China dampened appetite for risk.
 Strong Chinese export and import figures helped
commodity-linked currencies like the Australian dollar a little,
but gains were limited as the better data also increased the
risk of an interest rate hike.
 Sentiment towards the euro remained shaky, after Fitch
ratings agency slashed Ireland's rating by three notches to BBB+
on Thursday, pointing to the fiscal costs of restructuring.
 The euro was steady at $1.3239, staying above a low of
$1.3164 on trading platform EBS on Thursday, with traders saying
it was helped by reported demand from Middle East accounts
around $1.3220-30.
 ""The euro has held up surprisingly well given the poor news
coming out of Europe. Without further momentum in bad news we
are likely to see more consolidation,"" said Carl Hammer,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 He added that a rate hike in China would be negative for
risk appetite, but probably only in the short term as a strong
Chinese economy is still a positive for global growth.
 Ireland's government will seek parliamentary approval for an
85 billion euro IMF/EU rescue package next week, though there
were concerns about political infighting as the opposition
Labour Party pledged to vote against it.
 Traders say no end is in sight for the debt crisis with
European leaders now clashing over the idea of joint euro zone
bonds. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela
Merkel meet in Freiburg on Friday to prepare joint Franco-German
positions for next week's EU summit.
 The euro remains on a downward trend as intraday highs have
been getting lower since Monday.
 The next key target for the euro is seen at $1.3150,
followed by its 200-day moving average around $1.3115. Traders
said the euro may fall back to its December low of $1.2970 in
the coming weeks.

 DOLLAR DIPS
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, dipped 0.1 percent to
79.993, struggling to break through the 80.00-81.50 barrier that
capped its November rally.
 The dollar was off a high of 80.405 reached earlier this
week as healthy demand at a 30-year auction of U.S. Treasuries
on Thursday pushed U.S. yields down after a recent spike that
boosted the appeal of the greenback.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.9858, though
expectations of Chinese tightening kept the growth-linked
currency on a leash and it stayed away from Tuesday's 3-Â½ week
high of $0.9966.
 Traders said thin year-end volumes could make for a choppy
session.
 ""The market is getting thin, making prices moves susceptible
to big flows. This is a market where you shouldn't expect too
much logic,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank.
 Against the Japanese currency, the greenback was steady at
83.69 yen
 The greenback's repeated failure since late last month to
take out resistance around 84.40 yen is encouraging many traders
to take profits near that level, leading to expectations that
its 83.50-84.50 range will persist for now.
 ""There are heavy sell orders above 84 yen. As it's getting
difficult to build up new positions ahead of the Christmas
holidays, the dollar is unlikely to break above that resistance
unless there are further rises in U.S. bond yields,"" said a
Japanese bank trader in Tokyo.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2010 04:24AM ET</span>","FACTBOX-Top issues in India, China ties"," Dec 10 (Reuters) - India has seen China as a military
threat since its defeat in a 1962 war, but with both emerging
as uneven economic powers, New Delhi now fears Beijing will
use its massive clout to block its global ambitions. 
 Here is a list of issues that bedevil ties as Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao arrives in India on Wednesday for a 2-day
trip. [ID:nTOE6B400E]	
 
 ECONOMIC RIVALRY	
 China and India are scouring the globe -- from Asia to
Africa and Latin America -- to secure resources and food
supplies to keep powering their burgeoning economies, a
rivalry that is partly reshaping global business systems and
foreign policy priorities.	
 India is playing catch-up, trying to chip away at China's
decade-long head start in the race for resources. It trails
China, for instance, in Africa where Beijing's investments in
one country alone, Ghana, topped the entire Indian investment
in the continent in 2006.	
 
 TRADE	
 Despite decades of mistrust stemming in part from their
territorial rivalry, trade is booming and China is now India's
biggest trade partner. The value of bilateral deals is
expected to pass $60 billion next year, a 30-fold increase
since 2000, raising the stakes in maintaining peace. But the
balance of trade is heavily in China's favour. India's trade
deficit with China rose from $1 billion in 2001-2 to $16
billion in 2007-8, according to Indian central bank data.	
 No other country has initiated more anti-dumping
investigations with the World Trade Organisation against China
than India.	
 India has sought to diversify its trade basket, but raw
materials and other low-end commodities such as iron ore still
make up about 60 percent of India's exports to China. By
contrast, high-value manufactured goods form the bulk of
Chinese exports.	
 As an example of how India is still heavily dependent on
Chinese equipment, Chinese power equipment maker Shanghai
Electric Group Co. in late October agreed to sell
power equipment and related service contracts worth $8.29
billion to India's Reliance Power over a 10-year
period.	
 
 BORDER DISPUTE	
 While a new war is very unlikely, the unsettled border
between the world's two most populous countries remains the
biggest single impediment to better relations.	
 The Asian giants still claim vast swathes of each other's
territories along their 3,500 km (2,173 mile) Himalayan border
which has largely remained peaceful since a border war in 1962.	
 The border was never demarcated. In the years before
Indian independence in 1947, the former British colonial
rulers saw little need to demarcate such a remote area and
later the two sides were unable to agree on a common border.	
 India also says Beijing is illegally holding 5,180 sq km
of northern Kashmir ceded to it by Pakistan in 1963.	
 China claims 90,000 square km on the eastern sector of the
border. Historians have said China's claim on the eastern
sector was to use as a bargaining chip in order to keep
control of the strategically important region Aksai Chin.	
 
 DALAI LAMA	
 Beijing's longest running grudge with India is over its
granting of asylum to Tibetan leader Dalai Lama, who fled to
India in the 1950s following a failed uprising, setting off a
chain of events that eventually led to the war between India
and China. Beijing, which brands the Dalai Lama a separatist,
worries that Tibet's spiritual leader is using his base in the
northern hill town of Dharamsala to keep separatist fires alive.	
 Last year, China reacted angrily to New Delhi's decision
to allow the Dalai Lama to visit the border state of Arunachal
Pradesh disputed by China. For the first time in years, it
also criticised a visit by Prime Minister Singh to the state,
suggesting it was raising the stakes there.	
 The Dalai Lama is due to visit Sikkim, an Indian state on
the Chinese border, during Wen's visit, something that could
inflame tensions.	
 
 DIPLOMACY	
 Tensions between Asia's two rising powers have simmered
since their border war in 1962, but in recent years Beijing
and New Delhi have mostly managed to compartmentalise their
differences.	
 The relationship has matured to the point that while they
can jointly advocate for the interests of emerging economies
through forums such as the Group of 20 and climate talks,
India has the confidence to criticise Beijing's currency policy.	
 Still, India remains deeply wary of its bigger and more
powerful neighbour. China, a long-time ally of India's bitter
rival Pakistan, is feared to be encircling India in a ""string
of pearls"" by investing in its neighbours such as Sri Lanka
and Myanmar. Navy officials say increasing numbers of Chinese
ships are sailing just outside Indian waters, and the two
still spar over their disputed Himalayan border.	
 A Chinese decision to provide stapled visas to residents
of the disputed Indian Kashmir region has ruffled New Delhi 
which bristled at any suggestion that the Himalayan province
also claimed by Pakistan is not its territory.

 * Wen to travel to Pakistan after India	
 
 By Sui-Lee Wee and Krittivas Mukherjee	
 BEIJING/NEW DELHI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao faces a tough task when he arrives in India next week
to allay New Delhi's fears over China's rise as a global
power, and to smooth tensions in an often fractious
relationship.	
 Despite a boom in bilateral commerce in the past decade
and cooperation on global issues such as climate change, India
and China remain suspicious of each other's growing
international clout and influence.	
 ""The relationship is a mixture of third-world solidarity
and strategic rivalry. Those two elements are here to stay,""
said Jean Pierre Cabestan, an international relations
professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.	
 ""But India will need to balance China's growing power even
more tomorrow than today.""	
 Wen plans to spend Dec. 15-16 in New Delhi, after which he
will travel to Pakistan, India's closest rival, for another
two nights.	
 The growing economic interdependence between China and
India is likely to head Wen's agenda for the trip.	
 Analysts say he could announce more Chinese investments in
India or lower trade barriers to assuage the worries of Indian
politicians, peeved that the Sino-Indian trade balance is
heavily in China's favour.	
 
 
 
 India's deficit with China could reach $24-25 billion this
year, said Srikanth Kondapalli, head of East Asian studies at
Jahawarlal Nehru University.	
 The deficit rose to $16 billion in 2007-08, from $1
billion in 2001-02, according to Indian customs data.	
 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to press
Wen for reassurances that China will open its market wider,
especially in value-added sectors such as financial services
and information technology.	
 China is India's biggest trading partner, with bilateral
trade expected to pass $60 billion this year.
But even with greater market access, it is
likely to be a long time before India can close the trade gap.
""I don't see the deficit narrowing rapidly,""
said Dibyesh Anand, an international relations professor at
London's University of Westminster. ""Even if tariffs are
lowered on manufactured products, India can't compete with
China on manufactured products.""	
 
 TRADE IMBALANCE	
 India has sought to diversify its trade basket, but raw
materials and other low-end commodities such as iron ore still
make up about 60 percent of its exports to China.	
 In contrast, manufactured goods -- from trinkets to
turbines -- form the bulk of Chinese exports.
In an illustration of India's dependence on
Chinese manufacturing, Shanghai Electric Group Co
agreed in October to sell power equipment and related services
worth $8.3 billion to India's Reliance Power .
[ID:nSGE69S02V]	
 Even if India and China are the world's two largest
emerging economies, the development gap between them remains
large, due in part to a decade's head start for Chinese
economic reforms.
""India's at a phase of capital expenditure that
is 15 years behind China. That's just the way it is,"" said
Chetan Ahya, a Morgan Stanley economist in Singapore.	
 ""China also was importing a lot of capital goods in the
initial period of growth takeoff in the 1980s with periods of
trade deficit.""	
 India and China said in October that they would pursue a
free trade agreement, but talks could be protracted because
trade relations are overlaid with political and strategic rifts.	
 ""When it comes to economic ties, because there's a general
suspicion of Chinese motives in India, that would play into
the hands of those sceptical of China and probably filter down
into the Commerce Ministry,"" said Westminster University's
Anand .
""The trade deficit does not have a long-term
effect on relations,"" he added. ""But they want a scapegoat.
China is an easy one to blame because it is seen as a
political and military rival.""	

 GO-TO NEIGHBOUR
India and China have clashed repeatedly over a
raft of issues including their long-disputed border, China's
increasingly close relationship with Pakistan, and fears of
Chinese spying.	
 No other country has initiated more anti-dumping
investigations against China at the World Trade Organisation
than has India.	
 In May, India barred its mobile phone operators from
placing orders with China's Huawei Technologies and
ZTE Corp because of national security
concerns.	
 Still, both sides have something to gain from the
relationship.	
 ""The visit comes at a time when the Chinese are really
keen that the Indians do not become a fully fledged member of
the U.S. camp,"" said Manoj Joshi, the opinion editor of
India's Mail Today newspaper.	
 India needs Chinese backing for a permanent seat on the
U.N. Security Council and both countries have stood together
to resist Western demands in world trade and climate change
talks.
Singh is not expected to talk tough on China,
but this softer strategy could backfire at home. Indian
military officials have turned increasingly hawkish toward
China and are suspicious of China's intentions in the Indian
Ocean.	
 Nearly half a century after war broke out between them,
mistrust persists, especially over the 90,000 sq km (35,000
sq. miles) of land in Arunachal Pradesh state claimed by
Beijing.	
 China was incensed when the Dalai Lama visited the state
last year and saw it as proof of the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader's separatist machinations.
""I think the border dispute is still a festering
sore, which would continue to create disputes for the
relationship,"" said Pradeep Taneja, a lecturer in Asian
politics at the University of Melbourne. ""As long as the
nationalists on both sides continue to stir the pot, then any
settlement would not be easy.""

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday as
investors grew more confident about the prospect for economic
recovery following robust U.S. and Chinese data, while
Treasuries stabilised after a sell-off earlier in the week.
 Friday's data showed China's imports and exports were much
stronger than expected in November, providing robust numbers
that served as a reminder that Chinese demand was still growing
apace, boosting high-yielding currencies.
 China's central bank raised lenders' required reserves by 50
basis points but left interest rates on hold, which also allayed
investors' concerns that aggressive policy tightening could slow
China's growth down too much.
 ""In recent weeks people have been talking about the
possibility of a rate hike in China,"" said Niels Christensen,
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""Given they only announced a reserve requirement hike we are
seeing a bit of a relief rally as it has given a small boost to
risk appetite.""
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.15 percent while the
FTSEurofirst 300 index gained the same amount. U.S. stock
futures rose around a third of a percent, pointing to a firmer
open on Wall Street later.
 On Thursday, the benchmark S&P 500 index hit a two-year high
with data showing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell
more than expected last week.
 
 TREASURIES RECOVER
 U.S. Treasuries edged up thanks to a strong auction of
30-year bonds that reflected investor appetite. Treasuries sold
off heavily earlier in the week on U.S President Barack Obama's
plans to extend low tax rates. However, those plans hit some
opposition ahead of a Senate vote next week.
 Rising U.S. Treasury yields this week and growing inflation
concerns in developing economies -- together with the prospect
of tighter Chinese policy -- also encouraged investors to scale
back their already overstretched bets on emerging markets.
 Emerging stocks lost 0.1 percent, underperforming their
developed market counterparts.
 ""Data all suggest that further policy normalisation is
needed to keep China's economy on an even keel. So far, China
has made only modest moves in this direction,"" RBC said in a
note to clients.
 ""We expect to see more urgency from Beijing in the months
ahead as tackling inflation becomes a greater priority, with
both rate hikes and currency appreciation likely to be
employed.""
 Ten-year Treasuries were up 8/32 in price to yield 3.185
percent, off a six-month high of 3.330 percent reached on
Wednesday.
 The sale of $13 billion of reopened 30-year U.S. bonds went
through at a yield below the level trading on the open market,
indicating investors bid aggressively for the debt, with strong
demand particularly from foreign buyers.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies, while the euro was steady at $1.3235.
 U.S. crude oil rose 0.4 percent to $88.75 a barrel. The bund
futures were steady.

(Updates with increase in bank reserve requirements)	
 By Zhou Xin and Kevin Yao	
 BEIJING, Dec 10 (Reuters) - China's central bank on Friday
raised the amount of money that lenders must keep on reserve
for the third time in one month, following a spate of robust
data that raised the case for policy tightening.	
 The latest step to raise the reserve requirement ratio
(RRR), aimed at mopping up excess cash in the economy, had
been widely expected after Beijing announced a shift to a
""prudent"" monetary policy from the previous ""moderately loose""
stance earlier this month.	
 The move came after China reported strong trade figures
for November, which could fuel fresh criticism of Beijing's
exchange rate regime, and before data on Saturday that is
expected to show another pick up in inflation, already running
at its fastest clip in more than two years.	
 ""There is still much scope for the central bank to raise
reserve ratios next year -- we expect several increases in in
the first quarter of next year and the ratio should reach as
high as 23 percent in 2011,"" said Lu Zhengwei, chief economist
at Industrial Bank in Shanghai.	
 ""As for whether the central bank will raise interest
rates, I think it will largely depend on the CPI figure in the
coming months.""	
 The 50 basis point increase, which takes effect on Dec 20,
leaves the reserve requirement ratio at 18.5 percent, a record
high for the majority of the country's banks.	
 
 China's stock markets could find some comfort in the
central bank's decision to raise required reserves, as it
could suggest a rise in interest rates could be postponed
somewhat.	
 The country's stock markets have shed more than 10 percent
over the past month on concerns that the government would
ratchet up its monetary policy tightening in the face of
rising inflation.	
 
 STRONG DATA	
 Reflecting the challenge facing policymakers, data on
Friday showed China's imports and exports jumped in November,
bank lending topped forecasts and property investment powered
ahead.	
 The robust data also offered a double-hit of good news for
the global economy: a reminder that Chinese demand was still
growing apace and an indication that the U.S. and European
recoveries were picking up steam.	
 China has been slow to tighten monetary policy this year,
partly for fear of a double-dip recession in the developed
world where the United States and Europe are struggling to
recover from the global economic crisis.	
 With inflation running at its fastest clip in more than
two years, analysts are looking for the world's second-largest
economy to unleash a more aggressive mix of rate rises,
currency appreciation, lending restrictions and higher reserve
requirements for banks.	
 ""Reserve requirement hikes aren't going to prove totally
sufficient in dealing with overall inflation. Monetary
tightening by year-end is inevitable, I wouldn't rule it out
in very near term,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist
at CIBC.	
 November imports rose 37.7 percent from a year earlier to
easily top forecasts for a 24.2 percent increase, powered by
China's voracious appetite for commodities.	
 Chinese imports have developed a habit over the past two
years of surprising on the upside. In that respect, the 34.9
percent jump in exports, above market expectations for a 22.0
percent increase, was the bigger surprise.	
 Evidence for that view was in the fact that shipments of
final goods to markets such as Europe and the United States
outstripped those of intermediate goods to Asia.	
 Exports to the United States were up 32.2 percent, while
shipments to the European Union, its biggest trading partner,
climbed 33.8 percent. [ID:nTOE6B903A]	
 
 PRESSURE ON YUAN	
 The rise in exports left China with a hefty surplus of
$22.9 billion in November, the seventh straight month of
impressive trade performance. During that stretch, its average
surplus has been $22.2 billion.	
 That could fuel fresh criticism of China's exchange rate
regime. The United States and Europe say that an undervalued
currency gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage in global
markets.	
 Even without criticism, rising inflation in China could
put upward pressure on the yuan.	
 Chinese consumer price inflation may have hit 5.1 percent
in the year to November, a 28-month high, state media reported
on Friday. That would mark a sharp pick up from 4.4 percent in
October.[ID:nTOE6B900S]	
 China's wide M2 measure of money supply rose 19.5 percent
in November from a year earlier, while banks extended 564
billion yuan in new local currency loans in November, the
central bank said. Both numbers were slightly ahead of
expectations.	
 Banks have already just about hit the 7.5 trillion yuan
loan quota set by the government at the start of the year.	
 China's leaders on Friday opened the three-day Central
Economic Work Conference, a gathering where they will set the
policy direction for next year.

 By Robin Paxton and Maria Gordeyeva
 ALMATY, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Economic growth in Kazakhstan
should accelerate to around 6 percent in 2012, a senior IMF
official said, provided banks can shed problematic loans that
are stifling plans to diversify Central Asia's largest economy.
 Ana Lucia Coronel, International Monetary Fund division
chief for the Middle East and Central Asia, told Reuters in an
interview she expected the Kazakh tenge to strengthen next year
after the government restores the currency to a managed float.
 ""The main message is the need to restore the health of the
financial system. It's the only way of financing the
diversification of the economy, encouraging domestic demand and
getting sustainable growth in the medium term,"" Coronel said.
 Kazakhstan's resource-driven economy, among the first and
hardest hit by the global financial crisis, has rebounded this
year in line with higher oil prices . Several banks have
also completed billion-dollar debt restructuring programmes.
The IMF forecasts that Kazakhstan's gross domestic product
(GDP) will rise 5.4 percent this year. Oil revenues will be the
main driver of next year's growth of between 4.5 percent and 5.0
percent, Coronel said. Banks could play a bigger role from 2012.
""We don't see a strong revival of domestic demand in 2011.
There's going to be some recovery, but not much,"" said Coronel,
an Ecuadorian based at the IMF's Washington headquarters.
 ""As the banking system stabilises in 2012, we are going to
see a slightly higher rate of growth, probably close to 6
percent.""
 Kazakhstan's banks, said Coronel, were still ""vulnerable""
despite ample liquidity in the sector and progress in attracting
short-term, tenge-denominated deposits. She predicted flat or
negative credit growth this year.
 This chimes with previous forecasts given to Reuters by the

 ""Even though provisioning levels are high, the banks are not
willing to take much risk because there are uncertainties,"" she
said.
 She said this would stall government plans to diversify the
economy, which continues to rely heavily on the oil revenues
that contribute around 60 percent of Kazakhstan's export income.
 ""If the banks don't solve these problems, they are not going
to be willing to lend, and if corporations are highly indebted
and cannot pay their debts, they are not going to embark on any
new projects.""
 
 STRONGER TENGE
 To aid recovery, Kazakhstan should make it easier for banks
to write off non-performing loans, Coronel said. Non-performing
loans now account for 26 percent of all loans in Kazakhstan.
Authorities are already considering a plan to exempt banks
from paying tax on bad loans in an attempt to encourage them to
write down losses and improve transparency. [ID:nLDE67A0VL]
 Coronel said the IMF welcomed the central bank's intention
to return the tenge  to a managed float from March 2011,
removing a trading corridor first adopted in February 2009 after
the currency was devalued by 18 percent. [ID:nLDE6B6024]
 ""It's consistent with the advice that we have been giving
... that a move to more exchange rate flexibility is the right
thing to do in this country,"" she said.
 ""There is a large trade surplus, sufficient foreign direct
investment. The debt of the country is now manageable after the
restructuring. And the oil price is high. All of these are
factors supporting a stronger tenge.""

381,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2010 02:32AM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-Gjensidige's Norway listing raises nearly $2 bln," * Owner sells 40 pct stake in IPO including over-allotment
 * CEO eyes expansion outside domestic market
 * IPO valuation puts Gjensidige below peers' book value 

(Adds CEO, quotes, background) 
 By Victoria Klesty and Kylie MacLellan 
 OSLO/LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The owner of Norway's
Gjensidige is to raise up to 11.8 billion crowns ($2 billion)
from the sale of a 40 percent stake in the insurer, Norway's
largest flotation in nearly a decade.
 It is the second large Scandinavian offering in as many days
to defy the recent market turbulence that has knocked several
euro zone IPOs off track, after the private equity owners of
Denmark's TDC raised up to $3.7 billion on Thursday through a
share buyback and public offering.
 ""There were around seven (European) IPOs running about 10
days ago, five got withdrawn or postponed ... which made it
quite a tricky backdrop,"" said a source close to the deal.
 Mutually owned Gjensidige priced its shares at 59 Norwegian
crowns, the mid-point of its narrowed 58 to 60 crown guidance
range. In total it would be selling just under 200 million
shares if a 10 percent over-allotment option is exercised.
 The over-allotment would take the size of the offer to 11.8
million crowns, from a base deal of 10.7 billion.
 Investors were attracted by the relatively high dividend
yield of the two offers, those involved said, with TDC yielding
8.5 percent at its offer price, and Gjensidige yielding 6.3
percent.
 As well as domestic demand, good interest came from the
United States, a second source close to the deal said, with
investors drawn by the stability of the Scandinavian region at a
time when the euro zone is beset by sovereign debt worries.
 FURTHER CONSOLIDATION 
 Gjensidige Chief Executive Helge Leiro Baastad told Reuters
the company aims to grow its business outside Norway and also
expects further consolidation in the local insurance market.
 The company, which has a strong position on its home market,
has a share of just 1.2 percent in Sweden and 6.2 percent in
Denmark. It estimates its overall share of the Baltic market is
just above 9 percent.
 ""We know there are synergies across the borders,"" he said,
adding Gjensidige's expansion into Denmark had proven that point
to investors.
 The Gjensidige Foundation, which owned the company ahead of
the IPO, has said it will hold most of the proceeds from the
sale as a ""war chest"" to use in any future share issues by the
company, so it can retain the size of its holding.
 Gjensidige's shares traded up slightly at 59.25 crowns by
1131 GMT, having earlier dipped below the listing price -- a
move several analysts was likely down to Norwegian retail
investors, who bought 28 percent of the shares on offer,
flipping IPO shares they purchased at a discount.
 The Gjensidige IPO, the largest in Norway since Statoil's
in 2001 and the last big European flotation this year, values
the company at 29.5 billion crowns.
 Gjensidige's equity had a book value of 22.06 billion crowns
at the end of the third quarter. The IPO values it at 1.33 times
this amount, a Reuters calculation showed.
 Finnish insurer Sampo trades at 1.48 times its third-quarter
book value, while Denmark's Tryg trades at close to 1.65 times
book value.
 Some see the Gjensidige IPO as a way for the company to
pursue mergers and acquisitions, perhaps including a tie-up with
Norway's Storebrand. Gjensidige is Storebrand's largest
shareholder, with a 24.3 percent stake.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs were joint
bookrunners on the offer.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2010 01:40AM ET</span>",FOREX-Euro finds some solace but still looks shaky," * Euro on hold but looks weak on charts
 * Strong Chinese trade data marginally helps risk currencies
 * But expectations of Chinese rate hike overwhelm
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The euro gained some reprieve on
Friday, but fears of more problems emerging from the euro zone's
fiscal mess and doubts over whether U.S. bond yields have peaked
kept traders cautious of chasing it higher.
 Strong Chinese export and import figures provided commodity
currencies such as the Australian dollar with a minor lift, but
expectations of a rate hike by Chinese authorities as soon as
this weekend kept buying to a minimum.
 The euro had edged up 0.1 percent on the day to $1.3250,
extending its rebound from a low of $1.3164 on trading platform
EBS on Thursday.
 Still, the currency's intraday highs have been getting lower
since Monday, normally a sign of an imminent move down. Traders
say no end is in sight for the debt crisis with European leaders
now clashing over the idea of joint euro zone bonds.
 ""I still think the bias is for the dollar to rise in general.
U.S. bond markets seem to have calmed down for now. But if we
have strong U.S. data on retail sales and so on, their yields
could easily rise again,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage
house.
 The next key target for the euro is seen at $1.3150, followed
by its 200-day moving average around $1.3115. Traders said the
euro may fall back to its December low of $1.2970 in the coming
weeks.
 ""Short-term risks remain to the downside for the euro because
the peripheral problems remain unresolved,"" said Paul Robinson, a
strategist at Barclays Capital.
 Fitch became the first ratings agency to strip Ireland of its
A credit status on Thursday, slashing it by three notches to
BBB+, pointing to the fiscal costs of restructuring.
 Ireland's government will also seek parliamentary approval
for an 85 billion euro ($113 billion) IMF/EU rescue package next
week.
 While the downgrade did not help the euro, the currency's
rebound from its low suggested problems in Ireland may no longer
be having a major impact on the euro, as traders shift focus to
the bigger economies in the euro zone such as Spain, market
players said.
 CHOPPY SESSION
 Thin year-end volumes are likely to make for a choppy
session, traders said.
 ""The market is getting thin, making prices moves susceptible
to big flows. This is a market where you shouldn't expect too
much logic,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, slipped about 0.15 percent
to 79.93, struggling to break through the 80.00-81.50 barrier
that capped its November rally.
 Against the Japanese currency, the greenback last dipped to
83.69 yen, not far off Thursday's low of 83.51 yen on EBS plumbed
following the 30-year Treasury auction, which showed healthy
foreign demand for the longer-dated U.S. debt.
 The dollar's 14-day, 21-day and 90-day moving averages as
well as the ichimoku tenkan line are all clustered around
83.40-60, making the area a strong support level.
 But the greenback's repeated failure since late last month to
take out resistance around 84.40 is encouraging many traders to
take profits near that level, leading to expectations that its
83.50-84.50 range will persist for now.
 ""There are heavy sell orders above 84 yen. As it's getting
difficult to build up new positions ahead of the Christmas
holidays, the dollar is unlikely to break above that resistance
unless there are further rises in U.S. bond yields,"" said a
Japanese bank trader.
 Market player may be taking profits from gains in cross/yen
this month, capping the dollar/yen amid speculation the Chinese
central bank could raise rates to curb inflation.
 Fuelling those expectations, China moved forward the release
of November economic data, including the closely watched
inflation figures, to Saturday from Monday.
 ""The possibility of a Chinese rate hike is an obstacle for
the dollar/yen to test 85 yen,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief
economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 Expectations of Chinese tightening also kept the
growth-linked Australian dollar on a leash.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.15 percent to $0.9857 helped by
data showing growth in both Chinese imports and exports beat
expectations in November.
 But the currency kept some distance from Tuesday's 3-Â½ week
high of $0.9966.

 * Company expects to source more products from outside China
 HONG KONG, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Global consumer goods exporter
Li & Fung Ltd expects prices of products sourced in China to rise
at least 10 percent in the first half of next year as costs
continue to escalate, a senior executive told Reuters Insider.
 ""If prices are up now, depending on category, anywhere
between 10 to 30 percent, that's really the range ... I see that
continuing in the first half of next year,"" President Bruce
Rockowitz told Insider TV.
 ""(Prices) can go up another 10 percent to 15 percent to 20
percent ... in the first half of the year. In the second half of
the year, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen,"" he said.
 Wages would continue to go climb, and not just in China, he
said, adding that the cost of cotton could come down next year as
supply increases.
 ""This is the most dramatic time we've ever seen in (terms of)
the rise of the cost of goods. I mean, this huge cost inflation
in the system -- and it's not just wages going up, it's also all
of the commodities,"" he said.
 SEES MORE SOURCING OUTSIDE CHINA
 Li & Fung, which supplies U.S. retailers such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc and Target Corp, is diversifying sourcing to
lower-cost Chinese cities and other emerging markets.
 ""We're definitely diversifying ... places like Vietnam,
Bangladesh, Indonesia are growing dramatically,"" Rockowitz said.
""We're also moving away from the coast, especially the southern
coast of China, into the interior of China.""
 Li & Fung, which has started to make settlements in yuan as
the Chinese currency has risen considerably over the last six
months, would be making more settlements in yuan as more
producers were willing to accept payments in the local currency,
he added.
 The exporter has previously said that the low-cost era in
China is likely over and it aims to switch its sourcing focus to
inland regions of the country.
 Shares of Li & Fung were down 1.3 percent at the midday
trading break on Friday, compared with a 0.7 percent fall in the
Hang Seng Index.

(Updates with Japan stocks close, European openings)	
 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell on
Friday after a rise to a seven-month high earlier in the day
prompted profit taking, although they outperformed the rest of
Asia this week, while U.S. Treasuries steadied on the view
yields had risen too high, too quickly.	
 European shares rose for the fifth straight session, with
the FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 percent and London's FTSE
100 0.3 percent firmer. U.S. stock index futures
 were up 0.2 percent. 
 With 2010 almost over, investors were reluctant to throw
much money into any single trade now that a big selloff in
Treasuries had died down and opted instead to take profits on
small positions in thin trading volumes.	
 Whether China would raise interest rates this year,
perhaps even this weekend, was on investor radar screens as
they assess risk taking, especially after a state-run
newspaper said inflation may have hit 5.1 percent in November.
[ID:nTOE6B900S]	
 Tighter policies in China and other emerging markets
though have already been factored into economic and market
forecasts for 2011, a year in which some strategists favour
riskier assets such as stocks, commodities and credit, but not
government bonds.	
 ""The environment looks quite favourable for equities now,
but as we proceed through 2011 investors need to be alert to a
change,"" Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays Capital,
said in a statement.	
 ""Overstretched valuations may provide that signal, as
might central banks in emerging market countries as they pull
back from extremely supportive policies over the course of
2011.""	
 Japan's Nikkei share average finished 0.7 percent lower
after briefly touching its highest level since May 14,
with investors concerned for a second day that share prices
have been pushed up too quickly without any fundamental news
to support the move.	
 ""On top of profit-taking and overheating of the market,
some foreign investors are unloading positions and hedging
ahead of the Christmas break,"" said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief
equity marketing officer at Tokai Tokyo Securities in Tokyo.	
 In the MSCI Japan index, the financials and materials
sectors were the top performing sectors in the week, returning
2.7 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.	
 The broader TOPIX index was up 1 percent this
week, exceeding the 0.2 percent fall of the MSCI index of Asia
Pacific stocks outside of Japan .	
 The MSCI index fell 0.3 percent on Friday, with the
biggest losses in the consumer discretionary sector, one of
the top performing segments of the market this year.	
 
 SMALL SIGNS OF TRACTION	
 The U.S. Treasury market cooled after global investors
sold mid to longer-maturity bonds earlier in the week on news
the White House proposed a payroll tax holiday that some
analysts and fund managers reckon could boost growth next year
as much as a full percentage point.	
 The March 10-year U.S. Treasury future was up around 9/32
, while the cash 10-year note yield was down 2 basis
points on the day at 3.19 percent . 
 The yield has jumped 40 basis points so far in December,
putting it on track for the biggest monthly increase since
December 2009 when yields rose 64 basis points.	
 Pacific Investment Management Co, which runs the world's
biggest bond fund, has revised its U.S. growth forecast for
next year in light of the tax-cut compromise.

dealers comfortable keeping the currency tight to a downward
trend line despite overnight news that Fitch Ratings
downgraded Ireland's sovereign debt rating. [ID:nLDE6B81AH]	
 ""The euro reacted well to the Fitch news on Ireland and
that really tells you that maybe this story is too well known
and traders don't really want to sell it,"" said Robert Rennie,
chief currency strategist at Westpac Bank in Sydney.	
 The euro was still in a down trend after hitting a 9-month
high in early November and down 7.5 percent so far this year.
However, for all the worries over the euro zone fiscal crisis,
the currency is expected to fall only roughly two cents in 12
months to $1.3050, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices
recovered on Thursday from a sharp sell-off earlier in the
week, supporting equity markets, but the euro fell after a
rating agency's downgrade of Ireland revived concerns about
the euro-zone debt crisis.
 Bargain-hunters bought Treasuries again after the 10-year
note's yield reached a six-month high of 3.33 percent on
Wednesday. Strong demand in Thursday's auction of 30-year
bonds also helped dismiss fears that investors had lost
confidence in U.S. government debt.
 ""A great, great auction to end the week and the recent
outperformance in 30-years was a strong hint that buyers
lurked,"" said William O'Donnell, head of U.S. Treasury
strategy at RBS Securities Inc in New York.
 Other strategists anticipate Treasuries will rally into
year-end. The benchmark 10-year note  rose 16/32 in
price, with the yield at 3.213 percent. The 30-year bond
 jumped almost 1 full point in price, taking its
yield down to 4.40 percent.
 The vote of confidence in U.S. government debt took some
pressure off equity markets, but Asia still looked set for a
tepid start, with Japan's Nikkei futures  traded in
Chicago falling 30 points to 10,250.
 ""The stock market has been looking at the rise in yields,""
said Burt White, managing director at LPL Financial in Boston.
""It was a little bit of a sigh that the auction went a little
better than anticipated and we're not going to see a continued
surge in bond yields because that, over time, would end up
being a negative.""
 Stocks got a lift from U.S. jobless claims, which fell
more than expected in the latest week. But resistance from
Democratic leaders to the extension of Bush-era tax cuts
weighed on the market. [ID:nN09222654]
 The plan to extend tax cuts for two years, agreed to by

IMF/EU bailout package when it is put before parliament for
approval next week.
 ""Word the Irish Labour Party will vote against the bailout
sent us down here to test the lows. Some longs are dumping

 The European single currency was also hurt by Fitch's

BBB-plus. [ID:nLDE6B81AH]
 The euro  tumbled to session lows around $1.3169 and

406,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2010 06:04PM ET</span>",Ex-WikiLeaks staff to launch rival site-report," * Protest over Assange
 * Short-term goal to complete infrastructure
 
 STOCKHOLM, Dec 9 (Reuters) - A group of former WikiLeaks
collaborators who quit the project are to launch a new
campaigning site next week to protest against its founder, a
Swedish newspaper said on Thursday.
 Respected daily Dagens Nyheter said the decision was made to
launch the site, Openleaks, in protest against Julian Assange.
It did not elaborate.
 ""Our long-term goal is to build a strong, transparent
platform to support whistleblowers, both in terms of technology
and politics, while at the same time encouraging others to start
similar projects,"" the newspaper quoted a source connected to
the new site as saying.
 The report, headlined ""'New WikiLeaks' rebels against
Assange"", said the person wished to remain anonymous.
 Unusually, the newspaper printed the article in both English
and Swedish on the front page of its website, www.dn.se .
 The source said a short-term goal was to complete the
technical infrastructure and ensure that ""the organisation
continues to be democratically governed by all its members,
rather than limited to one group or individual"", an apparent
reference to Assange's leading role at WikiLeaks.
 Assange, who was remanded in custody in Britain after an
arrest warrant issued in Sweden over accusations of sexual
misconduct, has been the public face of WikiLeaks.
 The WikiLeaks site has attracted international attention in
the past two weeks with leaks of secret U.S. diplomatic cables,
angering Washington.
 The newspaper also said it had documents which showed
discontent within WikiLeaks and that accessibility issues with
the site earlier this year had been arranged by insiders as a
signal for Assange to step back.
 The report said that though the new website was also aimed
at providing the means for whistleblowers to publish
information, it would not itself publish information directly.
 Instead, other organisations would access the Openleaks
system and then present their audience with the material.
 Documents would be processed and published by various
collaborating groups such as the media, non-profit
organisations, trade unions or other groups.
 ""As a result of our intention not to publish any document
directly and in our own name, we do not expect to experience the
kind of political pressure which WikiLeaks is under at this
time,"" the report quoted another person as saying.
 ""In that aspect, it is quite interesting to see how little
of politicians' anger seems directed at the newspapers using
WikiLeaks sources,"" the person said.

 * Traders continue to eye bond yields
 * Euro to retest $1.30 as Spain remains a concern
(Adds comment, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Thursday and looked set to retest the key $1.30 level
after a ratings agency downgraded Ireland's sovereign debt and
as investors waited for a parliamentary vote on a rescue
package for the debt-laden country.
 The dollar dropped against the yen as Treasury yields fell
after a solid 30-year bond sale, though analysts said the
higher trend for the pair stays intact on expectations yields
will continue rising into the end of the year.
 Ireland's Labor Party earlier said it would vote against a
85 billion euro IMF/EU bailout package when it comes before
parliament next week, but two independent MPs said they would
support the package, signaling its likely passage. For details,
see [ID:nLDE6B81XS]
 ""The sovereign issues in the euro zone are continuing.
There are a lot of headline risks for the euro coming out,""
said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 Fitch became the first ratings agency to strip Ireland of
its A credit status on Thursday, slashing it by three notches
to BBB+, pointing to the fiscal costs of restructuring.
 The euro last traded 0.1 percent lower at $1.3241
, after hitting a session low of $1.3164 on trading
platform EBS. The next key target is $1.3150, followed by its
200-day moving average around $1.3115. Traders see the euro
falling back to its December low of $1.2970 in coming weeks.

 Many analysts said that regardless of the outcome in
Ireland, the euro is likely remain under pressure as market
participants continue to focus on debt problems in other euro
bloc countries, especially Spain, whose economy accounts for
nearly 12 percent of euro-wide gross domestic product.
 ""Spain is a much, much bigger problem than Greece, Ireland
and Portugal all put together,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, macro
strategist at Fulcrum Asset Management LLP in London. Fulcrum
oversees about $900 million in assets.
 ""The banking sector is the pivotal issue as a lot of the
government debt is owned by the country's banking sector. A
potential government failure will imply a major hit onto bank
balance sheets,"" he added.
 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 A rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the last two sessions,
which sent Treasury debt prices into their sharpest fall in
nearly two years, has boosted the dollar against the yen on the
view the proposed tax cut extension would spur growth.
 ""In the short term, the U.S. dollar will continue to be
supported because the tax cut measures announced are pretty
much a fiscal stimulus,"" said Gkionakis. ""It may also imply
that the Fed may act less decisively to try to push yields
lower if the economy is doing better.""
 The dollar slipped 0.5 percent to 83.63 yen , after
hitting a session low of 83.51 yen following the Treasury
auction. [ID:nN09493895]
 Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank said the sharp uptick in bond
yields and volatility has been met with subdued equity
volatility and a similarly retrained FX reaction. ""All this
suggests the positive risk trade is still intact, albeit traded
with typical light year-end positioning,"" he said.
 Daragh Maher, FX strategist at Credit Agricole, argued the
correlation between currencies -- particularly the euro, yen
and Australian dollar -- and movements in two-year yield
differentials were stronger than for 10-year yields.
 The two-year yield has risen less than 15 basis points this
week, much less than the 10-year yield, as the short end of the
yield curve has been anchored by expectations the Federal
Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon.
 ""For interest rates to gain greater traction on FX, the
shorter end has to move, and we're not seeing that yet,"" Maher
said.

reimburse Britain and the Netherlands for compensating savers
with online Icesave accounts operated by collapsed Icelandic
bank Landsbanki.
 Following are some key facts on the dispute:

 THE NEW DEAL:
 * Iceland will repay around $5 billion owed to Britain and
the Netherlands.
 * It will pay a fixed interest rate of 3.0 percent on the
money it owes to the Netherlands, and will pay a rate of 3.3
percent on the money owed to Britain, according to the Dutch
Finance Ministry.
 * Payments will start in July 2016 and repayment cannot
extend beyond Jan. 1, 2046.
 * Annual amount paid by Iceland cannot be lower than 1.3
percent of Iceland's GDP, but capped at 5 percent of government
revenues.
 * Deal will be final once Iceland's parliament and president
approve.
 
 THE COLLAPSE:
 * Iceland's banks expanded aggressively overseas during the
global credit boom, taking their balance sheets to almost 11
times the island's annual economic output, and became an emblem
of the decade's excesses when the bubble burst.
 * All three of Iceland's top banks collapsed within days of
each other when global credit dried up in 2008, leaving them
unable to sustain their heavy debt burdens.
 * Iceland took over the banks' domestic operations and
compensated Icelandic savers for lost money, but savers in other
countries with Icelandic accounts were left out in the cold.
 * Around 400,000 savers in Britain and the Netherlands had
accounts with Landsbanki when it collapsed.
 * Britain and the Netherlands compensated individual savers
who lost money in full. Iceland agreed to pay this money back to
the two countries, but settling the terms has proved tough.
 
 DEBTS:
 * Iceland owes Britain a maximum 2.35 billion pounds ($3.75
billion) and the Netherlands 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion),
plus interest. The final amount depends on how much money is
recovered from the sale of assets owned by Landsbanki. Iceland
has said the assets may cover all or nearly all the claims.
 WHY IT MATTERS:
 * The country is receiving aid from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and from Nordic neighbours. The IMF has
promised more than $2 billion and Sweden, Finland, Norway and
Denmark pledged some $2.5 billion. But it will be difficult for
the country to return to the international financial fold until
the size of the government's debt burden becomes clear. 
 * A deal on Icesave will help clear the way for the country
to remove capital controls, imposed at the height of the crisis.
The capital controls have held back investments and growth in
the North Atlantic island nation as foreign investors stay on
the sidelines and Icelandic firms remain effectively without
access to overseas capital.
 * The left-leaning government of the Social Democrats pushed
through an agreement on Icesave in December 2009. But Icelanders
rejected the deal in a referendum in March 2010. The issue has
hurt the government's popularity and the effects of an austerity
programme related the IMF deal has further eroded its standing
with voters. A deal which reduces the burden on taxpayers could
boost the government's standing in opinion polls.
 * Iceland started European Union accession talks in the
summer, but a deal over Icesave has been widely seen as crucial
for the country to attain membership. The EFTA Surveillance
Authority, a European trade body overseeing Iceland's
cooperation with the EU, warned Iceland in May it should pay up
or face possible court proceedings.
 With the Icesave issue solved, fishing rights will become
the main stumbling block to EU entry.

 * Factory output subdued but boost from households seen
 * Rates seen on hold for now
 * C/Act deficit wider on lower receipts
 
 By Phumza Macanda
 PRETORIA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - South Africa's spending growth
quickened in the third quarter and manufacturing output growth
was higher than expected, hinting at a steady recovery that may
negate the need for further monetary stimulus.
 Should the growth outlook of key trading partner the
eurozone deteriorate though, it would undermine domestic
recovery and make the central bank's next rate verdict a tough
one on Jan. 20.
 For now, analysts are of the view that rates do not need to
fall further after Reserve Bank data showed household spending
grew at an annualised 5.9 percent in Q3 from 4.9 percent
previously, as household finances improved, partly aided by
lower interest rates.
 The Reserve Bank has reduced interest rates by a cumulative
650 basis points since December 2008 to help lift the economy.
 ""With interest rates at their lowest levels since 1973, the
Monetary Policy Committee will probably believe that they have
loosened policy sufficiently,"" said Nedbank in a note.
 ""As a result, we believe that rates are likely to remain on
hold throughout next year and into the early part of 2012.""
 Household spending was expected to increase further on the
back of lower borrowing costs. This demand should also boost the
manufacturing sector, which was hit hard by a global slowdown.
 Statistics South Africa said factory output growth quickened
to a higher-than-forecast 2.5 percent year-on-year in October,
suggesting the beleaguered sector was on a steady recovery.
Current levels of growth are weak partly due to a strong
rand currency that has appreciated by around 28 percent against
the dollar since the start of 2009.
 ""(The data) is still a reflection of the troubles of the
manufacturing sector having to deal with a strong rand exchange
rate (and) global and local economic recovery seems to be still
hesitant,"" said Elize Kruger, economist at Kadd Capital.
 The strong rand has hurt South Africa's exports, a third of
which go to the euro zone. Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus
said on Wednesday the austerity measures in that region were
particularly concerning for local growth.[ID:nLDE6B70TR]
 ""An intensification of Europe's woes, which adversely
affects South Africa's growth prospects, could still prompt
further easing,"" Nedbank said.
 
 CURRENT ACCOUNT WIDER
 In its quarterly bulletin, the central bank also said the
current account deficit widened in the third quarter mainly on
lower tourist receipts after a previous boost from the soccer
World Cup hosted from June to July.
 The current account shortfall was at 3.0 percent of GDP in
Q3 from 2.5 percent in the second quarter, the central bank said
in its latest quarterly bulletin on Thursday.
 The surplus on the trade balance ballooned to 32.4 billion
rand as terms of trade improved but it was offset by a wider
deficit on the income, services and current transfer account of
111.6 billion rand ($16.22 billion).
 ""The net result of these two offsetting trends was a
slightly wider deficit on the current account of the balance of
payments in the third quarter,"" the Bank said.
 The gap was financed by portfolio inflows, most notably into
the bond market as large amounts of capital flowed into South
Africa and other emerging economies.
 ""With capital flows to emerging-market countries likely to
persist for some time ... governments of recipient economies are
faced with the challenge of dealing with such flows and their
impact on exchange rates, sectoral profitability and resource
allocation,"" the central bank said.
 Although company profits remain under pressure, industry is
cautiously optimistic. A survey by the South African Chamber of
Commerce and Industry's showed business confidence index rising
by 1.1 points to 87.0 in November from 85.9 in October.
 ""We remain comfortable with our view that steadily rising
levels of domestic demand and improving business and consumer
confidence should auger well for companies...,"" Absa Capital
said in a note, adding rates are likely to remain on hold next
year.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Thursday and looked set to retest the key $1.30 level
after a ratings agency downgraded Ireland's sovereign debt
rating as an opposition party there earlier said it would vote
against a bailout package for the debt-laden country.
 Heightened worries about Ireland's debt crisis and the risk
of contagion to other vulnerable economies in the euro zone
pushed the euro as low as $1.3160. Traders see the euro falling
back to its December low of $1.2970 in the coming weeks.
 Ireland's Labor Party earlier said it would vote against a
85 billion euro IMF/EU rescue deal when it comes before
parliament next week, raising concerns about Ireland's ability
to service and redeem outstanding debt. But two independent MPs
said they would support the package, signaling its likely
passage.
 ""Word the Irish Labour Party will vote against the bailout
sent us down here to test the lows. Some longs are dumping
euros here,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey. ""It's a question of people worrying
about sovereign default risk, which is bad for the euro.""
 Fitch's move to cut its rating for Ireland, which secured
an emergency European Union bailout last month, also weighed on
the euro.
 The euro last traded 0.4 percent lower at $1.3209, after
hitting a session low of $1.3164 on trading platform EBS.
 Dolan said traders will target $1.3150 next, ""and the big
level below that is the 200-day moving average of $1.3110.""

 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the last two
sessions -- which sent Treasury debt prices into their sharpest
fall in nearly two years -- has boosted the dollar against the
yen and euro on the view the economy is gaining traction.
 A larger-than-expected decline in weekly claims for
first-time U.S. jobless benefits added to that view.
 Some analysts, however, feared the extension of Bush-era
tax cuts that sparked the bond sell-off would swell the budget
deficit and stoke inflation.
 Commonwealth Foreign Exchange analyst Omer Esiner said that
if U.S. growth falters in the months ahead, that would renew
the focus on an ""already perilous fiscal position"" and cause
investors to ""abandon U.S. assets across the board.""
 Analysts said investors were wary of taking on big
positions as liquidity dries up toward year end, and this was
why the dollar's rise had been limited compared with the jump
in Treasury yields.
 The dollar index has risen only 0.7 percent this week while
the 10-year U.S. yield has soared around 25 basis points.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 83.80 Japanese yen as
U.S. bond yields eased, while strong employment data lifted the
Australian dollar 0.4 percent to $0.9822.
 Daragh Maher, FX strategist at Credit Agricole argued the
correlation between currencies -- particularly the euro, yen
and Australian dollar -- and movements in two-year yield
differentials were stronger than for 10-year yields.
 The two-year yield has risen less than 15 basis points so
far this week, much less than the 10-year yield, as the short
end of the yield curve has been anchored by expectations the
Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates any time
soon.
""For interest rates to gain greater traction on FX, the
shorter end has to move, and we're not seeing that yet,"" Maher
said.

support all efforts to make that happen,"" Obama said at a
meeting of his Export Council of advisers. ""Welcoming Russia to
the WTO would be good for them, but it would also be good for
us and good for the global economy.""
 Russia's $1.2 trillion economy is the largest outside the
WTO. Its goal is to join by the end of next year.
 The World Bank has estimated its entry could increase
Russia's gross domestic product by as much as 3.3 percent in
the medium term and 11 percent in the long term.
 Obama said he thought Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was
""doing important work trying to reform and move Russia forward
on a whole host of issues, and I told him that the United
States would be a partner with him in that effort.""
 RUSSIAN WTO ENTRY
 Obama and Medvedev in June set a Sept. 30 deadline for
resolving bilateral issues that blocked Russia's entry.
 The two sides made significant progress, but the United
States still has a few issues that need to be addressed, U.S.
Trade Representative Ron Kirk told the Export Council.
 ""I would say to Russia's credit we were probably 95
percent-plus successful"" in resolving U.S. concerns over
Russia's implementation of a bilateral market access deal the
two countries struck in November 2006, Kirk said.
 ""I believe we are in a very good place,"" Kirk said.
 The United States' remaining bilateral concerns include
enforcement of intellectual property rights, trade in meat
products and trade in products containing encryption
technology, a USTR spokeswoman said.
 The European Union on Tuesday said it had wrapped up its
bilateral accession talks with Russia, after Moscow promised to
reduce export taxes on timber and to lower fees on Asian
freight reaching Europe via Russian railways.
 Russia still needs to complete a multilateral agreement
with all members of the WTO to achieve its goal of joining the
world trade body by the end of 2011.
 The United States is ""working closely and cooperatively
with Russia, and with all other WTO members"" on that aspect of
the talks, the USTR spokeswoman said.
 During his remarks, Obama also announced a first set of
guidelines for what U.S. products should be subject to export
controls in the future and the licensing policies that will
apply to them.
 His administration is seeking comment from industry about
the guidelines.
 The measures to overhaul Cold War-era regulations respond
to complaints by U.S. defense and high-tech companies that say
the export controls cost them billions of dollars in lost
sales.
 U.S. allies also say they often face long waits to get
spare parts for U.S.-made weapons systems because of licensing
requirements as rigorous as those for the weapons themselves.
 ""Today's announcement is very positive news,"" said John
Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
""Manufacturers are pleased the administration listened to the
business community and is moving forward with the most sweeping
export control reform in the last 50 years.""
 Big U.S. defense manufacturers such as Boeing, Honeywell
and United Technologies are expected to benefit from the
reforms, much of which the administration can implement without
approval from Congress.
 ""We want input from businesses, from Congress and from our
allies as we complete this reform,"" the president said.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices
recovered on Thursday from a sharp sell-off earlier in the
week, supporting equity markets, but the euro fell on renewed
concerns about the euro-zone debt crisis.
 Bargain-hunters bought Treasuries again after the 10-year
note's yield reached a six-month high of 3.33 percent on
Wednesday. Their move dismissed fears that investors had lost
confidence in U.S. government debt.
 ""The world didn't come to an end for the bond market,""
said John Donaldson, director of fixed income at Haverford

 Other strategists anticipate Treasuries will rally into
year-end. The benchmark 10-year note  rose 10/32 in
price, with the yield at 3.232 percent.
 The vote of confidence in U.S. government debt took some
pressure off equity markets.
 Stocks were also supported by encouraging U.S. jobless

 * Obstacles: poor security, legal framework, infrastructure
 
 By Emma Graham-Harrison
 KABUL, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The American Chamber of Commerce
has opened an office in Kabul, aiming to show investors that
there is money to be made in Afghanistan, despite its security
problems and corruption.
 At a lunch in Kabul's five-star Serena hotel on Thursday,
U.S. ambassador Karl Eikenberry chatted with a former Central
Bank governor and businesspeople working in bottled water,
logistics and commercial law.
 More unusually for a Chamber of Commerce gathering, the
speeches included praise for the role of the aid sector, a
reminder of the challenges Afghanistan still faces as it
attempts to rebuild the economy after decades of conflict.
 Violence across the country is at its highest since the
overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, and the insurgency is
spreading to once peaceful parts of the north and west, but the
capital has remained relatively insulated.
  Eikenberry praised the advances of the last eight years and
singled out agriculture and information technology as growth
areas.
 But he also acknowledged to journalists that security
concerns, the lack of a strong legal framework for business, and
weak infrastructure after decades of conflict were all obstacles
to investment:
 ""Afghanistan still is a country that -- although great
improvements have been made in the last seven or eight years in
building the infrastructure that can facilitate commerce: roads,
power, access to water -- that still remains challenging.""
 Corruption is also a major problem, although businesspeople
were wary of discussing it. Some said that steady reforms of
legal and government systems to limit the room for it to
flourish might be more effective than public pressure on
President Hamid Karzai.
 The anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International
ranks Afghanistan as the world's second most corrupt country,
equal with Myanmar and behind only Somalia.
 
 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
 Businessmen already working in Afghanistan said it offered
good opportunities and that, in Kabul at least, security and
governance were improving.
 ""I've been here for two years and things are definitely
looking better,"" said Abdul Walid Qargha, an Afghan-American who
left as a teenager but moved back to work with his cousin at
Elite P&L, a procurement and logistics firm.
 Afghanistan offers a chance to break into sectors that in
other countries are already dominated by major players.
 And because it is a landlocked nation, the high cost of
importing goods boosts the competitiveness of local products on
the domestic market.
 ""So if you can produce certain goods locally, although the
cost of production relative to other countries may be a little
higher, you can still have a sustainable business,"" Farid
Maqsudi, Vice Chairman of the Chamber's Afghan branch, AmCham
Afghanistan.
 He acknowledged that attracting investors without personal
ties to the country was a challenge, and said a strong legal
framework was vital:
 ""The way you get American investors, and European investors,
is that they have to believe that there is a fair environment to
do business.""

424,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2010 11:32AM ET</span>",ECB: banks discriminate against small firms," FRANKFURT, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Banks seem to be more selective
in handing out loans to small businesses than their large peers,
potentially hampering the economic recovery, the European
Central Bank said on Thursday.
 Risk premia banks charge small firms have increased by more
than 100 basis points since 2008 lows, and the difference
between small and large business risk premia reached a record
high in the middle of this year, the ECB said.
 ""This suggests that banks have become more discriminating in
their pricing and granting of loans to smaller companies,"" the
central bank said in its latest Financial Stability Review.
 ""This could contribute to the pressure such firms face amid
weak profitability and significant financing needs, possibly
aggravating the adverse economic feedback loop.""
 It also said that parts of the small and medium-sized
enterprise sector remain fragile and that SMEs are recovering
more slowly from the recession than large firms, because they
are more dependent on domestic demand than exports.
 Small firms are especially dependent on funding from banks
for investment as it is more difficult for them to generate
internal funding, the report said.
 Overall, growth of retained earnings, subdued investment and
a low number of mergers have reduced the need for external
financing. The default trend is expected to continue to decline
in the next 12 months, the reports said.

 ""In the period ahead, many smaller hedge funds will continue

 However, even if hedge funds are liquidated, closures are
expected to be orderly and pose limited risk to financial

larger risk to financial stability.
 ""As investors prefer to invest in larger hedge funds, such

financial stability,"" the report said.
 Available data also pointed to a gradual releveraging of the
hedge fund sector, the ECB said, but it added that leverage
levels remain substantially below pre-financial crisis peaks.

 (Adds quotes, background)
 BERLIN, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle
expects the German economy to grow by at least 3.4 percent this
year, he said on Thursday, suggesting the expansion could be
stronger than the government last forecast.
 In October, the government raised its 2010 growth forecast
to 3.4 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent.
[ID:nBAE003834] Berlin is due to issue its next official growth
projections in mid-January.
 ""We expect economic growth of at least 3.4 percent for this
year,"" Bruederle told Reuters. ""And we are on a good path to
lasting, sustainable growth.""
 Germany suffered its biggest post-war recession in 2009 when
its economy contracted 4.7 percent as global demand plummeted.
Yet it emerged faster than expected from the slump and left most
other euro zone countries trailing in its wake.
 Forward-looking indicators suggest Europe's largest economy
is now poised to strengthen its performance, with domestic
demand playing an ever-more important role.
 Strong data has led forecasters to boost their growth
forecasts, with most more upbeat than the government's
estimates. The Bundesbank now expects the economy to grow 3.6
percent in 2010 and reach pre-crisis levels by 2011.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec. 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Monday, boosted by East European and Latin American
demand, though traders said uncertainty about how authorities
will handle the euro zone debt crisis could limit gains.
 That China refrained -- for now -- from raising interest
rates to quell inflation also helped the euro by stoking risk
appetite and also boosted the price of oil and commodity-linked
currencies such as the Australian dollar. [ID:nTOE6BB00G]
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.3292 , about a cent
above its session low, but traders said it would probably
remain in a tight range ahead of a European Union summit later
this week that may yield a permanent fund to support troubled
countries.
 ""It seems the market is comfortable with a euro just above
$1.30, and for now, it would take very specific developments to
push it out of its recent range -- call it $1.3150 to $1.3450,""
said Matthew Strauss, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 A break of $1.3324, followed by $1.3401 would provide the
momentum to test the top of that range, he said, though he
warned that thin, pre-holiday trading conditions and a recent
rise in U.S. yields will make it tough for a trend to develop.
 The U.S. benchmark 10-year yield hit a six-month high
overnight. With interest rates in developed countries at or
near record lows, higher U.S. yields make the dollar more
attractive to global investors.
 The EU's two-day summit begins on Thursday, and leaders are
expected to agree to tweak the EU treaty, paving the way to
create a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) from 2013, when a
temporary mechanism expires.
 It comes as fears that Portugal and possibly others could
follow Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency bailouts. Such
fears prompted speculators to more than double bets against the
euro, according to weekly data on speculative currency
positions issued on Friday. [IMM/FX]
 While German opposition to the idea of a joint euro zone
bond suggests that issue is off the agenda, speculation about a
permanent fund was a hopeful sign for investors.
 ""The more they talk and try to come up with a solution, the
more positive it is for the euro,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Dolan said the euro's ability to hold well above $1.30 last
week despite the rise in U.S. bond yields and fear about the
euro zone crisis was also a good sign for euro bulls.
 Elsewhere, the dollar was down 0.3 percent at 83.68 yen
, while higher oil prices pushed it down against
commodity-linked currencies in Canada  and Australia
.
 Traders said volume was light and likely to get lighter as
the Christmas holidays approach. Until hard news comes from
Europe, ""speculative and leveraged money is still more inclined
to be short of euros and they will stay this way through
December and the first quarter of next year,"" said Stephen
Gallo, head of market analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange.
 A Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday, while freighted with
less drama than recent gatherings, will also be watched closely
for any clues about the central bank's economic outlook or the
progression of its $600 billion bond-buying scheme.

(Adds Van Rompuy comments) 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - European Union leaders meet next
week under pressure to take bolder steps to quell the euro zone
debt crisis, despite signs that volatility in European bond
markets is abating towards the end of the year.
The European commissioner for monetary affairs, Olli Rehn,
said it was time for Europe to show proper coordination, and
back its shared currency union with closer economic union.
 ""We have to take well-coordinated action to safeguard
stability in the euro area,"" Rehn said on a visit to Athens on
Wednesday to review Greece's deficit-reduction efforts. ""We will
not stop until we have accomplished our mission.""
 Euro zone finance ministers took no extra measures to tackle
the crisis this week, saying a 750 billion euro ($1 trillion)
EU/IMF fund was sufficient to deal with Ireland's bailout and
any potential problems spreading to Portugal or Spain.
 That inaction caused further unrest in debt markets, with
yields on Greek, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish bonds all briefly
rising. But traders say movements are being exaggerated by thin
volumes, with investment houses traditionally closing their
books before the year-end. Activity will resume in January.
 ""Given the brutality of the moves we've seen in recent days,
we may well have seen most of the negative news for bond
markets,"" said David Page, an interest rate strategist at Lloyds
TSB in London.
 But EU finance officials have repeatedly warned there is no
room for complacency, aware that when markets last calmed down,
during July and August, it was not a signal that the crisis was
over -- if anything, it has worsened since.
 ""The risks are still there and I don't think anyone feels
reassured,"" Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities,
said this week. ""This is about reassurance of leadership.""
 The Dec. 16-17 EU summit is supposed to agree on the shape
of a permanent mechanism for handling crises from 2013.
 But the discussion will also focus on how to handle the
immediate situation. There is growing divergence between Germany
and other member states on what measures to take, including over
whether euro area bonds make sense, and whether the European
Central Bank might buy more distressed debt.
 France added its voice to Germany's staunch opposition to
the idea of euro bonds on Thursday, saying it saw little need
for such an instrument, which would effectively mean all 16 euro
zone member states sharing debt issuance and credit risk.
 ""It raises difficulties notably in terms of sharing costs
and profits,"" said a spokesman for French President Nicolas
Sarkozy. ""There is no need to discuss new propositions.""
 
 SPAIN'S CAJAS A LINGERING PROBLEM
 Instead, what analysts say could emerge at the summit is a
commitment to enlarge, or at least look at enlarging, the 750
billion euro European financial stability facility.
 Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, which
represents the EU's 27 states, hinted as much this week, saying:
""Up to now there is no need to increase the means available for
the facility. If needed, we will consider (it).""
 He said he expected EU leaders to agree a minor change to
the Lisbon treaty, the main law governing the 27-country bloc,
in order to create a permanent financial stability mechanism. 
 Germany had requested this concession to head off a looming
ruling from its constitutional court that could have stopped it
from backing a financial scheme to support weaker members.
 The other open question is what steps the European Central
Bank may be induced to take to support action by the EU leaders.
Speculation in financial markets in recent weeks has been that
the ECB could launch a massive bond-buying programme -- possibly
1 trillion euros or more -- to quell market pressure.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has sidestepped those
suggestions, but the bank has marginally increased its purchases
of Portuguese and Irish debt in recent days, market sources say.
 The fact yields on the sovereign debt of Portugal, Spain and
other weaker euro zone states have come off record highs may
therefore tempt some EU leaders to conclude the measures being
taken are working. But analysts warn against such temptation.
 Daniel Gros, an economist and director of the Centre For
European Policy Studies, draws the analogy of a crowded cinema.
If there is a large exit and lots of fire extinguishers,
everyone is more comfortable in the event of a fire. The euro
zone, he says, has yet to create a big enough fire exit.
 ""For example, the Spanish banking sector alone has
short-term liabilities of several hundred billion euros. To
return to the cinema analogy: investors know that the exit is
not large enough to allow them all to squeeze through at the
same time,"" he wrote this week, warning that if the EU does not
take big, bold decisions, it may never turn sentiment around.
 Whatever decisions leaders take next week, the root causes
of the crisis -- deep structural deficits, large debts and
inefficient economies -- will remain. Governments have to tackle
them in the coming years. In the meantime, methods have to be
found to handle the pressure on sovereign and bank debt.
 Next year, the euro zone will issue in the region of 800
billion euros of debt, according to Citigroup. If bond market
uncertainty picks up again early next year, as analysts expect,
funding that amount is going to prove taxing.
 And there are other lingering problems. Spain's regional
savings banks, the cajas, are under pressure to come clean on
their liabilities, and potential losses, on property loans.
 Spain's central bank will conduct a new round of health
checks on the cajas and report back in March. Bigger hidden
losses in Spain's banking sector could be a trigger for further
volatility on markets and renewed euro zone debt problems.

 TORONTO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened
slightly against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday morning,
pressured in part by firmness in the greenback.
 The dollar edged up on Thursday, still supported by a jump
in U.S. Treasury yields earlier this week, while the euro
slipped after ratings agency Fitch downgraded Ireland's
sovereign debt. [FRX/]
 ""What we did see overnight was broad-based U.S. dollar
buying with the Canadian dollar weakening slightly against the

Capital Markets.
 ""It's more a move into the U.S. dollar rather than the
selling of the Canadian dollar.""
 At 7:55 a.m. (1255 GMT), the Canadian dollar  stood
at C$1.0115 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.86 U.S. cents, down a
hair from Wednesday's finish at C$1.0108 to the U.S. dollar, or
98.93 U.S. cents.
 Strauss said moves were minimal and the market was looking
to the North American session for direction. The Bank of Canada
is expected to release its Financial System Review later on
Thursday morning, while economic releases include Canada's new
housing price index and U.S. initial jobless claims data.
[ECON/CA] [ECON/US]
 ""Commodities slightly up, equity futures slightly up, which
suggests a bit of a risk appetite move, but that has not
filtered through to the FX market,"" he said.
 Key technical ranges in the short term include C$1.0139 to
the U.S. dollar, a support level for the Canadian currency,
said Strauss. A key Canadian dollar resistance level is at
C$1.0078 to the greenback.
 Canadian bond prices were largely flat to higher on
Thursday, tracking U.S. Treasuries. Debt prices edged higher
there as a better-than-expected bond auction the previous
session encouraged buyers to creep back into the market, ending
a two-day sell-off. [US/]

440,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2010 08:24AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Iceland c.bank head: joining euro still good idea," LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank governor
said that joining the euro zone was still a good idea and that
it was too early to say whether the North Atlantic island's
ability to devalue the krona during the crisis had helped it.
 Helped by an International Monetary Fund-led bailout,
Iceland's economy and currency have stabilised since the 2008
crash, when all its main commercial banks collapsed in the space
of a few days.
 Iceland started talks on joining the European Union this
summer with the idea that it will also join the single currency
zone in due course.
 However, support for membership among Iceland's 320,000
population has been sliding, and the debt crisis that has forced
the EU and the IMF to bail out first Greece and then Ireland has
made neither the union nor the euro more popular.
 Sedlabanki Governor Mar Gudmundsson said he thought joining
the euro ""still makes sense"".
 ""Of course, we as everybody else, are hoping and expecting
the euro zone to learn the lessons of this (the debt crisis) and
clean up their act,"" Gudmundsson said in a telephone interview
with Reuters Insider from Reykjavik.
 ""And we have to remember there are many countries in the
euro zone that did not go the way of Ireland and Greece.""
 Gudmundsson said that having its own currency had been part
of the problem when the crisis hit Iceland, sending the economy
into a tailspin from which it has yet to fully recover.
 But he said that a big depreciation of the crown had also
helped spur recovery by making Iceland more competitive.
 ""I think that the big lesson is that you can get yourself
into problems both with your own independent currency and in a
monetary union ... and so you have to follow prudent economic
and particularly fiscal policies in order to avoid that.""

 FURTHER RATE CUTS
 With inflation now under control and the currency stable,
the central bank has been able to focus on boosting growth.
 Interest rates have come down over the last 20 months from
18 percent to 4.5 percent, with the latest cut of 1 percent
coming on Wednesday.
 Governor Mar Gudmundsson said that the central bank still
had some scope for more rate cuts after easing its key interest
rate by 1.0 percentage point to 4.5 percent this week.
[ID:nLDE6B70KH]
 But he said that this room was now quite limited.
 ""We changed our bias in our statement (on Wednesday) more
toward neutral because we have cut so much in the last few
months that the room for manoevre in that regard is becoming
less,"" Gudmundsson said.
 ""We think there might be some further scope, but that will
depend on the incoming data.""
 Data earlier this week showed output grew for the first time
in two years in the third quarter, expanding 1.2 percent
compared with the July-September period. [ID:nLDE6B60O1]
 But the Statistics Office recently downgraded its growth
forecasts, predicting a decline in gross domestic product (GDP)
this year of 3.0 percent, slightly bigger than it had previously
seen, and softer growth in the years ahead. [ID:nLDE6AM0VS]

 LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday after ratings agency Fitch downgraded
Ireland's sovereign debt while the dollar edged up, still
supported by this week's jump in U.S. Treasury yields.
 With trade thin, traders said the euro was also pressured
due to selling by model-related funds and a U.S. corporate.
 Fitch cut its rating on Ireland to BBB+ to reflect the
additional costs of restructuring Dublin's ailing economy and
banking sector, after the country secured a bailout from its
European neighbours last month. [ID:nWLA0394]
 The euro  slipped 0.4 percent to the day's low of
$1.3195, retreating from a high around $1.3320, with concerns
about steepling debt in some euro zone countries still weighing
on sentiment.
 The dollar continued to draw support from an extension of
U.S. tax cuts announced this week, but gains were capped as a
retreat in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields from a six-month high
hit on Wednesday quelled demand for the greenback.
 Analysts said the extended tax cuts were seen as supportive
for the economy and therefore the dollar, while U.S. Treasuries
have sold off heavily this week as the stimulus move fuelled
fears of inflation and deteriorating U.S. fiscal health. [US/]
 ""The latest fixation is the tax issue and that's created a
bond angle, and it's created a growth story that is positive for
the U.S.,"" said Daragh Maher, FX strategist at Credit Agricole.
 Other analysts said investors were wary of taking on big
positions as liquidity dries up towards year end, and this was
why the dollar's rise had been limited compared with the jump in
Treasury yields.
 The dollar index has risen only 0.7 percent this week while
the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has soared around 25 basis
points.
 ""We've seen a corrective move in U.S. Treasuries, whereas at
the moment we don't see a need for such a corrective move in the
dollar,"" said Antje Praefcke, FX analyst at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 The U.S. bond market may be vulnerable to more selling if a
30-year U.S. Treasury auction on Thursday attracts only limited
demand. A 10-year auction on Wednesday saw average demand.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the dollar's moves
against a currency basket, rose 0.3 percent to 80.271, rising
above its 100-day moving average at 79.953.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield  was at 3.25
percent, pulling back from a high of around 3.33 percent hit on
Wednesday.
 The dollar  was flat on the day at 84.08 yen.
 
 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 Analysts say investors have been encouraged to pick up
dollars as the higher U.S. yields make dollar-denominated assets
more attractive.
 But Maher at Credit Agricole argued the correlation between
currencies -- particularly the euro, the yen and the Australian
dollar -- and movements in two-year yield differentials were
stronger than for 10-year yields.
 The two-year yield has risen less than 15 basis points so
far this week, much less than the 10-year yield, as the short
end of the yield curve has been anchored by expectations the
Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates soon.
 ""For interest rates to gain greater traction on FX, the
shorter end has to move, and we're not seeing that yet,"" Maher
said.

 By David Milliken
 LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of England voted to make
no change to its monetary policy this month, in a widely
expected decision as it waits to see how much growth next year
suffers from UK public spending cuts and euro zone turmoil.
 None of the more than 60 economists polled by Reuters last
week expected the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee to change the
0.5 percent interest rate and 200 billion pounds ($317 billion)
of quantitative easing that have been in place since February.
 Financial markets did not move after the decision.
 ""The economic news over the past month has been consistent
with policy on hold,"" said George Buckley, chief UK economist at
Deutsche Bank.
 Despite a debt bailout for neighbouring Ireland, the
economic outlook for Britain has changed little since November's
MPC meeting and consumer price inflation has risen further above
its 2 percent target to 3.2 percent.
 Manufacturing activity has been strong following robust
overall economic growth of 0.8 percent in the third quarter,
though trade data on Thursday was unexpectedly weak, casting
doubt on the BoE's hopes of an export-led recovery next year.
 The central bank will not publish details of the MPC's vote
or discussion until Dec. 22, but most economists expect a repeat
of last month's three-way policy split.
 MPC member Andrew Sentance said since November's meeting
that he still saw a need to raise interest rates, while his
dovish counterpart Adam Posen reiterated his call for an extra
50 billion pounds of asset-buying with new money.
 ""If anything the recent data flow has tended to favour
Sentance's position with the economy experiencing the strongest
six-month period of GDP growth for 10 years,"" said James
Knightley, UK economist at ING.
 ""However, the ongoing threat from fiscal austerity, tight
credit conditions, falling house prices and the euro zone
sovereign debt woes will continue to provide downside risks,"" he
added.
 Most economists do not expect rates to rise until late 2011,
and only see more printing of new money if looming government
spending cuts cause a bigger-than-expected economic slowdown
next year.
 The BoE forecast last month that it would take until early
2012 for inflation to return to target, in part because
value-added tax on most goods and services will rise by 2.5
percentage points in January.
 This tax rise is part of a four-year plan of fiscal
tightening to tackle Britain's swollen post-financial crisis
budget deficit, which will involve the deepest public spending
cuts in decades.
 The government and BoE predict that overseas demand will be
able to take the place of domestic consumption, but even deeper
fiscal retrenchment in major British export markets such as
Ireland will make this a challenge.

 * Govt consumption disappointed, households in line
 * Annual CPI rate seen around 2 percent target by year end
 
 (Adds details)
 PRAGUE, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Czech third quarter economic
growth was slightly higher than the central bank forecast thanks
to higher-than-expected inventory building, the bank said on
Thursday.
 Gross domestic product grew by 1.0 percent from the second
quarter and 2.8 percent year on year, data showed. The bank had
predicted an annual rise of 2.7 percent.
 The bank's expectations for overall investment were exceeded
due to the higher inventories, although its forecast for fixed
investment, including investment in solar power plants, was
accurate, it said.
 Economists say Czech growth benefited from a boom in new
solar power plants fuelled by a generous state subsidy and
rapidly falling costs for solar panels, which led to rising
imports and investments.
 The bank also said import and export dynamics were
significantly higher than its prognosis. Net exports
deteriorated year-on-year versus expectations.
 Government consumption fell slightly, defying its
expectations for a moderate rise. Household consumption was in
line with expectations, it said.
 The bank said that its overall expectations for a moderate
acceleration in growth in the third quarter materialised.
 November annual inflation, also released by the statistics
bureau earlier on Thursday, was a touch below the bank's
expectations due to a slower than expected rise in food prices,
regulated prices and adjusted inflation excluding fuels, the
bank said.
 Consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in November from
October, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.0 percent, in
line with the midpoint of the central bank's 1-3 percent target.
 The bank forecast the annual rate at 2.1 percent.
 The bank said the November data confirmed that the annual
inflation rate will be around the bank' 2 percent target at the
end of the year.

 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - European Union leaders hold a
summit next week under pressure to take further steps to quell
the euro zone debt crisis, despite European bond markets showing
signs of calming down before the end of the year.
Euro zone finance ministers took no extra action to tackle
the crisis this week, saying a 750 billion euro ($1 trillion)
EU/IMF fund was sufficient to deal with Ireland's bailout and
any potential problems spreading to Portugal or Spain.
 That non-move caused further unrest in debt markets, with
yields on Greek, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish bonds all briefly
rising. But traders say these movements are being exaggerated by
thin volumes, with investment houses traditionally closing their
books before the year-end. Activity will pick up in January.
 ""Given the brutality of the moves we've seen in recent days,
we may well have seen most of the negative news for bond
markets,"" said David Page, an interest rate strategist at Lloyds
TSB in London.
 But EU financial officials have repeatedly warned there is
no room for complacency, aware that when markets last calmed
down, during July and August, it was not a signal that the
crisis was over -- if anything, it has worsened since.
 ""The risks are still there and I don't think anyone feels
reassured,"" Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities,
said this week. ""This is about reassurance of leadership.""
 The Dec. 16-17 summit is supposed to agree on the shape of a
permanent mechanism for handling crises from 2013.
 But the discussion will also focus on how to handle the
immediate situation. There is growing divergence between Germany
and other member states on what measures to take, including over
whether euro area bonds make sense, and whether the European
Central Bank might buy more distressed debt.
 France added its voice to Germany's staunch opposition to
the idea of euro bonds on Thursday, saying it saw little need
for such an instrument, which would effectively mean all 16 euro
zone member states sharing debt issuance and credit risk.
 ""It raises difficulties notably in terms of sharing costs
and profits,"" said a spokesman for French President Nicolas
Sarkozy. ""There is no need to discuss new propositions.""
 
 SPAIN'S CAJAS A LINGERING PROBLEM
 Instead, what analysts say could emerge at the summit is a
commitment to enlarge, or at least look at enlarging, the 750
billion euro European financial stability facility.
 Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, which
represents the EU's 27 states, hinted as much this week, saying:
""Up to now there is no need to increase the means available for
the facility. If needed, we will consider (it).""
 The other open question is what steps the European Central
Bank may be induced to take to support action by the EU leaders.
Speculation in financial markets in recent weeks has been that
the ECB could launch a massive bond-buying programme -- possibly
1 trillion euros or more -- to quell market pressure.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has sidestepped those
suggestions, but the bank has marginally increased its purchases
of Portuguese and Irish debt in recent days, market sources say.
 The fact yields on the sovereign debt of Portugal, Spain and
other peripheral euro zone states have come off record highs may
therefore tempt some EU leaders to conclude the measures being
taken are working. But analysts warn against such temptation.
 Daniel Gros, an economist and director of the Centre For
European Policy Studies, draws the analogy of a crowded cinema.
If there is a large exit and lots of fire extinguishers,
everyone is more comfortable in the event of a fire. The euro
zone, he says, has yet to create a big enough fire exit.
 ""For example, the Spanish banking sector alone has
short-term liabilities of several hundred billion euros. To
return to the cinema analogy: investors know that the exit is
not large enough to allow them all to squeeze through at the
same time,"" he wrote this week, warning that if the EU does not
take big, bold decisions, it may never turn sentiment around.
 Whatever decisions leaders take next week, the root causes
of the crisis -- deep structural deficits, large debts and
inefficient economies -- will remain. Governments have to tackle
them in the coming years. In the meantime, methods have to be
found to handle the pressure on sovereign and bank debt.
 Next year, the euro zone will issue in the region of 800
billion euros of debt, according to Citigroup. If bond market
uncertainty picks up again early next year, as analysts expect,
funding that amount is going to prove taxing.
 And there are other lingering problems. Spain's regional
savings banks, the cajas, are under pressure to come clean on
their liabilities and potential losses on property loans.
 Spain's central bank will conduct a new round of health
checks on the cajas and report back in March. Bigger hidden
losses in Spain's banking sector could be a trigger for further
volatility on markets and renewed euro zone debt problems.

demand to dump the single currency was also seen.
 Market participants say concerns over euro zone countries'

 The dollar was flat on the day at 84.05 yen.

 * Says common bond would skew French borrowing costs

(Recasts adding background, fresh quote, byline)
 By Emmanuel Jarry
 PARIS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - France sees no need today to
discuss creating euro zone bonds as a response to the bloc's
debt crisis, the president's office said, keeping Paris in line
with the more outspoken Germany in a new debate on ""e-bonds"".
 Bickering among European Union leaders escalated this week
over the idea of joint euro zone bonds, with Germany opposing
Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker's e-bond proposal on
legal and economic grounds.
 Juncker, chairman of finance ministers for the 16-nation
single currency area, floated the idea of creating a euro debt
instrument as a way of deterring market speculation.
 ""This proposal is not entirely new. It raises difficulties
notably in terms of sharing costs and profits,"" a spokesman for
French President Nicholas Sarkozy's office told reporters.
 ""There is no need to discuss new propositions.""
 Germany was quick to slam the e-bond idea, which would tie
the borrowing costs of major European economies to those of
peripheral members such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
 That would raise costs for both Germany and France.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that a common
euro bond would set the wrong incentives for member states that
need the discipline of bond markets.
 Thursday's statement suggests France would back Germany's
opposition to e-bonds for the time being -- although that
position could change if contagion from Greece, Ireland and
other peripheral euro zone nations spreads closer to the core.
 France is letting Germany do most of the talking in the
debate over the latest debt crisis in Europe, while trying
behind the scenes to moderate Berlin's stance to a more
market-friendly one. [nLDE6B50U8]
 The presidential spokesman also said France sees no pressing
need to discuss topping up the euro zone's 750 billion euro
rescue facility, a softer position than Merkel's stand that
there is no need to boost the bailout pool.
 ""We have a system today that has been agreed by all the
European countries in the Eurogroup,"" the spokesman said.
 ""A permanent, cross-government support mechanism against
crisis which functions according to specific rules.""

 By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Ben Deighton
 LONDON/BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - MasterCard is buying the
prepaid cash card business of foreign exchange group Travelex
for 290 million pounds ($459 million), boosting its presence in
a fast-growing financial services segment.
 Mastercard said the transaction would be $0.04 dilutive to
its 2011 earnings per share as a result of amortization and
integration costs. It added it could pay an extra 35 million
pounds if the business meets certain performance targets.
 Travelex's card programme management (CPM) division provides
prepaid ""cash passports"" for overseas travellers to use at cash
machines or to make purchases.
 MasterCard is the world's second-largest credit and debit
card processing company, behind rival Visa Inc. Both companies
have said they plan to devote some of the billions of dollars of
cash they have on hand to make acquisitions.
 Mastercard sees pre-paid cards as one of the fastest growing
parts of the financial services industry, with volumes in this
sector set to reach more than $840 billion by 2017.
 ""The acquisition of Travelex's CPM operations underscores
MasterCard's commitment to the global prepaid business, which
remains a key strategic focus for us,"" said Ajay Banga,
MasterCard president and chief executive.
 For Travelex, the transaction provides it with extra cash
for its own expansion plans.
 The deal will not change the shareholding structure of
Travelex, majority-owned by private equity group Apax and often
touted as a potential candidate for a listing.
 Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman, who set up the company in
1976, also has a significant stake in the group.
 Travelex reported a 3 percent dip in first-half earnings in
September, saying at the time it was confident its full-year
profit would be higher than in 2009.
 Mastercard said it expected the acquisition to be neutral to
its earnings in 2012 and accretive in 2013.

 * MORGAN STANLEY -- The Three Rs.
 ""Rebalancing: Further progress from the unbalanced
pre-crisis global economy to a more balanced one is a
pre-requisite for making this recovery sustainable over the next
several years. Encouragingly, we see external imbalances
shrinking as many surplus countries transition from export-led
to consumption-led growth and many deficit countries move in the
opposite direction.
 ""Reflation: During the rebalancing process, the G3 central
banks will likely keep policy very expansionary, which should
support the ongoing reflation of the global economy and
financial markets. Many emerging market central banks will
likely raise rates, but won't be overly aggressive ...
 ""Reconciliation: Debt-laden governments are facing the huge
challenge of reconciling conflicting claims by their bondholders
and stakeholders (citizens) on their limited resources. Which
choices governments will be making between the various options
-- default, engineering strong growth, fiscal austerity,
monetisation and/or forcing lenders to fund them at low interest
rates -- should be key for economic and market outcomes in 2011
and beyond. We continue to think that a spreading of the
sovereign debt crisis constitutes the main downside risk to our
otherwise constructive global outlook.""
 
 * NOMURA - Emerging economies thrive, developed advance.
 ""We forecast global growth of 4.3 percent in 2011. Emerging
economies are set to keep growing strongly but risk overheating
while the developed world recovery faces ... stiff headwinds.
 ""The (U.S.) recovery from the ""Great Recession"" is likely to
remain a slow and arduous climb. We forecast growth to remain
below its underlying potential for most of the coming year.
 ""We forecast the (euro zone) recovery to become more evenly
driven by domestic and external demand. Cross-country
divergences look set to widen further in 2011, complicating the
ECB's (European Central Bank's) exit path.
 ""Growth in (UK) net exports and investment will likely
offset the fall in public spending and the impaired growth in
private consumption. Inflation is stubbornly high but policy is
on hold for now.
 ""The Japanese economy has slowed sharply. However, we expect
it to avoid a full-blown recession.
 ""Asia's economies are rebalancing, but unless macro policies
also rebalance, setbacks are likely. We expect (Latin America)
to begin 2011 with a surge in commodity-driven inflation. Fears
of further currency appreciation will likely result in a slow
policy response, leading to higher inflation.""
 
* WELLS FARGO - Sluggish developed world, strong emerging.
""We forecast that the United States, which accounts for more
than 20 percent of global GDP, will continue to grow at a
sub-trend pace -- only 2.6 percent in 2011, which is
significantly below the annual average growth rate of 3.2
percent that was achieved between 1992 and 2007 ...
""Some countries in the euro area, which represents roughly 20
percent of global GDP, also experienced sizeable increases in
consumer debt in the last decade.
 ""The ratio of household debt-to-disposable income in the
United Kingdom exceeds the comparable ratio in the U.S. and
growth in British consumer spending will likely remain
lacklustre.
""The combination of slower global growth and the recent
appreciation of the yen will cause the overall rate of Japanese
GDP growth to downshift from 3.6 percent in 2010 to roughly 1
percent next year.
""In contrast to the lackluster expansions we forecast for
most advanced economies in 2011, we project that economic growth
in the developing world, especially in non-Japan Asia and Latin
America, will remain strong. Real GDP growth in China will
likely grow in excess of 10 percent in 2010 and about 9 percent
next year. Likewise, the Indian economy should grow nearly 8
percent in 2011. The real GDP growth rate of 5 percent that we
project for Brazil in 2011 is a very solid achievement for that
economy.""

453,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2010 05:12AM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-UK Oct trade gap unexpectedly widens, may weigh on GDP"," * Global goods trade gap 8.529 bln sterling vs 8.05 bln
forecast
 * Oil suppports UK exports, chemicals drive imports higher
 * Trade gap excluding oil and erratics is highest on record
 * Markets unmoved as data not seen shifting BoE decision

(Adds analysts, details)
 By David Milliken and Kate Holton
 LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Britain's global goods trade
deficit unexpectedly widened in October after imports rose to
the highest on record, official data showed on Thursday, raising
questions about trade's contribution to future UK growth.
 Economists had been predicting that the trade gap would
continue to narrow as domestic manufacturers finally started to
benefit from falls in the value of sterling, but in fact a
rebound in oil exports were the only thing that prevented the
headline number being worse.
 Imports were driven by UK demand for chemicals from the
European Union, and stripping out the effect of trade in oil and
erratic goods like aircraft, the underlying global goods trade
deficit was the worst since records began in 1992.
 ""At face value this is not a good reading, and probably a
drag on growth. We were hoping net exports would be one of the
main drivers of the recovery,"" said Alan Clarke, UK economist at
BNP Paribas.
 The Office for National Statistics said that Britain's total
trade gap in goods widened to 8.529 billion pounds in October
from an upwardly revised deficit of 8.392 billion p ounds in
September.
 Imports were their highest on record at 31.601 billion
pounds, up from 30.551 billion in September, while exports rose
to 23.072 billion pounds from 22.159 billion, their hig hest
since May 2006.
 However this improvement in exports was driven by a sharp
reversal in September's 954 million pound deficit in the trade
in oil to a surplus of 259 million pounds in October. The ONS
said this was due in part to an end to summer maintenance work
on Britain's North Sea oil fields.
 Markets did not move on the data, which comes a few hours
before the Bank of England announces its December monetary
policy decision. The BoE is betting that a recovery in exports
will help Britain weather a slowdown in domestic demand next
year when hefty government spending cuts start to bite.
 But markets before the data had viewed it as almost a
foregone conclusion that the BoE will not change its policy
stance this month, regardless of the trade data.
 BNP Paribas's Clarke added that the figures should not be
seen in a purely gloomy light. ""It is worth cautioning that a
lot of the deterioration in recent months is down to strong
imports rather than weak exports. That could be down to
manufacturers sucking in imports.""
 The Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday that
factories were reporting the strongest export orders in 15
years.
 Britain's overall trade deficit -- including the more
volatile services component, where the country typically runs a
surplus -- also widened in October to 3.946 billion pounds from
a three-month low of 3.790 billion pounds in September.
 ""Really the figures are incompatible with the rebalancing of
the economy and an export-led recovery,"" said Investec economist
Philip Shaw. ""Admittedly this is only one month's figures, but
it's not a particularly encouraging set.""

 * Analysts: Dollar lagging move in Treasury yields
 * Market awaits 30-yr auction, U.S. jobless claims
 (Releads, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The dollar's rally paused on
Thursday as U.S. Treasury yields retreated from a dramatic
climb, prompting investors to book profits on gains in the
currency.
 A slide in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield from a
six-month high hit on Wednesday quelled demand for the dollar,
while moves in major currencies were subdued given a dearth of
major economic data or events.
 Analysts said currencies would be sensitive to U.S. yields
in the short term, but added that dollar moves have been limited
during the hefty sell-off in Treasuries this week after an
extension of U.S. tax cuts fuelled fears of inflation and
deteriorating U.S. fiscal health.
 ""We've seen a corrective move in U.S. Treasuries, whereas at
the moment, we don't see a need for such a corrective move in
the dollar,"" said Antje Praefcke, currency analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 She said investors were wary of taking on big positions as
liquidity dries up towards year end. This may explain why the
dollar index has risen only 0.7 percent this week as the 10-year
U.S. Treasury yield has soared roughly 30 basis points.
 While the tax cuts have raised the issue of U.S. fiscal
problems, analysts say they could help to boost the economy,
which would be supportive of the dollar.
 Others in the market said the jump in Treasury yields was
overdone and that there was limited room for a further rise.
 Still, the U.S. bond market may be vulnerable to more
selling if a 30-year U.S. Treasury auction later in the day
attracts only limited demand. A 10-year auction on Wednesday saw
average demand.
 The dollar index, which tracks the dollar's moves against a
currency basket, was up a shade at 80.028, hovering near its
100-day moving average at 79.953.
 Technical analysts say a sustained break above that level is
needed to add significantly to the dollar's upside.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 3.239 percent,
pulling back from around 3.329 hit on Wednesday. 
 The euro was up a touch on the day at $1.3270.
 Traders say concerns over euro zone countries' debt
financing -- while put on a back burner after euro zone bond
yields fell on European Central Bank buying -- could resurface
at any time to hurt the euro.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 83.80 yen.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $0.9860, boosted
by data showing the country's employment is growing far faster
than expected, fuelling speculation interest rates may not stay
on hold for long.
 
 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 Rising Treasury yields can help to increase the rate
differential between U.S. assets and those of other currencies,
which is often supportive for the dollar.
 Credit Agricole analysts say dollar movements against the
Australian dollar, the euro and the yen have been most sensitive
to relative differentials in two-year yields, while the
correlation with 10-year bond differentials has been less
significant in the past three months.
 In a note, Citi analysts said the dollar's rise has been
lagging the surge in Treasury yields as recent U.S. data,
including a below forecast employment report last week,
suggested the economy was underperforming.
 ""The divergence between the reaction in the U.S. bond market
and the USD will depend of the performance of the U.S. economy
in the very near term,"" they said, adding that yields could fall
in the absence of more evidence the U.S. economy is improving.
 Traders also say weekly U.S. initial jobless claims data at
1330 GMT could trigger a rise in bond yields. The data last week
showed the four-week moving average of the claims at a two-year
low, stoking optimism about the U.S. recovery.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - World stocks ratcheted higher on
Thursday, adding to December's gains, and U.S. Treasuries
steadied following their recent sharp sell off.
 Wall Street looked set to join in the equities rally.
 A downgrade by Fitch Ratings of Ireland's sovereign debt
took a bit of the edge off European stock gains, but only after
they hit a fresh 26-month high.
 Euro weakness, partly due to the downgrade, helped the
dollar claw back some losses from the past couple of sessions.
 A combination of rising optimism about the U.S. economy,
including over a proposed extension of tax cuts, and concerns
about the deficit that those measures would worsen, prompted a
sharp spike in Treasury yields on Wednesday as investors dumped
the bonds.
 Thursday, however, saw a cooling of the sell-off ardour.
 ""My hunch is that we are near a selling climax in U.S.
Treasuries. Such a feeling is also in the market, dampening the
dollar now,"" said Koichi Yoshikawa, head of forex trading at BNP
Paribas in Tokyo.
 The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries was around 3.25 percent
in European trading, down around 2 basis points but still around
90 basis points above this year's low hit in late September.
 At the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit held in New
York and London this week, leading investors indicated they
wanted to avoid benchmark government bonds because their low
yields were unsustainable.
 ""We are going to have to get used to rising long-term
yields. How else are you going to get the long-term savings
returns you need?"" Andreas Utermann, chief investment officer of
fund firm RCM, said at the summit.
 The dollar, which has risen on prospects of higher yields
from U.S. assets, was down a quarter of a percent against a
basket of major currencies on Thursday, essentially tracking the
recovery-from-Wednesday mood.
 The euro was down a third of a percent at $1.3214.
 Euro zone debt also gained slightly and tension surrounding
peripheral euro zone debt was muted, despite the Irish
downgrade.
 The ratings agency downgraded Ireland to BBB+, but with a
stable outlook.
 
 STOCKS RALLY
 Investors, by contrast, have become more bullish about
equities, driving world stocks as measured by MSCI up nearly 3
percent this month.
 The all-country world index was up 0.2 percent on Thursday,
with its emerging market counterpart gaining around a third of a
percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 was off its highs, but up
0.2 percent.
 December's rally is setting some equity indexes up for
reasonable 2010 gains. The MSCI all-country, for example, is up
around 8 percent for the year to date, while the emerging market
benchmark has risen more than 13 percent.
 ""Bonds outflows are negative for the first time since 2009,
while equity inflows are their highest since 2006 and money
market inflows have turned positive again,"" Credit Suisse said
in a note.
 ""This pattern of funds flow suggests that investors want to
be cautious, but realise that bonds carry a risk and that, at
the margin, some types of equities are safer than bonds.""

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices edged up
on Thursday as bargain hunters entered the fray after a
two-day surge in yields while Asian stocks rose on hopes that
stimulus measures will help the U.S.economy in the near term.	
 European shares hit a 26-month high on optimism that U.S.
tax cuts would boost consumption. The FTSEurofirst 300
was up 0.5 percent in early trade and London's FTSE
100 was 0.6 percent higher. U.S. stock index futures
 were up 0.4 percent.	
 In stark contrast to the jobless U.S. recovery that the
White House is trying to shore up with tax cuts, Australia's
jobs growth in November was the biggest since January, blowing
past forecasts and lifting the Australian dollar and domestic
shares. [ID:nL3E6N81X6]	
 The financial world is becoming split between investors
who are deeply concerned that a proposal from U.S. President
Barack Obama to extend tax cuts will worsen a budget
shortfall, and investors who are relieved U.S. authorities are
trying to use fiscal and monetary medicine for the economy.	
 For now the rapid selloff of U.S. Treasury debt appeared
to have run its course.	
 ""Everybody is still focusing on U.S. bond yields. My hunch
is that we are near a selling climax in U.S. Treasuries. Such
a feeling is also in the market, dampening the dollar now,""
said Koichi Yoshikawa, head of foreign exchange trading with
BNP Paribas in Tokyo.	
 The lead 10-year U.S. Treasury future was up around 9/32
, after hitting the lowest since June 25 overnight. Even
after the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated plan to buy
more bonds to push down interest rates hatched in early
November, the bond market has relentlessly sold mid to
longer-maturity bonds.	
 Since November, the difference between 10-year yields and
2-year yields has widened by nearly 40 basis points.	
 Despite the selloff in U.S. bonds, patient investors have
been rewarded this year. The Merrill Lynch total return index
for Treasury bond maturities between 1-year and 10-years was
still up 5.3 percent as of Wednesday, gains worth noting in a
market where the official rate is effectively zero.	
 In the cash market, the benchmark 10-year yield was at
3.26 percent after climbing to 3.33 percent on
Wednesday, the highest since June. 
 The poor performance of sovereign bond markets in the
fourth quarter, especially the Treasures selloff this week,
may hasten a shift from bonds to other assets such as stocks.
Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, told the
Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit the deal in Washington
to extend tax cuts will probably accelerate the movement of
cash into equities and out of fixed income. [ID:nN08158565] 
 DOLLAR EASES	
 The U.S. dollar has benefited from the rapid pace of
rising Treasury yields relative to other sovereign bonds. The
decline lower in U.S. yields on Thursday pushed down the
dollar index, a gauge of performance against six other major
currencies, 0.3 percent .	
 The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $0.9871
after employment increased by a net 54,600 jobs last month,
surpassing expectations of a 19,000 gain.	
 Interbank rate futures tumbled while Australian
government bond futures <0#YTTc1> fell, unlike other
sovereigns on the day.	
 In stock markets, Japan's Nikkei share average hit
a seven-month high though short-term measures showed the
market was due for a pause, having risen 12 percent since
November compared with the 6 percent advance in the MSCI
all-country world index . The Nikkei ended 0.5
percent higher.	
 ""Thanks to both the yen's weakness and Nikkei futures
ending higher in Chicago, the Nikkei may see more buying, but
the market has been overbought,"" said Yumi Nishimura, a senior
market analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets in Tokyo. 
 Foreign investors gobbled up Japanese stocks last week,
with net buying reaching the highest since early April,
Finance Ministry data showed. Foreigners have been net buyers
for 5 straight weeks, bringing the total net buying to 730.6
billion yen over the period. Out of the last 10 weeks
foreigners were net buyers in nine weeks.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 1
percent , with gains spread evenly across all
sectors. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index inched up 0.4 percent
in thin volume. 
 The end of the year is not drawing a close on the
territory's IPO boom. Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank
raised $1.35 billion after pricing its initial
public offering, sources said, a move that could spark a new
wave of IPOs by mid-sized Chinese banks. 
 ""From an investment perspective, these guys have better
loan growth and they can tap on the more rural areas, so
investors will likely look at that,"" David Lai, a fund manager
at CITIC Securities who manages about HK$200 million, said.

 NEW DELHI, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Negotiations on a free trade
pact will top the agenda at a summit of Indian and European
Union (EU) leaders on Friday, an agreement that could generate
two-way trade worth about $134 billion, officials said.	
 Here are some questions and answers on issues at the 11th
India-European Union Summit to be held in Brussels, which will
also be Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's first trip to
Europe since its Lisbon Treaty came into force.	
 
 WHAT IS THE TRADE DEAL?	
 India and the European Union launched negotiations for a
free trade and investment agreement in 2007. An agreement is
expected by the middle of next year or perhaps sooner.	
 European exporters see an enormous opportunity in
everything from cars to fashion and luxury goods in the
world's second-fastest growing major economy with a potential
customer base of 1.2 billion people and a rapidly expanding
middle-class.	
 For India, the European Union is its largest trading
partner despite a recent slowdown following the euro zone
crisis. The Indian government has been aggressive in its push
for free trade agreements and sealed a deal with Japan in
October.	
 But the talks on a pact have run into differences, such as
over EU efforts to link it with sensitive topics such as
India's performance on climate change and reducing child
labour, and over greater market access.	
 Such efforts grate with Indian trade officials, who see
them as irrelevant to negotiations for a commercial
partnership. The details of what Europe wants have not been
revealed but any deal will have to be acceptable to its
parliament.	
 Complications have also arisen over the possibility of the
proposed pact leading to easier immigration rules for Indians
seeking to find work in Europe, particularly Britain which has
capped immigration.	
 The two sides have missed a previous target of October
2010 to conclude the deal, negotiations for which must satisfy
a wide range of stakeholders and the interests of a total of
more than 1.5 billion people.	
 India's trade minister has said the deal was awaiting
""finishing touches"" but it will almost certainly not be signed
during the summit as the two sides iron out the last hurdles.	
 Two-way trade between India and the European Union touched
$92.2 billion in 2009 in goods and services, but the figure
could rise to $134 billion (100 billion euros) if the free
trade agreement goes through, senior Indian Foreign Ministry
official Vivek Katju said. The proposed pact is expected to
help bilateral trade exceed $237 billion by 2015.	
 Against a backdrop of uncertain progress on the Doha
global trade talks, India has pushed ahead with free trade
agreements with countries such as South Korea and the ASEAN
bloc of Southeast Asian nations. [ID:nDEL520335]	
 
 ARE THERE ANY OTHER TRADE ISSUES? 
 India and the European Union have a running dispute over
Indian generic drugs in a case dating back to the seizure by
Dutch customs in December 2008 of an Indian blood pressure
drug in transit to Brazil. The row highlights disagreement
between those who call for the protection of the intellectual
property rights of drug companies and others pushing for
greater access to cheap medicines.	
 Activists have said the case represented a more aggressive
stance by patent rights holders which could undermine the
supply of cheap drugs to developing countries. Indian trade
officials initiated the first steps of a trade dispute at the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) this year and have reserved
their right to escalate the case even as they work towards a
solution with their European counterparts.	
 Indian Trade Minister Anand Sharma has said the two sides
have come to an ""understanding"" on the matter.	
 Indian trade officials have complained of what they see as
the unfair obstruction of goods to Europe, such as farm and
fishery goods on safety grounds. But accusations of
protectionism can cut both ways. India has launched more
anti-dumping investigations than any other country this year,
according to the WTO.	
 India, a cotton exporter, has also complained of European
moves to give concessions to Pakistani exporters after recent
flooding that engulfed much of India's neighbour, saying it
was unfair to other countries. 
 
 WHAT ARE THE OTHER ISSUES?	
 India and the 27 country-EU bloc also seek to cooperate
more on global issues such as financial imbalances, security,
trade and climate change. As a major member of the Group of 20
countries, India's views on the euro zone crisis could be of
significance and the two sides could also discuss reform of
the international monetary system and improvements in global
governance.	
 As India increasingly looks to the United States on global
issues from trade to climate change and security, Europeans
have appeared to lag in engaging Asia's third-largest economy.
India will seek clarity on European plans in war-torn
Afghanistan and India's role there and will also try to
extract European pledges for green technology support.

 * Says upturn to remain moderate in next few years
(Adds details, quotes, background)	
 COPENHAGEN, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank on
Thursday raised its forecasts for the country's economic
growth in 2010 and 2011, but said the upturn would be moderate
over the next few years.	
 ""Denmark is facing significant economic challenges,""
central bank Governor Nils Bernstein said in a statement.	
 ""We have so far had a very expansive fiscal policy, but
that will now be replaced by increases in private consumption,
business investments and exports if the economic upswing
becomes more self-sustaining"" Bernstein said in a statement
with a quarterly review of the economy.	
 The bank raised its estimate of 2010 gross domestic
product (GDP) growth to 2.0 percent from a previous forecast
of 1.6 percent and lifted its 2011 GDP growth view to 1.9
percent from 1.7 percent.	
 The central bank said it expected GDP growth to steady at
1.9 percent in 2012.	
 ""In our new prognosis we expect that this transformation
will be possible, because of the good economic development in
Germany and Sweden, among other things, supporting Danish
exports,"" said the bank whose fixed exchange-rate monetary
policy aims to keep the crown currency in a narrow band to the

 The bank said it expected consumer price inflation to be
2.2 percent in 2010 and 1.9 percent in 2011.

 * 30-year T-notes auction, U.S. jobless claims in focus
 * Australian dollar jumps on massive jobs increase
 * Kiwi falls after dovish RBNZ comments
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The dollar lost steam on Thursday as
a sizzling rise in U.S. bond yields appeared to pause for now
while the Australian dollar surged on data showing the country's
employment is growing far faster than expected.
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields dipped about 4 basis points in
Asia after a 23 basis point surge previous day, leading some
traders to think dumping of U.S. bonds may have run its course,
and undermining the yield attraction of the dollar.
 ""Everybody is still focusing on U.S. bond yields. My hunch is
that we are near a selling climax in U.S. Treasuries. Such a
feeling is also in the market, dampening the dollar now,"" said
Koichi Yoshikawa, head of forex trading at BNP Paribas in Tokyo.
 Investors dumped U.S. Treasuries this week after a deal in
Washington to extend tax cuts fuelled concerns of inflation and a
swelling budget deficit. Some analysts said the tax cuts could
boost growth by as much as a percentage point next year.
 Some traders were starting to think of the climb in yields as
overdone, with two-year yields rising more than 20 basis points
in two days to a 4-Â½ month high of 0.64 percent on Wednesday,
way above the Fed's short-term rate target of 0-0.25 percent.
 ""That's almost like you had a rate hike,"" Yoshikawa said.
 The greenback lost 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies. The dollar index fell to 79.77, struggling to break
above the 80.00-81.00 area, which capped its November rally.
 Still, some traders think there will be more position
unwinding in U.S. Treasuries after many investors amassed bonds
for months in expectations of massive buying by the Federal
Reserve.
 ""This will end only when everyone has dumped their long
positions. I think we are still far away from that,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.
 Investors' nerves will remain frayed at least until a 30-year
U.S. Treasuries auction later in the day.
 Traders also say weekly U.S. initial jobless claims data at
1330 GMT could trigger a rise in bond yields. The data last week
showed the four-week moving average of the claims at a two-year
low, stoking optimism about the U.S. recovery.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.3 percent to 83.83 yen,
pressured by selling by Japanese exporters.
 Traders said the dollar faced strong resistance around
84.40-60, an area it has repeatedly failed to break since late
last month.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.3306,
extending its rebound from a one-week low around $1.3180 on set
on Wednesday. The euro gained momentum after hitting stop-loss
orders at around $1.3280.
 But its inability to hold gains above $1.3400 this week meant
a probe lower was still possible, with a sustained break of
$1.3180 opening the way to a test of $1.3060/50.
 Traders also say concerns over euro zone countries' debt
financing -- while put on a back burner after euro zone bond
yields fell on the European Central Bank's buying -- could crop
up at any time to hurt the euro.
 The European Commission welcomed Ireland's tough 2011
austerity budget, which received its first approval from
parliament, opening the way for international loans to start
flowing to Dublin.
 AUSSIE SURGE
 The euro was also helped by a surge in the Australian dollar,
which jumped nearly 1 percent at one point following the release
of surprisingly strong employment data in the country.
 Australian employment grew by 54,600 in November, providing a
resounding counterpoint to recent soft data and an omen that
interest rates may not stay on hold for too long.
 The Aussie dollar last traded at $0.9864, up 0.75 percent
from late U.S. levels and breaking above resistance at around
$0.9855.
 The currency could test Tuesday's 3-Â½ week high of $0.9966
if it clears resistance from the top of ichimoku cloud on charts
at $0.9887.
 Against the yen, the Aussie rose 0.5 percent to a 2-Â½ week
high of 82.72 yen.
 In contrast, the New Zealand dollar dropped to a one-week low
at $0.7435, shedding about half a cent, after the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand said it expected interest rates to rise less over the
next two years than it had previously forecast.
 RBNZ left rates unchanged at 3.0 percent as expected but said
they should stay low for longer.
 ""The kiwi sagged given the much watered-down tightening
bias,"" said Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific Research at TD
Securities. ""We can finally confirm that we are pushing out the
next rate hike from March to July.""

 HO CHI MINH CITY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Coffee theft has been
added to steep borrowing costs and unstable exchange rates as
a threat to Vietnam's coffee sector and cited as a key factor
supporting domestic and global prices, industry players said
on Thursday.	
 Stealing of coffee cherries from trees has led farmers to
pick beans early, leading to lower export quality and possibly
affecting coffee flows from Vietnam, the world's
second-largest producer after Brazil, following rain delays to
the harvest that disrupted bean drying last month.	
 Concerns over Vietnam's supply were behind London's
robusta futures prices hitting two-year high last month. The
March contract  ended $5 higher at $1,882 per tonne on
Wednesday on more concerns over the Vietnamese crop.	
 Robusta prices in Vietnam, which often closely track
London prices, eased to 34,600-35,000 dong ($1.8) per kg on
Thursday in Daklak, the country's top growing province, down
about 1.4 percent from the previous day despite gains in London.	
 Daklak prices have now jumped 42 percent from a year ago,
which appears to have stimulated stealing cherries in the
Central Highlands coffee belt.	
 ""Now the situation with coffee theft, harvesting of coffee
without ensuring quality, or picking green beans, in the
province are evolving with complications,"" the Daklak
provincial government said in a letter this week to all
departments and districts.	
 It urged the authority to ""boost strict protection of the
coffee area being harvested,"" while farmers should avoid
expanding planting areas to ensure sustainable production and
bean quality.	
 Looting started in November and farmers rushed to pick
ripe and unripe cherries early instead of waiting until 95
percent of the crop ripened, traders said.	
 ""The stealing problem is obvious and the authorities have
not done much to prevent it,"" an executive at a coffee
processing plant in the central highland province of Lam Dong
told Reuters on the sidelines of an international coffee
conference.	
 Lam Dong is the second-largest growing province after
Daklak.	
 Doubling labour costs also made many farmers quicken the
harvest, which could lead to green cherries processed through
splitters raising the ratio of broken beans, a defect in
export standards.

 * But keeps firm grip on capital account at same time
 * Investment options in Hong Kong to grow but remain limited

 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 9 (Reuters) - If earlier doubts about China's
commitment to make the yuan a global currency were misplaced,
the current excitement is more than a little bit overdone.	
 Beijing's strategy for the next few years can be summed up
quite simply: Dear foreigners, please use our currency, but
not as a way to profit from our country's growth.	
 It is understandable why excitement is mounting. With more
and more Chinese firms paying for imports in their own
currency, the small pool of yuan abroad is increasing
exponentially. And the menu of yuan assets on offer to
foreigners, from dim sum bonds to swaptions, is getting bigger
by the day.	
 But the reality of China's incrementalist approach to
reform will soon set in.	
 The offshore yuan market is bound to disappoint global
investors over the next couple of years because two big things
they crave will remain on hold: China's capital account will
stay largely closed and yuan appreciation will proceed only at
the plodding pace dictated by Beijing.	
 ""It's not very international at all. It's just that it has
made progress,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist
with Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.	
 ""I don't think they (Chinese officials) are in a rush.
They would rather do things well than hurriedly,"" he said.	
 
 What this means in practice is that the trade track for
yuan internationalisation will far outshine the investment
track.	
 As for the buffet of investable yuan assets -- the CNH
market -- in Hong Kong, it will be big in significance, but
not in size.	
 ""This is a small, really small, tiny experiment in a lot
of long-term strategic financial deregulations, in terms of
interest rates, exchange rate and capital controls,"" said
Isaac Meng, economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing.	
 A London-based hedge fund strategist visiting Beijing last
week put it succinctly: ""I get that this is all important, but
I can't help but say 'so what?' There's nothing in it for us.""	
 
 TRADE GUSHER	
 Yet Beijing's determination to make the yuan a globally
accepted means of payment should not be underestimated. That
is the lesson of the past year.	
 When China launched a trial programme for settling trade
in yuan last year, it restricted access to just a handful of
foreign countries and Chinese cities.	
 Unsurprisingly, the numbers underwhelmed at first, and few
market players thought that pledges to internationalise the
yuan would amount to much in the short term.	
 But in June, Beijing allowed all countries and most
Chinese provinces to settle trade in yuan. Then in July, it
gave Hong Kong a green-light to launch yuan-denominated
products, a precondition for foreign firms to accept payment
in the currency.	
 With those two strokes of the pen, the gates opened.	
 Yuan-denominated trade flows have grown seven-fold to
total 340 billion yuan over the last six months, official
statistics show. From nothing a year ago, about 5 percent of
Chinese trade is now paid for in yuan.	
 ""Chinese policymakers want an even bigger share and they
don't mind the pace being rapid,"" Kowalczyk said. ""They can
achieve a lot without opening the capital account massively
wide.""	
 If there was any doubt about the direction of reform,
China this week expanded the number of domestic exporters who
can bill in yuan to 67,359 from 365.	
 And Beijing still has much room for experimentation. At
217 billion yuan, yuan deposits in Hong Kong have tripled
since the end of last year, but are still less than 0.5
percent of the deposit base in China -- not enough to pose any
macro-economic risks for the mainland.	
 
 LOCKING OUT RISKS	
 Nevertheless, the government is alert to even the faintest
whiff of danger. Hence its decision, reported by Hong Kong
media last month, to shelve a plan that would have allowed
offshore yuan to be channelled into the mainland's stock
markets.	
 A currency dealer at a foreign bank in Beijing also said
there were signs that regulators were surprised at how many
Chinese firms had taken advantage of the yuan's slightly
higher spot rate in Hong Kong by buying it on the mainland and
selling it in the territory.	
 ""There is no limitation on the offshore market. What they
can do is use administrative measures to narrow the channels
out,"" she said.	
 So even as Beijing widens the scope for the yuan's
cross-border use, be on the look-out for moves to ensure that
Chinese firms are truly buying and selling goods with their
cash and not just seeking out arbitrage trading opportunities.	
 
 AN UNSHACKLED YUAN?	
 The 64 million yuan question is when China will abandon
all of these controls and make its currency fully convertible
under the capital account -- the launching point for it to
become a rival to the dollar.	
 Many in the market are working on the assumption that the
government's stated ambition of turning Shanghai into a global
financial centre by 2020 acts as a rough deadline.	
 Yi Gang, a central bank vice governor, noted in an
interview earlier this year that, according to International
Monetary Fund data, countries typically take 7-10 years to
progress from current account convertibility to capital
account convertibility.	
 China opened its current account in 1996, so it is well
behind the average, Yi told Caixin magazine.	
 ""We have no timetable, but referring to international
practice, people can form a rough idea,"" he said.	
 Meng from BNP Paribas said that major reforms will be on
ice until a reshuffle of top leadership at the start of 2013.
After that, however, Beijing could have a true surprise up its
sleeve and move ahead quickly in opening the capital account.	
 ""2020 seems to be a relatively conservative objective. We
could easily see it happen earlier,"" he said.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2010 12:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Russia to lose rail oil sales to China as ESPO starts," * Russia to cut oil exports by rail when pipeline starts
 * ESPO pipeline expected to start full operations on Jan 1
 * Pipeline carries 300,000 bpd, rail about 200,000 bpd
 By Jim Bai and Tom Miles
 BEIJING, Dec 9 (Reuters) - China's imports of Russian crude
oil by railway will fall sharply next year after a new pipeline
begins pumping oil across the border, Sergey Tsyplakov, the
Russian Trade Representative in China, said on Thursday.
 That means two steps forward, one step back for Russia's
hopes of boosting its oil exports to China.
 The Chinese branch of the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO)
pipeline is expected to start operating on Jan. 1, supplying
300,000 barrels per day (bpd).
 Many oil market participants expected it would effectively
double Russian sales to China, which totalled 12.8 million tonnes
(308,000 bpd) in the first 10 months of 2010.
 But losing the rail route at the same time means China's oil
imports from Russia, which also include some shipments via
Kazakhstan and by ship, may rise by only 100,000 bpd next year.
 ""Railway transportation was very expensive and had little
economic benefit. To carry 10 million tonnes a year of crude oil
was a big burden for the railway,"" Tsyplakov said.
 ""It's good to have the railway to supply other products when
the crude oil will be supplied via the pipeline.""
 Russian state oil firm Rosneft has been sending oil to China
by rail ever since it bought the biggest unit of defunct oil
giant Yukos six years ago. The purchase was facilitated by a $6
billion loan from China, which effectively prepaid $17 per barrel
for 48.4 million tonnes of oil.
 That contract ran out this year, and Rosneft decided not to
extend it, citing the low selling price.
 But a new deal was struck during the depths of the financial
crisis in February 2009, when Rosneft and pipeline monopoly
Transneft borrowed $25 billion from China Development Bank in
return for 15 million tonnes a year for 20 years.
 The pipeline was originally intended to carry twice as much
oil to China, but Tsyplakov said any increase would depend on
Russia's capacity to produce more from its East Siberian
oilfields.
 ""Russia has introduced some policies, such as lowering export
taxes and fees to encourage developing the oilfields in East
Siberia, which should help to create the conditions for further
exports,"" he told reporters at a briefing in Beijing.
 He said China-Russia trade was up 43 percent to $45.1 billion
in the first 10 months of this year, and he expected it would hit
$55-57 billion in the full year, recovering to 2008 levels.
 Asked about the possibility that the oil would be settled in
roubles, following a currency agreement between the two
countries, he said: ""In principle Russia can ask for payment for
energy in roubles, but whether it is necessary to do that is
debatable.""

 TOKYO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The dollar lost steam on Thursday as
U.S. bond yields dipped after a sizzling rise in the past few

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices edged up
on Thursday as bargain hunters entered the fray after a
violent two-day surge in yields, pulling the dollar lower,
while Asian stocks rose on hopes added fiscal stimulus will
help the U.S. economy in the near term.	
 In stark contrast to the jobless U.S. recovery that the
White House is trying to shore up with tax cuts, Australia's
jobs growth in November was the biggest since January, blowing
past forecasts and lifting the Australian dollar and domestic
shares. [ID:nL3E6N81X6]	
 The financial world is becoming split between investors
who are deeply concerned a proposal from U.S. President Barack
Obama to extend tax cuts will worsen a budget shortfall, and
investors who are relieved U.S. authorities are trying to use
fiscal and monetary medicine for the economy.	
 Both higher U.S. yields and higher growth are being seen
as supportive for the dollar, for now.	
 ""The stimulus measures agreed by the U.S. administration
will likely lead to many analysts penciling in higher growth
forecasts over 2011 whilst reducing the prospects of QE3 from
taking place, all of which is dollar positive,"" Mitul Kotecha,
global head of foreign exchange strategy with Credit Agricole
CIB in Hong Kong, said in a note.	
 The lead 10-year U.S. Treasury future was up around 9/32
in early Asian trade , after hitting the lowest since
June 25 overnight. Even after the Federal Reserve's highly
anticipated plan to buy more bonds to push down interest rates
was hatched in early November, the bond market has
relentlessly sold mid to longer-maturity bonds.	
 Since November, the difference between 10-year yields and
2-year yields has widened by nearly 40 basis points.	
 In the cash market, the benchmark 10-year yield was at
3.22 percent after climbing to 3.33 percent on
Wednesday, the highest since June. 
 The poor performance of sovereign bond markets in the
fourth quarter made much worse this week has become a question
of allocation for many investors. Bob Doll, chief investment
strategist at BlackRock, told the Reuters 2011 Investment
Outlook Summit the deal in Washington to extend tax cuts will
probably accelerate the move of cash into equities and out of
fixed income. [ID:nN08158565] 
 The U.S. dollar has benefited from the rapid pace of
rising Treasury yields relative to other sovereign bonds. The
move lower in U.S. yields on Thursday pushed down the dollar
index, a gauge of performance against six other major
currencies, 0.33 percent .	
 The Australian dollar rose 0.7 percent to $0.9863
after employment increased by a net 54,600 jobs last month,
surpassing expectations of a 19,000 gain.	
 Interbank rate futures tumbled while Australian
government bond futures <0#YTTc1> fell, unlike other
sovereigns on the day.	
 In stock markets, Japan's Nikkei share average hit a
seven-month high though short-term measures showed the market
was due for a pause, having risen 12 percent since November
compared with the 6 percent advance in the MSCI all-country
world index .	
 ""Thanks to both the yen's weakness and Nikkei futures
ending higher in Chicago, the Nikkei may see more buying, but
the market has been overbought,"" said Yumi Nishimura, a senior
market analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets. 
 Foreign investors gobbled up Japanese stocks last week,
with net buying reaching the highest since early April,
Finance Ministry data showed. Foreigners have been net buyers
for 5 straight weeks, bringing the total net buying to 730.6
billion yen over the period. Out of the last 10 weeks
foreigners were net buyers in nine weeks.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose
1.1 percent , with gains spread evenly across
all sectors.

 * RBNZ says will keep rates low until recovery picks up 
 * Rates rises to be less than projected in September 
 * NZ dollar temporarily dives half a cent, debt futures
rise

 WELLINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank
held interest rates steady and scaled back its rate and growth
outlook on Thursday, backing views that it will keep rates
unchanged until mid-2011 at the earliest as it tries to revive
a tepid economy.	
 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept the official
cash rate (OCR) at 3 percent, as financial markets had
expected, saying the pace of economic growth has slowed as
household and businesses remained cautious about spending, and
as the global outlook faced downside risks. 
 ""While interest rates are likely to increase modestly over
the next two years, for now it seems prudent to keep the OCR
low
until the recovery becomes more robust and underlying
inflationary pressures show more obvious signs of increasing,""
Governor Alan Bollard said in a statement. 
 He said rates are likely to rise less over the next two
years than signalled in the September statement, when its bank
bill interest rates had implied the cash rate hitting around 5
percent by 2012/13.	
 The bank cut its forecast for 90-day bank bill futures
, a barometer for the official cash rate, by
about 25 basis points across the curve.

 The RBNZ held its cash rate steady at the September and
October reviews after 25 basis point rises in June and July.	
 The New Zealand dollar fell around half a cent to
$0.7448 before bouncing back to $0.7485/90 while interest rate
futures prices <0#NBB:> rose by up to 10 points as investors
trimmed expectations of future tightening and abandoned
expectations of a hike in March.	
 The swap yield curve also steepened, with two-year swaps
falling 5.5 basis points to 3.81 percent and the 5-year swaps
down one basis point to 4.715 percent. 
 The restrained RBNZ outlook contrasted with the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA), which still has a gradual tightening
bias after holding rates at 4.75 percent this week. That sent
the kiwi to a low of NZ$1.3132 before steadying
around NZ$1.3101.	
 ""It appears that it will take a decent pick-up in the New
Zealand data flow to bring rate hikes back onto the policy
table,"" said Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs.	
 ""An upward move in the OCR before the middle of 2011 is
very unlikely and there must be a reasonable chance it is even
later than mid-year,"" he added.	
 
 OUTLOOK	
 Economists said there was no need for the RBNZ to start
hiking early next year because of the weak economic outlook
and benign inflation. 
 A Reuters poll after the decision showed 11 of 13 analysts
now expecting the first rise in June or later, with two
picking March. Previously a clear majority favoured the
earlier start.	
 The cash rate is also seen rising less, touching 3.75
percent by the end of September next year compared with 4
percent in previous polls.	
 Financial markets hardened their expectations for a June
hike, while markets pricing of tightening for the next 12
months fell to 62 basis points from 70 basis points before the
latest statement. It has fluctuated between 57 and 95 basis
points since November. 
 Economic data since the October review has been patchy,
with
retail sales soft, unemployment high, and the housing market
stalling. Business sentiment, however, picked up for the second
time last month, and consumer confidence has steadied. 
 The economy is expected to have grown a meagre 0.3 percent
in the September quarter, according the median forecast in a
preliminary Reuters poll. It expanded 0.2 percent in the
second quarter. 
The RBNZ said inflation was not an issue at present, even
with a temporary spike caused by an increase in the sales tax
rate, which will boost the headline rate to nearly 5 percent
by the middle of next year.	
 ""There is little evidence of this spike affecting price and
wage setting behaviour,"" Bollard said.	
 He also said that New Zealand's commodity prices remained
high, helped by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.	
 ""While this is encouraging, downside risks to global
growth and export prices persist,"" Bollard added.	
 He said greater efforts to curb the government's fiscal
deficit would also help ease the pressure on the current
account interest rates and the currency. 
 The next RBNZ cash rate review will be on Jan 27.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury bond prices sank
for the second day on Wednesday, driving yields to a six-month
high after an agreement to extend tax cuts fed fears of
inflation and a ballooning deficit, while the dollar rose on
perceptions the tax cuts could increase economic growth.
 Gold tumbled a day after hitting a lifetime high in a
profit-taking frenzy prompted in part by the stronger dollar.
 On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed at
its highest level since September 2008, finishing slightly
above 1,228, which has been an important technical resistance
level. Gains in financial and technology stocks helped buoy
the U.S. stock market, offsetting declines caused by the
recent surge in bond yields.
 U.S. oil futures prices slipped, but remained near
two-year highs above $88 a barrel after government data showed
an increase in gasoline inventories.
 The deal to extend tax cuts enacted during George W.
Bush's presidency stoked worries over how the government would
pay for the additional stimulus.
 For the first time in weeks, investors shifted their
attention from concerns about euro-zone debt to U.S. economic
fundamentals.
 U.S. Treasury prices lost 2 percent in two days after
President Barack Obama proposed extending tax cuts aimed at
supporting economic growth. The dollar has reacted positively,
climbing as investors favor rising rates in the United States
compared with other bond markets.
 ""This tax agreement is a disaster for the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" said Howard Simons, strategist at Bianco Research
in Chicago.

 U.S. stocks closed moderately higher as bank shares, which

Index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.38 percent.
 The December futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago rose 70 points to 10,275.
 TWO SIDES OF BOND SELL-OFF
 The sell-off of U.S. Treasuries brought some buyers to the
table in an auction of $21 billion of reopened 10-year notes,
which was part of $66 billion of coupon-bearing securities
sales this week.
 Still, sentiment remained strongly bearish heading into
the sale of $13 billion of reopened 30-year bonds on
Thursday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 1-1/32, with the yield at 3.265 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 6/32, with the yield at
0.624 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 1-9/32, with the yield at 4.453 percent.
 On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury debt market suffered its
worst one-day sell-off in 18 months.
 Higher government bond yields tend to support the dollar,
as they reflect stronger growth and make some
dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors. The
dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.17 percent at 79.996.
 Some analysts believe the U.S. tax cuts could increase the
growth in the country's gross domestic product by as much as 2
percentage points in 2011.
 The dollar's strength pushed the euro toward important
support levels around $1.3200 as the European bloc comes under
pressure over high debt levels. The euro  dipped 0.02
percent to $1.3260. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar
 was up 0.65 percent at 84.02.
 The rise in U.S. borrowing costs gave the dollar an edge
over the euro among yield-hungry investors, also delivering a
blow to gold, which has shed 2.5 percent since hitting a
record high of $1,430.95 an ounce on Tuesday, as its
investment appeal diminishes with a rise in interest rates.
 Spot gold  lost $19.63, or 1.40 percent, to
$1,381.70 an ounce.
 The price of gold has jumped 26 percent this year, while
silver, which fell in sync with gold on Wednesday, has surged
almost 70 percent.
 Copper ended sharply higher moving back up against record
highs, as supply-side constraints continued to draw in strong
investment demand flows, even as the dollar rose and rate-hike
concerns mounted in top consumer China.
 Three-month copper  shot up $245 to close at $9,015
a tonne on the London Metal Exchange, well within striking
distance of Tuesday's record high of $9,044.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 41 cents, or 0.46
percent, to settle at $88.28 per barrel after data showed a
rise in U.S. fuel inventories.

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar ended
slightly higher against the greenback on Wednesday on positive
domestic data, comments from Russia's central bank and a deal
to extend U.S. tax cuts that could benefit both currencies.
 There was little direction taken from flat U.S. stocks, a
key barometer of risk appetite, and lower oil and gold prices
were largely shrugged off. [.N] [O/R] [GOL/]
 Leading currency direction, U.S. Treasury prices plunged
for a second straight day on plans to extend Bush-era U.S. tax
cuts, pushing benchmark yields  to a six-month high.
Higher yields tend to boost the greenback, enhancing the
attractiveness of U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
 Currency investors have focused on the better growth
prospects that the tax plan may bring, which could also lift
Canada, the biggest U.S. trading partner.
 ""Very small moves in the Canadian dollar generally, and for
the most part it was trading off bond developments rather than
something independent to the FX market,"" said Mark Chandler,
head of fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital
Markets.
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0108 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.93 U.S. cents, up
slightly from Tuesday's close at C$1.0114 to the U.S. dollar,
or 98.87 U.S. cents.
 Also on the plus side for Canada, Chandler pointed to the
stronger than expected domestic housing starts, although he
noted the details were not as upbeat as the headline
suggested.
 Canadian housing starts rose a greater than expected 11.6
percent in November, but most of the gains were in a single
province, Ontario, and economists said the home-building
industry was still decelerating toward a soft landing.
[ID:nN08291860]
 As well, Russia has recently started buying the Canadian
dollar for its near-$500 billion in gold and forex reserves,
and its central bank governor said the currency's share of the
portfolio could rise to 1 to 2 percent next year.
[ID:nLDE6B71GW]
 For the first time in weeks, euro zone debt concerns were
placed on the back burner as investors focused on U.S. economic
and interest-rate fundamentals in a thinning market as the end
of the year approaches.
 BONDS OUTPERFORM
 Canadian bond prices slid on Wednesday, tracking U.S.
Treasuries lower, but managing to trim earlier losses. [US/]
 The two-year bond  was down 8 Canadian cents to
yield 1.676 percent, while the 10-year bond  dropped
18 Canadian cents to yield 3.244 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed their U.S. counterparts across
the curve, and Chandler noted the Canadian-U.S. 10-year yield
spread turned negative for the first time since May.
 ""Canada's outperformance is simply reflecting the upgrade
to U.S. economic forecasts on the assumption that, first of
all, the tax package is sizable and impactful and second that
it's likely to go through,"" he said.
 Also helping Canada, the auction of three-year bonds met
with healthy appetite, while the U.S. auction of 10-year notes
was described as relatively successful, albeit somewhat sloppy,
said Chandler. [ID:nN08152103]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its
biggest three-day advance versus the yen in nearly three months
on Wednesday and looked poised to extend gains after proposed
tax cut extensions sparked a rally in U.S. bond yields.
 For the first time in weeks, euro zone debt concerns were
placed on the back burner as investors focused on U.S. economic
and interest-rate fundamentals in a thinning market as the end
of the year approaches.
 U.S. Treasury prices plunged for a second straight day,
pushing benchmark yields  to a six-month high.
Higher yields tend to boost the greenback as they enhance the
attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets.
 While the tax deal fueled fears of deteriorating U.S.
fiscal health, which is negative for the dollar, currency
investors focused more on the better growth prospects that the
tax cuts may induce, at least for now.
 ""The whole interest-rate differential argument is turning
out to be dollar supportive, at least in the near term,"" said
Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research in New York.
 ""I do think that in the longer term, the rising budget
deficit is clearly dollar negative,"" he added.
 Some analysts said the tax cuts could boost U.S. gross
domestic product growth by as much as 2 percentage points next
year. For analysis, see [ID:nN07277043]
 ""What this means is that it reduces the probability or the
odds of quantitative easing, which is good for the dollar,""
said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac
in New York.
 The dollar last traded up 0.7 percent at 84.04 yen
 after hitting a session high at 84.31 yen on trading
platform EBS. The dollar is on track for a gain of 1.7 percent
versus the yen in the past three sessions, the biggest since
mid-September.
 Against a basket of six currencies, the dollar index <.DXY>
rose 0.2 percent to 80.001, moving above its 100-day moving
average at 79.981. If sustained that would be a bullish signal.
 The dollar pared gains versus the yen and euro following a
$21 billion sale of 10-year Treasury notes, which pushed yields
off their highs.

 FURTHER DOLLAR STRENGTH
 For the near-term, resistance for dollar/yen is around
84.40, which will attract offers from Japanese exporters. A
break of that level could see the pair extend gains toward
84.60, followed by 85.40 and a retest of the September high
around 85.95 yen, traders said.
 In the options market, traders said there was high investor
demand for bullish dollar/yen option structures, ranging from
calls, call spreads, to barrier-type options where there's a
pay-off if the pair rises.
 The euro was flat at $1.3257 . Analysts said its
failure to hold gains above $1.3400 this week suggests a probe
lower, with a sustained break of $1.3180 opening the way for a
test of $1.3060/50.
 The European Commission welcomed Ireland's tough 2011
austerity budget, which received a first approval from
parliament, opening the way for international loans to start
flowing to Dublin. [ID:nBRU011201]
 But investors will likely continue to sell the euro on any
bounce amid worries about the European Union's ability to keep
debt problems from spreading.
 Sentiment in the options market remained negative on the
euro, with investors buying new bearish structures, although
volume has fallen from highs seen two weeks ago, traders said.

 NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury bond prices sank
for the second day on Wednesday, driving yields to a six-month
high after an agreement to extend tax cuts fed fears of
inflation and a ballooning deficit, while the dollar rose on
perceptions the tax cuts could increase economic growth.
 Gold tumbled a day after hitting a lifetime high, setting
the stage for its biggest one-day drop in a month, in a burst
of profit-taking spurred partly by the stronger dollar.
 On Wall Street, investors retreated from stocks, with the
major U.S. indexes little changed, in reaction to the dollar's
strength and the spike in bond yields.
 In Europe, stocks closed at a 26-month high, lifted by
banking and insurance shares, on expectations that worries
about the euro-zone debt crisis will ease.
 U.S. oil futures prices slipped, but remained near
two-year highs above $88 a barrel after government data showed
an increase in gasoline inventories.
 The deal to extend tax cuts enacted during George W.

positively, climbing as investors favor rising rates in the

 U.S. stocks opened slightly higher, but a rise in bond
yields and the dollar limited gains.

But the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.56 points,

points, up 0.35 percent, as financial stocks in Europe
advanced.
 Global stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.36 percent.
 FOR BONDS, SELL-OFF CONTINUES
 The sell-off of U.S. Treasuries continued for a second
straight day, which raised worries about demand at a $21
billion sale of 10-year notes later this session and a $13
billion reopening of a 30-year bond issue on Thursday.
 Bonds, however, pared some of their losses after the
10-year note auction met with decent demand for a reopening.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 1-3/32, with the yield at 3.267 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 6/32, with the yield at
0.628 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 1-9/32, with the yield at 4.445 percent.
 On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury debt market suffered its
worst one-day sell-off in 18 months.
 Higher government bond yields tend to support the dollar,
as they reflect stronger growth and make some
dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors. The

percentage points in 2011.
 The dollar's strength pushed the euro toward important
support levels around $1.3200 as the European bloc comes under

 STOCKHOLM, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve nominee and
Nobel economics prizewinner Peter Diamond said on Wednesday he
would like the U.S. government to selectively roll out more
fiscal stimulus while the Fed assessed the impact of recent
policy steps.
 ""We need to throw things that we find useful at this

 ""More on the fiscal side. My favourite one is what was done

the ability of the states to borrow is not ... there.""
 But extending tax breaks for top earners made no sense, he
said, reiterating previous criticism.
 Opposition from several Republican lawmakers means the
already drawn-out process of Diamond's nomination to the
seven-member Federal Reserve board could be pushed into next
year, Senate aides said this week. [ID:nN06241521]
 Lawmakers opposed to appointing Diamond, who shared the
Nobel economics prize with Dale Mortensen and Christopher
Pissarides for his work on labour markets, have said he lacks
experience.
 If Diamond, an economics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is not approved by the end of this year
his nomination to the Federal Reserve board will lapse, but he
said he was ready to stand for renomination next year if needed.
 ""It is a job I would like,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines
of his Nobel lecture in the Swedish capital.
 ""I believe I can be very helpful with the background, skills
and techniques I can bring, because we are facing many new
questions -- both things we have learned during the crisis which
should lead to changes in regulation, and all the changes that
the Dodd-Frank bill (on financial reform) gave to the Fed to
design new regulations.""
 Diamond also said the Federal Reserve, which last month
unveiled an additional $600 billion effort to spur demand by
buying government bonds, would need to take stock of the impact
of that measure before deciding on anything extra.
 ""We've just seen a significant change by the Fed and I think
the Fed needs to take time to see how it is working and how the
economy is doing before making some change in any direction.""
 He also reiterated his criticism of plans to include the
highest income earners in an extension of tax breaks outlined by
President Barack Obama earlier this week. [ID:nN07288652]
 ""I think including the highest earners in this makes no
sense whatsoever for anyone concerned about the long-term debt,
because when you look at the ratio of the amount of stimulus you
get relative to the additional amount of debt it is a very poor
trade-off,"" he said.
 ""There is very little bang for that buck.""

499,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2010 12:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Ten EU countries plan to go it alone on EU patent," (Adds Barnier comment)
 PARIS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Ten EU governments, including
France and Germany, got European Commission backing on Wednesday
for plans to push ahead with a common patent system despite
objections by other countries in the 27-country European Union. 
 Hopes of creating a region-wide patenting system to slash
costs and allow Europe to compete with China and the United
States have been stymied for years at EU level due to disputes
over which languages to use.
 In a letter sent to EU Internal Markets Commissioner Michel
Barnier on Tuesday, 10 countries said it was clear a unanimous
agreement would not be reached any time soon, and urged the
European Commission to allow them to go ahead as a smaller group
with a common patent.
 Speaking in Brussels, Barnier said the Commission would now
start proceedings to allow the states to move ahead on a deal
without first reaching unanimity. 
 ""I have been authorised by the (commissioners') college to
tell the Competitiveness Council on Friday that we are ready to
start the procedure,"" Barnier told journalists at a news
conference.
 Once the Commission has received the green light from
EU-member states and the European parliament, it will move
quickly to propose a new text for an EU-wide patent, he said.
 The letter was signed by France, Germany, Slovenia, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
Sweden.
 However, French Industry Minister Eric Besson said last week
he thought 23 or 24 countries within the EU-bloc were ready to
move ahead on a proposal.
 The EU has tried since the 1960s to simplify its complex and
costly system of patenting across a membership that now spans 27
countries, but it has stumbled on how to pare the number of
languages used and streamline legal challenges.
 A European patent already exists but it is in effect a
bundle of national patents as it has to be validated in each
country, a costly process in terms of legal and translation fees
that can ultimately push the cost of a patent far higher than in
the United States.
 This makes a European patent cost as much as 20,000 euros,
10 times more than its U.S. equivalent, which costs about 1,850
euros.
 In July, Barnier proposed a deal for a region-wide patent,
limiting the number of languages to three: English, German and
French.
 But the solution was rejected by Spain and Italy who said
their languages should also be included to guarantee diversity.

 * Dollar bolstered as U.S. Treasury yields rise
 * Dollar index rises above 80, breaches 100-day MA
 * Options market flags further dollar/yen rise
(Adds comment, updates prices, adds option volume)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The dollar advanced on
Wednesday, with further gains likely in the near term, as
Treasury yields spiked following a proposed extension of tax
cuts that raised growth expectations for the U.S. economy.
 For the first time in weeks, euro zone debt concerns were
placed on the back burner as investors focused on U.S. economic
fundamentals in a thinning market.
 Some analysts said the tax cuts could boost U.S. gross
domestic product growth by as much as 2 percentage points next
year. Such views have propelled 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to
3.295 percent, a level not seen since late June.
 Higher yields tend to support the greenback as they reflect
stronger growth. They also enhance the attractiveness of some
dollar-denominated assets to investors.
 ""These tax cuts are now regarded as a game changer, which
will provide significant support for the U.S. economy next
year,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist, at
Westpac in New York.
 ""What this means is that it reduces the probability or the
odds of quantitative easing, which is good for the dollar.""
 In midday New York trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index,
a gauge of its performance against a basket of six major
currencies, rose 0.3 percent from late U.S. levels to 80.121,
moving above its 100-day moving average at 79.981. If sustained
that would be a bullish signal.
 Market concerns over North Korea firing artillery shells in
a suspected military drill also helped the dollar. See
 The greenback rose a further 0.8 percent to 84.13 yen after
hitting session highs at 84.31.
 Traders said there are exporter offers around the 84.40
area, which could limit gains, although there are bids at the
83.80 level.
 In the options market, traders said there was high investor
demand for bullish dollar/yen option structures, ranging from
calls, call spreads, to barrier-type options where there's a
pay-off if the pair rises.
 The focus has therefore returned to option barriers at
84.50 yen, a breach of which should push implied volatilities
higher, traders said. On Wednesday, one-month implied vols in
dollar/yen rose to 10.36 percent from a close of 9.75 on
Tuesday.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3239. Its failure this week
and last to hold above $1.3400 suggests a probe lower, with a
sustained break of $1.3180 opening the way for a test of
$1.3060/50.
 Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East accounts were
seen around $1.3200 and $1.3180, respectively, traders said.
Few analysts expect the euro to break below $1.30 anytime
soon.
 Ireland moved a step closer to securing bailout funds after
passing the first in a series of votes on its toughest budget
on record, but traders said investors were still likely to sell
the euro on any bounce given broader worries about the European
Union's ability to keep debt problems from spreading.
 Sentiment in the options market remained negative on the
euro as well. Investors were still buying new bearish
structures, offsetting profit-taking on old bearish trades,
although volume has fallen from highs seen two weeks ago,
traders said.
 Market participants said dollar positioning was neutral
overall at the moment and few investors are keen to take on
significant long positions.

(Adds further comments, byline)
 By Laura MacInnis
 GENEVA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund chief
Dominique Strauss-Kahn on Wednesday said the situation in Europe
remained troubling, keeping up pressure on policymakers to find
more effective measures to deal with the euro zone's debt
crisis.
 In a speech in Geneva, the IMF managing director said the
effects of the global financial crisis were still in play. ""The
situation in Europe remains troubling and the future is more
uncertain than ever.""
 Strauss-Kahn said the Greek and Irish debt bailouts
highlighted the need for a more coordinated response to economic
and financial storms.
 ""The delay in strengthening supervision and creating
effective crisis resolution mechanisms could well lead to the
next crisis,"" Strauss-Kahn cautioned, later dismissing concerns
that Europe's single currency may have aggravated its problems.
 ""For me the euro is not the cause. The euro has to be
complemented by better coordination at the regional level,"" he
told diplomats gathered at the U.N.'s European headquarters.
 A day earlier he had criticized the euro zone for a
disjointed response to the debt crisis. ""The euro zone has to
provide a comprehensive solution to this problem. The piecemeal
approach, one country after another, is not a good one,"" he said
during a visit to Greece. [ID:nLDE6B70B]
 In his speech in Geneva, he called for stronger economic and
financial oversight noting that without proper supervision
""disaster could be just around the corner.""
 He said reforming banking sector regulations was urgent and
necessary and authorities across the globe were not moving fast
enough to fix the shortcomings.
 ""It is important to apply new rules to the financial
sector,"" Strauss-Kahn said. ""We need supervision that is not
afraid of saying no to powerful interests.""
 He also stressed that most of the world has moved past the
global financial crisis, with Asian economies largely in the
clear and Latin America and Africa faring well.
 ""There is strong growth not only in Brazil but also in
Chile, Peru and Colombia. It required one year for African
countries to return to growth,"" he said.
 ""In the United States the situation is more uncertain,"" he
continued. ""We are not out of the crisis yet but there should
not be an overly European-centric perspective.""

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks wallowed on
Wednesday and the dollar firmed as a spike in Treasury bond
yields following a proposed extension of tax cuts raised growth
expectations for the U.S. economy.
 Oil and commodities prices eased from record highs,
pressured by the dollar's rise, while U.S. government bond
prices fell with benchmark yields hovering at their highest in
six months after a deal to extend Bush-era tax-cuts stoked
fears over inflation and the government's control of the budget
deficit.
 For the first time in weeks, investors shifted their
attention from euro zone debt concerns onto U.S. economic
fundamentals in a light volume market.
 U.S. Treasury prices have fallen by 2 percent in two days
after President Barack Obama proposed extending tax cuts aimed
at supporting economic growth.
 ""Tax cuts are being perceived as positive for growth,
positive for stocks, certainly outweighing the long-term
negative impact on the U.S. fiscal deficit,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, senior currency strategist, at BNY Mellon in New
York. ""The dollar is therefore benefiting.""
 Stocks opened slightly higher, but a rise in bond yields
and the dollar limited gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 8.78 points,
or 0.08 percent, at 11,367.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 1.59 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,225.34. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 4.82 points, or 0.19
percent, at 2,603.31.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares rose to a fresh 26-month high at 1,125.38 points as
financial stocks in Europe advanced.
 Global stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.3 percent.
 DOLLAR AND BONDS
 Higher government bond yields tend to support the dollar,
as they reflect stronger growth and make some
dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors. The
dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.33 percent at 80.12.
 The dollar strength pushed the euro towards important
support levels around $1.3200 as the European bloc comes under
pressure over high debt levels. The euro  was down 0.21
percent at $1.3235. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar 
was up 0.75 percent at 84.11.
 The continued sell-off of U.S. Treasuries raised worries
about demand at a $21 billion sale of 10-year notes later this
session and $13 billion reopening of a 30-year bond issue on
Thursday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 29/32, with the yield at 3.2493 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 6/32, with the yield at
0.6196 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 14/32, with the yield at 4.4009 percent.
 The Treasuries market suffered on Tuesday its worst one-day
sell-off in 18 months.
 The rise in U.S. borrowing costs gave the dollar an edge
over the euro among yield-hungry investors, thereby also
delivering a blow to gold, which has shed 2.5 percent since
hitting a record high on Tuesday, as its investment appeal
diminishes with a rise in interest rates.
 Spot gold prices  fell $25.84, or 1.84 percent, to
$1375.50 an ounce, while U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell
93 cents, or 1.05 percent, to $87.76 per barrel after industry
data showed a rise in inventories.

 * Oil prices, c/a surplus to support rouble
 * Worried about inflation, but 2011 target ""achievable""
 * Does not rule out rate hikes in Q1
 
(Recasts, adds quotes, details, background)
 By Toni Vorobyova and Yelena Fabrichnaya
 MOSCOW, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Russia could be ready to stop
regular interventions to prop up the rouble in the next two
years as it moves ever closer to allowing the currency to float
freely, central bank governor Sergei Ignatyev said on Wednesday.
 In a rare press briefing, Ignatyev also forecast the time of
chronic rouble weakness could be over, said he was concerned
about inflation and did not rule out near-term rate hikes.
 His comments boosted the rouble in late trade, pushing it
towards Tuesday's one-week high versus the euro-dollar basket
used by the central bank to track the exchange rate.
 ""Anything is possible,"" he said, when asked about the
possibility of interest rate hikes starting late this year or in
the first quarter of 2011.
 Analysts see the refi rate hiked from 7.75 percent in the
first quarter of 2011 -- expectations which were fuelled by the
central bank dropping its wording in November on policy likely
staying unchanged in comings months.
 Rates at record lows, rising inflation, foreign debt
repayments by corporates, acquisitions abroad, rising imports
and global risk aversion all combined this autumn and prompted
the rouble to shed all its 2010 gains in just a few weeks.
 ""Some people expect a further weakness of the rouble -- I
think they may be disappointed,"" Ignatyev said.
 ""At the moment oil prices are very high... and against the
backdrop of current account surplus it is very difficult to
expect a further rouble weakness.""
 Russia remains committed to increasing exchange rate
flexibility, further widening the rouble's floating corridor.
 ""My opinion is that in the next 2-3 years, the central bank
cannot take on this obligation that it will not carry out
interventions,"" Ignatyev said.
 ""But what I call an ""almost free-float"" -- we could arrive
at that regime in the next two years -- where we go along the
path of widening the corridor, and the rouble wobbles in its
central part without any interventions.""
 
 UPBEAT ON GROWTH, WORRIED ON INFLATION
 Ignatyev estimated November's capital outflows at $9 billion
-- meaning some $29 billion has now left Russia since the start
of the year -- but said an inflow was possible in December.
 Russia's $32 billion privatisation plan could lead to more
inflows in 2011-3, he said.
 Echoing the central bank's recent tone, Ignatyev sounded
upbeat on the economy, saying he sees no serious macroeconomic
risks for Russia in 2011 and hopes for gross domestic product
(GDP) growth of 5 percent -- higher than the official forecast.
 Next year's target to cut inflation to 6-7 percent ""is quite
achievable"", he said but sounded less sanguine on the near-term.
 ""Inflation is starting to worry us,"" he said, forecasting it
could reach 8.4 percent this year -- the lowest in post Soviet
history but far higher than had been expected before a severe
summer drought wiped out a third of the harvest, pushing up food
prices.
 The rouble's weakness this autumn may also have played a
part in fuelling price pressures, Ignatyev conceded.
 
 RESERVES
 Russia has recently started buying the Canadian dollar for
its near-$500 billion gold and forex reserves, and Ignatyev said
that currency's share of the portfolio could rise to 1-2 percent
next year.
 The central bank is also preparing to invest in the
Australian dollar and, not least because of the addition of the
new currencies, Ignatyev said the structure of reserves could
change a little next year.
 ""I do not rule it out. But it is unlikely that something
will change significantly,"" he said.
 Prior to the addition of the loonie, the FX part of the
reserves was held in 47 percent dollars, 41 percent euros, 10
percent sterling and 2 percent yen.

 * Danske could issue bonds, shares to pay back state loan
 
 By Mette Fraende and Peter Levring
 COPENHAGEN, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Danske Bank, which bought
National Irish Bank in 2004, is changing strategy in Ireland,
pulling back from high street banking to focus on wealthy and
corporate clients, its chief executive said.
CEO Peter Straarup also told Reuters in an interview that
Danske Bank could offer bonds or raise capital when the time
comes to pay back a 26 billion crown ($4.26 billion) loan from
the Danish government.
 ""The Irish business will focus on private banking plus the
bigger of the small and mid-size corporate customers,"" Straarup
said on Wednesday. ""We are pulling back from traditional mass
banking when it comes to branches.""
 Danske, Denmark's biggest financial institution, has already
closed half of National Irish Bank's branches.
 ""There is nothing attractive about having banks in Ireland
at this time, but there will be a day after tomorrow,"" Straarup
said in the interview.
 ""The alternative for us is to get the bank's costs down to a
level where we will be profitable once the crisis is over, and
to do what we can to defend any outstanding claims the bank may
have,"" he said. ""I don't think we have any other choice, and I
think this is the right choice.""
 Straarup repeated that Danske Bank had no wish to sell
National Irish Bank, nor try to expand further in the country
through acquisitions.
 
 LOW GROWTH, HIGH PROVISIONS
 ""The restructuring of Ireland will obviously take a number
of years, likely about three to four years. But that does not
mean that the economy will not show some progress, and we expect
to see a small positive development in the Irish economy in
2011,"" Straarup said.
 The crisis in Ireland has weighed on Danske Bank's results
in the form of high debt provisions, which are expected to
continue in the future, Straarup said, adding that he hoped such
provisions peaked in the second quarter of 2010.
 ""We are of the opinion that what we are experiencing in
Ireland, but also in the rest of Europe, could be relatively low
growth for a long period ahead. It means that there could be
challenges for the banking sector in a relatively long period to
come with regards to loan losses and so forth,"" Straarup said.
 ""We do not expect our business in Ireland to show any growth
worth mentioning in the coming 12 months,"" he said.
 Danske Bank has about 90 percent of its business in the
Nordic countries and little exposure in countries such as
Greece, Portugal and Spain, Straarup said.
 ""But low growth in the euro countries contributes to keeping
growth down in Denmark,"" he said.
 Having borrowed $4.26 billion from the Danish state in 2009
through a state aid package, the group could look to raise funds
once payback is due in April 2014, he said. Of the $4.26
billion, $354.6 million would be paid back in 2012.
 ""It cannot be ruled out that we will be in a situation where
it will be interesting for the bank to offer convertible bonds,
or, to an extent, raise capital when we will be paying our loan
back to the state,"" Straarup said.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The dollar firmed on Wednesday
and may sustain gains in the near term, as Treasury yields
spiked following a proposed extension of tax cuts that raised
growth expectations for the U.S. economy.
 For the first time in weeks, euro zone debt concerns were
placed on the back burner as investors focused on U.S. economic
fundamentals in a thinning market.
 Some analysts said the tax cuts could add as much as 2
percentage points to U.S. gross domestic product, adding such
views have contributed to a rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury
yield to 3.25 percent , a level not seen since late
June. [US/]
 Higher yields tend to support the greenback, as they
reflect stronger growth and make some dollar-denominated assets
more attractive to investors.
 ""Tax cuts are being perceived as positive for growth,
positive for stocks, certainly outweighing the long-term
negative impact on the U.S. fiscal deficit,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, senior currency strategist, at BNY Mellon in New
York. ""The dollar is therefore benefiting.""
 Yields, however, could decline as a 10-year U.S. bond
auction later in the day and a 30-year auction on Thursday
loomed. Auctions at the end of the year tend to attract tepid
demand as liquidity dries up, but some in the market say if the
sales go smoothly, yields will likely back down, withdrawing
some support for the dollar.
 ""The move in spreads in a thinning market has prompted some
people who had been short on the dollar to put back on some
positions,"" said Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe
Generale.
 In early New York trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index
<.DXY>, a gauge of its performance against a basket of six
major currencies, rose 0.2 percent from late U.S. levels to
80.043, moving above its 100-day moving average at 79.981. If
sustained that would be a bullish signal.
 The greenback, which made its biggest one-day gain against
the yen in nearly three months on Tuesday, rose a further 0.6
percent to 83.93 yen . It briefly rose above 84 yen,
where there is resistance through 84.40 that has capped its
recent rally.
 The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.3246 . Its failure
this week and last to hold above $1.3400 suggests a probe
lower, with a sustained break of $1.3180 opening the way for a
test of $1.3060/50.
 Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East accounts were

510,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2010 10:04AM ET</span>","GLOBAL ECONOMY-Europe data upbeat, mkt eyes new US stimulus"," * German industrial output rises more than f'cast
 * France raises outlook, UK manufacturing upbeat
 * Europe's top economies strong as US, weaker peers struggle
 
 By Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Dec 8 (Reuters) - German industrial output soared
past expectations and France's central bank upped its forecast
for fourth-quarter growth on Wednesday, signs that Europe's
biggest economies are speeding ahead while the debt crisis puts
the brakes on smaller peers.
 Upbeat economic signs from Germany, France and Britain also
contrasted with the United States, where authorities are still
worried enough about jobs and growth to be taking new steps on
taxes and bond-buying to stimulate the economy.
 German industrial production rose by 2.9 percent on the
month in seasonally adjusted terms, beating even the most upbeat
forecasts in a Reuters median poll of 1.0 percent, preliminary
data from the Economy Ministry showed on Wednesday.
 That adds to evidence Europe's largest economy will start
2011 in high gear, even as a sovereign debt crisis and resulting
budget austerity undermines hopes for growth in Spain, Portugal,
Ireland and others. 
 The crisis has already prompted Greece and Ireland to seek
EU/IMF aid and fears are spreading that Lisbon and possibly
Madrid could be next. 
 ""The data show the core countries in the euro zone are in
good shape, with Germany leading the pack. Only the peripheral
states are struggling,"" said Fabienne Riefer, an economist at
Postbank Research. ""The divergence is here to stay for 2011.""
 French firms capitalised on Germany's stronger imports by
exporting more to Germany in October and France's central bank
also raised its fourth quarter growth forecast to 0.6 percent in
a report on Wednesday.
 UK manufacturing figures were again upbeat, reinforcing the
case for countries to press on with strong budget consolidation.
 However, a survey of purchasing managers earlier this month
in Greece, which is going through its deepest recession since
1974, showed its manufacturing sector continued to contract in
November, with domestic demand weak. [ID:nSLAUME6JE]
 Meanwhile, a key gauge of business confidence in Portugal
fell for a second straight month in November. [ID:nLIS002514]
 
 CONSOLIDATE MORE 
 The strong tone contrasts with the United States, where the
jobless rate last month hit a seven-month high and President
Barack Obama has agreed to extend tax cuts for two years to
reinflate the economy.
 The deal with Republicans to preserve Bush-era tax cuts gave
stock markets a boost across the globe, but concerns it may also
spell longer-term budget strife drove U.S. bond yields to
six-month highs.
 That compares with efforts by the Federal Reserve, which
this week hardened its tone on a $600 billion bond-buying
programme that aims to bring yields and borrowing costs down.
 U.S. 10-year yields  are around 70 basis points
above where they were when the Fed announced its ""QE2""
bond-buying programme in early November.
 Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the Chinese central bank
pointed to questionmarks over Washington's fiscal approach in
comparison to European governments who have been desperately
cutting back on spending in a bid to ease pressure on market
yields.
 ""For now, market attention is still on Europe and for the
coming 6-12 months, it will not shift to the United States,"" Li
said when asked about U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to
extend tax cuts for all Americans. [ID:nN07288652]
 ""But we should be clear in our minds that the fiscal
situation in the United States is much worse than in Europe. 
 Employment in the United States barely grew in November,
hardening views the Federal Reserve will stick to its $600
billion plan to shore up the anemic recovery.
 
 IMPORTS WILL HELP
 Other data from Germany showed unadjusted imports rose to a
post-war record in October -- a sign of rising domestic demand
which European and global peers hope will spread the benefits of
German growth and help ease global imbalances. [ID:nLDE6B707H]
 Euro zone peers have criticised Germany for its reliance on
exports and weak consumer spending but imports from euro zone
countries to Germany rose 17 percent compared to a year ago.
 ""As domestic demand recovers in Germany, that may help the
peripheral countries, but that won't be a topic before 2012,""
said Riefer at Postbank.
 Economists expect the euro zone economy to expand 1.7
percent in an uneven recovery this year, the highest in two
years of polling. It is then expected to slow to 1.4 percent
next year before picking up again to 1.7 percent in 2012.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2010 09:32AM ET</span>",Q+A-Changes ahead at Hungary's central bank," Dec 8 (Reuters) - Hungary's government plans to change the
central bank law to let a parliamentary committee fill all
vacant posts on the central bank's Monetary Council next year
when the mandates of four rate setters expire.
 The move would leave central bank (NBH) Governor Andras
Simor and his two deputies in a minority on the seven-member
panel and could pave the way for monetary policy changes
favoured by the government.
 The changes in the bank will come in a crucial period when
markets will be nervous anyway as the government must detail a
savings plan of up to 800 billion forints ($3.78 billion) to
persuade investors that its economic policy is sustainable.
 To see main story please double click on
 
 Q: How does the government plan to change the law?
 A: According to a planned amendment, parliament's economic
committee -- where government lawmakers have a majority -- would
be allowed to appoint new Monetary Council members.
 That would strip Simor -- often criticised by the government
-- of his right to nominate two members. The six-year mandates
of Tamas Banfi, Peter Bihari, Csaba Csaki and Judit Nemenyi
expire on March 1 next year. The terms of Simor and his
deputies, Julia Kiraly and Ferenc Karvalits, end in 2013.
 The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to publish its
view on the planned changes in the next two weeks. Analysts said
the change could hurt the NBH's independence, and the ECB and
the European Union could criticise the government. Sanctions
are unlikely as the move does not affect existing mandates.
 Earlier the EU called on Hungary to change a law which cut
public sector pay -- including at the central bank -- which it
said infringed the bank's independence. The government has kept
the measures in place.

 Q: Will the central bank lift its inflation target?
 A: According to a report by news portal index.hu, the
government wants to have the central bank raise its inflation
target to 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent.
 The NBH projects 3.3 percent average inflation for 2012, and
the government sees 3.3-3.5 percent for the years to 2015 --
levels which would also mean that the country is unlikely to
join the euro zone before the second half of this decade.
 Setting the inflation target has been the central bank's
exclusive jurisdiction since 2007. A review of the target is due
next year. Analysts said the new Monetary Council was likely to
lift the target, as that would allow it to loosen.
 
 Q: What else can change in monetary policy?
 A: Three months ago, the NBH batted back government
suggestions that the bank should use monetary stimulus to help
the economy recover.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said the NBH should buy
corporate bonds, primarily those of the state development bank
MFB, in the secondary market to help provide liquidity to the
economy and foster economic growth.
 The bank has said that monetary stimulus measures could
further lift inflation and that the government had more
efficient fiscal policy tools to stimulate economic growth.
 The new Monetary Council could adopt the idea of monetary
stimulus.
 
 Q: What can the changes mean to markets?
 A: The conflict between the government and the NBH has
already contributed to pressure on the forint and Hungarian
government bonds and could further increase market volatility if
the euro zone debt crisis keeps investors wary of economies
where they see fiscal vulnerabilities.
 Hungary's risk assessment hinges on developments in the euro
zone and the details of the promised savings package, while bad
news about the NBH can magnify volatility, analysts said.
 Hungarian governments have tended to intervene in central
bank affairs in the hope they can achieve looser monetary
policy. But past developments, including an enlargement of the
Council in 2005, showed new appointees acted independently when
the panel decided on interest rates, analysts say.
 If the inflation target is raised, that may in itself dent
the NBH's credibility and lead to a weakening of the forint and
a rise in long-end government bond yields.
 Monetary stimulus is also a risk to markets as it may
increase inflation pressure, while the impacts are unpredictable
as the government has not detailed its idea.

 By Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Changes planned by Hungary's
government to how central bank policymakers are appointed will
likely lead to the end or reverse of its monetary tightening
cycle and potentially a bond-buying programmme to boost growth.
 After urging Governor Andras Simor to quit and criticising
the bank for keeping rates too high, the centre-right government
is poised to change the central bank law so it can appoint all
four rate-setting spots coming vacant next year. Hungarian
media have reported Prime Minister Viktor Orban may also push
the new board to raise their medium-term inflation target to 3.5
percent, from 3 percent to justify lower interest rates and
support his anti-austerity, pro-growth strategy.
 Orban's government has not denied the report, which follows
a series of decisions to raise budget revenues with crisis taxes
on banks and other firms and the effective re-nationalisation of
$14 billion in private pension assets.
 The central bank has criticised those measures and, saying
they were fuelling price growth and undermining Hungary's risk
profile, raised interest rates last week to 5.5 percent.
 It warned it could hike more, although that bias now looks
set to last only until the new central bankers take their posts.
 ""The sentiment of the next Monetary Council will be more
dovish, more willing to lower rates and there can be easing
totaling 50 basis points next year,"" said Zoltan Torok of
Raiffeisen. ""But they will not start to cut rates wildly."" 
 He said a rate cut of half a percent, from the current level
of 5.5 percent, could potentially push the forint to weaken to,
say, 300 per euro, from 278 on Wednesday, which would quickly
end any easing cycle.
 
 CREDIBILITY
 Investors have called for more sustainable policy from
Orban, who has rejected budget cuts in favour of tax cuts and
other measures his government hopes will boost growth and push
up budget revenues enough to keep its budget deficit below the
EU ceiling of 3 percent of annual output.
 On Monday, ratings agency Moody's downgraded Hungary to the
brink of ""junk"" status and left its outlook on negative, saying
it could cut further unless the government adopts a fiscal
policy to keep the deficit low in the longer term.
 The forint lost 1 percent on the Moody's move and economists
said Orban's push for easier monetary policy could cause further
losses as it would undermine the bank's credibility, erode
Hungary's risk profile, and hamper Budapest's efforts to raise 4
billion euros worth of foreign bonds next year.
 ""A change in the inflation target is not a credible or
sensible suggestion,"" said Nigel Rendell of RBC. ""Any government
ruling to change this would be seen as very negative for Hungary
and would push up public sector borrowing costs.""
 The new Monetary Council could also adopt a government plan
to introduce monetary stimulus to help economic growth and that
also entails risks to markets as its details are unknown.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said in September that the
central bank could buy corporate bonds, primarily those of the
state development bank MFB, to boost growth.
 
 RATE BATTLE
 The government will present the law to parliament once it
gets an evaluation from the European Central Bank, expected as
early as this week or next.
 Analysts say legal sanctions against Hungary are unlikely if
the government changes the law as planned, stripping Simor of
his ability to name two of the central bank posts coming open
and pushing the bank to pursue easier policy.
 But it could trigger criticism from the European Central
Bank and the European Union, which have already slammed Orban's
special taxes on big companies and the government's plan to take
over assets from private pension funds to plug budget holes.
 ""This will be a tough issue in the coming months,"" said
Daniel Bebesy, analyst at Budapest Fund Management. ""What has
happened so far has been risky already... This can really hurt
if the international market sentiment worsens.""
 The EU and ECB have also criticised a decision to cut the
pay of Simor and his deputies and the government's calls for him
to step down, which he has refused to do. The terms of Simor and
his deputies Ferenc Karvalits and Julia Kiraly will end in 2013.
 The law change ""is of course very detrimental to the
independence of the central bank... (and) might trigger a
negative approach in certain (EU) countries"", one EU diplomat in
Budapest told Reuters.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2010 09:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-EU energy chief clamps down on insider trading," * EU executive aims to prevent energy market abuse from 2012
 * Targets insider trading, energy price manipulation
 * Rules cover spot trades and derivatives markets
 
 (Adds quotes)
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Europe's energy chief launched a
clampdown on Wednesday against insider trading and market
manipulation in wholesale gas and power markets.
 Energy commissioner Guenther Oettinger said the new rules
for 2012 aim to prevent companies from withholding energy
capacity to force up power prices in a market estimated to be
worth around 500 billion euros ($660 billion) per year.
 That should also help protect consumers against spikes in
domestic energy prices.
 A team of about 15 market monitors, based at the Agency for
the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in Slovenia, will be
handed extensive powers to collect market data and act on
manipulative behaviour.
 ""We believe there have been one or more cases where power
prices were influenced by unnecessary profits from power
trading,"" Oettinger told reporters. ""Transparency would make
that impossible.""
The rules will force market players to disclose any price
sensitive information, such as a power station shut-down, before
trading. They will also make it illegal to spread rumours or
give false signals about the supply, demand or price of gas or
electricity.
 ""For the trading environment, it means that it will take
some edge off utility traders, as they would lose an important
market advantage that some have so far successfully used for
themselves,"" said one power trader in Germany.
 ""Economically, this makes sense as it would level the
playing field a little bit and could therefore attract some risk
capital.""
 
 PRICE MANIPULATION
 If the plans are approved by EU governments, the monitors
will be able to raid offices, demand access to any document,
including telephone records, and temporarily prohibit trades on
Europe's 15 energy exchanges.
 The Commission estimates up to 10,000 energy deals take
place each day, about a quarter of them on exchanges and the
rest over-the-counter.
 ""Experience in the UK shows that even well-intended
regulation can have unintended consequences,"" warned David
Porter at Britain's Association of Electricity Producers. ""As
always, the devil is in the detail.""
 While it is difficult to prove market abuse is occurring,
the European Commission says a 2008 probe of German utility E.ON
has raised concerns that power generators are capable of
manipulating power prices by temporarily withdrawing generation
capacity from the market.
 EU officials also cite a case of market abuse in the United
States in 2006 where markets were manipulated by hedge fund
Amaranth, and they have concluded that a similar play in Europe
would cost consumers about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion).
 The laws go further than the EU's planned reform of MiFID
trading rules, also announced on Wednesday, by creating a
monitoring team to cover spot trades as well as the derivatives
market.
 European power industry body Eurelectric welcomed the move.
 ""Most of the important details and definitions will be
decided later, mainly by the Commission and ACER,"" said
Eurelectric analyst Marco Foresti.
 ""They will have to work carefully over the coming months to
avoid gaps in the framework, and especially overlaps with other
regulations, or grey areas.""
 German utility RWE also welcomed the new rules, and said
they should be extended to Europe's market for carbon emissions
permits, the Emissions Trading Scheme, which is closely
interlinked with gas and power markets.
 EU officials say they would looking at the integrity of the
carbon market in the year ahead.

(Adds quotes, background)
 BERLIN, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Germany believes there are legal
and economic hindrances to the introduction of joint euro-zone
government bonds which would require fundamental changes to the
European Union's underlying treaty, Berlin said on Wednesday.
 Chief German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said his
country's opposition to the idea, mainly championed by Eurogroup
head Jean-Claude Juncker, would not change in the coming weeks,
though he reiterated Germany's commitment to the joint currency.
 ""There are economic and legal problems that are standing in
the way of any introduction of euro bonds at the moment,""
Seibert said. ""Nothing has changed in our point of view.""
 He said there were several legal hurdles in the way and euro
bonds would not be possible without fundamental changes of the
Lisbon Treaty.
 ""The introduction of euro bonds would require more thorough
changes, in principle a different European structure and we
don't see that at the moment,"" he said. ""Thus, the German
government remains opposed to the proposal.
 ""The legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will
remain in place for the weeks ahead,"" he added.
 Asked about Juncker's criticism of Germany's rejection of
euro bonds, Seibert said: ""In general it certainly doesn't help
anyone in Europe when the individual players in Europe call each
other 'un-European'. 
 ""I don't think this talking against each and about each
other should stop. The markets are taking due note of this
disunity,"" he said.
 Juncker was quoted as saying on Wednesday Germany rejected
the idea of a common euro zone bond without studying the
proposal in detail. Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, also
said Germany had a non-European way of doing European business.
 ""The proposal is being rejected before it has been
studied,"" Juncker was quoted as saying in an interview with Die
Zeit newspaper to be published on Thursday. ""Germany's thinking
is a bit simple on that."" [ID:nLDE6B70UI]
 Earlier this week, Juncker and Italian Finance Minister
Giulio Tremonti called for the issuance of joint European
sovereign bonds -- or E-bonds -- to assert the ""irreversibility
of the euro"".
 The plan has come up against strong resistance from Germany,
which wants to ensure governments are kept under pressure from
bond markets to avoid a repeat of the years of easy borrowing
that led to Europe's debt crisis.
 A meeting of the group of euro zone finance ministers on
Monday ended with no fresh action to stem the currency bloc's
debt crisis and Juncker saying that the issue of a common bond
had not even been broached.
 ""Germany stands fully behind the euro,"" Seibert said. ""The
euro is more than just money,"" he said.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2010 08:44AM ET</span>",Ten EU countries plan to go it alone on EU patent," PARIS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Ten European Union governments,
frustrated by deadlocks over the creation of an EU-wide patent
due to a language dispute, plan to push ahead without
recalcitrant countries, a letter released on Wednesday said.
 Hopes of slashing huge patenting costs have been stymied for
years at EU level and a recent attempt to end the impasse failed
when Spain and Italy insisted their languages be included along
with German, English and French as official patent languages.
 In the letter to EU Internal Markets Commissioner Michel
Barnier, 10 countries, including France and Germany, said it was
clear the 27-nation bloc would be unable to reach a unanimous
agreement within a reasonable timeframe.
 They urged the European Commission, the EU's executive body,
to allow them to go ahead as a smaller group with establishment
of a common patent, according to the text of the letter, which
was released to the media by the French finance ministry.
 The letter was also signed by Slovenia, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden.
 In Brussels, a spokeswoman for Barnier confirmed receiving
the letter and said it would be discussed by EU countries and
the Commission at a meeting on Friday.
 The EU has tried since the 1960s to simplify its complex and
costly system of patenting across a membership that now spans 27
countries, but it has stumbled on how to pare the number of
languages used and streamline legal challenges.
 A European patent already exists but it is in effect a
bundle of national patents as it has to be validated in each
country, a costly process in terms of legal and translation fees
that can ultimately push the cost of a patent far higher than in
the United States.
 This makes a European patent cost as much as 20,000 euros,
10 times more than its U.S. equivalent, which costs about 1,850
euros.
 In July, Barnier proposed a deal limiting the number of
languages to three: English, German and French, but the solution
has failed to win the unanimous backing of EU member states.

(Adds background)
 OSLO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Mutually owned insurer Gjensidige
further narrowed the price range for its initial public offering
on Wednesday to between 58 and 60 crowns, and added that the
full offering was oversubscribed throughout the new range.
 If all Gjensidige's shares are sold, the IPO could raise as
much as 12 billion Norwegian crowns ($2 billion) in what looks
set to be Norway's largest offering since 2001.
 The Gjensidige IPO and a concurrent $2 billion share sale by
Denmark's TDC telecoms firm highlight recovering Scandinavian
economies and share valuations. Investor interest in IPOs has
picked up worldwide in the second half of 2010, though euro-zone
debt troubles have tempered optimism.
 The company as a whole would be valued at between 29 billion
and 30 billion crowns.
 Gjensidige did not specify how many shares it would float,
but has said 25 to 40 percent of the company's 500 million
shares would be offered -- that is, between 125 million and 200
million shares.
 All of Gjensidige's 500 million shares are now owned by the
Gjensidige Foundation.
 A company spokesman said information about the size of the
share sale and the exact prize would be made public either late
on Thursday or early on Friday.
 Bookbuilding for the IPO closes on Thursday, and the company
expects to begin trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange on Friday.
 Some analysts see the Gjensidige IPO as a way for the firm
to pursue mergers and acquisitions, perhaps including a tie-up
with Norwegian life insurer Storebrand. Gjensidige is already
Storebrand's largest shareholder, with a strategic 24.3-percent
stake.
 Separately, sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Denmark's
TDC is most likely to be priced at 51 crowns per share, the
middle of its original range.

 By Tamawa Desai and Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday on a
spike in U.S. Treasury yields after a proposed extension of tax
cuts raised growth expectations for the U.S. economy.
 Traders took their cue to buy the dollar from a rise in the
10-year U.S. Treasury yield to 3.25 percent, a level not seen
since late June.
 Higher yields were seen as dollar supportive near-term,
despite the adverse fiscal impact of the U.S. government's tax
plan.
 Analysts said the dollar would be buttressed by higher
Treasury yields ahead of a 10-year U.S. bond auction later in
the day and a 30-year auction on Thursday.
 Auctions at the end of the year tend to attract tepid demand
as liquidity dries up, but some in the market say that if the
sales go smoothly, yields will likely back down, withdrawing
some support for the dollar.
 ""The move in spreads in a thinning market has prompted some
people who had been short on the dollar to put back on some
positions,"" said Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe
Generale.
 ""But there's little chance for high yields to linger, apart
from the supply issue,"" he said, adding that dollar's rally
would be short lived.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a
basket of major currencies, rose 0.4 percent from late U.S.
levels to 80.167, moving above its 100-day moving average at
79.981. If sustained that would be a bullish signal.
 The greenback, which made its biggest one-day gain against
the yen in nearly three months on Tuesday, rose a further 0.4
percent to 83.90 yen. It briefly rose above 84 yen, where there
is a resistance band through 84.40 that has capped its recent
rally.
 The euro fell 0.1 percent $1.3244. Its failure this week and
last to hold above $1.3400 suggests a probe lower, with a
sustained break of $1.3180 opening the way for a test of
$1.3060/50.
 Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East accounts were
seen around $1.3200 and $1.3180, respectively, traders said, and
few analysts expect the euro to break below $1.30 anytime soon.
Ireland moved a step closer to securing bailout funds after
passing the first in a series of votes on its toughest budget on
record, but traders said investors were still likely to sell the
euro on any bounce given broader worries about the European
Union's ability to keep debt problems from spreading.
 Markets concerns over North Korea firing artillery shells in
a suspected military drill were also helping the dollar
 UPBEAT
 Analysts said the dollar's outlook appeared well-supported
in the near term.
 ""The market seems happy for now to follow U.S. yields which
have boosted the dollar,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist
at UBS in London.
 The yield jump made the dollar more attractive to those
chasing higher yields and cuts the yield advantage of currencies
such as the Australian dollar, which slipped 0.3 percent on the
day to $0.9815.
 Bucking Wednesday's dollar-buying trend, sterling rose 0.2
percent to $1.5790, shaking off early losses after an unexpected
jump in UK factory orders cemented the view the trundling
manufacturing sector was helping the economy recover.
 Market participants say dollar positioning is more or less
flat at the moment, and that few investors are keen to take on
significant long positions at the moment.
 As a result, the year-end climb in the dollar seen in 2009
may prove elusive, some analysts say.

was quoted as saying on Wednesday.
 Juncker, who is also Prime Minister of Luxembourg, also said
Germany had a non-European way of doing European business.
 Earlier this week, Juncker and Italian Finance Minister
Giulio Tremonti called for the issuance of joint European
sovereign bonds -- or E-bonds -- to assert the ""irreversibility
of the euro"". 
 But the plan came up against strong resistance from Germany,
which wants to ensure governments are kept under pressure from
bond markets to avoid a repeat of the years of easy borrowing
that led to Europe's debt crisis.
 ""The proposal is being rejected before it has been studied,""
Juncker was quoted as saying in an interview with Die Zeit
newspaper to be published on Thursday. ""Germany's thinking is a
bit simple on that.""
 Juncker said he had not proposed a single interest rate to
bundle national debt on a European level but instead, a large
part of the debt would be at national rates.
 A meeting of the group of euro zone finance ministers on
Monday ended with no fresh action to stem the currency bloc's
debt crisis and Juncker saying that the issue of a common bond
had not even been broached.

 * China was ""constructive and creative"" in brainstorming
 * Now waiting to see what happens in the negotiations
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The United States is encouraged by
China's approach in the run-up to intensified talks on a new
global trade deal, the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade
Organization said on Wednesday.
 Now it is waiting to see whether that will be reflected in
actual negotiations on the long-stalled Doha round, said Michael
Punke, who is also Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.
 Punke's comments are one of the strongest signs yet that the
Doha round, launched more than nine years ago and deadlocked for
much of the past two, could finally come together in 2011.
 Leaders at the G20 summit in Seoul and the APEC summit in
Yokohama last month called for a conclusion of the deal -- which
could boost the world economy by hundreds of billions of dollars
by creating new trade flows -- and said next year offered a
narrow window of opportunity.
 One of the main barriers to a deal has been a call by the
United States for big emerging countries like China, India and
Brazil to do more to open their markets to competition than is
currently on the table.
 ""We've been encouraged the last couple of weeks and months
by a very constructive attitude on the part of the Chinese,""
Punke told Reuters in an interview.
 That ""creative and constructive"" approach was evidenced in a
series of meetings of small groups of key WTO ambassadors to
thrash out possible ways of breaking the Doha deadlock, he said.
 ""But that was brainstorming and so now we're about to find
out if that attitude will carry into actual negotiations. And
we're hopeful on that front but we also intend to test where
we're at,"" Punke said.
 The United States and China are holding high-level bilateral
trade talks next week in China, which Punke will take part in. 
 In Geneva, the WTO's 153 members are holding a packed series
of negotiations with different groups of ambassadors and senior
officials this month and next, following the G20 and APEC calls.
 
 MIXED SIGNALS FROM INDIA
 Washington wants the big emerging economies to negotiate
duty-free agreements for individual industrial sectors, such as
chemicals or electrical goods, beyond any general cuts in
tariffs, something they have been wary of.
 China had shown some willingness to consider a Japanese
compromise proposal to apply such tariff elimination to baskets
of products within a sector, rather than the entire sector,
according to Punke.
 He said the G20 and APEC summits had sent a very strong
political signal that they wanted negotiators to reach a deal.
 ""Now we've got that political signal we need to sync it up
with the negotiating reality,"" he said ""The question is, are we
now, post-Seoul, about to enter those negotiations.""
 The picture in the run-up to the intensified negotiations
was less clear with Brazil and India, he said.
 Brazil is currently undergoing a political transition
following the election of Dilma Rousseff as president and the
United States hopes the new administration taking office on Jan.
1 will signal its commitment to a Doha deal, Punke said.
 India was sending mixed signals, showing leadership on the
negotiations on some days but less so on others, he said.
 He said the United States has not yet started real
negotiations with any of the three emerging powers that would
signal the talks had entered the ""end-game.""
 That is the stage where states start to make trade-offs
across the board, for instance seeking greater access for car
exports in exchange for cutting farm subsidies, moving on from
negotiations within the individual silos of agriculture,
industrial goods and services.
 Punke said that the United States recognised this would
require it to put more on the table as well.
 ""We would be naive if we didn't believe that the very
definition of negotiation is give and take, and we expect and
are ready to participate in a process of give and take as part
of this move we hope into an end-game,"" he said.
 Asked whether the tight fiscal situation could encourage
Washington to offer further cuts in expensive agricultural
subsidies, he noted that the United States had already offered
dramatic cuts in farm support in the talks.

 BEIJING, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will be a safe
investment for the next six to 12 months because global
markets are focused on the euro zone's troubles but America's
fiscal health is worse than Europe's, an adviser to the
Chinese central bank said on Wednesday.	
 Li Daokui, an academic member of the central bank's
monetary policy committee, said that U.S. bond prices and the
dollar would fall when the European economic situation
stabilised.	
 ""For now, market attention is still on Europe and for the
coming 6-12 months, it will not shift to the United States,""
Li said, when asked about U.S. President Barack Obama's plan
to extend tax cuts for all Americans. [ID:nN07288652]	
 ""But we should be clear in our minds that the fiscal
situation in the United States is much worse than in Europe.
In one or two years, when the European debt situation
stabilises, attention of financial markets will definitely
shift to the United States. At that time, U.S. Treasury bonds
and the dollar will experience considerable declines.""	
 U.S. Treasury prices fell sharply for a second day on
Wednesday as the proposed tax deal sparked concerns over the
government's ability to service its massive debt burden.
Moody's Investors Service said it is worried the tax cuts
could become permanent, hurting U.S. finances and credit
ratings in the long run. [ID:nN07283493] [ID:nN07282425]	
 In Europe, Ireland's parliament passed the first in a
series of resolutions underpinning its 2011 austerity budget
on Tuesday, marking the first step in a lengthy approval
process. But investors are now worried that the region's debt
crisis could engulf Portugal next, or Spain. [ID:nWLA0218] 
 China has a big stake in the performance of dollar assets.
The country holds the world's biggest stock pile of foreign
exchange reserves at $2.64 trillion and an estimated
two-thirds of that is invested in dollar assets, including
U.S. Treasuries.	
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), an
arm of the central bank, is responsible for managing the
reserves.	
 Li was speaking on the sidelines of a financial forum in
Beijing. He sits on the monetary policy committee of the
central bank but does not have real influence on key decisions
on interest rates and the yuan.	
 
 ROBUST CHINA GROWTH	
 China's annual economic growth will exceed 9.5 percent in
2011 and will remain above 9 percent through the coming
decade, Li told the forum.	
 The long-term growth outlook would be underpinned by the
need to continue investing in infrastructure, he said.	
 ""China has a vast domestic demand that is untapped, and
that's the fundamental difference between China now and Japan
in 1985,"" Li told a forum.	
 In addition, China would have to spend a lot on ""low
carbon"" industries, lending more support for the economy, he
said.	
 Li also predicted that global commodities prices,
including oil, would rise sharply next year.	
 Speculation about a Chinese interest rate rise in the
coming days has intensified after an official newspaper
flagged the chances of an imminent move amid expectations of
rising inflation in November. [ID:nTOE6B602F]	
 Asked whether the central bank should raise interest
rates, Li said it should take steps to protect depositors.	
 Concerns about hot money inflows would be a factor when
the central bank starts considering whether to raise interest
rates, he added.

530,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2010 04:28AM ET</span>",Japan new retail fund inflows fall 47% in Nov-Lipper," TOKYO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Inflows into newly launched Japanese
investment trusts dropped 47 percent from the previous month to
$1.2 billion in November due to a dearth of hit funds, data from
fund research company Lipper showed.
 Still, retail investors continued to put money into existing
mutual funds as the seek higher returns than those offered by the
low-yielding bank and postal savings accounts where they have
historically kept the bulk of their assets.
 Newly launched investment funds, also known as ""toushin"",
drew 100.3 billion yen ($1.2 billion) of fresh retail money in
November, down from 188.3 billion yen the previous month, Lipper
data showed.
 Inflows dropped 69.2 percent against the same month a year
earlier, down for the seventh straight month on a year-on-year
basis.
 ""We've seen a lot of new popular funds over the last few
years, but we haven't heard of a new big hit product recently,""
an official of a Japanese brokerage said.
 ""There are already a variety of funds in the line-up. Over
the past few months, retail investors appeared to be more happy
about buying the existing funds.""
 The overall asset size of Japan's retail investment trust
market came to 61.87 trillion yen ($741 billion) in October,
according to the Investment Trusts Association. That is larger
than the economies of Turkey and Indonesia.
 The association has not yet disclosed data for November.
 Net inflows overall, including new and existing investment
trusts, totalled 408.7 billion yen in October. In September,
inflows reached a three-year high of 934.6 bln yen, the
association's data shows.
 Retail investors, a major force in financial markets with
some $15 trillion in personal assets, have been actively putting
money into investment trusts targeting China, Brazil and other
emerging markets.
 High-yield bond funds and currency-selective thematic funds
have also have attracted strong demand in the last few years.
 A Kokusai Asset Management fund that invests in shares of
China, Indonesia and India drew the strongest demand among new
funds launched in November, with initial inflows totalling 18.9
billion yen.

 * Unadjusted imports highest level in postwar history
 * Economists see exports remaining pillar of economy

(Adds economist quote, details, background)
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Germany's trade surplus narrowed
slightly in October on an unexpected fall in exports, but demand
for foreign goods was robust and economists saw no reason to
doubt the country's recovery.
 Adjusted for seasonal swings, exports fell 1.1 percent on
the month, while imports rose 0.3 percent, figures from the
Federal Statistics Office showed on Wednesday. That compared to
expectations for exports to rise 0.5 percent on the month and
imports to increase by 1.5 percent.
 The drop in exports was the biggest in six months, helping to
shrink October's trade surplus to 14.3 billion euros from 15.4
billion a month prior. Unadjusted imports stood at their highest
level in postwar history -- 72.6 billion euros, the Office said.
 ""There was a strong increase in September and now there was
a bit of a correction in October,"" said Thorsten Polleit from
Barclays Capital. ""Nevertheless exports remain a pillar of
economic growth.""
 ""The export success is stimulating consumption and
investment at home,"" he added. ""That's why the imports are
rising -- the domestic demand is improving.""
 Germany suffered its biggest postwar recession in 2009 when
its economy contracted 4.7 percent as global demand plummeted.
However, it has emerged faster than expected from the slump and
left most fellow euro zone countries trailing in its wake.
 Forward-looking indicators suggest Europe's largest economy
is now poised to strengthen its performance, with domestic
demand playing an ever-more important role even if overall trade
volumes should ebb in 2011.
 Manufacturing orders rose in October, rebounding despite a
fall in euro zone demand as the sector sidestepped a fall in
exports from countries which share the common currency thanks to
an increasing focus on emerging markets.
 A survey released last week showed growth accelerating in
November on new orders, allowing employers to hire at their
fastest pace since a survey-record high posted in March 2008.
 
 WORLDWIDE SLOWDOWN
 An abundance of recent positive data suggests Germany will
head into next year full of momentum, but has raised concerns it
is leaving other euro zone countries too far behind.
 The trade data from October should work to allay some of
those concerns -- it showed German demand lending increasing
support to trading partners who share the euro.
 Imports from other euro zone countries to Germany rose 17
percent in October compared to the same month a year earlier,
while a broader category covering the entire EU showed imports
rose 18.3 percent.
 Economists say rising private consumption in Germany is
playing an increasingly important role.
 European Union members like France, which have in the past
decried Germany's traditionally weak consumer spending as a
cause of economic imbalances within the bloc, should find some
satisfaction in the trade data.
 Meanwhile, export-oriented companies are also showing signs
of improvement. Steelmaker ThyssenKrupp late last month forecast
higher profits in 2011 driven by solid economic growth at home
and in emerging economies. 
 ""Business is running very good abroad for companies,"" said
Alexander Koch form Unicredit. ""That suggests that this was only
a short-term correction for exports.""
 Germany's upbeat data rush has led forecasters to boost
their estimates for the months ahead, with the Bundesbank now
expecting the economy to grow 3.6 percent in 2010 and reach
pre-crisis levels by 2011.
 Those forecasts, an upward revision from the central bank's
previous outlook, top government estimates for 3.4 percent
growth this year and 1.8 percent growth in 2011.
 Hurdles do remain for Germany's export sector however,
traditionally the economy's main growth engine.
 Economists expect the global economic recovery to downshift
next year as the U.S. rebounds less quickly than expected and
growth in emerging countries moderates.
 ""The dynamic growth with exports will nevertheless weaken a
bit in the months ahead,"" said Joerg Lueschow from WestLB. ""The
reason for that is that worldwide growth will probably slow
somewhat. That will hit our exports with a bit of a time lag.""

TOKYO/SINGAPORE)
 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains on
Wednesday on a spike in U.S. Treasury yields as a proposed
extension of tax cuts raised growth expectations for the U.S.
economy.
 Traders took their cue as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
rose to 3.25 percent, a level not seen since late June and
beyond Tuesday's high of 3.18 percent.
 The rise in yields was broadly seen as dollar supportive
near-term, despite the adverse fiscal impact of the U.S.
government's tax plan.
 ""At the moment, the market is taking the rise in U.S. yields
as a positive for the dollar rather than a supply story,"" said
Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
""There are rising expectations for growth, where growth is a
scarce commodity.""
 U.S. yields would likely provide short-term direction, and
markets would keep a close eye on a 10-year U.S. bond auction
later in the day and a 30-year auction on Thursday, he added.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a
basket of major currencies, rose 0.5 percent from late U.S.
levels to 80.250, moving above its 100-day moving average at
79.981, which if sustained would be a bullish signal.
 The greenback, which made its biggest one-day gain against
the yen in nearly three months on Tuesday, rose a further 0.3
percent to 83.72 yen, nearing an 84.00-84.40 resistance band
that has capped its recent rally.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent $1.3221, nearing the bottom of its
recent $1.3200-3450 range. Its failure this week and last to
hold above $1.3400 suggests a probe lower, with a sustained
break of $1.3180 opening the way for a test of $1.3060/50.
 Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East accounts were
seen around $1.3200 and $1.3180, respectively, traders said.
 Ireland moved a step closer to securing bailout funds after
passing the first in a series of votes on its toughest budget on
record, but traders said investors were still likely to sell the
euro on any bounce given broader worries about the European
Union's ability to keep debt problems from spreading.
 The dollar also gained as markets were spooked after North
Korea fired artillery shells in a suspected military drill.
 David Forrester, G10 FX strategist for Barclays Capital
in Singapore, said the dollar's outlook appeared well-supported.
 ""The Obama agreement to extend Bush tax cuts, that places
less of an onus on monetary policy to stimulate the U.S.
economy,"" he said.
 The correlation between the dollar and long-term Treasury
yields has declined recently, Forrester said, which could be due
in part to position squeezing, or long liquidation, in the
Treasury market and thinning volumes as the year-end draws near.
 Still, the yield jump made the dollar more attractive to
those chasing higher yields and cuts the yield advantage of
currencies such as the Australian dollar. The Australia/U.S.
10-year yield spread narrowed to about 240 basis points, well
off a November high of 275.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.9805, backing
further off parity with the greenback hit in November.
 Other risk-related currencies were mixed, with the New
Zealand dollar down 0.7 percent while the Canadian dollar was
little changed against the greenback.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Asian and European stocks rose on
Wednesday as a deal on U.S. tax cuts offered some optimism over
the outlook for growth, although the prospect of higher national
debt drove U.S. bond yields to near six-month highs.
 European equities rallied as investors shifted their
attention from euro zone debt worries to focus on the prospects
for further recovery, while Wall Street was set for a mixed
open.
 The U.S. plan for a fiscal boost to its economy came as one
senior Chinese official expressed concern about America's
long-term financial health, and contrasts sharply with euro zone
governments bearing down hard on public deficits.
 ""It's becoming increasingly clear the U.S. is taking a very
different approach to the Europeans in dealing with their debt
overhang ... they're reflating their way out of it and the
Europeans are going the opposite way,"" said Grant Turley,
strategist at ANZ.
 U.S. Treasury prices have fallen by 2 percent in two days
after President Barack Obama proposed extending tax cuts aimed
at support economic growth, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's
multi-billion dollar bond-buying programme, but unleashed fears
about the longer-term rise in the national debt level.
 In what one bonds trader described as a ""diabolical"" market,
10-year Treasury yields rose by 5 basis points to 3.19 percent,
having risen to 3.255 percent in Asian trading, their highest
since late June.
 ""At the moment, the market is taking the rise in U.S. yields
as a positive for the dollar rather than a supply story,"" said
Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
""There are rising expectations for growth, where growth is a
scarce commodity.""
 While the economy may gain a much-needed boost from the tax
cuts, the move will also likely swell the $1.3 trillion U.S.
budget deficit, which has already persisted for nearly two solid
years, and this prospect prompted investors to shed Treasuries,
thereby driving up the risk premiums on U.S. debt.
 ""The tax cuts have changed the market's landscape,"" said
Arihiro Nagata, fixed income manager at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp.
 ""A lot of people are now changing their scenarios. Many
economists are saying the tax cuts will push up U.S. growth by
0.5 to 1.0 percentage point.""

 GOLD, OIL DECLINE AS DOLLAR FIRMS
 The rise in U.S. borrowing costs gave the dollar an edge
over the euro among yield-hungry investors, thereby also
delivering a blow to gold, which has shed 2.5 percent since
hitting a record-high on Tuesday, as its investment appeal
diminishes as rates rise.
 The dollar strength pushed the euro towards important
support levels around $1.3200 as the European bloc comes under
pressure over high debt levels.
 Spot gold was down 0.3 percent on the day at $1,396.39
an ounce, having risen to an all-time high of $1,430.95 an ounce
on Tuesday.
 European equities edged higher, led by gains in the banking
sector, where the likes of Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas up
between 0.6 and 1.1 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was last up 0.2 percent at 1,118.25,
having struck its highest in over 26 months this week.
 With U.S. Treasuries under fire, German government bonds
fell, pushing yields on the benchmark 10-year Bund rose 4 basis
points to just shy of 3.0 percent.
 Meanwhile, the stronger dollar weighed on commodities.
 U.S. crude oil futures fell for the second day in a row by
0.5 percdent to $88.27 a barrel, while benchmark industrial
metal copper slid more than 1 percent to $8,785 per tonne after
hitting a fresh peak of $9,044 on Tuesday.

 STOCKHOLM, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Inflation expectations among
key financial and business groups in Sweden have risen in
recent months, a poll commissioned by the central bank showed
on Wednesday.	
 The survey of employee and employer organisations,
purchasing managers and money market players, carried out by
research group TNS Prospera, showed headline inflation was
seen at 1.9 percent in 12 months and 2.2 percent in two years.	
 The outcome compares with the previous poll published in
September when inflation was seen at 1.7 percent in 12 months'
time and 2.0 percent in two years.	
 The expectation for the central bank's repo rate was also
higher amongst all the interviewees, with the rate expected at
1.7 percent after a year, versus an earlier view of 1.3 percent.	
 Money market players alone see the repo rate at 1.9
percent in 12 months versus the 1.8 percent seen in a separate
survey published in November. After 24 months, the repo rate
was seen at 2.5 percent, unchanged from the previous survey.	
 The poll showed that interviewees saw gross domestic
product rising 3.5 percent in a year and by 3.2 percent after
2 years. Both were higher than the views expressed in the
September poll for GDP growth of 3.1 percent and 3.0 percent
respectively.

 By Charlotte Cooper and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The dollar firmed and
looked set to climb further on Wednesday, having powered up
across the board the day before on the back of a spike in U.S.
bond yields, while the euro slippped towards some significant
support levels.
 The greenback rose sharply on Tuesday, gaining 1 percent on
the yen and rising against the likes of the Australian dollar
after U.S. Treasury yields surged on a proposed extension in U.S.
tax cuts, which fuelled concerns about inflation and the cost of
the massive debt burden.
 The dollar pressed home its advantage in Asia, nearing 84.00
yen and pushing the euro within range of support levels just
above and below $1.3200.
 The rise in yields and widening in yield spreads is broadly
seen as dollar supportive near-term, despite the fiscal concerns,
while the U.S. economy stands to get a boost from the tax deal,
which could lift growth next year and also lessen the case for
bigger monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
 ""It could be that the market is somewhat buoyed for now by
the fact that the U.S. growth outlook for 2011 at least will
probably be a lot better than what we all thought a couple of
weeks ago,"" said Sue Trinh, senior FX strategist at RBC.
 David Forrester, G10 FX strategist for Barclays Capital in
Singapore said the dollar's outlook appeared well supported.

10-year yield spread narrowed to 238 basis points, well off a
November high of 275.
 ""For the dollar, how risk responds will be less important
than whether other competing government nominal and real yields
(notably Bunds and JGBs) keep up with Treasuries,"" said Alan
Ruskin, global head of currency strategy at Deutsche Bank.
 ""If 10-year U.S. yields consolidate in a 3 percent to 3.25
percent range, I could see the dollar and euro sharing the role
of financing currencies, as the other side of a muted long
emerging/commodity trade,"" he wrote in a note.
 The dollar, which made its biggest one-day gain against the
yen in nearly three months on Tuesday, rose a further 0.5 percent
to 83.88 yen, nearing an 84.00-84.40 resistance band that has
capped its recent rally.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent $1.3214, nearing the bottom of its
recent $1.3200-3450 range. But its failure to sustain moves above
$1.3400 suggested it might probe lower, with a sustained break of
$1.3180 support opening the way for a test of $1.3060/50.
 Ireland moved a step closer to securing bailout funds after
passing the first in a series of votes in its toughest budget on
record but traders said investors were still likely to sell the
euro on any bounce given broader worries about the European
Union's ability to keep debt problems from spreading.

 SINGAPORE, Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. government bonds
extended sharp losses on Wednesday, pushing the dollar higher
against the yen and the euro while sending most other
investors fleeing to the sidelines.	
 U.S. Treasuries prices plunged on Tuesday and yields
surged after President Obama proposed a deal to extend tax
cuts that would support economic growth but raise national
debt levels in the longer term.	
 The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose more than 4 basis
points from overnight U.S. levels in early Asian trade to
around 3.188 percent , its highest since late June.	
 ""In the short run this is good news, but two or three
years down the road foreign buyers of U.S. Treasuries may
start to balk,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at
Lenox Advisers in New York.	
 The move in Treasuries made the dollar more attractive to
investors looking for higher yields, pushing it up against the
yen, the euro and most emerging Asia currencies. The dollar
index against a basket of major currencies was up 0.4
percent.	
 The weaker yen gave the Japanese stock market a boost. The
benchmark Nikkei average hit its highest in almost
seven months, reversing Tuesday's move to rise more than 1
percent.	
 Major exporters such as Sony Corp and Hitachi
Construction were among the biggest gainers, both
adding more than 1 percent in early trade. A weaker domestic
currency helps exporters who are paid in foreign currency.	
 The selloff in Treasuries and the Nikkei's rise spurred
further losses in Japanese government bonds after the previous
day's weak 30-year debt auction. The yield on 10-year JGBs
rose to its highest since June. 
""A further rise (in Treasuries) would put pressure on some
of the higher correlatedÂ bondÂ markets in Asia such as
Singapore,Â Hong Kong and Thailand which have seen yields
rising in recent weeksÂ due to inflationary pressures and year
end profit taking,"" said Kenneth Akintewe,Â a fund manager at
Aberdeen Asset Management who helps manageÂ $5 billion inÂ Asian
fixed income assets.	
 ""Still, inflows into the region are very strong ... which
would mean any sharp selloff would be temporary and offer
attractive entry points.""	
 
 Other Asian stock markets stumbled as the suddenness and
size of the U.S. bond selloff added to uncertainty heading
into year-end.	
 South Korean stocks and the won fell
briefly on a report North Korea had fired an artillery round,
but partially recovered when it emerged it was a military
exercise, while weak resources stocks dragged Hong Kong stocks
down around 0.6 percent.	
 The MSCI Asia index excluding Japan was
down 0.7 percent, but with a year-to-date gain of around 12
percent was still well ahead of the main MSCI world index.	
 Asia has been one of the chief beneficiaries of flows of
capital from the United States, where the Federal Reserve is
pursuing a policy of printing more cash.	
 The euro fell to $1.322, wiping out Tuesday's
gains, and is expected to remain under pressure given
persistent concerns about high debt levels in the single
currency zone.	
 ""It's becoming increasingly clear the U.S. Is taking a
very different approach to the Europeans in dealing with their
debt overhang ... they're reflating their way out of it amd
the Europeans are going the opposite way,"" said Grant Turley,
strategist at ANZ.	
 Gold , which has gained almost one-third since the
start of the year, traded at $1,400 per ounce, down from its
most recent record high of over $1,430. 
 The precious metal's fall is expected to be temporary, as
it is firmly supported by its traditional appeal as a 'safe
haven' in contrast to the euro and the dollar, which are
undermined by worries about debt levels, and the prospect of
the U.S. central bank printing cash respectively.	
 The stronger dollar dragged down other dollar-denominated
commodities.	
 U.S. crude oil futures  fell for the second day in a
row, losing nearly a dollar to $87.76 per barrel, while
benchmark industrial metal copper slid almost 1
percent to $8,817 per tonne after hitting a fresh peak of
$9,044 on Tuesday.

Summit, click
http://www.reuters.com/summit/InvestmentOutlookDec10)
By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Investor guru Jim Rogers says
life on the farm will bring far more riches in coming years
than the trenches of Wall Street.
 Rogers, a commodities evangelist for more than a decade,
has tweaked his pitch, saying the producers of the world --
whether individuals, companies or countries -- will become the
new growth sector.
 In short, Rogers told the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook
Summit in New York, being productive, saving the fruits of your
labor, and owning hard assets hold the keys to a bright
future.
 ""All these people who got MBAs made a mistake. The city of
London and Wall Street are not going to be great places to be
in the next two or three decades. It's going to be the people
who produce real goods,"" he said.
 ""Throughout history we've had long periods when the
financial centers were in charge. But we've also had long
periods when people who produced real goods were in charge --
the farmers and the miners,"" Rogers said.
 Rogers, who rose to prominence after co-founding the now
defunct Quantum Fund with billionaire investor George Soros
some four decades ago, railed about the fiscal irresponsibility
of debtor governments and praised China and other Asian
countries because they save, work hard and invest in the roads,
schools and factories that beget tangible wealth.
 As an example, he said that commodity- and mineral-rich
Canada will fare far better than Belgium, the seat of European
bureaucracy.
 Rogers still touts commodities, despite a recent price
surge. Even with the benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB index of
19 commodities hitting its highest level on Tuesday since
October 2008, Rogers said commodities will continue to soar
over the next decade.
 ""They're very high, but they're going to be much, much
higher over the next decade. Even I'm going to be stunned, and
I'm the bull,"" he said.
 Spot gold hit an all-time high at $1,430.95 an ounce on
Tuesday, benchmark copper hit a record peak at $9,044 a tonne
in London and U.S. crude rose above $90 a barrel for the first
time in 26 months, before all turned lower.
 A year ago at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit, Rogers
said investors in oil, metals and grains should not sweat
sell-offs in those markets because the printing of money by
governments across the globe would push prices higher.
 Rogers reiterated on Tuesday that politicians are afraid to
bite the fiscal bullet and will opt to debase their country's
currency. He called the Chinese renminbi the world's safest
currency and again said gold would eventually rise above $2,000
an ounce.
 A bubble might exist in housing in China's coastal cities,
but he called it a price bubble and not harmful like the credit
bubble that was behind the U.S. housing debacle.
 ""We had a credit bubble here, perhaps the biggest credit
bubble in the whole world,"" he said. ""That kind of huge credit
bubble certainly is different than a price bubble. If people go
bankrupt in China, it's not going to bring down the Chinese
economy.""
 More currency crises loom, and creditor nations -- China,
South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore -- will
thrive, he said.
 Rogers singled out the United Kingdom as vulnerable to hard
times, and said the pound would underperform the euro over the
next five years.
 The United States also faces difficulties.
 ""The way you build an economy, a thriving economy is you
save and invest,"" he said. ""Productive capacity is what leads
to long-term growth of the economy. You don't build an economy
by going to the disco every night.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose the most
against the yen in nearly three months on Tuesday after a
proposed extension of U.S. tax cuts triggered higher Treasury
yields, though the longer-term impact on the greenback is less
clear given an already large U.S. deficit.
 The euro fell versus the dollar after it did not
convincingly break above $1.34. Analysts expect the euro zone
single currency to remain under pressure and slide below $1.30
in coming weeks as fears about the euro zone's debt problems
persist.
 U.S. 10-year Treasury yields posted their biggest one-day
rise since June 2009 as the proposed tax deal sparked concerns
over the government's ability to service its debt burden.
Moody's Investors Service said it is worried the tax cuts could
become permanent, hurting U.S. finances and credit ratings in
the long run.
 ""We've seen Treasury yields move quite a bit higher and
that's boosted the dollar,"" said Ronald Simpson, director of
currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida.
 In late trading, the dollar rose 1 percent to 83.50 yen, on
track for its biggest daily percentage gain since Sept. 15.
 An index of the dollar against a basket of other major
currencies rose 0.5 percent to 79.971, just below its 100-day
moving average at 80.015.
 Despite the rise in the dollar, some analysts said
deteriorating U.S. fiscal positions could pose risks to the
currency in the medium to long term. In recent years, dollar
bears have been worried about the ability of the United States
to continue funding its large deficits if foreign investors
lose faith in U.S. assets.
 ""There are structural risks to the dollar. The whole world
is cutting back on spending and the United States has just
announced tax cuts,"" said Jessica Hoversen, fixed income and
currency analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 ""However, the economic data has looked better. People are
still active buyers of U.S. Treasuries. There are arguments to
be made that the dollar won't aggressively resume its
downtrend,"" she added.
 FURTHER EURO LOSSES LIKELY
 The euro last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.3262 having hit
a session high of $1.3401 on trading platform EBS. Key
resistance lies at around $1.3472, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the euro's fall in November.
 Ireland's parliament passed the first in a series of
resolutions underpinning the 2011 budget on Tuesday, marking
the first step in a lengthy approval process.
 Investors continued to sell the euro on any bounce as
optimism about an Irish budget was overshadowed by broader
worries about the European Union's ability to keep debt
problems from spreading.
 Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, chairman and founder of
the $6.8 billion Greenlight Capital, said he doesn't expect the
euro to gain much traction against the dollar as the European
situation has yet to stabilize.
 ""It's still an open question. It's still in progress,"" he
said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit on Tuesday.
 Influential U.S. investor Jim Rogers told Reuters that euro
zone bailouts are corroding the value of the euro and that he
doesn't expect the euro to be around for 10 to 15
years.Harriman in New York, said the euro is also at risk of
dropping if China decides to implement a rate cut over the
weekend.

 By Steven C. Johnson and Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. government inflation data
is ""a sham"" and is causing the Federal Reserve to vastly
understate price pressures in the economy, influential U.S.
investor Jim Rogers said on Tuesday.
The U.S. central bank uses inflation data that relies too
heavily on housing prices, Rogers told the Reuters 2011
Investment Outlook Summit, and he criticized the Fed's $600
billion bond-buying program.
 Rogers, who rose to prominence after co-founding the now
defunct Quantum Fund with billionaire investor George Soros
some four decades ago, said he was betting against U.S.
Treasuries. ""I expect interest rates in the U.S. to go much,
much, much higher over the next few years,"" he said.
 The core personal consumption expenditure index, which
removes food and energy costs, is the Fed's favored measure of
inflation and was flat in October for the second straight
month.
 ""Everybody in this room knows prices are going up for
everything,"" Rogers told the Reuters Summit.
 The Fed began its $600 billion bond buying program last
month, its second round of quantitative easing, to boost a
sluggish U.S. economy, citing excessively low inflation and
high unemployment.
 The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since late
2008, and the 10-year Treasury yield hit 3.18 percent on
Tuesday, its highest since July.
 STILL BULLISH ON COMMODITIES
 On commodities, Rogers said he remains bullish in general,
particularly given loose monetary policies and high debt levels
in the United States and other Western economies.
 ""If the world economy gets better, commodities are going to
go up in price because there are shortages. If the world
economy does not get better, you should own commodities,
because (central banks) are going to print more money,"" he
said. ""Real assets are the way to protect yourself.
 Rogers also said the price of gold will rise eventually
above $2,000 an ounce. The price of spot gold on Tuesday hit a
record high of $1,430.95 an ounce before falling back to close
at $1,409.35.
 YUAN ATTRACTIVE, EURO'S DAYS MAY BE NUMBERED
 Among currencies, Rogers said the Chinese yuan is the most
attractive, and, when pressed, forecast that Beijing would
probably allow full convertibility by 2013.
 Though China manages the value of its currency, it began
letting it rise more rapidly against the dollar this year. The
dollar is down 2.7 percent against the yuan so far this year,
after barely budging in 2009.
 Rogers called the European Union's 85 billion euro bailout
for Ireland bad morally and ""bad economics,"" and said the
mishandling of Europe's debt crisis could spell the eventual
end of the common currency,
 ""They are corroding the value of the euro, and they are
corroding the value of the European community,"" he said. ""I
don't expect the euro to be around within 10 to 15 years
because they keep doing things like this and destroying the
value of the euro.""
 Portugal and Spain could be the next countries to require
assistance, he said. ""The way we are going right now, we are
all going to be bailed out, which is not going to make the
system better.""
 High debt levels in the United States and Britain will also
spell trouble for the dollar and British pound in the years
ahead, Rogers added.
 He said U.S. efforts to bail out its own troubled banks
after the financial crisis and the subsequent rise in public
debt may mean ""we are going to have another lost decade or
two.""

(Updates with U.S. markets' close)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices
fell sharply on Tuesday amid worries over the fiscal outlook,
while Wall Street stocks ended up only slightly as bond yields
rose and an insider trading scandal worsened.
 The euro was mostly weaker as Ireland's parliament debated
a tough austerity budget, reminding investors of the euro
zone's indebtedness, while the U.S. dollar benefited from
rising Treasury yields.
 Investors bailed out of U.S. Treasuries after President
Obama proposed a deal on tax cuts and unemployment payments
that would boost economic growth in the short term but raise
debt levels longer term.
 Moody's Investors Service said U.S. finances could suffer
in the long run, though it did not foresee a change to the
country's AAA credit rating in the next 18 months to two
years.[ID:nN07283861]
 ""This reduces revenue on top of extending jobless benefits,
which is bad for deficits. In the short run this is good news,
but two to three years down the road foreign buyers of U.S.
Treasuries may start to balk,"" said David Carter, chief
investment officer at Lenox Advisors in New York.
 Rising U.S. bond yields spooked the stock market with
investors worried that higher borrowing costs could hurt
corporate profits and consumer spending.
 ""The spike in interest rates could be enough to stop the
equity rally in its tracks,"" said Peter Boockvar, equity
strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York.
 Stocks in Europe and America initially gained in reaction
to President Obama's proposed tax plan which is seen boosting
U.S. economic growth and lowering unemployment. Concern about
rising U.S. bond yields and a widening probe by regulators into
insider trading saw stocks lose early gains and end little
changed in New York though. 
 News late in the trading day that federal authorities have
ramped up an investigation into insider trading on Wall Street
fueled selling in the equities market. [ID:nN07296421]
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended <.DJI> down 3.64
points, or 0.03 percent, at 11,358.55, with the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> up just 0.68 points, or 0.06 percent,
at 1,223.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.57
points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,598.49.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  saw
its biggest one-day sell off since June, with the yield rising
to 3.14 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 7/32, with the yield at 0.5318 percent. The 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond  was down 70/32, with the yield at
4.3703 percent.
 The Obama tax plan would cost $501 billion in lost tax
revenues, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office, at a time when investors are increasingly concerned
about U.S. budget deficits that have approached 10 percent of
economic output in recent years.
 The bond sell-off intensified after a disappointing
three-year debt auction and fears over its impact on bidding at
subsequent sales of 10-year and 30-year debt later this week,
they said.
 The U.S. dollar rose the most against the yen in nearly
three months on Tuesday after the proposed extension of U.S.
tax cuts triggered higher Treasury yields, though the
longer-term impact on the greenback is less clear given an
already large U.S. deficit.
 The euro fell versus the U.S. dollar and analysts expect
the euro zone single currency to remain under pressure and
slide below $1.30 in coming weeks as fears about the euro
zone's debt problems persist.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Global stocks jumped on
Tuesday, boosted by a compromise deal to extend expiring U.S.
tax cuts, while the euro rose on optimism that Ireland's
lawmakers will pass the toughest budget ever.
 Copper prices hit a record high, supported by Chinese
buying and a firmer euro. Gold also hit a record at $1,430.95

high on demand for heating fuel in parts of Europe and the

 U.S. government bonds dropped as the tax deal was seen as a
stimulus for the economy, benefiting stocks, commodities and
other risky assets.
 Despite its rise, the euro was vulnerable, with European
policymakers divided over how to tackle the region's debt
problem.
 U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled a deal late on Monday
to renew tax cuts for the middle class as well as for wealthy
Americans, as Republicans wanted. For details see

 The announcement was welcomed by the markets as investors
bet that the tax breaks would prompt increased spending and
buoy the economy as well as lessen chances investors would sell
shares.
 ""U.S. activity is reliant on consumer spending, so any move
to help consumer start spending money, particularly in the
Christmas period, is going to be seen as positive for the

 Meanwhile, the euro  was up 0.44 percent at $1.3363

 The dollar was up at 83.140 yen  after slipping to a
three-week low against the Japanese currency earlier in the

225 <.N225> down 0.3 percent.
 Clouding the euro's outlook, euro zone policymakers failed
to agree on new policies to tackle the region's debt crisis.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.18 percent at 79.429 as
the news to extend the Bush tax cuts in the United States was
seen by investors as dollar-negative.
 While the plan could accelerate U.S. growth, it is funded
through debt and expected to add significantly to the budget
deficit, thus would be another weight on the dollar.
 ""The likelihood that the Irish budget will pass and the
extension of U.S. tax cuts are working together to boost risk
appetite, which should last for the next few days but then
dissipate,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York.

 EYES ON EUROPE, COMMODITIES
 Euro zone policymakers have yet to show financial markets
that they can decisively resolve the region's debt problem.
Concerns remain that the debt crisis could spread from Greece
and Ireland to Portugal and possibly Spain.
 After a five-hour meeting, the bloc's finance ministers
said late on Monday they would be taking no new steps to tackle
the contagion, saying an existing emergency fund was
sufficiently big and that a proposal to issue euro zone bonds
had not even been broached. [ID:nLDE6B525H]
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking in Berlin,
rebuffed calls for a bigger financial safety net or joint euro
bonds.
 Commodities, meanwhile, shed some gains after touching
multiyear or record highs as macroeconomic factors and a firmer
euro boosted prices.
 Copper  rallied to a record high above $9,000 a
tonne before easing to $8,948 on rising demand expectations for
2011 against a backdrop of tight supply and a softer dollar.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 47 cents, or 0.53
percent, to $88.91 per barrel after rising above $90 a barrel
for the first time in 26 months.
 Spot gold prices  fell $10.90, or 0.77 percent, to
$1412.10 after touching a record high at $1,430.95 an ounce,
driven by fund buying ahead of year-end, the prospect of more
U.S. monetary easing and investor nervousness over the European
debt crisis.
 U.S. government bond prices stumbled as the proposed
extension of tax cuts raised concerns over inflation and the
federal government's ability to meet its long-term debt
burden.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 41/32, with the yield at 3.0805 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 3/32, with the yield at
0.4682 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 56/32, with the yield at 4.3427 percent.

 * Eyes further talks on permanent solution in March
 * Pension reformers score little at EU finmins' meeting

(Recasts with Polish PM Tusk)
 By Marcin Grajewski and Gabriela Baczynska
 BRUSSELS/WARSAW, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Poland is nearing a
temporary compromise with the European Union on looser public
finance rules for countries with pension reforms in place, Prime
Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday.
 Poland and eight other EU members want the bloc to allow
higher deficits for members that have overhauled their pension
systems and also seek more beneficial rules on public debt.
 Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said talks on a permanent
solution should be delayed until March.
 EU officials, however, say chances for fully meeting
Poland's demands are slim and that Warsaw would most likely have
to settle for something close to Brussels' original proposals.
 ""We are quite far away from a compromise that would fully
satisfy Poland but we are quite close to a temporary solution
that we hope can be agreed before mid-December,"" Tusk told a
news conference in Warsaw.
 In the past, the Commission has proposed that pension
reformers enjoy a five-year period of some leniency if their
budget deficit or public debt exceeds levels permitted by the
EU.
 ""Will deduction of pension reform costs apply for 5 or 10
years?... Will countries that have reformed their pension
systems be allowed (a deficit) of 4 or 4.5 percent instead of 3
percent as now? This is the area where we are nearing a
temporary compromise,"" said Tusk.
 
 EU SUMMIT
 Both Tusk and Rostowski said they did not want to burden a
summit of EU leaders next week with the pension issue as they
will also have to deal with a proposed treaty change needed to
set up a permanent bailout mechanism for euro zone countries
facing budget difficulties.
 ""We don't want this issue (pensions) to be an axis of
conflict at the summit. We can postpone it until March,""
Rostowski said in Brussels after EU finance ministers said there
had been limited progress on the pension issue.
 The August proposal of nine EU members to be allowed to
write off the full cost of pension reform from their deficit and
public debt came as part of a debate on sharpening EU budget
discipline rules to ward off a sovereign debt crisis.
 Belgium, which now holds the bloc's rotating presidency,
confirmed proposals similar to the European Commission's
previous offer would be sent to the EU summit on Dec.16-17.
 ""We are close to a compromise,"" said Belgian Finance
Minister Didier Reynders.
 Poland says its proposal would encourage other countries to
carry out reforms necessary because of their ageing populations,
but which have provoked protests in some cases.
 EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said the current
proposals ""strike the right balance between respect for the
Stability and Growth Pact (budget discipline rules) and taking
into account strong incentives to have pension system reforms"".
 Some politicians say prospects of EU disciplinary action for
a high deficit or debt may encourage a country to dismantle
pension reforms. Hungary has already suspended state transfers
to private pension funds to cut its deficit faster, prompting
Moody's to cut its rating by two notches.
 Poland, which is also looking at how to reform its pension
system to find savings and reduce its fiscal gap, will not take
the Hungarian route, Rostowski reiterated on Tuesday.

 * Private creditors should be involved in bailouts
 * Sees no serious threat to German growth from crisis

(Adds details, background)
 By Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The euro zone needs to increase
its members' fiscal discipline and the chance of sanctions on
budget offenders to solve its debt crisis, the chairman of the
German government's panel of economic advisers said.
""For the foreseeable future, it seems unrealistic to expect
a joint fiscal policy in the euro zone, even though that would
be very important for the success of the currency union,""
Wolfgang Franz told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Instead one should make an effort to secure the solidity of
individual national fiscal policies ... for instance by
significantly increasing the likelihood that sanctions will be
imposed in cases of fiscal misconduct,"" he added.
 Franz was referring to plans to give the euro zone the right
to impose financial sanctions on countries which implement bad
fiscal policies and do not respond to calls to change them.
 The panel of five wise men, which Franz chairs, advises the
government on economic policy. Germany is in support of ""as
automatic as possible"" sanctions but opposes calls for more
fiscal integration, such as through a common euro zone bond.
 ""I believe euro bonds are an inappropriate path. Instead,
one should establish a crisis management in which private
creditors will contribute to the risk under certain
circumstances,"" Franz said.
 ""That doesn't have to be a haircut straight away but it
could start with a suspension of interest payments or an
extension of the maturities of loans,"" he added.
 
 NO THREAT SEEN
 The sovereign debt crisis has prompted the 16 members of the
euro currency to allow some influence of fellow euro zone
countries on national policymaking at the expense of pushing for
their national interests.
 Plans to reform the Stability and Growth Pact now include a
range of steps to boost economic cooperation -- from EU vetting
of future national budget plans to monitoring competitiveness
trends, macroeconomic imbalances and structural reforms.
 Germany, the paymaster of the European Union, has emerged
quickly from its deepest post-war recession last year but has
left behind it some of its peers that are struggling with debt.
 ""At the moment I don't see a serious threat to our economic
growth,"" Franz said. ""The aid is mostly about debt guarantees.
If all goes well, the German state will profit from that.""
 However, a devaluation of the euro would make many imported
goods, such as fuel, more expensive, while a strengthening would
be tough on exports, Franz added.
 The wisemen expect economic growth this year of 3.7 percent,
to slow to 2.2 percent next year, higher than the government
forecast.

Summit, click

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - RCM Chief Investment Officer
Andreas Utermann said he expected global equities to gain
between 8 and 12 percent next year and that emerging market
currencies are set to appreciate significantly.
 But he said he was steering well clear of benchmark
government bonds with maturities of longer than 4 to 5 years,
believing them to be an ""accident waiting to happen"".
Speaking on Tuesday at the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook
Summit, Utermann was cautiously bullish about riskier assets
next year and suggested that investors had not properly factored
in a solid improvement in the global economy, including the
United States.
 ""Despite the trend being very clearly positive, much of the
commentary, the behaviour of markets has been not to accept that
but to explain that away with special factors,"" he said.
 Utermann said that one result of this was that while his
firm was positioning itself for equity gains of 8 to 12 percent
overall, there was a better chance of bigger gains than lower
ones.
 ""The markets are in a too defensive mode relative to the
underlying improvements we have seen in the last 12 months,"" he
said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in London.
 Utermann said, however, that 2011 would not be smooth, but
would have the same roller coaster tendencies as this year. But
plentiful liquidity and good earnings would lift equities.
 He particularly looked towards developed market companies
that have a solid exposure to emerging markets, saying that
investing in actual emerging market stocks was a ""crowded
trade"".
 
 FX AND BONDS
 RCM was also looking for appreciation in emerging market
currencies.
 ""Emerging market currencies will do best, followed by the
euro, followed by the dollar. (It) is very difficult to forecast
what the yen will do. We know what it should do, depreciate,"" he
said.
 ""The dollar will be volatile to the euro for much of 2011, a
continued depreciation against the background of a hopefully
receding government debt crisis in Europe.""
Overall, Utermann believes developed market bond yields are
too low and may start to back up next year. This was mainly
because the world economy is improving and long-term savers need
higher yields than are on offer.
 ""We are going to have to get used to rising long-term
yields. How else are you going to get the long-term savings
returns you need?""
 Turning to the current crisis in euro zone government debt,
Utermann said markets were pricing too great a chance of
default.
 He did not believe there would be a default or a ""haircut""
for investors -- formally trimming a percentage off their
returns -- but even if there was, yields now are too high.
 ""If you thought there should be haircuts ... then a 10 to 15
to 20 percent haircut would be very significantly sufficient to
resolve the debt issue,"" Utermann said. ""Some of these (recent)
positions are implying 30 to 40 to 50 percent haircuts.
 ""That's just ridiculous,"" he said.
 Utermann said it remained too volatile a situation for
institutional investors to get involved yet but he himself had
bought some peripheral euro zone debt for tactical gains.
RCM is a part of Allianz Global Investors and has some 100
billion euros in assets under management.

 * Emerging markets seen as big gainers again in 2011
 * Investors looking at indirect ways to invest in EM
 * Russia one of the top picks
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt and Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Leading investors are looking to
emerging markets again to create their biggest gains in 2011
with Russia and developed market companies with exposure to fast
growing economies the favourites.
 Speakers at the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit being
held in London and New York see gains in emerging markets as the
best bet for returns next year, but not necessarily directly.
 Andreas Utermann, chief investment officer of RCM, said on
Tuesday, for example, that direct investment in emerging market
equities was becoming a ""crowded trade.""
 Instead, he suggested that investors should look at U.S.,
European and other developed market companies with heavy
exposure to emerging markets.
 ""We have preferred to play it in 2010 and likely (will in)
2011 to look at the exposures you can get to emerging markets
without investing in narrower markets,"" he said.
 Nick Timberlake, head of emerging market equities at HSBC
Global Asset Management, said he saw value in developed market
firms producing goods from low-price technology such as mobile
phones to pricier luxury items.
 ""In China, we estimate 450,000 millionaires. Those people
are consuming big ticket items. The second largest market (for
Rolls Royce) is the UK. (It) will be surpassed by China,"" he
said.
 Utermann and Timberlake echoed comments made at the summit
on Monday by Giordano Lombardo, chief investment officer of
Pioneer Investments.
 Lombardo suggested getting exposure to emerging economies
indirectly through investing in technology, materials and energy
sectors within the developed world. Pioneer also likes banks
with emerging market exposure, such as HSBC.
 RCM's Utermann, meanwhile, said that currency exposure to
emerging markets was likely to bring good results because of
appreciation.
 ""Emerging market currencies will do best, followed by the
euro, followed by the dollar,"" he said.
 
 RUSSIA REDUX
 A second theme to emerge from the summit has been the
potential for gains from Russia in 2011.
 HSBC Global Asset Management's Timberlake said it had Russia
as its biggest overweight position in emerging markets,
predicting 2011 returns would outstrip the 10-30 percent gains
it expects from broader emerging equities.
 ""We have our most significant overweight position in Russia
today. Russia is our favourite market for next year,"" he said.
""There's a strong valuation case.""
 A similar case was made on Monday by Jim O'Neill, chairman
of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and creator of the term BRICs
to describe leading emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India and
China.
 ""In the BRIC world controversially I like Russia the most,""
O'Neill said. ""If I look at the forward price/earnings of the
four BRIC markets, the surprise is Russia is very cheap.""
 Utermann was not as vocally bullish, but he said for Russia
to do well in 2011 commodities would have to. His firm is
expecting that to be the case.

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The European Union formally
backed Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation on
Tuesday, clearing the way for Moscow to join the body in 2011,
after 17 years of trying. 
 EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and Russian Economic
Development Minister Elvira Nabiullina signed an agreement on
the sidelines of an EU-Russia summit, after the resolution of a
tariff dispute that had held up EU approval.
 ""Our difficult bilateral issues are resolved. We signed a
memorandum of understanding to this end today,"" EU Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
 ""Russia becoming a WTO member in 2011 is a realistic
perspective,"" he said.
 The EU, the world's largest trading zone, is Russia's
biggest trading partner. Its decision to end its WTO veto --
largely thanks to Moscow's commitment to phase out export
tariffs on timber and rail freight fees -- removes a major
obstacle to Moscow's accession to top trading nation status.
 Russia's $1.2 trillion economy makes it the largest outside
the WTO. The World Bank has estimated that entry could increase
Russian gross domestic product by as much as 3.3 percent in the
medium term and 11 percent in the long term.
 As part of Tuesday's agreement, Russia has promised to lower
export duties on timber, which are currently set at about 15
percent. This will benefit EU paper makers such as UPM
, Stora Enso  and M-Real .
 Russia will also lower fees on Asian freight reaching Europe
via Russian railways, EU officials said.
 Russia's accession still needs approval from the 153-member
WTO. Multilateral negotiations are expected to focus on Russian
concessions that will make it easier for foreign car makers to
export and produce cars in Russia.
 ""Foreign car makers operating in Russia and joint ventures
are going to be the big winners. They're the ones that will
progressively take over the market,"" said Eric Bergelin,
Director for Trade and Economics at the European Automobile
Manufacturers' Association.
 Russia hopes WTO entry will increase foreign direct
investment and its exports of steel to the EU market.
 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said the country
hopes to join the 153-member WTO in 2011, completing a process
that began in 1993. The WTO represents more than 97 percent of
global trade.

 * Says profit on long crown bet more than previous estimate
 
(Adds quotes)
 By Simon Johnson and Johan Ahlander
 STOCKHOLM, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Sweden's strong public finances
and buoyant growth rates should drive the crown currency to
further gains against the euro on top of this year's 12 percent
rise, the head of the Nordic state's debt office said.
 The office's view is important not just for managing the
country's borrowing, but also because last year it took a big
bet on the crown strengthening.
 It said in September it would begin unwinding its 50 billion
crown ($7.33 billion) long position, which had fallen to 40.5
billion at the end of October.
 ""If you look upon fundamentals, I see no reason why the
currency shouldn't strengthen down to ... 8.75, 8.80 or 8.85 or
something like that,"" office head Bo Lundgren told Reuters in an
interview on Tuesday.
 The crown was trading at around 9.096 to the euro at 1208
GMT, gaining just over 1 ore after Lundgren's comments.
 Lundgren said he was one of many economists who had thought
for several years before the recent crisis that the crown should
be stronger than it actually was. ""But the market is always
right,"" he said.
 Sweden has bounced back rapidly from the recent downturn and
its budget is expected to be close to balance this year before
returning to surplus in 2011. The economy grew 6.9 percent
year-on-year in the third quarter, its fastest pace since 1970.
 Lundgren said it was hard to pick exactly the right time to
sell down the crown position and that the debt office had to
take a careful approach to avoid disrupting markets.
 ""To be able to sit on the position, to pinpoint the maximum
is obviously not possible,"" he said.
 ""So we decided that at a certain time we would start the
process, then obviously if the currency is stronger we try to do
the maximum (selldown) for a month, if it is not so strong we
will perhaps wait for a month.""
 Profits on the crown position are set to be larger than the
previous estimate of about 6 billion crowns made in August. ""It
is about 7 billion, a bit less than 7 billion now,"" he said.
 The debt office said in September it would take up to a year
to unwind the position.

 LESS DEBT
 While most of Europe is facing an extended period of
austerity as governments struggle to deal with sharply rising
debt burdens, Sweden expects to see its debt levels fall over
coming years.
 The debt office sees central government debt falling to
around 29 percent of GDP in 2012 from around 35 percent this
year.
 But falling debt may make it more difficult for the office
to maintain liquidity in its benchmark issues.
 ""We believe that we should have a benchmark of 50-60 billion
(crowns) at least to be able to have a turnover that gives the
liquidity needed,"" he said.
 It would be hard to keep index-linked and foreign currency
bonds at current levels and maintain overall liquidity in the
market if government debt fell to 700-800 billion crowns,
Lundgren said.
 But the debt office has the options of reducing T-bill
issuance further, cutting foreign currency borrowing or
borrowing on behalf of a wider client base, such as local
authorities, for example.
 ""Should we be some kind of wealth fund? I don't know,
although that's not the first thing to think about,"" he said.

 * Support likely to be fleeting, euro zone weaknesses remain
 * Expectations for further Fed easing fuel risk appetite

(Adds quote, updates prices)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday on
cautious optimism that Ireland will pass an austerity budget
later in the day, but support for the single currency was
expected to be fleeting as it is still dogged by structural
weaknesses in the euro zone.
 The dollar slipped against a currency basket after comments
from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stoked
expectations of prolonged easy U.S. monetary policy, supporting
appetite for risk. 
 The euro remained vulnerable after euro zone policymakers
failed to come up with new policies to tackle the region's debt
crisis. But an Irish Times report suggesting Dublin would pass
an austere budget on Tuesday supported cautious investor
optimism.
 ""The euro is gaining some support on optimism that the Irish
budget will be passed, but I expect any rallies to be fleeting.
Structural weaknesses in the euro zone remain,"" said BTM-UFJ
currency analyst Lee Hardman.
 ""It would be far more significant for the euro if the budget
wasn't passed as this would bring down the Irish government and
exacerbate concerns about the debt crisis spreading,"" he said.
 At 1222 GMT, the euro was 0.4 percent higher on the day at
$1.3363, after rising to $1.3394, more than 1 percent above
Monday's low of $1.3246. Traders said strong demand from a UK
clearer and Middle East accounts helped it to rally in European
trade.
 Euro/dollar volatility slipped on Tuesday, with one-month
vols at 12.5 percent, off nearly 6-month highs around 16 percent
last week.
 ""Vols have come off but may stay stuck near current levels""
because of risks of further euro declines, one London-based
trader said.
 The picture was complicated by the dollar's own weakness
after Bernanke did not rule out further bond purchases, sending
the greenback to an 11-month low last month.
 Analysts said the fact the Federal Reserve could end up
buying more than its initial target of $600 billion in
government bonds made investors more positive towards riskier
assets and weighed on the dollar.
 ""The markets now think monetary policy will stay loose in
2011, and there's no reason to think abundant liquidity will die
down soon,"" said Stephen Gallo, head of market analysis at
Schneider Foreign Exchange.
 ""Risk appetite is up and the short U.S. dollar, long
commodities trade still looks to have legs,"" he said.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent versus a currency basket at
79.324, while European stocks rose 1.2 percent. Commodities
firmed, with U.S. crude for January rising to a 26-month high
above $90 a barrel. Gold hit record highs for the second day in
a row., close to a three-week high of $0.9966. It dipped
slightly after the central bank kept rates on hold at 4.75
percent and said inflation would be little changed over the next
few quarters. The Aussie also recovered from losses on talk
about Chinese monetary tightening.
 The official Chinese Securities Journal reported China's
central bank may raise interest rates this weekend to enshrine
its shift to a ""prudent"" monetary policy in the face of rising
inflation.
 Such speculation was offset somewhat after China's key
short-term money market rate plunged from two-year highs. Big
banks had previously been locking up large amounts of cash on
expectations of a further increase in reserve requirements in
coming weeks and more policy tightening next year, causing the
benchmark seven-day repo rate to soar.

 * Says profit on long crown bet bigger than pvs estimate

(Adds quotes, background, detail)
 By Simon Johnson and Johan Ahlander
 STOCKHOLM, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The Swedish crown is set for
more gains against the euro after a 12 percent rise against the
single currency this year due to strong state finances and
growth, the Nordic state's Debt Office head said on Tuesday.
 The Debt Office's view on the crown is important not just
for managing borrowing, but also because last year the office
took a big bet on a stronger crown.
 It said in September it would begin unwinding its 50 billion
crown ($7.33 billion) long position which had fallen to 40.5
billion at the end of October.
 ""If you look upon fundamentals, I see no reason why the
currency shouldn't strengthen down to ... 8.75, 8.80 or 8.85 or
something like that,"" Debt Office head Bo Lundgren told Reuters
in an interview.
 The crown was trading at around 9.109 to the euro at 1119
GMT, gaining around 1 ore after Lundgren's comments.
 Lundgren said he was one of many economists who had thought
for several years before the recent crisis that the crown should
be stronger than it actually was.
 ""But the market is always right,"" he said.
 Sweden has recovered rapidly from the recent downturn and
the budget is expected to be close to balance this year before
returning to surplus in 2011. The economy grew 6.9 percent
year-on-year in the third quarter, its fastest pace since 1970.
 Lundgren said it was hard to pick exactly the right time to
sell down the crown position and that the Debt Office had to
take a careful approach to avoid disrupting markets.
 ""To be able to sit on the position, to pinpoint the maximum
is obviously not possible,"" he said.
 ""So we decided that at a certain time we would start the
process, then obviously if the currency is stronger we try to do
the maximum for a month, if it is not so strong we will perhaps
wait for a month.""
 Profits from the position are set to be larger than the
previous estimate of about 6 billion crowns made in August. ""It
is about 7 billion, a bit less than 7 billion now,"" he said.

 * Plans to sell up to 200 million shares
 * Has previously said IPO was oversubscribed
 * Source says additional narrowing seen on Wednesday

(Adds comments on price range narrowing further, deal size)
 OSLO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Mutually owned insurer Gjensidige
said on Tuesday that it had narrowed the price range for its
initial public offering to between 56 and 62 crowns, which could
raise up to 12.4 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.06 billion).
 Norway's largest property and casualty insurer previously
indicated a price range of 54-64 crowns per share in what could
become Norway's largest IPO since 2001.
 Gjensidige's IPO, along with a $2.4 billion share sale by
Denmark's TDC, highlight recovering Scandinavian economies and
valuations, even as the euro zone's debt worries rattle European
stock markets.
 ""The offering has continued to attract strong investor
interest,"" Gjensidige said in a statement.
 Last Thursday, it said the IPO was oversubscribed within the
initial price range.
 All of the company's 500 million shares are now owned by the
Gjensidige Foundation, which said it intends to sell between 25
and 40 percent -- that is, between 125 million and 200 million
shares.
 A source close to the offer said a further narrowing of
price guidance was expected on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday when
bookbuilding closes.
 ""We still don't know where we'll be between a 25 percent and
a 40 percent deal size,"" the source said. ""I think if we had
fixed the deal size we would probably have a narrower range.""
 ""It is high yielding and a safe economy so everyone is quite
relaxed about it,"" the source added.
 If all 200 million shares are floated within the most recent
price range, the foundation would raise between 11.2 billion
crowns and 12.4 billion crowns, and the company as a whole would
be valued at between 28 billion and 31 billion crowns.
 The company expects to begin trading on the Oslo Stock
Exchange on Friday.
 Some analysts see the IPO as a way for Gjensidige to pursue
mergers and acquisitions, perhaps including a tie-up with
Norwegian life insurer Storebrand. Gjensidige is already
Storebrand's largest shareholder, with a strategic 24.3-percent
stake.
 Danish telecoms firm TDC has narrowed the price guidance on
its $2.4 billion public offering to 50-52 crowns per share, the
middle of its original range, sources said earlier on Tuesday.

Russia's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday,
clearing the way for Russia to join the trade body in 2011, an
EU spokesman said.
 EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and Russian Economic
Development Minister Elvira Nabiullina signed an agreement on

 Russia's $1.2 trillion economy makes it the largest outside
the WTO, and the World Bank has estimated entry could increase
it by as much as 3.3 percent in the medium term and 11 percent
in the long term.
 The EU is Russia's biggest trading partner and ending its
veto -- largely thanks to Moscow's commitments to phasing out
export tariffs on timber -- removes a major obstacle to Russia's
accession.
 Moscow must still negotiate the terms of its entry with the
WTO, with Russian concessions expected in car parts trade and

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday on
optimism Ireland will pass an austerity budget later in the day,
though support was expected to be fleeting, with the single
currency still dogged by structural weaknesses in the euro zone.
 The dollar slipped against a currency basket after comments
from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stoked expectations of prolonged
U.S. monetary easing measures, supporting appetite for risk.
 The euro remained vulnerable after euro zone policymakers
failed to come up with new policies to tackle the region's debt
crisis.
 An Irish Times report suggesting the austere Irish budget
would be passed on Tuesday triggered cautious investor optimism.
 ""The euro is gaining some support on optimism that the Irish
budget will be passed but I expect any rallies to be fleeting.
Structural weaknesses in the euro zone remain in place,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 ""It would be far more significant for the euro if the budget
wasn't passed as this would bring down the Irish government and
exacerbate concerns about the debt crisis spreading,"" he said.
 The euro was up around 0.5 percent on the day at $1.3375,
after rising to $1.3394, more than 1 percent above Monday's low
of $1.3246. Traders said strong demand from a UK clearer and
Middle East accounts helped it to rally in European trade.
 The picture was complicated by the dollar's own weakness
after Bernanke did not rule out further bond purchases -- a
theme that sent the greenback to an 11-month low last month.
 Analysts said the fact the Federal Reserve could end up
buying more than its initial target of $600 billion in
government bonds made investors more positive towards riskier
assets and weighed on the dollar.
 ""The markets now think monetary policy will stay loose in
2011 and there's no reason to think abundant liquidity will die
down soon,"" said Stephen Gallo, head of market analysis at
Schneider Foreign Exchange.
 ""Risk appetite is up and the short U.S. dollar, long
commodities trade still looks to have legs,"" he said.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent versus a currency basket at
79.324, while European stocks rose more than 1 percent on the
day. Commodities were generally firmer, with U.S. crude for
January rising to a 26-month high above $90 a barrel. Gold hit
record highs for the second day in a row.
, close to a three-week high of $0.9966. It dipped slightly
after the central bank kept rates on hold at 4.75 percent and
said inflation would be little changed over the next few
quarters.
 The Aussie also quickly recovered from initial losses from
talk about Chinese monetary tightening.
 The official Chinese Securities Journal reported that
China's central bank may raise interest rates this weekend to
enshrine its shift to a ""prudent"" monetary policy in the face of
rising inflation.

 (Adds background, byline)
 By Simon Cameron-Moore
 ISTANBUL, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Turkey must maintain fiscal
discipline as its current account deficit, a key macroeconomic
weak point, widens due to the economy's rapid growth, the
central bank said on Tuesday.
 In its half-yearly stability report, the bank said it would
continue to use reserve requirements and liquidity measures as
key policy tools, given a pick-up in credit growth and strong
domestic demand.
 Turkey tends to post large current account deficits during
times of economic expansion, and the country's habitually low
domestic savings rate puts extra strain on financing.
 ""In an environment where the current account deficit is
widening, maintaining fiscal discipline in harmony with
perspectives set out in the medium-term programme is important
from the viewpoint of financial stability,"" the report said.
 Turkey's economy is expected to post growth of 7-8 percent
this year, while the current account deficit of $4.08 billion in
September marked a 300 percent rise year-on-year.
 Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said last month that, at 5.5
percent of gross domestic product, the current account was both
financeable and manageable.
 But credit rating agency Fitch warned last month as it
changed Turkey's outlook to positive that imbalances, chiefly
the current account deficit, and a deterioration in the quality
of external financing ""expose the country to an abrupt shift in
global liquidity"".
 Fitch rates Turkey BB+, just one notch below investment
grade. A ratings boost would give the country access to funds
from a much wider range of investors.
 In Tuesday's report, the central bank said government plans
to bring the budget deficit down to 3 percent of GDP within two
years were on track.
 ""The rise in tax revenues, linked to the pickup in economic
activity, and the control of expenditure is having a positive
impact on public finances,"" it said, noting core inflation
indicators and unemployment were in line with targets.
 The bank must keep an eye on credit growth, however.
 ""As a result of the recovery in economic activity, a clear
pickup in loan volumes is evident,"" the report said, adding that
the divergent pace of domestic and external demand growth
""requires a cautious approach to financial stability"".
 The central bank has already raised lira and forex reserve
requirements as part of an exit strategy from a loose monetary
policy adopted in the wake of the global financial crisis, and
the report said it would take similar measures if needed:
 ""The Central Bank will continue to use actively in the
period ahead policy instruments, especially non-interest rate
instruments like reserve requirements and liquidity management,
which reduce macro-financial risks.""
 In its Nov. 24 statement, Fitch praised Turkey's strong
economic recovery from 2009's contraction and improving public
finances but highlighted its external imbalances and history of
high and volatile inflation.
 It said Turkey's quality of financing had deteriorated as
the share taken by short-term and portfolio debt inflows rises.
 Finance Minister Simsek, uncomfortable with the strength of
the lira currency, has said the government should consider
options to curb ""hot money"" flows that have poured into Turkish
assets this year, though there were no such plans at present.

 LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Tuesday
on optimism Ireland will pass an austerity budget later in the

currency still dogged by structural weaknesses in the euro zone.
 The dollar was broadly weaker, slipping to a three-week low

 That view manifested itself most clearly in dollar/yen,
which fell to a three-week low of 82.34 yen, after Bernanke's
comments helped it break out of a rough 83.50-84.50 range. It
later steadied to trade close to flat at 82.70.
 The dollar fell briefly below its 55-day moving average at
82.53 yen. Support was at the bottom of the Ichimoku cloud at
around 81.70.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, was slightly softer at
79.530, having fallen in the past three sessions.

high of $0.9938 set on Friday. It dipped slightly after the

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Global equities advanced on
Tuesday, boosted by a compromise deal to extend expiring U.S.
tax cuts, while the euro rose on optimism that Irish lawmakers
will pass its toughest ever budget later in the day.
 Copper prices gained, supported by Chinese buying and a
firmer euro, and oil prices rose to a fresh 26-month high on the
back of extra demand for heating fuel in parts of Europe and the
United States.
 The single currency, however, remained vulnerable, with
European policymakers dithering over how to tackle the region's
debt problem.
 U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled a deal late on Monday
to renew tax cuts not just for the middle class but for also
wealthier Americans, as Republicans wanted.
 The announcement was welcomed by the markets, with U.S.
stock index futures trading 0.7 to 1 percent higher and global
stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index adding 0.6
percent.
""The market is benefiting from the compromise in the U.S. on
the extension of the Bush tax cuts and to a lesser extent from
the probable voting (through) of the Irish (budget),"" said
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.2 percent and shares
in euro zone peripheral economies also gained sharply.
 The Irish benchmark advanced 1.5 percent, as Prime Minister
Brian Cowen is expected to get his fiscal plan through
parliament and avert the risk of a snap election.. Last month,
Dublin accepted an 85 billion euro international bailout
package.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.3359.
 ""The euro is gaining support on optimism that the Irish
budget will be passed but I expect any rallies to be fleeting.
Structural weaknesses in the euro zone remain in place,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.

 
 EURO ZONE ON WATCH
 The single currency region's policymakers have yet to show
financial markets that they can decisively resolve its debt
problem. Concerns remain that the debt crisis could spread from
Greece and Ireland to Portugal and possibly Spain.
 After a five-hour meeting, the bloc's finance ministers said
late on Monday they would be taking no new steps to tackle the
contagion, saying an existing emergency fund was sufficiently
big and that a proposal to issue euro zone bonds had not even
been broached.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking in Berlin,
rebuffed calls for a bigger financial safety net or joint euro
bonds.
 Yields on sovereign bonds issued by euro zone peripheral
countries were mixed. Ireland's 10-year bond yields over
benchmark German Bunds eased 3 basis points to 563 bps, while
those on Spanish 10-year bonds rose 7 bps to 241 bps.
 The cost of protection against an Irish debt default
narrowed 8 bps to 520 bps, while Spain's protection cost rose 2
bps to 319 bps. 
 Dealers said trade in the bonds was very thin.
 ""My gut feeling is that spreads are going to carry on
widening for a while yet,"" said Chris Scicluna, deputy head of
economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
 ""Anyone in the market who is expecting someone, somewhere to
fund more support for the periphery, whether it be the EFSF or
the ECB -- they're going to be disappointed.""
 The dollar was steady at 82.65 yen after slipping to a
three-week low against the Japanese currency earlier in the
session. The renewed strength in the yen dragged Japan's Nikkei
225 down 0.3 percent.
 A Reuters poll showed the mood among Japanese manufacturers
darkened in late November and is expected to grow even gloomier
in the coming months as a strong yen and the global slowdown eat
into profits.
 In the commodity market, copper rose 2.4 percent, while oil
prices gained 0.8 percent to trade above $90 a barrel.

 SINGAPORE, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Asian stocks got a tentative
boost on Tuesday from U.S. President Barack Obama's compromise
deal to extend all Bush-era tax cuts, while the euro ticked up
but remained vulnerable to debt-related pressure.	
 Leading European shares rose 0.2 percent in early
trade, though investors were wary of the possibility of an
imminent Chinese interest rate rise, possibly as early as this
weekend. 
 Stock markets in Hong Kong , Shanghai and
South Korea closed higher, and MSCI's gauge of Asian
stocks excluding Japan rose 0.5 percent,
taking its gains for the year to more than 12 percent versus
7.5 percent for the MSCI world index .	
 ""Today's market is driven largely by expectations of more
quantitative easing measures by the United States,"" said
Shinhan Investment Corp analyst Lee Sun-yeb in Seoul.	
 After meeting Democratic leaders at the White House on
Monday, Obama announced a ""framework"" agreement with
Republicans that would renew tax cuts not just for the middle
class -- as he and fellow Democrats had sought -- but also for
wealthier Americans, as Republicans wanted. [ID:nN06211347]	
Extending all the tax cuts for two years would cost $501
billion, according to the congressional budget office, adding
that renewing the rates will boost the economy in the short
term, but be harmful in the long term.	
 Asia has been one of the chief beneficiaries of flows of
capital from the United States, where the Federal Reserve is
pursuing a policy of printing more cash.	
 In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei average was dragged
down by the strength of the yen, and a Reuters poll showed the
mood among Japanese manufacturers darkened in late November
and is expected to grow even gloomier in the coming months as
a strong yen and the global slowdown eat into
profits.[ID:nTOE6B600A]	
 ""The impact of a strong yen, slowing exports and declines
in profits weighed on corporate sentiment and companies are
growing more cautious about the outlook,"" said Yoshimasa
Maruyama, an analyst at Itochu Corp.	
 The Nikkei closed 0.26 percent lower, though Sumitomo Corp
and Mitsubishi Corp outperformed the broader
index on reports they are making moves to expand their rare
earths businesses. Non-Chinese sources of the hi-tech minerals
are much in demand, on worries the world's biggest supplier
may in future restrict exports. [ID:nTOE6B600E]	
 But adding to the generally cautious tone in Asian
financial markets was the belief that the cost of borrowing in
China will soon rise.	
 China's central bank may raise rates again this weekend as
it tries to contain inflationary pressures, official newspaper
the China Securities Journal reported on Tuesday.[ID:nTOE6B602F]	
 Another newspaper said Chinese bank lending had exceeded
by the end of November the government's full-year loan target
of 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.13 trillion), supporting arguments in
favour of further credit tightening.	
 
 
 
 DEBT WORRIES DOG EURO, BOOST GOLD	
 The euro slipped in early trade before recovering to
$1.3320, just above its late levels in New York on Monday,
with support seen at $1.3268.	
 The next major market event will be the outcome of the
Irish budget, due later on Tuesday, traders said. The deeply
unpopular government is set to unveil a record austerity plan
that will inflict more pain on voters. [ID:nLDE6B51VW]	
 ""If the (Irish) parliament fails to approve proposals, we
could see a fresh flare-up in euro zone tensions and the euro
could fall sharply against major forex counterparts,"" said
David Rodriguez, strategist at DailyFX.	
 Ireland last month received an 85 billion euro bailout
from the International Monetary Fund and European Union, and
markets are wondering if Portugal and Spain will be the next
ones in need of rescue.	
 Euro zone finance ministers met on Monday amid pressure to
increase the size of a 750 billion euro safety net for
debt-stricken members, but Germany rejected such a move and
also dismissed a call for joint euro bonds guaranteed by all
governments.	
 U.S. consumer confidence data for October was due for
release at 1500 GMT.	
 Gold traded at $1,420 per ounce, down slightly from
the previous session's $1,427. This is the most recent in a
series of peaks the precious metal has reached as investors
buy heavily, attracted by gold's perceived safety as a store
of value, in contrast to paper currencies. It has risen almost
one-third since the start of the year.	
 Gold priced in euros hit an all-time high of
1,073.03 euros on Tuesday, driven by persistent worries about
unsustainably high debt levels within the single currency zone.	
 U.S. crude oil futures  slipped from the 26-month
high it touched in the previous session, trading around $88.80
on Tuesday, while benchmark industrial metal copper ,
which has moved closer in recent sessions to its record high
of almost $9,000 per tonne, changed hands for just below
$8,800.

(Adds details, background)	
 ALMATY, Dec 7 (Reuters) - - Kazakhstan's tenge currency
should return to a managed float next year and its
current trading corridor should be removed, the chairman of
the central bank said on Tuesday.	
 Grigory Marchenko said a final decision had not been made
but that he hoped the board of the central bank would approve
his proposal to scrap the corridor of 127.5-165 per dollar
introduced after the currency was devalued in February 2009.	
 ""Next year we will return to a managed float,"" Marchenko
told a news conference. ""The trading corridor is not needed,""
he said. ""I hope the (central bank) board will support us.""	
 Kazakhstan's economy, the largest in Central Asia, is
rebounding from the financial crisis thanks to higher prices
for its main exports, oil, metals and grain. Several Kazakh
banks have also managed to restructure their defaulted debt.	
 The tenge has traded in a corridor since the central bank
devalued the currency by 18 percent in response to the
deepening financial crisis and a weakening rouble, the
currency of Kazakhstan's main trading partner, Russia.	
 Central bank data shows the average official tenge rate in
November was 147.5 per dollar.	
 Marchenko said the central bank purchased $650 million on
the foreign exchange market in November.	
 Also on Tuesday, the central bank announced that its net
gold and foreign currency reserves fell to $27.3 billion as of
Nov. 30 from $28.4 billion on Oct. 31.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The euro won a slight reprieve on
Tuesday though it was still dogged by worries over debt problems
in the euro zone, while the dollar slipped to a three-week low
against the yen after breaking below key chart levels.
 Although the euro drew some support in skittish trade from
hopes that Ireland will pass an austerity budget later in the
day, the currency remained vulnerable with European policymakers
bickering over how to tackle the region's debt crisis.
 Complicating the picture, however, was the dollar's own
weakness after the Federal Reserve's chief did not rule out
further bond purchases -- a theme that sent the greenback to an
11-month low last month.
 ""There are many people out there who are still bearish on the
euro. But I think the market has been looking a bit too far ahead
recently,"" said Minoru Shioiri, chief forex manager at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
 ""I do not see a debt domino-effect hitting Spain now. That
may happen some time in the future but not now. The fact that
10-year Spanish bond yields have moved more than 50 basis points
in just a couple of days shows just how far the markets have gone
to an extreme,"" he added.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent in Asia to $1.3345, having risen a
full cent from Monday's low of $1.3246. Support at around
$1.3268, a level representing a 61.8 percent retracement of its
September to November rally, is proving solid for now.
 Still, testing Friday's 10-day high of $1.3438 and major
resistance in the $1.3446-3470 area looks difficult, given the
persistent worries over euro zone debt problems.
 Societe Generale strategists said it was still on track for a
move below $1.3000, unless $1.3450 breaks.
 IRISH BUDGET
 The Irish budget outcome due later on Tuesday was shaping up
to be the next focal point for markets, with some participants
still cautious about the potential for negative surprises.
 ""If the (Irish) parliament fails to approve proposals, we
could see a fresh flare-up in euro zone tensions and the euro
could fall sharply against major forex counterparts,"" said David
Rodriguez, a strategist at DailyFX.
 The IMF urged euro zone finance ministers to increase the
size of a 750 billion euros ($1 trillion) bailout mechanism for
debt-stricken members, but Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
rebuffed calls for a bigger financial safety net or joint euro
bonds.
 The inability of the region to come up with a common solution
saw investors give the euro a wide berth, sending it to a record
low against the Australian dollar at around A$1.3415 late on
Monday.
 For the dollar, traders said the fact the U.S. Federal
Reserve could end up buying more than it's initially announced
target of $600 billion in government bonds, as suggested by Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke on Sunday, meant it was not out of the
woods yet.
 That view manifested itself most clearly in dollar/yen, which
fell to a three-week low of 82.34 yen, after Bernanke's comments
helped it to break out of a rough 83.50-84.50 range.
 The dollar fell below its 55-day moving average at 82.53 yen.
On the ichimoku chart, having broken below the top of cloud on
Friday, it fell below the kijun line at 82.44 yen on Tuesday.
 Some traders say a fall below 82 yen is now possible, with
the bottom of the cloud at around 81.70 seen as a major support.
 ""The U.S. jobs data was weak. Although Bernanke's comments
initially offset the impact of the weak jobs data, investors
could become more risk averse if we see another weak economic
figure or two,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.2 percent to 79.430,
having fallen in the last three sessions.
 INDEX SUPPORT
 Support for the index was pegged at 79.226, the 38.2 percent
retracement of last month's rally from an 11-month low of 75.631
hit on Nov. 4 in the wake of the Fed's announcement it would buy
$600 billion Treasuries.
 Prospects of greater injections of liquidity by the Fed kept
commodity prices underpinned. The 19-commodity CRB index, a
global benchmark for the asset class, rose for a fourth session
on Monday to four-week highs. It was not far off a two-year high
set last month.
 This helped commodity currencies such as the Australian
dollar hold on to most of the gains made recently.
 The Aussie last traded at $0.9911, not far off a two-week
high of $0.9938 set on Friday. It dipped slightly after the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates on hold at 4.75
percent and said inflation would be little changed over next few
quarters.
 ""They are fairly comfortable with where things are and where
the economy is heading, suggesting no great need to rush in with
another rate rise ... We have February pencilled in at the moment
(for the next rate hike), but that sounds a little soon and we
may have to push that back a bit. Sometime in the first half of
next year,"" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth
Bank in Sydney.
 The Aussie also quickly recovered from initial losses from
talk about Chinese tightening.
 Official Chinese Securities Journal reported on Tuesday that
China's central bank may raise interest rates this weekend to
enshrine its shift to a ""prudent"" monetary policy in the face of
rising inflation.

 By Wayne Cole	
 SYDNEY, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept
its key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent on Tuesday, a
widely expected decision following a pre-emptive hike last
month, and is thought likely to remain on hold for a few
months to come.	
 The Australian dollar barely budged after the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its monthly policy
meeting with a brief and balanced statement which offered
scant guidance on when rates might rise again.	
 ""Following the Board's decision last month to lift the
cash rate, and the subsequent increases by financial
institutions, lending rates in the economy are now a little
above average,"" wrote RBA Governor Glenn Stevens.	
 ""The Board views this setting of monetary policy as
appropriate for the economic outlook.""	
 Investors had priced in <0#YIB:> absolutely no chance of a
hike as Stevens had made it clear the market was reasonable to
assume the next hike might not come until the middle of 2011.	


 The central bank last lifted rates by 25 basis points to
4.75 percent in November, billing it as a pre-emptive strike
against future inflation. That brought its tightening to 175
basis points in 13 months, easily the boldest action of any
developed nation.	
 A Reuters poll of 21 analysts had found all expected rates
to stay at 4.75 pct on Tuesday, with the next hike likely
coming sometime in the second quarter of 2011. The RBA does
not meet in January, so the next window on rates will be its
Feb. 1 meeting.	
 Investors are pricing in a more leisurely pace of just 26
basis points of hikes in 12 months , in part
reflecting moves by commercial banks to lift mortgage rates by
more than the rise in the cash rate.	
 Domestic economic news has also turned patchy with gross
domestic product (GDP) rising a pedestrian 0.2 percent in the
third quarter, while retail sales slumped 1 percent in October
as households chose to save more.	
 
 ALL ABOUT TRADE	
 Yet the central bank has actually been counting on
household consumption to stay subdued to leave room for mining
to boom without creating inflation.	
 The RBA has been confident that growth will accelerate as
Asian demand for Australia's resources drives a huge rise in
the terms of trade, or the ratio of export to import prices.	
 Stevens recently estimated that the once-in-a-century lift
in the terms of trade was worth a staggering 12 to 15 percent
of GDP every year it lasted.	
 And he expects it to last a long time as the urbanisation
and industrialisation of over two billion people in China and
India promises to boost commodity demand for decades to come.	
 This flood of cash from trade is boosting profits, wages,
employment and tax receipts, while fuelling the biggest
business investment boom in Australian history. A government
survey out last month showed firms planned to spend A$129
billion in 2010/11 alone, or 10 percent of GDP.	
 Such is the rush that some of this investment will likely
be delayed or suffer significant cost overruns, but even then
the lift to the economy should be substantial.	
 Perhaps the most tangible sign of all this good fortune
has been the creation of over 300,000 new jobs so far this
year, a remarkable run for a country with just 22.5 million
people.	
 Even the farm sector is chipping in as good rains have
lifted the estimate for winter crops by 22 percent to 43.2
million tonnes, while the summer crop is seen rising 60 percent.	
 The jobless rate is already down to 5.4 pct and is
expected to drop under 5 percent next year, lows that have led
to inflation in the past.	
 ""The RBA sounds fairly comfortable with where things are
and where the economy is heading, suggesting no great need to
rush in with another rate rise,"" concluded Michael Blythe,
chief economist at Commonwealth Bank.	
 ""But with the terms of trade, national income growing
strongly, wages growth to pick up further ... that still
suggest higher rates sometime in the first half of next year.""

 By John Mair and James Pomfret	
 MANILA/HONG KONG, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Capital inflows will
be a major policy challenge for emerging East Asia in 2011 as
the region outperforms major economies, even as growth will
moderate towards 7 percent, the Asian Development Bank said on
Tuesday.	
 Asian currencies have surged this year on a flood of hot
money from other regions in search of better returns, raising
fears of a potentially damaging trade war if governments try
to depress their own currencies to maintain export
competitiveness.	
 Such a risk could be mitigated through a regional currency
cooperation framework, which could pave the way for a swifter
rise in China's yuan currency, the ADB said.	
 While export goliath China currently runs a massive trade
surplus with the U.S. and Europe, it is a huge net importer of
components and intermediate goods from within Asia, putting it
at a disadvantage to low-cost manufacturing rivals in the
region if its currency appreciates too sharply.	
 ""If there is exchange rate coordination I think the
willingness of China to appreciate their currency will be
greater,"" said Iwan Azis, the head of the ADB's office of
regional economic integration. ""The huge deficit of China
vis-a-vis East Asia will not be worsened,	
 ""If you are appreciating alone, then your trade sector
will be absolutely damaged. That's why you cannot expect that
China will unilaterally appreciate without the appreciation of
the rest of Asia,"" said Azis in a press conference in Hong Kong.	
 While the ADB said it wasn't calling for anything like a
European-style single currency, it said the informal
monitoring of Asian currencies and coordinated moves to
intervene to correct fluctuations as they arise would smooth
inter-regional trade, while speeding the larger process of
global rebalancing.	
 ""If there is exchange rate coordination there is room for
every single country, not just China, to appreciate more.""	
 Emerging East Asia -- the ASEAN economies plus China, Hong
Kong, Taiwan and South Korea -- faced four major risks to its
upturn: weakness in major economies, destabilising capital
inflows, rising inflation and asset prices, and protectionism,
the bank said in its Asia Economic Monitor.	
 ""Competitive non-appreciation -- or 'currency wars' as
some put it -- may escalate into trade wars as countries try
to preserve international competitiveness and exports,"" the
ADB wrote. (See www.adb.org for full report)	
 Emerging East Asian economies were forecast to grow 8.8
percent in 2010, led by growth of 10.1 percent in China,
before slowing to 7.3 percent in 2011, the ADB said.	
 While some forecasts for 2010 were revised from the
previous ADB forecasts issued in September, the 2011 forecasts
were unchanged. For a full table of forecasts, see
[ID:nMNA002974]	
 
 ASSET BUBBLES	
 Asia's strong recovery from the global financial crisis
has widened interest rate differentials with the rest of the
world, and quantitative easing and low interest rates in major
economies were expected to keep investors shifting money to
emerging markets.	
 ""The unsynchronized global recovery -- red-hot growth in
emerging economies against tepid, uncertain recovery in
advanced economies -- pose policy challenges,"" the ADB said.	
 Although growth will moderate, the narrowing of output
gaps, resilient domestic demand and higher commodity and food
prices were pushing up headline and core inflation in some
economies.	
 Asset prices were rising quickly, reflected in surging
equity markets and housing prices, and the ADB said despite
some economies withdrawing monetary stimulus and tightening
prudential measures, prices could rise further.	
 Tightening policy to rein in demand and asset prices could
have a short-term impact of attracting more funds and
""aggravating inflated asset bubbles,"" the ADB said.	
 ""There is no magic solution to effectively managing
capital flows. Each policy option has its merits and
shortcomings and involves difficult trade-offs,"" the ADB said.

 By Daniel Magnowski	
 SINGAPORE, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a
three-week low against the yen on Tuesday, with gains in the
Japanese currency pulling Tokyo stocks lower, while the euro
came under renewed pressure as Europe struggled to contain its
debt crisis.	
 A flat close on Wall Street offered stock markets little
inspiration, while resurgent fears of an imminent Chinese
interest rate rise kept investors on the defensive.	
 In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei average was dragged
down by the strength of the yen, and a Reuters poll showed the
mood among Japanese manufacturers darkened in late November
and is expected to grow even gloomier in the coming months as
a strong yen and the global slowdown eat into profits.
[ID:nTOE6B600A]	
 ""The impact of a strong yen, slowing exports and declines
in profits weighed on corporate sentiment and companies are
growing more cautious about the outlook,"" said Yoshimasa
Maruyama, an analyst at Itochu Corp.	
 The Nikkei fell 0.4 percent, though Sumitomo Corp
and Mitsubishi Corp outperformed the broader index on
reports they are making moves to expand their rare earths
businesses. Non-Chinese sources of the hi-tech minerals are
much in demand, on worries the world's biggest supplier may in
future restrict exports.	
 MSCI's gauge of Asian stocks excluding Japan
rose 0.4 percent, taking its gains for the
year to over 12 percent versus 7.5 percent for the MSCI world
index .	
 Asia has been one of the chief beneficiaries of flows of
capital from the United States, where the Federal Reserve is
pursuing a policy of printing more cash.	
 But adding to the market's generally cautious tone was the
belief that the cost of borrowing in China will soon rise.	
 China's central bank may raise rates again this weekend as
it tries to contain inflationary pressures, official newspaper
the China Securities Journal reported on Tuesday.
[ID:nBJI002478]	
 Another newspaper said Chinese bank lending had exceeded
by the end of November the government's full-year loan target
of 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.13 trillion), supporting arguments in
favour of further credit tightening.	
 
 
 
 POLITICAL BICKERING WEIGHS ON EURO 
 The euro slipped in early trade before recovering to
$1.3325, just above its late levels in New York on Monday,
with support seen at $1.3268.	
 The next major market event will be the outcome of the
Irish budget, due later on Tuesday, traders said., The deeply
unpopular government is set to unveil a record austerity plan
that will inflict more pain on voters. [ID:nLDE6B51VW]	
 ""If the (Irish) parliament fails to approve proposals, we
could see a fresh flare-up in euro zone tensions and the euro
could fall sharply against major forex counterparts,"" said
David Rodriguez, strategist at DailyFX.	
 Ireland last month received an 85 billion euro bailout
from the International Monetary Fund and European Union, and
markets are wondering if Portugal and Spain will be the next
ones in need of rescue.	
 Euro zone finance ministers met on Monday amid pressure to
increase the size of a 750 billion euro safety net for
debt-stricken members, but Germany rejected such a move and
also dismissed a call for joint euro bonds guaranteed by all
governments.	
 Gold traded at $1,420 per ounce, down slightly from
the previous session's $1,427, the most recent in a series of
peaks the precious metal has reached as investors buy heavily,
attracted by gold's perceived safety as a store of value, in
contrast to paper currencies. It has risen almost one-third
since the start of the year.	
 U.S. crude oil futures  oscillated around $89 per
barrel after hitting a 26-month high in the previous session,
while benchmark industrial metal copper , which has
moved closer in recent sessions to its record high of almost
$9,000 per tonne, changed hands for just below $8,800.

(Adds details, direct quote)
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister warned on
Tuesday against further yen gains as signs that the U.S. Federal
Reserve could increase bond purchases and disappointing data on
the U.S. labour market weigh on the dollar.
 It is ""certainly possible"" the Fed could end up buying more
than its initially announced target of $600 billion in government
bonds, Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Sunday, as the U.S. economy
struggles to pick up enough pace to create new jobs.
 Bernanke's comments have put a dent in the dollar and helped
push bond yields lower globally. Should the yen continue to rise
versus the greenback, it could leave Japan in an awkward position
after it intervened in September to prevent a strong currency
from harming its economic recovery.
 ""Since yesterday, there have been some one-sided moves,""
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said at a briefing.
 ""I will continue to pay close attention to the markets. I'm
not in a position to comment about specific monetary policy moves
in other countries.""
 The dollar slipped to a three-week low below 82.52 yen
earlier on Tuesday in Tokyo trade.
 Japan sold 2.1249 trillion yen ($25.69 billion) on one day in
September, finance ministry data shows, as Japanese authorities
intervened for the first time in six years as the yen surged to
15-year highs against the dollar.
 Japan has stayed out of the currency market since then,
according to finance ministry data.
 On domestic tax policy, Noda told reporters after a cabinet
meeting that the government should not issue bonds to cover
revenue lost from lowering the corporate tax burden.
 He also said he could not decide now by how much the
corporate tax burden should be reduced
 The government is on course to compile its tax policy for
fiscal 2011/12, which will serve as a base for drafting next
fiscal year's budget due at the end of the month.

 By Alexei Anishchuk
 MOSCOW, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Russia is widely expected to
secure European Union approval to join the World Trade
Organisation at a summit on Tuesday, taking Moscow closer to
completing membership negotiations after 17 years.
 Russia's $1.2 trillion economy makes it the largest outside
the WTO, and the World Bank has estimated entry could increase
it by as much as 3.3 percent in the medium-term and 11 percent
in the long-term.
 President Dmitry Medvedev will meet EU leaders on Tuesday in
Brussels at the 26th Russia-EU summit. The EU, which represents
almost 500 million people, is Russia's biggest trading partner.
 U.S. backing for Russian membership, as part of a broader
so-called ""reset"" with the West, has been key in smoothing the
path for Russian accession. Differences between the two powers
had been a hurdle for years.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said Russia hoped to join
the 153-member WTO, which sets trade rules, in 2011.
 ""Currently, the EU position carries decisive significance
for the successful conclusion of the (WTO) talks in the swiftest
manner,"" the Kremlin said in a statement last week.
 Energy efficiency and climate change would also be
discussed, said the Kremlin.
 Russia's bid to join the WTO is the longest-running in
history, and outstanding multilateral issues include the level
of subsidy that Russia will pay its farmers -- a sensitive topic
as WTO members try to cap agricultural support among themselves.

 * Letter presses China to allow currency to rise
 * China's government procurement offer called inadequate
 By Doug Palmer
(Adds detail from letter)
 WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 32
senators on Monday pressed China to show ""concrete progress"" on
beef, intellectual property and other trade irritants at a
high-level meeting with U.S. officials next week.
 The group, representing nearly one-third of the Senate,
also urged China to let its currency ""to appreciate
meaningfully in advance of President Hu's visit"" to the United
States, which is expected Jan 17-20.
 The letter to Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan laid down a
marker for the annual U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce
and Trade meeting on Dec. 14-15 in Washington.
 ""The United States and China cannot just talk about hurdles
in our trade relationship - we need to overcome them,"" Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said in a statement
accompanying the letter.
 ""China's ineffective protection of intellectual property
rights, discriminatory innovation practices and barriers to
U.S. beef exports have long presented hurdles for American
businesses and ranchers exporting to China,"" Baucus said.
 Wang will lead a delegation of about 100 Chinese officials
coming to Washington for the talks.
 The meeting is co-chaired for the United States by Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk.
 In a move aimed at addressing U.S. concerns about copyright
theft, Beijing promised the United States in 2006 that Chinese
government agencies and state-owned enterprises would use only
licensed software.
 The senators said China failed to honor that commitment.
They asked Wang to ensure China would in a timely fashion and
also allow U.S. intellectual property rights holders such as
Microsoft  ""to verify the legitimacy of the software
used by these entities.""
 The senators also complained about a web of Chinese
regulation they said banned all imports of U.S. beef.
 ""There is no scientific basis for any of these restrictions
on U.S. beef imports. We therefore urge China to take
immediate, material steps that demonstrate its commitment to
open its market to all ages and cuts of U.S. beef,"" they said.
 Some of the restrictions stem from the discovery of mad cow
disease in the U.S. cattle herd in 2003. A number of countries
closed their markets to U.S. beef at the time and the United
States continues to battle to get some reopened.
 The senators acknowledged that one of the biggest trade
irritants, China's currency policy, is not on the official
agenda for the JCCT.
 But they warned if Beijing did not take action soon on that
front, the Senate could pass legislation already approved by
the House of Representative to address China's ""persistent
currency undervaluation.""
 The senators also criticized the terms of China's most
recent offer to join the World Trade Organization's Government
Procurement Agreement. They urged Beijing ""to submit a new
offer that is comparable to the commitments the United States
and other parties to the GPA have made.""

30-year high as fears remained about Europe's sovereign debt
problems amid speculation the United States may extend
monetary easing.
 Investors rushed to buy gold and silver, pushing spot gold
prices to an all-time high at $1,429.40 an ounce, and driving
U.S. silver futures front-month contract above $30 an ounce
for the first time since 1980.
 On Wall Street, the Dow and the S&P 500 ended slightly
lower as investors took profits while oil futures closed at
their highest in more than two years near $90 a barrel.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, prompted by safe-haven
bids after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on
Sunday the Fed may buy more than the $600 billion in U.S.
government bonds it has committed to purchase, if the economy
failed to respond. [ID:nN05271909]
 ""The U.S. showed you need to take extremely strong actions
to overcome the threat of a broad financial crisis,"" said Rick
Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in New York.
 ""The feeling was Europe has only gone about two-thirds of
the way, and there was some hope they will go to a full-
throttle protection plan.""
 Euro-zone finance ministers met on Monday amid pressure to
increase the size of a 750-billion-euro ($1 trillion) safety
net for debt-stricken members in hopes of halting potential
contagion to other countries. [ID:nLDE6B40EJ]
 But EU paymaster Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
rejected any such moves and also dismissed a call by two
veteran finance ministers for joint euro bonds guaranteed by
all governments.
 Last week, Ireland became the second country after Greece
to require an EU/IMF financial rescue. Some diplomats say
putting more money on the table now might be interpreted as a
sign that the EU is preparing for a possible bailout of Spain,
the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, and could aggravate
market tensions.
 Stocks and the euro have moved in tandem of late with the
euro looked at as a proxy for regional debt concerns.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slipped 19.90
points, or 0.17 percent, to close at 11,362.19. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 1.59 points, or 0.13 percent, to
1,223.12. But the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> ended up 3.46
points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,594.92.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of European
shares <.FTEU3>, added 0.13 percent to end at 1,105.41 as the
shares of major oil companies got a lift from strong crude
prices.
 U.S. crude oil futures  posted their highest close
in more than two years, gaining 19 cents, or 0.21 percent, to
settle at $89.38 a barrel. Oil prices got a lift from
Bernanke's comments raising the possibility of more
quantitative easing, as well as from a cold spell in Europe
and in parts of the United States that created greater heating
demand.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.11
percent to 321.78, while the December futures contract for the
Nikkei 225 stock index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 145
points to 10,175.
 EURO DROPS, COMMODITIES SOAR
 The euro  fell 0.84 percent to $1.3300, its first
decline in four sessions, as euro-zone finance ministers come
under pressure to find a common approach to ease the region's
debt crisis after an 85-billion-euro aid package for Ireland
failed to calm markets.
 The dollar gained against a basket of currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.34 percent at 79.654. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up just 0.02 percent
at 82.65 from a previous session close of 82.620.
 Meanwhile, spot gold prices  rose to an all-time
high at $1,429.40 an ounce and U.S. silver futures 
climbed above $30 an ounce, the highest level since 1980, on
worries about the European debt crisis.
 ""If you have money to put somewhere, you can either put it
in one of the smaller currencies like Canadian dollar or Swiss
franc or you can put it in an alternative currency like gold
or silver, and that's what is happening here,"" said Sterling
Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc., in St. Paul,
Minnesota.
 ""I can see that continuing. Until I see real resolution to
the European debt crisis, money will find its way into
precious metals.""
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, yet gains were limited as
investors prepared for this week's $66 billion in
coupon-bearing supply. Traders have also been selling into
strength, either to lock in short-term profits or to unwind
earlier positions tied to the Fed's latest quantitative easing
program, dubbed QE2.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
climbed 23/32 in price, with the yield at 2.926 percent. The
2-year U.S. Treasury note  rose 3/32, with the yield
at 0.429 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond 
shot up 1-10/32, with the yield at 4.237 percent.

 TORONTO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slipped
lower against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, as riskier
currencies were sold on growing doubts that European officials
would find a common approach to ease the region's debt crisis.
 Euro zone finance ministers met on Monday amid pressure to
increase the size of a 750-billion-euro ($1 trillion) safety
net for debt-stricken members in hopes of halting potential
contagion to other countries. [ID:nLDE6B40EJ]
 However, the Canadian dollar still held its own against
other major currencies as the second best performer behind the
greenback, thanks to strength in commodity markets.
 ""As the week starts, the market has refocused on European
concerns,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at
RBC Capital Markets.
 ""But ultimately, as the market moves into safe-haven U.S.,
it seems that the Canadian dollar benefited through
proximity.""
 Prices for key Canadian exports such as oil and metals were
boosted by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke that raised the possibility of more quantitative
easing, spurring optimism for the demand outlook.
 Bernanke, appearing on the U.S. TV news program ""60
Minutes"" on Sunday, said the Fed could end up buying more than
the $600 billion in U.S. government bonds it has committed to
purchase, if the economy failed to respond. [ID:nN05271909]
 The Canadian dollar closed the North American session at
C$1.0053 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.47 U.S. cents, down from
Friday's finish at C$1.0033, or 99.67 U.S. cents.
 Strauss said the area just above parity continues to
provide near term support for the U.S. dollar, followed by
C$0.9977 -- a bottom that has been unsuccessfully tested a
number of times during the last few months.
 The focus on Tuesday will be on the Bank of Canada's
interest rate announcement. While markets are pricing in next
to no chance of a move, investors will be eyeing the
accompanying statement closely.
 Strauss noted that meaningful changes to the outlook seem
unlikely in the absence of a quarterly monetary policy report,
last released in October, with the statement seen retaining its
cautious tone.
 Also on Tuesday, ministers from the 27-nation European
Union are expected to formally approve an 85 billion euro aid
package for Ireland and discuss the reform of EU budget rules,
which could set further direction for the week.
 Canadian bond prices were firmer across the curve, tracking
U.S. Treasuries, where debt prices rallied on Bernanke's
comments and as euro zone jitters sparked a safe-haven bid.

 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday and
more losses are likely after Germany rebuffed calls for a
bigger euro zone financial safety net, raising fears of
division over how to stem the region's debt crisis.
 The euro had earlier fallen more than 1 percent to near
$1.3250 as traders took profits on its recent three-day climb.
In the near term, the euro could head back toward its 2-1/2
month low around $1.2970 set last week, traders said.
 Yields on Italian, Spanish and Greek bonds and the cost of
protecting them against default rose after Germany rejected a
call by the International Monetary Fund to increase the size of
a 750 billion euro safety net. Germany also dismissed a call
for joint euro bonds guaranteed by all governments.
 ""What Europe has done is not enough. They have to have
eurobonds,"" John Taylor, chairman and chief investment officer
of FX Concepts, told Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit.
Taylor runs the world's largest currency hedge fund with assets
under management of around $8.5 billion.
 ""You can't lend money to Ireland or Greece. You're just
piling on more debt to them, and it's getting harder and harder
to repay.""
 He said Portugal could be the next country to seek a
bailout after Ireland, with Spain after that. This will push
the euro to parity versus the dollar by next year, he said.
 The euro was last down 0.9 percent at $1.3301, coming off a
session low of $1.3246 on trading platform EBS. It also fell
0.8 percent to 109.94 yen.
 Market talk that fueled the euro's rally late last week was
confirmed on Monday when the ECB said it had bought 1.965
billion euros worth of bonds in the week to Dec. 3 compared
with 1.348 billion the previous week. That was the biggest
weekly total since the end of June and takes the program's
overall tally to 69 billion euros.
 In the options market, risk reversals showed bearish
sentiment on the euro increased again after falling last week,
suggesting a recovery in the spot euro above $1.34 may have run
its course. The 25-delta 1-month risk reversal rose above 2.0
on Monday after hitting around 1.85 on Friday.
 Ireland, which last week became the second country after
Greece to require an EU/IMF financial rescue, looks set to pass
the toughest budget in the country's history on Tuesday.
 BERNANKE AND QE2
 With the euro resuming its decline, the dollar index, which
tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, was up
0.3 percent at 79.583, close to its 100-day moving average of
80.04.
 Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke said on CBS-TV's ""60 minutes""
Sunday evening that it is possible U.S. monetary policy-makers
could increase the $600 billion in asset purchases announced at
the last Fed meeting.
 Analysts and traders said Bernanke's comments on QE were
not too bearish, given Friday's sharply below-forecast jobs
growth for November.
 Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive
Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut, said Bernanke's comments
assuaged fears over inflation and helped buoy the dollar.
 ""Bernanke made clear that he has no interest in letting
inflation budge beyond 2 percent and that soothed fears,"" he
said.
 FX Concepts' Taylor said the United States is headed for a
new recession, and that should boost the U.S. dollar while
weighing on commodity prices.
 The dollar was flat at 82.63 yen, climbing off Friday's
three-week low of 82.52 yen and keeping well above the Ichimoku
'cloud' bottom around 81.70 yen.
 Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O'Neill said a
retreat of the supercharged Japanese yen may well be the
currency story of next year.
 ""The one currency that could be developing a new trend
could be the yen. We could see the end of its strength...it's
more than two standard deviations overvalued.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro snapped a three-day advance
versus the dollar on Monday and selling pressure is likely to
continue as doubts grew that European officials would find a common
approach to ease the region's debt crisis.
 The euro had earlier fallen more than 1 percent to around $1.3250
as traders took profits on its recent gains. The single currency
could head back toward its 2-1/2 month low around $1.2970 set last
week, traders said.
 Yields on Italian, Spanish and Greek bonds and the cost of
protecting them against default rose after Germany rejected a call by
the International Monetary Fund to increase the size of a
750-billion-euro safety net for debt-stricken members.
 Last week, Ireland became the second country after Greece to
require an EU/IMF financial rescue and fears are growing Portugal and
Spain will be the next to need assistance. That pushed the euro down
7 percent versus the dollar last month.
 ""What Europe has done is not enough. They have to have
eurobonds,"" John Taylor, chairman and chief investment officer of FX
Concepts, told Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit. Taylor runs
the world's largest currency hedge fund with assets under management
of around $8.5 billion.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday as
traders took profits from a three-day rally on signs of
division over how to contain the euro zone's fiscal crisis.
 The euro's weak performance came as euro zone finance
ministers met under pressure to boost the size of a rescue fund
to stop a debt crisis from spreading.
 The euro zone should have a bigger rescue fund for member
states in trouble, and the European Central Bank should boost
its bond buying to prevent the sovereign debt crisis from
derailing economic recovery, an International Monetary Fund
report obtained by Reuters said.
 ""There is a growing discord among euro zone finance
ministers, and that is weighing heavily on the euro today,""
said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive
Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""This discord is prompting a resumption of the bearish trend
surrounding the euro,"" he said. ""If this discord continues, I
fully expect the euro to be tested at $129.86 this week.""
 Germany's rebuff to the IMF call reinforced this discord.
 In early afternoon in New York the euro was down 0.90
percent at $1.3294 but above the session's low of $1.3245,
according to Reuters data.
 Peripheral government bond yields widened sharply against
those of Germany after four days of narrowing last week.
 The United States is headed for a new recession, said John
Taylor, chairman and chief investment officer of FX Concepts,
and that should boost the U.S. dollar and weigh on commodity
prices.
He added that the euro zone is in a difficult financial
situation, with Spain likely to be an issue in 2011. That could
push the euro to parity versus the dollar by next year, Taylor
said at the Reuters Global Investment Summit on Monday.
 The euro also fell to a session low against the yen on
electronic trading platform EBS midway through the New York
session on Monday. The euro was last down 1.1 percent against
the yen at 109.69 yen after going as low as 109.63 yen.
 With the euro resuming its decline, the dollar index was up
0.5 percent at 79.74, close to its 100-day moving average of
80.04.
 Meanwhile, market talk that fueled the euro rally late last
week was confirmed on Monday when the ECB said it had bought
1.965 billion euros worth of bonds in the week to Dec. 3
compared with 1.348 billion the previous week. It was the
biggest weekly total since the end of June and takes the
program's overall tally to 69 billion euros.

Sunday it is possible U.S. monetary policymakers could increase
the $600 billion in asset purchases announced at the last Fed
meeting.
 Analysts and traders said Bernanke's comments on QE were
not too bearish given Friday's below-forecast jobs data.
 Interactive Brokers' Wilkinson said Bernanke's comments
assuaged fears over inflation and has helped buoyed the
dollar.
 ""Bernanke made clear that he has no interest in letting
inflation budge beyond 2 percent and that soothed fears,"" he
said.
 Euro/dollar risk reversals showed the premium demanded to
buy euro puts over calls rising again as the recovery in the
spot euro above $1.34 looked to have run its course. The
25-delta 1-month risk reversal traded above 2.0 on Monday after
falling to around 1.85 on Friday.
 The dollar was up 0.08 percent to 82.70 yen, below its
session high of 82.98, but climbing off Friday's three-week low
of 82.52 yen and keeping well above the Ichimoku 'cloud' bottom
around 81.70 yen.

 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply against

 U.S. crude oil futures  slipped 30 cents, or 0.34
percent, to $88.89 per barrel, after trading as high as
$89.76, the highest since October 2008, as a cold spell in

 EURO SLIDES, COMMODITIES SOAR
 The euro  slipped 0.95 percent to $1.3286, its first
decline in four sessions, as euro-zone finance ministers come
under pressure to increase the size of the region's rescue
fund after an 85-billion-euro aid package for Ireland failed
to calm markets.
 The dollar gained against a basket of currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.43 percent at 79.716. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up just 0.08 percent
at 82.69 from a previous session close of 82.620.
 Meanwhile, U.S. silver futures  climbed above $30 an
ounce, gaining more than 2 percent as gold's rally and strong
demand from momentum traders and retail investors lifted the
metal to its highest level since 1980.
 ""If you have money to put somewhere, you can either put it
in one of the smaller currencies like Canadian dollar or Swiss
franc or you can put it in an alternative currency like gold
or silver, and that's what is happening here,"" said Sterling
Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc., in St. Paul,
Minnesota.
 ""I can see that continuing. Until I see real resolution to
the European debt crisis, money will find its way into
precious metals.""
 Spot gold prices  rose as high ast $1,420.31 an
ounce before easing to $1,413.40 an ounce later in the day. It
touched a record $1,424.10 early in November.
 While strength in the U.S. currency kept a lid on
dollar-priced gold's further gains, gold hit record highs in
euro and sterling terms, and Japanese yen-denominated bullion
hit its highest since early 1983 as risk aversion stoked
broad-based gains in the metal.
 An International Monetary Fund report, to be delivered to
the meeting in Brussels, will say the euro zone should
increase the size of its 750-billion-euro rescue fund and the
European Central Bank should boost its bond buying markedly.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose yet gains were limited as
investors prepared for this week's $66 billion in
coupon-bearing supply. Traders have also been selling into
strength, either to lock in short-term profits or to unwind
earlier positions tied to the Fed's latest quantitative easing
program, dubbed QE2.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 11/32, with the yield at 2.968 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 2/32, with the yield at 0.449
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up
14/32, with the yield at 4.287 percent.

 Dec 6 (Reuters) - France's President Nicolas Sarkozy on
Monday unveiled upto $20 billion worth of defence, atomic energy
and civil aviation deals with India during a four-day trip to
the country.
 Following are details of signed deals between India and
France, agreements close to completion, and possible future
deals:
 SIGNED DEALS:
 AREVA
 In a deal estimated at 7 billion euros ($9.3 billion),
French nuclear power group Areva signed a framework agreement
with state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India to provide
two pressurised water reactors to a site in the western state of
Maharashtra.
 Construction for the reactors, the first in a series that
France is expecting to supply, will start next year and
operations will start by 2018. The deal includes the supply of
reactor fuel for 25 years.
 AIRBUS
 A government statement said European group Airbus has signed
lease contracts to supply A330 aircraft to India's Jet Airways
and state-run carrier Air India in separate deals totalling 2.8
billion euros.
 But aviation industry officials later said the deals were
likely to involve renting the planes from banks or other third
parties and would not generate new business for Airbus.
 MICHELIN
 French tyre maker Michelin signed a protocol contract with
the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu to invest around 600
million euros in a factory.

 ADVANCED TALKS TO SEAL DEALS:
 THALES
 Indian and French officials are close to signing two deals
with European defence electronics group Thales to modernise
India's ageing air force.
 Negotiations are under way on a 1.5-billion euro deal for
Thales to upgrade India's Mirage fighter jets, and an agreement
for Thales to equip the Mirage jets with missiles worth 700
million euros.
 MBDA
 European missiles and missile systems manufacturer MBDA,
whose major shareholders are BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica
of Italy, are close to signing a deal with India to jointly
develop surface-to-air missiles in a deal worth 2 billion euros.
 SAFRAN
 French defence and aerospace conglomerate Safran is in
advanced negotiations to jointly develop a fighter jet with
India in a deal worth 500-700 million euros.
 
 OTHER POSSIBLE DEALS:
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he was still hopeful
that India would also buy the Rafale fighter jet produced by
France's Dassault Aviation.
 Dassault faces stiff competition in the race for the $11
billion deal, currently the world's largest single military
contract, from the Typhoon aircraft made by the Eurofighter
consortium and other U.S. and Russian bidders.

should hit a record $75 billion this year, with similar levels
likely in 2011 as well, says J.P Morgan which runs the
widely-used EMBI and GBI-EM emerging bond index series.
 The bank said in a note that year-to-date flows stand at
$61.8 billion, or $7 billion a month on average, compared to
$3.9 billion per month in 2009, the previous record year. J.P.
Morgan's previous forecast for 2010 had been $50-$55 billion.
 Local currency debt took the most inflows of around $35.8
billion year-to-date, compared to $26 billion for hard currency,
J.P. Morgan said, adding that around 17 percent of the inflows
may have gone to exchange-traded funds.
 Emerging bond ETFs have grown to $4.4 billion compared to
$250 million in early 2009, J.P. Morgan said, adding EM bond
ETFs had taken in $2.2 billion year-to-date after receiving
inflows of $1.5 billion in 2009.
 But this remains tiny compared with inflows of $22 billion
year-to-date in emerging equity ETFs, it added.
 Total funds benchmarked to JPM's indexes amount to nearly
$420 billion, including the sovereign dollar bond EMBI indices,
the local currency GBI-EM series and the corporate CEMBI index.
 ""The strongest growth in percentage terms has been in assets
benchmarked to the local market GBI-EM indices, increasing by
almost 120 percent over the past two years,"" the bank said.
 The sector has also posted stellar returns this year, with
sovereign hard currency bonds posting gains of 13.3 percent so
far, and returns for the CEMBI corporate bond index and GBI-EM
local currency debt index also in double digits.
 All the three indexes are now rated investment grade, as a
number of developing countries including Brazil, Costa Rica,
Peru and Morocco, made it to the ranks of investment grade
sovereigns during or after the crisis.
 The lowest sovereign investment grade rating is BBB- for
Fitch and Standard & Poor's and Baa3 for Moody's.

 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply against
the dollar on Monday and stocks dipped as fears remained over
sovereign debt problems in Europe.
 U.S. Treasuries rose prompted by safe-haven bids after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Sunday the Fed
may buy more than the $600 billion in U.S. government bonds it
has committed to purchase, if the economy failed to respond.
[ID:nN05271909]
 Oil and gold prices held near its highest in two years and

to overcome the threat of a broad financial crisis,"" said Rick

 Stocks and the euro have moved in tandem of late with the
euro looked at as a proxy for regional debt concerns.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 14.57
points, or 0.13 percent, at 11,367.52. The Standard & Poor's

down 0.1 percent on profit-taking after they hit a six-month

 EURO UNDER PRESSURE
 The euro  was down 0.93 percent at $1.3289, its first
decline in four sessions, as euro zone finance ministers are
put under pressure to increase the size of its rescue fund
after an 85 billion euro aid package for Ireland failed to calm
markets.
 The dollar gained against a basket of currencies, with the

inversely to the dollar.
 Crude oil  was down 2 cents, or 0.02 percent, to

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply against
the dollar on Monday, marking its first decline in four
sessions, as fears about euro zone peripheral government debt
moved to the forefront, trumping dovish comments made by U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 The weak performance of the euro comes ahead of a meeting
of euro zone finance ministers, who are under pressure to boost
the size of a rescue fund to stop a debt crisis from
spreading.
 The euro was down 1.14 percent at $1.3261, according to
Reuters data. Traders reported an options expiry on Monday at
$1.3250.
 IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn will present a report, a
copy of which was obtained by Reuters, to euro zone finance
ministers meeting in Brussels, saying more action is needed
from member states.
 This encouraged renewed selling of the euro after a rebound
late last week took it back above $1.34, with traders citing
selling by real money accounts and sovereign names.
 Euro/dollar ""has scope to move down further, with political
developments and commitment from euro zone policymakers likely
to be the focus,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency
strategy at HSBC.
 The IMF report will say the euro zone should increase the
size of its 750 billion euro rescue fund and the European
Central Bank should boost bond buying markedly.
 With the euro resuming its decline, the dollar index was up
0.5 percent at 79.814, close to its 100-day moving average of
80.04.
 BERNANKE AND QE2
 The dollar also bounced on a bout of short covering as
investors shrugged off comments from U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke that quantitative easing could be bigger
than estimated.
 Fed Chairman Bernanke appeared in an interview on CBS-TV's
""60 minutes"" late Sunday and communicated his view that it is
possible that U.S. monetary policymakers increase the
additional $600 billion in asset purchases announced at the
last Fed meeting.
 More asset purchases would be negative for the dollar, but
his comments failed to hurt the greenback.
 The weakness in the European currency complex is likely the
primary reason for the dollar's support, nullifying the impact
of Friday's nonfarm data which punished yields and sent the
trade-weighted dollar down nearly 1 percent. This was its worst
daily loss in over a month, according to Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""Reports that both President Trichet and the IMF have
suggested that the size of the European bailout fund needs to
be larger has removed the calm that had entered European
markets late last week,"" she wrote. ""The combination of the
Irish budget vote, today's Eurogroup meeting and several ECB
council member press conferences leaves a lot of room for
headline risk.""
 Analysts and traders said Bernanke's comments on QE were
not too bearish given Friday's below-forecast jobs data.
 The euro briefly rose to $1.3380 after European clearing
house LCH.Clearnet reduced the margin requirement on Irish
government bonds to 30 percent from 45 percent of net positions
of its margin rate.
 Euro/dollar risk reversals showed the premium demanded to
buy euro puts over calls rising again as the recovery in the
spot euro above $1.34 looked to have run its course. The
25-delta 1-month risk reversal traded above 2.0 on Monday after
falling to around 1.85 on Friday.
 Latest data from the Commodity and Futures Trading
Commission showed currency speculators trimmed bets against the
U.S. dollar for a fourth straight week.
 The dollar was up 0.25 percent to 82.83 yen, below its
session high of 82.98, but climbing off Friday's three-week low
of 82.52 yen and keeping well above the Ichimoku 'cloud' bottom
around 81.70 yen.

 BEIJING, Dec 6 (Reuters) - One more victim can be added to
the casualty list from the fallout of the euro zone debt
crisis: the cause of currency integration in Asia.	
 The idea that countries as different as Japan and Laos, or
Singapore and Myanmar, might share the same money has always
been a vision for future generations, not the here and now.	
 But policymakers have at least been heading in the
direction of closer cooperation by formalising the network of
emergency central bank loans they set up in Chiang Mai,
Thailand, in 2000 to try to prevent a repeat of the 1997/98
Asian financial crisis.	
 Any notion, though, that the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI)
could form a springboard to more ambitious monetary
coordination looks doomed since the bailouts of Greece, and
now Ireland, have exposed the frailties of a common currency
area with infinitely deeper economic and institutional roots
than Asia can offer.	
 ""The key message from Europe for Asia is that it
undermines any argument that currency union is a sensible way
forward towards closer integration,"" said Peter Drysdale,
emeritus professor of economics at Australian National
University (ANU) in Canberra.	
 ""That was never a persuasive argument, but it has close to
zero credibility now,"" Drysdale added.	
 
 POSTPONED TILL LATER	
 The nations of Europe painstakingly knitted together their
economies, and then their exchange rates, over the course of
nearly half a century before they were ready to create the euro.	
 Even then, as the current crisis has exposed, the fathers
of the single currency left gaping institutional holes that
they are now scrambling to fill by creating mechanisms to
enforce fiscal discipline and, as a last resort, enable
sovereign debt restructuring.	
 Governments in Asia, by contrast, pride themselves in not
poking their nose into their neighbours' business.	
 It took the 10 members of the Association of South East
Asian Nations along with China, Japan and South Korea -- ASEAN
Plus Three -- a decade to turn the CMI's complex web of
bilateral currency swap agreements into a single, uniform
facility.	
 The $120 billion, ungainly named Chiang Mai Initiative
Multilateralisation agreement finally took effect in March.	
 But don't expect leaders to conclude that the moral from
Europe's debt mess is to get a move on. The opposite is more
likely.	
 ""There is a bit of concern about what has been going on in
Europe and what it means for Asia,"" said Jay Menon, an
economist in the Office of Regional Economic Integration at
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila.	
 Menon said the first lesson to be learned was the need for
greater institutionalisation to ensure the success of
regionalism; second, admitting countries to a single currency
before they were ready and without a means of enforcing fiscal
discipline could lead to disastrous consequences.	
 ""This implies that the deepening of Asian regionalism is
likely to take even longer than before the euro zone crisis
erupted,"" he said. ""It was a long way away before, but it's
even further away now.""	
 
 FORGET UTOPIA	
 Some would say that is not a bad thing. Asia should
concentrate on getting the basics right before reaching for
the stars.	
 Razeen Sally, director of the European Centre for
International Political Economy, a Brussels think tank, said
the logic for the European Union to integrate trade in goods
and services as well as investment capital flows was
reasonably clear.	
 But the economies of Europe do not have enough in common
to constitute an optimal currency area, he argued. So monetary
integration was a bridge too far.	
 Speaking in Beijing, Sally said: ""If there is a big lesson
to draw in this part of the world, it is that trade and
investment integration should be secured incrementally without
a leap into Utopian projects.	
 ""Because if you do make a leap into Utopian projects, the
risk is not only will these projects themselves self-destruct
but they will lead to an unravelling of the kind of trade
integration that Asia has already achieved.""	
 Specifically, Sally said, if the euro were to crack, the
risk of controls on capital flows within Europe could not be
excluded, and that could spill over to protectionism in the
27-nation single market.	
 Drysdale, the ANU professor, also said the demise of
Asia's dream of a single currency should not prevent
governments from forging closer links in other areas.	
 ""All the other arguments for commodity and capital market
opening remain intact, and are reinforced by a sense that it
is necessary to promote regional growth and integration in the
face of continuing weakness in Europe and north America,"" he
said.	
 
 SALUTARY EFFECT	
 The argument in favour of keeping a close eye on economic
and financial performance in the region has not gone away
either, especially as currencies across Asia are moving
increasingly in tandem, in the orbit of the yuan.	
 ""I think that the crisis can have a salutary effect on
Asian integration by highlighting the importance of
surveillance,"" said Willem Thorbecke, a researcher in Tokyo at
the ADB Institute and the Research Institute of Economy Trade
and Industry.	
 Indeed, the 13 parties to the CMIM intend to do just that.	
 Although diplomats say ASEAN Plus Three showed no interest
at recent meetings in developing a coordinated approach to
tackling capital inflows, the group is due to open an Asian
Macroeconomic Research Office in Singapore next May.	
 ""Asian countries are considering holding each other's
currencies as part of their foreign exchange reserves. If they
do, they will have an incentive to monitor economic
fundamentals in neighbouring countries and to use peer
pressure to advocate policies to mitigate vulnerabilities,""
Thorbecke said.

(Adds details, background)
 BEIJING, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Trade transactions settled in
Chinese yuan totalled 340 billion yuan ($51 billion) between
June and November, the People's Bank of China said on Monday.
 China launched a pilot scheme of allowing companies to
settle cross-border trade in yuan in July 2009 and expanded it
in June.
 The amount of yuan settlement in the past six months was
more than seven times the total level at its initial stage and
well satisfied the demand of companies in the business, the
central bank said in a statement on its website
(www.pbc.gov.cn).
 The figure suggests that the pilot programme, allowing firms
in some parts of the country to denominate their trade with
companies in Hong Kong and some other trade partners in yuan, is
growing faster than expected.
 A total of 67,359 companies had already participated in yuan
trade settlements, it said.
 ""The expansion of exporters to 67,359 from 365 in the trial
programme will further push ahead the development of yuan
settlement in the exports of goods, and facilitate trade and
investment,""the central bank said in a statement.
 The programme was heralded as a step towards
internationalising the currency and eventually leading to
China's relaxation of capital controls.
 China, under pressure from the United States and other
countries to let the yuan rise in value, seeks to increase the
yuan's use in foreign trade to reduce the dollar's dominance.

 MOSCOW, Dec 6 (Reuters) - China wants to pay in roubles for
Russian timber, coking coal and seafood, a Russian central bank
official said on Monday, as the two countries seek to boost
trade in national currencies and reduce reliance on the dollar.
 Russia's MICEX exchange will start trading in yuan-rouble on
Dec. 15 to support bilateral trade ties, Igor Marich, a
vice-president of the bourse, told a conference on Monday.
 This move follows the launch of the forex pair 
in China on Nov. 22. [ID:nTOE6AL02F]
 ""Our importers need the yuan, there is no doubt about it --
they have worn down the doorsteps of Russian banks. It is more
profitable to pay in yuan,"" Viktor Melnikov, a deputy chairman
of the Russian central bank, told a conference in Moscow.
 ""On the other side, there is demand for roubles from the
Chinese -- they are ready to buy timber, Sakhalin coking coal
and seafood for roubles.""
 Russia is trying to raise the profile of the rouble both in
the long-term hope it could become a reserve currency for other
countries and to reduce its reliance on the dollar due to most
of its revenues stemming from oil and gas.
 China, Moscow's second largest trading partner after the
European Union, is interested in establishing long-term supplies
of oil and gas from Russia, the world's largest energy producer.
 Marich said the daily volume of the yuan-rouble trading is
expected to average 3 billion yuan ($450 million) with the one
hour trading session starting from 1000 Moscow time (0700 GMT).
 Around 40 banks have demonstrated interest in trading
Chinese currency  against the rouble  and five
of them will act as market makers, including VTB, My Bank, the
Russian affiliate of Chinese ICBC bank and a local subsidiary of
Bank of China, Marich said.
 
 LEARN CHINESE
 Russian bankers at the conference -- used to a more flexible
exchange rate regime than their Chinese counterparts --- were
most interested in the possibility of speculative bets, asking
if there was easy money to be made from opening a long yuan
position and just waiting for it to appreciate.
 ""Are speculative operations possible? That word is a bit
frightening for the Chinese,"" said Lang Weijie, vice president
at ICBC, adding that such operations would only be possible with
off-shore money.
 According to the regulation, Chinese currency held in
Russian bank accounts can only be moved into China if
accompanied by a contract for a trade deal.
 Russia's central bank said the yuan-rouble trade was aimed
at satisfying importers and exporters rather than speculators,
and cautioned investors against placing bets on the currencies
without fully delving into the complicated world of Chinese
foreign exchange regulation.
 ""If you want to develop this direction, you should teach
people, find people with Chinese language. Without that, it will
be difficult,"" Melnikov said.
 China accounts for 9.5 percent of Russia's foreign trade.
Bilateral trade rose to $41.8 billion in the first nine months
of 2010 compared to $26.7 billion a year ago, according to the
Russian Federal Customs Service data.
 Russia is also looking to settle bilateral trade in national
currencies with Turkey , Brazil , Vietnam  and
Algeria . Melnikov said talks with these countries were
continuing.

 WARSAW, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Poland's planned reform of its
pension system will avoid the sort of radical overhaul that has
spooked investors in Hungary, the prime minister's top economic
aide said on Monday, adding decisions would be made on the
reform in late December.
 Rating agency Moody's cut Hungary's credit rating on Monday,
citing concerns over fiscal sustainability. [ID:nLDE6B5073]
Investors have sold Hungarian assets since Budapest announced it
was scrapping private pension funds.
 ""Hungary's example shows that short-term, anti-system or
one-off solutions don't work,"" Michal Boni told Reuters. ""We are
determined not to follow in Hungary's footsteps. We will search
for different solutions.""
 Poland is seeking ways to rein in its public debt amid
concerns that it could breach the 55 percent of GDP level this
year, a move which under Polish law would trigger painful
spending cuts.
 The centre-right government has been working on solutions
that would change the functioning of the private pension funds
(OFEs), part of a 1990s reform that generated additional
temporary costs for the state that push up its budget deficit. 
 ""In Poland's situation it's better to seek a wise correction
of the system that would guarantee the long-term benefits of
this system and at the same time decrease the current debt
threat,"" Boni said.
 ""We will make the general decision by Christmas. Then
everything must be translated into the legislative work of the
government and the parliament. So these solutions won't be in
place in the first quarter (of 2011) for sure.""
 Officials say lowering the cash contributions to the OFEs is
the most likely option, with OFE-dedicated, non-tradeable bonds
being substituted for some of the transfers. [ID:nLDE6B01IQ]

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The euro slid on Monday with
concerns about weaker European economies undimmed, while shares
were flat as euro zone worries were offset by the possibility of
more money being injected into the U.S. economy.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Sunday the central bank
could end up buying more than the $600 billion in U.S.
government bonds it has committed to purchase, if the economy
failed to respond.
 European shares edged higher, supported by the belief the
Fed would do what it took to keep the U.S. economic recovery
ticking along but still fearful of the euro zone debt crisis
spreading.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a mixed open on Wall
Street, following strong gains last week.
 ""The market is looking a bit tentative. We are looking
towards the euro zone finance ministers meeting to see how much
they are going to increase the safety net,"" said Micky
Mahbubani, senior sales trader at IG Index.
 ""But, we have not seen a major sell off yet as Bernanke's
comments have been supportive. If the outcome of the meeting is
not as good as expected than I expect to see a sell off.""
 
 EURO IN RETREAT BEFORE KEY MEETING
 The euro, having climbed 1.5 percent on Friday, beat a
retreat to around 1.3300 ahead of a euro zone finance ministers'
meeting later in the day that will consider next policy options
after an 85 billion euro aid package for Ireland failed to calm
markets.
 An International Monetary Fund report, to be delivered to
the meeting in Brussels, will say the euro zone should increase
the size of its 750 billion euro rescue fund and the European
Central Bank should boost its bond-buying markedly.
 But whether they will act is far from certain.
 ""The crisis will probably get worse before anything is done
and (the Eurogroup meeting) could be another missed
opportunity,"" said James Nixon, chief European economist at
Societe Generale.
 Peripheral bond yields were kept in check last week by
European Central Bank bond buying, which it increased but not
dramatically so. Far more than that is likely to be needed.
 ""The ECB has bought some time by increasing its bond
purchases but unless they are prepared to do that every day,
it's like Canute -- the tide will continue to come in,"" Nixon
said.
 Portuguese 10-year bond yields rose almost 13 basis points
by 1200 GMT, with equivalent Spanish and Italian yields up
around 8 bps. December Bund futures were 26 ticks higher on the
day.
 The prospect, following weak U.S. jobless data, of more
money from the Fed sloshing around the U.S. economy had taken
its toll on the dollar, but having shed more than 1 percent
against a basket of currencies on Friday, it bounced.
 The dollar index was up 0.45 percent at 79.74 by 1200 GMT.
 ""Friday's moves were so rapid that it is natural to have a
bit of position unwinding,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, strategist at
Nikko Cordial Securities. ""There's also a feeling that there
could be more bad news from the euro zone.""
 Oil eased from a 26-month high near $90 as the dollar
strengthened while the MSCI world equity index was down 0.2
percent at 321.43, with Asian shares as steady as those in
Europe.
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index slipped 0.1 percent but
investors snapped up shares in Africa-focused miner Riversdale
Mining, after global miner Rio Tinto made a $3.5 billion bid
approach. Riversdale shares surged 12 percent.
 Firm metal prices helped support commodity currencies such
as the Australian dollar, which traded around $0.99.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded at
$8,725 a tonne at 1123 GMT, within reach of its record high of
$8,966 reached on Nov. 11.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose to a
three-week high on Monday as the head of the U.S. Federal
Reserve suggested its injection of cash into the economy could
exceed the planned $600 billion, overshadowing weak U.S. jobs
data late last week.	
 European shares followed the firmer tone of Asia as
investors bet that the chances for a global recovery had
increased following the comments from Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares climbed 0.4 percent in early dealings.	
 ""Markets have a clear message from the policymakers that
they are in the business to ensure a sustained recovery,"" said
Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""That is
good news for the markets.""	
 The prospect that the U.S. central bank could boost its
bond buying supported U.S. Treasuries and undermined the
dollar, which in turn boosted the attractiveness of some
commodities, such as oil.	
 Bernanke's comments came after data on Friday showed a
paltry 39,000 increase in U.S. non-farm payrolls and an
unexpected rise in the jobless rate to a seven-month high of
9.8 percent.	
 Bernanke said the central bank could increase its bond
buying if the economy fails to respond to stimulus efforts or
if unemployment stays too high.	
 Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS, said the prospect of
persistent quantitative policy measures by the major economies
was likely to overpower other key developments, such as
tighter policy settings in China.	
 ""It appears that the main underlying trends in the market
have been reinforced and funds will continue to flow strongly
towards Asia and commodities will remain well bid,"" he said.	
 
 MSCI's gauge of Asian stocks excluding Japan
rose to highs not seen since Nov. 15. It was
last up 0.4 percent at 467.87, extending last week's 3.9
percent rally.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.3 percent,
India's SENSEX rose 0.9 percent and Singapore's
Straits Times Index put on 0.9 percent.	
 ""Talk that the U.S. Federal Reserve doesn't rule out
further quantitative easing is helping to keep the markets
buoyant, despite the poor jobs data that came out on Friday,""
said Carey Wong, an investment analyst at OCBC Investment
Research.	
 In Australia, investors snapped up shares in
Africa-focused miner Riversdale Mining after global
miner Rio Tinto made a $3.5 billion bid approach.
Riversdale shares surged 16 percent.	
 However, Japan's Nikkei average , which has
outperformed most other major markets in the past month, ended
a shade lower.	
 Exporters such as Canon Inc came under pressure
as the dollar wallowed near two-week lows against the yen.	
 
 DOLLAR CAPPED	
 The dollar bought 82.83 yen , not far off a two-week
low of 82.51 yen set Friday. 
 It edged down against a basket of major currencies ,
extending a fall of 1.4 percent last week.	
 The euro, however, slipped back below $1.34 on
persistent worries that Ireland's debt crisis would spread to
other high deficit euro zone members, such as Portugal and
Spain.	
 The region's finance ministers, meeting later on Monday,
face pressure to increase the size of a 750 billion euro
safety net for crisis-hit members in order to halt contagion
in the single currency bloc. [ID:nLDE6B40EJ]	
 U.S. Treasury bond yields eased across the curve, with the
10-year slipping 4 basis points to 2.96 percent.	
 German government bonds also rose off the back of firmer
Treasuries, although the European market's main focus was
firmly set on the euro debt woes.	
 Copper , which produced its biggest weekly gain in
four months last week, drifted up 0.6 percent to $8,781 a
tonne, close to a record $8,966 reached on Nov. 11.	
 U.S. crude futures  rose 0.6 percent to $89.69 a
barrel, having reached a two-year high at $89.76 earlier.	
 Gold was little changed at $1,416 an ounce, but was
close to a record high around $1,424 set last month.

 * Wants to see experience of other countries first

(Adds more comments, background)
 By Stanley Carvalho and Mahmoud Habboush
 ABU DHABI, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Pegging the United Arab
Emirates' currency to the U.S. dollar is still the best choice
for the Gulf oil-producing country, its central bank governor
Sultan Nasser al-Suweidi said on Monday.
 Suweidi's comments come after the UAE economy minister last
week said Gulf countries should discuss whether to shift their
currency pegs to a basket of international currencies instead of
the dollar.
 ""Sixty to 65 percent of the UAE trade is denominated in U.S.
dollars so it is important to keep our peg to the dollar,""
Suweidi told a news conference ahead of a summit of Gulf Arab
rulers in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi.
 ""We have lots of investments in the U.S. and the U.S has
deep markets for investing, so the dollar for us is the most
important currency.""
 Periods of dollar weakness combined with higher inflation in
the Gulf tend to revive questions about the viability of
currency pegs to the U.S. dollar in the world's top oil
exporting region.
 Kuwait is the only Gulf oil exporter tracking a currency
basket, after ditching the dollar peg in 2007.
 The dollar recouped some losses on Monday from a renewed
focus on U.S. monetary policy easing, pulling up off two-week
lows against the euro.
 Inflation in the Gulf is on the rise again as oil-based
economies recover from last year's downturn and regional debt
woes, but it is well below record double-digit highs seen in
most countries in 2008.
 ""We have inflation under control and supervision. There is
no issue here at all,"" Suweidi said.
 ""Inflation stemming from economic sectors ... like real
estate ... has thank God now ceased to cause problems and
therefore I think inflation will not return to the UAE for many
years to come,"" he said.
 UAE consumer prices climbed to an 18-month high of 1.9
percent in October, but pressures are muted due to the fallout
from Dubai's debt woes. Inflation hit a record high of 12.3
percent in 2008, when the dollar peg came under pressure.
 Forwards now price in 0.1 percent weakening in a year for
the UAE dirham compared with 3.7 percent appreciation at the
height of 2007 speculation that imported inflation would force
the region to abandon its dollar pegs.
 
 GULF CURRENCY
 Suweidi also said the UAE's position on rejoining a planned
Gulf monetary union was unchanged, indicating the world's
third-largest crude exporter may come back to the project only
after the single currency is launched.
 ""Nothing new under the sun. The Emirates is still on its
position, we are giving our brothers the chance to speed up the
process ... and (then) we see their experience,"" he said.
 He declined to explain why the UAE is holding back.
 The second-largest Arab economy withdrew from the project
last year in protest at a decision to locate the joint monetary
council in rival Saudi Arabia. UAE policymakers have been saying
that rejoining was not on the table unless it is profitable.
 Only Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain in the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council remained committed to
forming the long-delayed monetary union.
 But the project, expected to be discussed at the Dec 6-7
summit, saw little progress this year with the euro zone debt
crisis limiting its appeal.

 * Rogue is Nissan's best-selling light truck in U.S.
 * Model accounts for about quarter of Kyushu plant output
 * Nissan negotiating spin-off of Kyushu factory to cut costs
(Adds details, background)
 By Chang-Ran Kim, Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co will stop building
the Rogue in Japan at the crossover's next remodelling around
2013, transferring output of one of its most popular U.S.
vehicles to reduce exposure to the yen, an executive with direct
knowledge of the matter said.
 The Rogue is made at Nissan's 430,000 units-a-year Kyushu
factory in southern Japan, and is the brand's best-selling light
truck in the United States.
 Japanese automakers are looking for ways to reverse
currency-related losses as the yen's strength against the dollar
makes vehicles shipped to the U.S. from Japan less attractive and
profitable.
 ""There won't be another Rogue made in Japan (when it is
remodelled),"" the executive said, declining to be identified due
to the sensitivity of the matter.
 The end of the Rogue's production in Japan could result in a
hole of more than 100,000 vehicles a year at the Kyushu factory
-- or about a quarter of its capacity -- and comes at a sensitive
time for Japan's second-biggest automaker.
 Nissan is looking to spin off the factory, which also builds
the Teana, X-Trail and other models, into a new subsidiary by
late 2011 to allow it to broach wage negotiations with labour
unions and seek lower prices from suppliers.
 ""We do not disclose detailed plans of future models but among
the many ways to reduce the impact of the yen, increasing local
production has always been one of our options,"" Nissan spokesman
Toshitake Inoshita said.
 Japanese automakers are in a tough spot politically as
domestic suppliers and factory workers fret about a hollowing out
of the manufacturing sector at home. Japan lost its place as the
world's top car producer to China last year as total output sank
more than 30 percent to 7.93 million units.
 Nissan Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga, also chairman
of Japan's auto industry lobby, has said Nissan wants to maintain
domestic production at a minimum 1 million vehicles a year
despite a shrinking home market and a dollar that is far weaker
than its comfort zone of 95 yen.
 Last business year, Nissan built 1.025 million vehicles in
Japan.
 U.S. CAPACITY UNUSED
 The source declined to say where the Rogue would be built,
but Nissan has capacity left over at its two U.S. factories, in
Tennessee and Mississippi.
 Sales of the Rogue, which shares vehicle underpinnings with
other car-based SUVs such as the Qashqai and X-Trail, exceeded
89,000 units in the United States in the first 11 months of 2010,
accounting for just over a third of Nissan-branded light trucks
in the world's second-biggest car market.
 It also sold about 16,000 Rogues in Canada and Mexico through
October, according to the latest data available.
 Nissan has said it would aim to cut costs and offset currency
headwinds by importing more parts from overseas using a strong
yen, and make production even of small cars profitable in Japan.
 But executives have repeated that a yen at 90 to the dollar
would still be too strong for the Japanese auto industry and
threaten jobs in Asia's second-biggest economy. The dollar was
trading around 82.90 yen on Monday.
 Nissan has made headlines with its decision to shift output
of the high-volume March/Micra subcompact to Thailand from this
year for sales of that model in Japan.
 Local North American production has helped Nissan attract
customers in other segments compared with its Japanese rivals.
 Senior Vice President Junichi Endo told reporters on Monday
that Nissan's Versa subcompact, built in Mexico, was now the
best-selling model in the U.S. entry segment, overtaking Toyota
Motor Corp's Yaris, which is shipped from Japan.
 Shares of Nissan, held 43 percent by Renault SA, fell 0.1
percent to 821 yen, in line with the benchmark Nikkei average.

 * Bernanke: may buy more assets; QEII not automatic
 * Euro zone finance ministers to meet later on Monday
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The dollar on Monday recouped some
ground lost from a renewed focus on U.S. quantitative easing, and
was helped by short covering, while the euro fell back towards
channel support ahead of a meeting of European finance ministers.
 The greenback pulled up off a three-week low against the yen
and two-weeks lows against the euro set on Friday after
disappointing U.S. jobs data and a report that Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke did not rule out bond purchases beyond
those planned.
 The comments, which were then aired on Monday, served as a
reminder that the Fed's second round of quantitative easing, in
which it plans to buy $600 billion in assets, remains a weight on
the greenback, although the resulting easy liquidity is
supportive of risk trades.
 As the dollar shed 1.5 percent against the yen on Friday and
more than 1 percent against a basket of currencies, it had scope
for a bounce in thin volume on Monday, analysts said. It rose
0.5 percent to 82.93 yen, climbing off Friday's three-week low of
82.52 yen, and it gained 0.4 percent on the index.
 Still, just as euro zone debt concerns return periodically to
dog the euro, U.S. asset-buying will haunt the dollar.
 ""The market is going to continue to view U.S. quantitative
easing as being a driving force,"" said Greg Gibbs, FX strategist
at RBS in Sydney.
 Bernanke said it could be four to five years before the U.S.
returned to a more normal jobless rate but that a double-dip
recession was not likely.
 With QEII on track, commodity-linked and higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars kept
some of the gains they made on Friday against both the dollar and
yen. Gold and silver were buoyant, with silver at its strongest
levels since early 1980.
 The Australian dollar, which surged 1.7 percent to $0.9938 on
Friday, gave back 0.6 percent to $0.9865 but was flat on the yen
at 81.75 yen.
 The euro, battered in November by worries about peripheral
euro zone economies' debt levels, had also found support last
week from European Central Bank purchases of peripheral
economies' bonds.
 But after climbing 1.5 percent on Friday and reaching as far
as $1.3438, it beat a retreat on Monday, slipping nearly 0.6
percent to $1.3335 to test support in that area from a rising
channel on its hourly charts.
 Dealers said automatic sell stops also lay at about
$1.3330/35.
 Euro zone finance ministers meet later on Monday and will
face pressure to increase the size of a 750 billion euro ($1,006
billion) safety net for crisis-hit members in order to halt
contagion in the single currency bloc.
 That will be followed by a meeting on Tuesday of ministers
from the broader 27-nation European Union, who are expected to
formally approve an 85 billion euro aid package for Ireland and
discuss the reform of EU budget rules.
 ""Given how frail sentiment remains, the market is holding out
hope for some broader plan to be put in place and a widening of
that stability fund in case another one of the peripherals falls
over,"" said Sue Trinh, currency strategist at RBC in Hong Kong.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, was hovering just above a two-week low of
79.063 set on Friday.

 WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - China's currency peg hurts
U.S. exports but is also bad for the Chinese economy, since it
prevents the country's authorities from running their own
monetary policy, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said.
 ""They need to continue doing what they had been doing,
which is to allow their currency to appreciate to something
more appropriate in terms of its market value,"" Bernanke said.
 The comments, part of an interview with CBS program ""60
Minutes"" aired on Sunday, were an especially strong indictment
of the Asian giant's exchange rate stance, and comes after
China has criticized the Fed's own policies.
 ""If they fix their currency to the dollar, then they have
to have the same monetary policy, essentially, that the United
States has,"" Bernanke told ""60 Minutes"" in excerpts of a video
interview made available on the network's website.
 ""China is growing very quickly. They're risking inflation
by importing U.S. monetary policy. And that's a problem for
them.""
 The Fed's decision to buy bonds to keep rates low and
support a fragile recovery has raised eyebrows overseas. Many
officials in emerging markets accused the U.S. central bank of
actively trying to push down the dollar, saying the move risked
stoking bubbles in unexpected places.
 Ma Delun, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China,
said he was concerned the Fed's spending spree may undermine
efforts to balance out global growth. [ID:nN08254228]
 The Fed's program ""may add risks to the global economic
imbalance, put pressure on emerging markets to adjust their
international balance of payments and could also stir the
formation of asset bubbles,"" Ma said in Beijing last month.
 But in the CBS interview, Bernanke shot back: ""Keeping the
Chinese currency too low is bad for the American economy,
because it hurts our trade. It's bad for other emerging market
economies.""
 Bernanke and other top Fed officials have strongly
dismissed the notion that they are trying to manipulate the
dollar to boost U.S. exports.
 ""Currency undervaluation by surplus countries is inhibiting
needed international adjustment and creating spillover effects
that would not exist if exchange rates better reflected market
fundamentals"" he told a conference at the European Central Bank
in Frankfurt in November.
 It was a thinly veiled critique of China, though he did not
cite the country specifically by name.
 Since China loosened its peg to the U.S. dollar in June,
the yuan has appreciated about 3 percent. But at its current
level of 6.65 per dollar, the currency remains far weaker than
what many economists say it should be under a floating exchange
rate system.
 Critics say Beijing undervalues its currency by 15 percent
to 40 percent to give its companies an unfair price advantage
in international trade.

 * Asian stock rally pauses, market awaits fresh impetus
 * Oil, commodities cling on to gains

 By Ian Chua	
 Dec 6 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on
Monday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it was open to
injecting more funds into the economy, while investors took a
breather after having pushed Asian stocks to three-week highs.	
 Speaking on the 60 minutes television programme, Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank could end up
buying more than the $600 billion in U.S. government bonds it
has committed to purchase if the economy failed to respond or
unemployment stayed too high.	
 Bernanke's comments came after U.S. jobs data on Friday
showed a paltry 39,000 increase in non-farm payrolls and an
unexpected rise in the jobless rate to a seven-month high of
9.8 percent from 9.6 percent.	
 ""The prospect of persistent quantitative policy measures
by the major economies is a powerful force in the market. It
is tending to overpower other key developments in the market,
such as a tighter policy settings in China,"" said Greg Gibbs,
strategist at RBS.	
 ""It appears that the main underlying trends in the market
have been reinforced and funds will continue to flow strongly
towards Asia and commodities will remain well bid."" 
 
 MSCI's gauge of Asian stocks excluding Japan
edged up 0.3 percent, having climbed nearly 4
percent last week. Japan's Nikkei average slipped 0.1
percent, with exporters, such as Canon Inc , under
pressure as the dollar wallowed near two-week lows against the
yen.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index was a touch firmer
and South Korea's KOSPI inched down 0.1 percent.	
 But investors snapped up shares in Africa-focused miner
Riversdale Mining , after global miner Rio Tinto
made a $3.5 billion bid approach. Riversdale shares
surged 12 percent.	
 The dollar eased 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies , having fallen 1.4 percent last week.
Against the yen, it stood at 82.82 yen , not far off a
two-week low of 82.51 yen set last Friday.	
 The selloff in the dollar helped drive the euro above
$1.34 for the first time since Nov. 24, well off the
low of $1.2964 plumbed last week. 
 But the single currency has since slipped back to $1.3381
on persistent worries that Ireland's debt crisis would spread
to other high deficit euro zone members such as Portugal and
Spain.	
 The IMF will urge euro zone governments on Monday to boost
the size of their rescue fund and recommend the European
Central Bank buy more bonds to prevent the bloc's debt crisis
from derailing economic recovery.	
 Higher metal prices helped underpin commodity currencies
such as the Australian dollar. The Aussie last traded
just above $0.99, highs not seen since Nov. 22.	
 Copper, which notched its biggest weekly gain in four
months on Friday, edged up 0.4 percent to $8,760 a tonne,
while U.S. crude  rose 0.2 percent to $89.35 a barrel,
having reached a fresh 25-month high at $89.60.

 * Not worried about double-dip recession in euro zone
 * Euro still on strong side in terms of effective FX rates
(Adds details)
 TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Market jitters over Ireland are
likely to ease due to an EU/IMF rescue package, European Central
Bank policymaker Christian Noyer was quoted as saying in an
interview with Japan's Nikkei business daily.
 Noyer also told the newspaper he was not worried about the
debt crisis spilling over to other euro zone economies, adding
that Ireland was a unique case stemming from a crisis in the
banking sector and that the situation in Southern Europe was
improving.
 To prevent borrowing costs of countries like Portugal or
Spain from rising too high, the ECB has been buying their bonds
in the secondary market, but the purchases have been moderate
compared, for example, to similar moves in the United States.
 Noyer said the ECB would continue current monetary policy
measures as long as they are needed and at least until the end of
the January-March period next year, according to the Nikkei.
 The interview was published in Monday's morning edition but
the daily did not mention when it was conducted.
 Noyer told the newspaper the ECB's debt purchases were aimed
at keeping the banking sector from malfunctioning but it would
not play a primary role in realigning banks and stabilising
financial systems.
 He was also quoted as saying that a recovery in the euro zone
economies would weaken slightly in the latter half of this year
but he was not at all worried about the possibility of a
double-dip recession in the region.
 The outlook was bright for euro zone economies due to signs
of a pick-up in domestic demand across the region, Noyer told the
newspaper.
 He also said the euro remained on the strong side when
looking at effective exchange rates, and that effective exchange
rates in the yen and the euro have been moving at appropriate
levels in line with their past trends, the paper added.
 The euro was holding just below a two-week high of $1.3438,
having risen 1.5 percent on Friday helped in part by ECB's
purchases of Irish and Portuguese debt last week.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The dollar sat at its lowest levels
for a couple of weeks on Monday, nursing large losses from weaker
than expected employment data and renewed focus on U.S.
quantitative easing.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was reported in an
interview with CBS television as not ruling out further bond
purchases beyond the $600 billion already announced, helping take
the dollar to its lowest in three weeks against the yen on
Friday, and two weeks against the euro.
 ""The market is going to continue to view U.S. quantitative
easing as being a driving force,"" said Greg Gibbs, FX strategist
at RBS in Sydney.
 Bernanke appears on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" show at 0000 GMT and
Gibbs said the suggestion he would say he was prepared to do more
was keeping the dollar on the back foot.
 The dollar was trading at 82.71 yen, up 0.2 percent from late
U.S. trade and just above Friday's three-week low of 82.52 yen.
It lost 1.5 percent against the yen on Friday.
 The euro was holding just below a two-week high of $1.3438,
having risen 1.5 percent on Friday.
 Data on Friday showed the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than
expected in November, driving the jobless rate up to 9.8
percent..
 At the same time, European Central Bank purchases of Irish
and Portuguese debt last week also helped support the euro.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, was hovering just above a two-week low of
79.063 set on Friday.
 Expectation that U.S. quantitative easing will be around for
a while yet encouraged investors to buy into higher yielding
currencies, lifting both the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 The Aussie, which surged 1.7 percent to $0.9938 on Friday,
was holding steady at $0.9912 in early trade.

 * Says enlarging EU stability fund not current question
(adds details, background, quotes)
 PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Spain's economic fundamentals are
sound and the country will not appeal for financial support
from the international aid mechanism, Spanish Economy Minister
Elena Salgado said in an interview published on Sunday.
 Spain announced a range of deficit cutting measures on
Friday as it fought to reduce a high budget shortfall, calm
investor nerves over its credit-worthiness and shake off
concerns that it could need a financial bailout.
[ID:nLDE6B20HM]
 Bond markets have been punishing Spanish sovereign debt
over concerns Spain will not be able to cut its deficit,
although its relative cost of borrowing has pulled back from
record highs on reports of the European Central buying its
bonds.
 ""No. None of our fundamentals justify it,"" Salgado told
French business daily Les Echos when asked if Spain would
appeal for a financial bailout from the European Union and
other lenders.
 The minister has called for systemic reform to deal with
the debt crisis, whose spread to Spain would likely exhaust the
rescue funds set aside by the euro zone to deal with it.
 But she said that increasing the size of the European
Stability Fund designed to extend aid to member states in
financial difficulty was ""not the question for the moment.
Today, we need to show clarity, determination and
coordination.""
 ""Markets need to know that European institutions and
countries will do everything to ensure the stability of the
euro,"" she added.
 Spain's public deficit stood at 11.1 percent of gross
domestic product in 2009 and analysts have long warned extra
measures would be needed beyond an austere 2011 budget and
promised labour market reforms to bring it down.
 Salgado said that Spain's property crisis, a source of
worry for investors concerned about the health of Spanish
lenders, was over and that the country would meet its official
full-year 2011 growth target of 1.3 percent.
 ""We think we will be able to maintain our forecast. We
think there is room (for growth) in private consumption,"" she
said.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>",GLOBAL ECONOMY WEEKAHEAD-Calibrating China's cool-down," By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - China needs to slow down its
economy enough to cool inflation at home without putting a drag
on growth in the rest of the world.
 This will require careful calibration. It's no secret that
advanced economies are growing slowly. The International
Monetary Fund thinks 2011 output will reach just 2.2 percent in
rich countries while China romps ahead at 9.6 percent.
 Figures this week are expected to show China's import
growth outpaced that of exports in November, although the total
volume of goods flowing out still easily dwarfs those coming
in.
 The trade balance probably widened yet again last month,
according to economists polled by Reuters, providing more
ammunition for critics who say China holds down its yuan
currency to gain a trade advantage. [ID:nTOE6B202H]
(China trade, inflation graphic: http://r.reuters.com/syw48q)
 For the global economy, the question is what happens to
China's domestic demand once policymakers begin twisting harder
on the credit screws to try to tame inflation.
 Chinese inflation data won't come for another week, but
economists think the consumer price index edged closer to a 5.0
percent year-over-year growth rate in November, up from an
already uncomfortable high 4.4 percent in October.
 The Communist Party's top leaders announced on Friday they
would switch to a ""prudent"" monetary policy while maintaining
""proactive"" fiscal policy, a signal that they are well aware of
the need to ensure a gentle slowdown.
 Donald Straszheim, head of China research at ISI Group in
Los Angeles, said Beijing was clearly on a path to raise
interest rates, but how fast and how far remains to be seen.
 The term prudent ""means whatever the appropriate officials
want it to mean,"" Straszheim said, adding that China may aim to
contract the money supply and restrict new lending in order to
cool the economy.
 China has already taken steps to curb lending, raising
banks' required reserve ratio twice in the past month.
 Xianfang Ren, an economist with IHS Global Insight in
Beijing, said the government's tightening message was ""clear
and strong"" as inflation spreads beyond financial markets and
food and into a broader range of goods.
 ""Nonetheless, the government exit from the stimulus cycle
is expected to be quite calculated and smooth as the
policymakers try to avoid a hard landing,"" he said.
 DIVERGING, NOT DECOUPLING
 The rest of the world would like to see China avoid a hard
landing, too.
 For the European Union, China is the biggest trading
partner and the region can ill afford another threat to growth
while sovereign debt tensions refuse to subside.
 According to the European Commission, EU goods imports from
China were nearly 215 billion euros last year, and exports to
China exceed 80 billion euros.
 ""The term 'decoupled' may be trite, but resilient activity
in parts of the globe provides a healthy backdrop against which
Europe can grapple with its structural woes,"" said Simon Hayes,
an economist with Barclays Capital in London.
 Trade numbers from Germany on Wednesday are expected to
show imports grew faster than exports, narrowing the trade
surplus slightly. Germany's figures cover October (unlike
China's, which are for November) so they precede the latest
eruption of debt worries, which drove down the euro.
 U.S. trade data, due on Friday, will probably look similar
to the month before when the gap was $44 billion. Like
Germany's, these figures are for October and may be too
backward-looking to get much attention from investors focused
on the here-and-now fears about European debt.

 * Recommends European Central Bank should buy more bonds
 * Urges more stringent stress-testing of banks

 (Adds more details, quotes)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The euro zone should have a
bigger rescue fund for member states in trouble, and the
European Central Bank should boost its bond buying to prevent
the sovereign debt crisis from derailing economic recovery, an
IMF report obtained by Reuters said.
 International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn
will present the report on the economy of the 16 countries using
the euro at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers and
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on Monday.
 ""The recovery could still stay the course, but this scenario
could now easily be derailed by the renewed financial market
turmoil,"" the IMF report said. ""The sovereign and financial
market storm affecting the periphery (of the euro zone)
constitutes a severe downside risk.""
 The IMF will tell the ministers that while last week's 85
billion euro ($114.1 billion) joint EU/IMF rescue package for
Ireland and a permanent mechanism for crisis resolution
including the private sector are welcome, they are not enough.
 National structural reforms plans, fiscal consolidation and
bank sector repair were still the first line of defence against
market turmoil, but more should be done, the IMF said.

 SAFETY NET
 The document said euro zone rescue funds ""should be deployed
for countries undertaking strong adjustment but remaining under
market pressure, using sufficient liquidity support to
cope with uncertain market responses so as to minimize costs
from market risks and contagion.""
 It was not clear from the document if this meant the IMF was
advocating euro zone help to Portugal, whose borrowing costs
have risen sharply on market concern over its high debt and low
growth, but which has passed an austerity budget for 2011.
 ""There is also a strong case for increasing the resources
available for this safety net and making their use more
flexible, including for the purpose of providing more effective
support to banking systems,"" the report said.
 The euro zone, together with the IMF, now has a fund
totalling 750 billion euros to help governments cut off from
being able to borrow on financial markets, in exchange for
fiscal austerity and reforms.
 But economists and some policymakers believe that should
more euro zone countries, like Portugal, Spain or even Italy, be
forced to seek EU financial help, the fund would be too small.
 To prevent borrowing costs of countries like Portugal or
Spain from rising too high, the ECB has been buying their bonds
on the secondary market, but the purchases have been moderate
compared, for example, to similar moves in the United States. 
 ""The ECB's extraordinary liquidity provision and its
securities market program, as well as the EU's extended state
aid framework for bank support, would need to remain in place
and indeed be expanded until systemic uncertainty receded,"" the
IMF said. Eventually they should be removed gradually to avoid
the return of unexpected market pressures, it said.
 
 STRINGENT TESTS
 To raise market confidence in the euro zone banking sector,
the IMF called for more probing and stringent national and
EU-wide stress tests of banks, which would include liquidity
tests with more transparency about exposures to various assets.
 ""It is now urgent to address remaining banking weaknesses
and follow up with individual action to restructure,
recapitalise, or resolve weak institutions,"" the report said. 
 The IMF report will be discussed at length at the euro zone
finance ministers' meeting on Monday, a euro zone source said,
along with the current situation on debt markets.
 European Union finance ministers, who will join their euro
zone colleagues on Tuesday, will formally approve the aid
package for Ireland and discuss progress in detailing the reform
of EU budget rules, the outline of which was agreed in October.
 EU sources said they expected a tough debate on whether the
revised EU budget rules should allow countries to deduct pension
reform costs from the deficit. 
 Nine EU countries want the costs to be excluded from deficit
accounting, but Germany is against it.
 The budget rule reform has been watered down by France and
Germany to insert more political discretion into disciplinary
action against euro zone countries that do not abide by the
Stability and Growth Pact -- the EU fiscal rulebook.
 The executive European Commission and the ECB have signalled
to the European Parliament, which will have a say in the final
agreement, that deputies should make the rules stricter again.
 The IMF also called for that, saying that a crisis
resolution mechanism envisaged for after mid-2013 was a good
idea, but crisis prevention was better than crisis resolution.
 The IMF would like to see sanctions imposed on euro zone
countries which do not plan budgets for the following year in
line with EU guidelines and which allow macroeconomic imbalances
to grow, despite warnings from fellow euro zone countries.
 It also opposes the increased political discretion
introduced by France and Germany in deciding on sanctions for
rule-breakers, saying in the document that it believes the
process should be depoliticised.

 * Says ends ""Soviet-era"" culture of secrecy
 
 By Emma Graham-Harrison
 KABUL, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's mining minister says
he has shaken up a ""Soviet-era"" mentality of compulsive secrecy,
shed some of his staff and drawn up the ministry's first
business plan in a bid to create a more accountable industry.
 Washington and its allies believe that Afghanistan
developing its vast untapped mineral wealth is its surest path
to economic self-reliance, but projects have been held up in the
past by corruption and red tape. Cleaning out the mining
ministry has been a priority for international donors.
 Wahidullah Shahrani, who took over the ministry around a
year ago, said the country has joined the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a candidate country and hopes
to get full compliant status in little over a year.
 ""You cannot imagine the progress that we have made in the
last nine months, transforming the ministry from an old
Soviet-style entity where there was a mentality to hide all the
information, not to share any information even with the Ministry
of Finance or the parliament,"" he told Reuters.
 He said when he arrived at the ministry, which has around
8,000 employees, he found no business plan or strategic goals.
 ""After five years we are expecting that the contribution of
the ministry to the revenue of the government would be at least
$1.2 billion,"" he said on the sidelines of a conference to
report Afghanistan's progress with EITI.
 ""After 15 years its contribution to the revenue will
increase up to $3.5 billion in a year,"" he added. At present
most of Afghanistan's budget comes from foreign donors.
 The government said on Sunday its biggest planned mining
project so far, the Aynak copper mine run by Metallurgical Corp
of China Ltd (MCC) <1618.HK>, would be delayed to safeguard
ancient Buddhist relics found there. [ID:nSGE6B401B]
 In many developing nations the discovery of valuable oil or
minerals has brought civil strife and corruption. Shahrani says
he is aware of the dangers of the ""resource curse"" and confident
he can steer his country along a path like Botswana's -- where
diamond mines brought improvements in national living standards.
 Finance minister Omar Zakhilwal praised Shahrani's work.
 ""In the past one year, the amount of reform that has taken
place in the ministry of mines would not have happened in other
countries in five years,"" he told the news conference.
 He highlighted a decision last year to take the massive
Hajigak iron ore deposit off the market, saying that was driven
by fears the bidding process could invite corruption.
 The deposit is now up for tender again. At the time the
tender was scrapped, Shahrani said the main reasons were
economic and included the global recession.
 
 STRICT CONTROLS
 EITI, based in Oslo, Norway, describes itself as a coalition
of civil society groups, companies, governments, international
organisations and investors focused on good governance in
resource-rich countries.
 So far there are only five compliant countries including
Ghana and Mongolia, while the list of candidate nations includes
many known for corruption in their natural resources industry.
 The organisation chief acknowledged that EITI's rules would
not be able to ward off all corruption but defended them as an
important first step.
 ""There will always be ways in which corruption can take
place, but the key thing is to make sure that you minimise those
possibilities,"" said EITI secretariat head Jonas Moberg. ""EITI
reports are based on audited data so that is properly verified.""

 * Nov. 2009 US cables suggest Franco-Brazilian deal near
 
 PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Brazil has sought to buy French
Rafale jets and acquire the technology to build them at home for
export to other Latin American countries by 2030, the daily Le
Monde reported on Sunday, citing leaked U.S. diplomatic cables.
 Brazil has been negotiating with several nations including
France, the United States and Sweden, over a deal to acquire
fighter planes as it seeks to renew its ageing fleet and boost
surveillance of the nation's strategic assets.
 The proposed deal, which could concern over 100 aircraft
potentially worth more than $4 billion, has sparked fierce
competition among aircraft manufacturers. The cables quoted by
Le Monde suggest Paris was in advanced talks with Brasilia over
a possible sale.
 ""Not only do they (Brazil) want to buy the Rafale, but also
produce the aircraft on their soil and even sell across Latin
America by 2030,"" Le Monde quoted a U.S. diplomat as saying in
Nov. 2009 in one of the cables.
 Le Monde is one of five newspapers to have been given
advance access to a store of some 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables
leaked by website WikiLeaks. The cables reveal frank exchanges
between U.S. diplomats and Washington about foreign leaders.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy sought to reassure his Brazilian
counterpart about the price of the aircraft -- $80 million each
-- by telling him that France would transfer the codes at the
heart of Rafale technology to Brazil, Le Monde said.
 French officials have said repeatedly that a deal with
Brazil was near but none has been signed. Dassault Aviation was
not immediately available to comment on Le Monde's report.
 In January, a Brazilian cabinet member said that
then-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wanted Brazil to choose
the Rafale, but at a lower price than France was offering.
 Brazil's air force said in July that it planned to buy 28
military planes from jet maker Embraer.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2010 08:56AM ET</span>","Czech crown to stay long, no euro opt-out needed-PM"," PRAGUE, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic does not need
to negotiate a formal opt-out from joining the euro currency,
which would not be to the country's advantage for a long time,
Prime Minister Petr Necas said on Sunday.
 The Czechs have been cautious about adopting the euro and
Necas's centre-right cabinet has pushed the issue far into the
future, saying it would not set any date during its term in
office, which will end in 2014.
 Necas said during a televised debate the euro zone had
changed since the Czech Republic made a commitment to eventually
adopt the euro, due to the economic crisis and the EU's response
to it
 ""At this point, it is clearly showing that the costs of
keeping the crown are lower than those of adopting the euro,""
Necas during a televised debate. ""It will remain like that for a
very long time.""
 The Czech economy is highly dependent on exports, and
companies that have seen their margins shrink due to the
long-term firming of the crown have been calling for adoption of
the single currency.
 But Necas said keeping the crown would help in the process
of alignment of the Czech economy with the euro zone and would
keep inflation low.
 Necas said eurosceptic Czech President Vaclav Klaus had
asked the government to consider negotiating an opt-out from the
country's commitment to join the euro, which was mentioned in a
central bank document for the cabinet.
 But he said there was no need for that.
 ""No one can force us into joining the euro... We have a de
facto opt-out,"" he said.
 He said the country would decide when to join the ERM-2
exchange rate mechanism, a precursor to euro membership that
applicants must remain in for at least two years, and this gave
the government enough discretion on timing.
 He also said euro adoption was a ""theoretical problem"" given
the fact that the country had to first narrow its budget gap and
undergo reforms of its pension and healthcare systems before it
could apply.

 * Economists see Portugal as likely bailout candidate
(Updates with Socrates comments, budget details)
 By Luis Andres Henao
 MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Portugal's
approval of its 2011 budget shows commitment and helps bolster
confidence in the country, Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Socrates said on Saturday.
 Portugal approved the austerity budget on Nov. 26, vowing
to spur growth and apply tough spending cuts as it seeks to
avoid an Irish-style bailout.
 ""Portugal's main contribution to reinforcing confidence ...
was presenting its budget,"" Socrates told a news conference
toward the end of Ibero-American summit in the Argentine
coastal city of Mar del Plata.
 Economists say debt-laden Portugal likely will be the next
weak euro zone country to need financial help as it struggles
with low competitiveness and a high budget deficit, high
borrowing costs and slow growth.
 Socrates has repeatedly denied his country needs a bailout,
vowing it will do everything possible to meet goals to cut the
budget deficit -- although many economists fear this will push
Portugal back into recession.
 Socrates on Friday reiterated Portugal was committed to
ending 2010 with a budget deficit of no more than 7.3 percent
of gross domestic product.
 The Portuguese budget aims to cut the deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product in 2011.
 Socrates also said on Friday the determination of European
Union states and institutions to defend the euro had halted
speculation in the debt market.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2010 01:12PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key provisions of revised KORUS trade deal," Dec 4 (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea reached
a deal this week on auto concerns that have blocked approval of
a free-trade agreement for three years.
 Here are key changes the countries agreed to make to the
2007 trade deal in the new ""supplemental agreement"":
 AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY STANDARDS
 To address U.S. concerns that South Korean safety standards
have effectively operated as a nontariff barrier to U.S. auto
exports, the revised deal allows for 25,000 cars per U.S.
automaker -- or almost four times the number allowed in the
2007 agreement -- to be imported into Korea provided they meet
U.S. federal safety standards.
 AUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
 South Korea agreed that all U.S. autos will be considered
compliant with new Korean environmental standards on fuel
economy and greenhouse gas emissions, developed since the 2007
agreement, if they achieve 119 percent of the targets in these
regulations. The White House said this provision would help
American automakers sell their cars affordably in Korea without
undermining Korea's environmental objectives.
 TAXES
 In the 2007 agreement, Korea committed to reduce tax rates
for American cars and to streamline current taxes based on
engine size, which have tended to raise the cost of the
typically larger size of American vehicles sold in Korea.
 Korea agreed in the revised deal to additional transparency
in this area, including a 12-month period between the time a
final regulation is issued and the time auto companies must
comply with it. Seoul also said it would develop a new review
system within 24 months of the pact's entry into force to make
sure that existing auto regulations accomplish their objectives
in the least-burdensome manner possible.
 CAR TARIFF ELIMINATION
 The 2007 agreement would have immediately eliminated U.S.
tariffs on an estimated 90 percent of Korea's auto exports,
with remaining tariffs phased out by the third year of
implementation. The revised deal keeps the 2.5 percent U.S.
tariff in place until the fifth year. At the same time, Korea
will immediately cut its tariff on U.S. auto imports in half
(from 8 percent to 4 percent), and fully eliminate that tariff
in the fifth year.
 TRUCK TARIFF ELIMINATION
 The 2007 agreement would have required the United States to
start reducing its tariff on Korean trucks immediately and
phase it out by the agreement's tenth year. The revised deal
allows the United States to maintain its 25 percent truck
tariff until the eighth year and then phase it out by the tenth
year. It holds Korea to its original commitment to eliminate
its 10 percent tariff on U.S. trucks immediately.
 TARIFFS ON ELECTRIC CARS
 In the 2007 agreement, the United States and Korea would
have eliminated tariffs on electric cars and plug-in hybrids by
the tenth year of implementation. Under the revised deal, Korea
will immediately reduce its electric car tariffs from 8 percent
to 4 percent, and both countries will then phase out their
tariffs by the fifth year.
 SPECIAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFEGUARD
 The 2007 agreement contained no safeguard specific to the
U.S. auto industry. Korea agreed in the revised deal to add a
special safeguard for motor vehicles to ensure that the
American auto industry does not suffer from any harmful surges
in Korean auto imports due to this trade agreement. The special
auto safeguard, which allows the United States to reimpose
tariffs, is available for 10 years beyond the full elimination
of tariffs for each Korean auto product.
 ENFORCEMENT
 The 2007 agreement created a tough remedy for the United
States to re-impose as much as $200 million in U.S. tariffs
(i.e., ""snapping back"" to pre-agreement levels) on Korean
passenger cars if U.S. auto business in Korea is materially
affected by Korean violations of the agreement. The revised
deal substantially increases Korea's obligations in a number of
areas subject to this strong enforcement mechanism.
 BEEF
 South Korea did not make any additional concessions in this
politically sensitive sector because of lingering South Korean
concerns stemming from the discovery of mad cow disease in the
U.S. cattle herd in 2003.
 Under a voluntary industry-to-industry agreement struck in
2008, South Korea imports U.S. beef only from cattle younger
than 30 months, considered the safest.
 U.S. officials said they would continue work with South
Korea to allow imports of all cuts of U.S. boneless and bone-in
beef and other beef products from all ages of cattle, as long
as specified materials known to transmit mad cow disease were
removed, and other conditions were met.
 Even so, the 2007 deal requires South Korea to phase out a
40 percent tariff on U.S. beef over 15 years.
 Many U.S. beef exporters are eager to get that increased
access and are prepared to wait for a solution on remaining mad
cow trade concerns.
 PORK
 The United States agreed in the revised deal to let South
Korea delay by two years -- until January 2016 -- the
elimination of tariffs on some pork products. U.S. pork
producers said they agreed to the change because they still
expect a substantial increase in sales under the agreement.

 * Obama calls it model for deals to come
 * Some dissent in Congress, beef concerns persist
 (New throughout with Obama statement)
 By Patricia Zengerle and Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama vowed
on Saturday to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass a
free-trade pact with South Korea that he said was a model for
future agreements he would seek in Asia and around the world.
 U.S. and South Korean negotiators struck a deal on Friday
on the long-delayed pact, which was signed in 2007 but had not
been ratified for three years because of U.S. auto and beef
industry concerns.
 The pact was an accomplishment for Obama, who faced an
embarrassing setback when negotiators failed to settle their
differences before he visited Seoul last month.
 ""The agreement we're announcing today includes several
important improvements and achieves what I believe trade deals
must do. It's a win-win for both our countries,"" he told
reporters in Washington.
 A day after the Labor Department reported U.S. unemployment
unexpectedly hit a seven-month high of 9.8 percent in November,
Obama said the pact would boost annual exports of automobiles,
agricultural products and other goods and services by $11
billion and generate 70,000 additional jobs.
 Obama said the agreement with South Korea showed the United
States was ready to finalize more trade pacts -- business
leaders wish two other long-delayed deals, with Panama and
Colombia, would also get through Congress.
 ""I'm especially pleased that this agreement includes
groundbreaking protections for workers' rights and for the
environment. In this sense, it's an example of the kind of fair
trade agreement that I'll continue to work for as president, in
Asia and around the world,"" Obama said.
 ""This agreement also shows that the United States of
America is determined to lead and compete in our global
economy,"" he added.
 He also said the agreement shows the strength of
Washington's alliance with Seoul. Tensions in the region
ratcheted up last month after North Korea attacked the small
southern island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people.
 BUSINESS SUPPORT, SOME DOUBTS
 Business leaders and analysts said free trade could be one
area of cooperation between Obama's Democratic administration
and Republicans in Congress, who won a majority in the House of
Representatives in the Nov. 2 elections, amid voter discontent
over the sputtering economy and worries over the U.S. deficit.
 Obama said he looked forward to working with Congress and
leaders of both parties to approve the pact.
 Both the U.S. House and Senate must approve the agreement,
and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he was
prepared to work with Obama to win approval. A range of
companies and industry groups have spoken out in support,
including the United Auto Workers union and Ford Motor Co.,
which welcomed the changes made to address their concerns about
market access provisions of the original deal.
 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat,
also praised the deal.
 But despite progress on the auto issues, Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said he was
""deeply disappointed"" the deal did not address South Korea's
remaining restriction on beef imports imposed in response to
discovery of several cases of mad cow disease in the U.S.
cattle herds a number of years ago.
 Baucus, whose committee has jurisdiction over trade, said
he would reserve judgment while continuing to work with the
Obama administration.
 Obama said the United States would continue to press for
""full access for U.S. beef to the Korean market.""
 Obama has made increasing U.S. exports a focus of his
strategy for generating jobs.
 ""(The Korea pact) will contribute significantly to
achieving my goal of doubling U.S. exports over the next five
years. In fact, it's estimated that today's deal alone will
increase American economic output by more than our last nine
free trade agreements combined,"" Obama said.

 MADRID, Dec 4 (Reuters Life!) - Spaniards hoping to make the
most of the ""puente"" this long pre-Christmas holiday weekend
were frustrated by a wildcat strike by air traffic controllers
which brought airports to a standstill. [nLDE6B301W]
 Despite news of tax rises, austerity budgets, soaring
unemployment and a euro zone crisis, most Spaniards had planned
a ""puente"" (bridge) day between Monday's Constitution Day and
Wednesday's Feast of the Immaculate Conception to create a
five-day weekend of shopping, eating and visiting.
 But many had their plans thrown into disarray by the
unofficial industrial action. Spanish airspace was not due to
reopen until Sunday morning after the government declared a
state of emergency and sent in the army to staff control towers.
 Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said: ""I
reiterate the government's apologies to everyone who has had
their plans drastically altered at a particularly important
moment, a ""puente"" that many people ... had looked forward to
enjoying.""
 Madrid hotels had been fully booked by people travelling to
see the Christmas lights, take in the shows and shop, despite
the government revealing a new tax rise and a speeding up of
pension reforms to combat a euro zone sovereign debt crisis.
 Spain's own economic problems stem from a decade-long
debt-driven construction and property boom that left Spaniards
in debt when the bubble burst two years ago.
 The good news for the economy is that demand hasn't waned
for Christmas knick-knacks from the Plaza Mayor square or
discouraged queues along the busy Gran Via for lottery tickets
from Dona Manolita, famous for having sold many winning numbers
for the ""El Gordo"" Christmas draw.
 The country is struggling to emerge from an 18-month
recession, but the recovery has stagnated and unemployment
hovers near 20 percent, the highest in the euro zone.
 Spain already suffered salary cuts and VAT hikes as the
government tries to rein in its public deficit, and a string of
new measures, including a higher tobacco tax, were announced on
Friday to stave off a bailout like in Greece and Ireland.

 By Kim Yeonhee and Doug Palmer
 SEOUL/WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The United States and
South Korea welcomed a free trade deal reached after a three-year
delay which U.S. President Barack Obama said would boost exports
to South Korea by $11 billion and support at least 70,000
American jobs.
 An official announcement of the deal is expected in the next
few days after both trade negotiators report back to their
presidents, a spokeswoman for South Korea's presidential Blue
House said.
 The two allies signed a trade agreement on June 30, 2007, but
ratification has been delayed due to sticking points involving
U.S. autos and the opening of South Korean beef market.
 ""This agreement is meaningful in that it reflects both
countries' interests in a balanced way and lays the foundation
for a reciprocal win-win,"" South Korean President Lee Myung-bak
said in a statement.
 ""It will also be an opportunity for the South Korea-USA
alliance to make a leap by one notch. Our economy will face an
opportunity to make a jump again in terms of quality.""
 Lee urged parliament and the U.S. Congress to approve the
deal as soon as possible.
 Obama said U.S. car and truck manufacturers would gain more
access to the Korean market ""and a level playing field to take
advantage of that access"".
 ""We are strengthening our ability to create and defend
manufacturing jobs in the United States, increasing exports of
agricultural products for American farmers and ranchers and
opening Korea's services market to American companies.""
 The American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul expressed support
for the final agreement, saying it was critical to the durable
recovery of the U.S. job market.
 ""The agreement announced today provides renewed proof that
the United States is willing and able to move forward with a free
and fair trade agenda -- one that will support the president's
focus on export promotion and job creation,"" AMCHAM said in a
statement.
 It said the agreement was expected to go into effect in July
2011.
 As part of the revisions agreed over several days of talks
this week in Columbia, Maryland, South Korea will let the United
States keep a 2.5 percent tariff on Korean-built cars for five
more years, rather than cut it immediately. [nN03287146]
 The new supplement agreement allows 25,000 cars per U.S.
automaker to qualify for entry into the South Korean market based
on U.S. safety standards. That is about four times the amount
agreed to under the deal struck in 2007.
 It also allows the United States to keep a 25 percent tariff
on trucks until the eighth year, instead of beginning to reduce
it in the first year. The United States will still have to
eliminate the duty in year 10 of the pact.
 South Korea is no longer required to eliminate immediately
its 8 percent tariff on U.S. auto imports, but will reduce it to
4 percent for four years before eliminating it.
 Seoul will still immediately eliminate a 10 percent tariff on
U.S. trucks under the revised pact.
 South Korea was given an additional two years -- until 2016
-- to eliminate duties on some U.S. pork products.
 Even with the changes announced on Friday, the agreement will
likely divide Obama's fellow Democrats, meaning he will have to
work closely with Republicans to win passage of the Korea-U.S.
Free Trade Agreement.
 Both the Senate and House of Representatives must approve the
deal for it to become law.

 * US dollar/yen falls to 2-1/2 week low
 (Adds background)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a third
straight day on Friday after falling more than 7 percent last
month, though analysts say it's unclear whether it will extend
its gains next week.
 The euro's gains on Friday accelerated after data showed
the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected in November,
driving the jobless rate up to 9.8 percent.
 It was also the second-largest one-day decline in the since
May 2009.
 The euro rose 1.5 percent to $1.3414 on Friday, capping off
its best three-day performance since May. It hit a 2-1/2-month
low beneath $1.30 on Tuesday.
 Traders said European Central Bank's purchases of Irish and
Portuguese debt this week helped support the euro.
 But with a light U.S. economic data calendar next week,
analysts said lingering euro zone debt worries could weigh on
the euro again next week. European authorities may have bailed
out Ireland, but investors are still worried about the next
euro-area country to require assistance.
 ""The strong rally in the euro we have seen in recent days
will likely fizzle out next week,"" said Greg Anderson, G10
strategist at Citigroup in New York. ""There are few drivers
left in the market.""
 Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar fell to a 2-1/2-week low at
82.53 yen. It was last at 82.57, down 1.6 percent.
 THE EURO'S NEXT MOVE
 If investors start to worry anew about the strength of the
U.S. economy, the euro could sustain its recent gains. The
unexpectedly weak U.S. employment report on Friday unnerved
some investors.
 Also weighing on the dollar were reports that Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in an interview to be aired
on CBS-TV on Sunday that markets should not dismiss the
possibility of the central bank buying more than $600 billion
in bonds to boost U.S. growth.
 The Fed announced its second round of bond buying last
month, though recent signs of U.S. economic strength had
sparked some speculation it could spend less than the allotted
$600 billion.
 In the options market, recent negative sentiment on the
euro turned about two days ago and is currently neutral, noted
David Tien, a director at Credit Suisse's Global Algorithmic
Strategy and Modeling group in New York.
 ""Looking ahead to late 2010 and early 2011 we see potential
for a temporary stabilization in the euro and even some
corrective strength, to as high as $1.37-$1.38,"" said Nick
Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo.
 ""The medium-term outlook for the euro remains challenging
however,"" he wrote. ""We expect the euro will resume its
downward trend next year, reaching $1.25 or lower by late
2011/early 2012.""
 Anderson said all of these factors may combine to leave the
euro near its current level for the rest of the year.
 ""The shorts were shaken out over the last two weeks and
over the last few days the longs got destroyed, so many people
will choose to just sit on their hands until the end of the
year,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a third
day on Friday as investors looked past a disappointing jobs
report and focused on growth elsewhere in the economy.
 Gold  jumped above $1,410 an ounce, however, forging
its biggest weekly gain since April on lingering fears of a
sprawling European debt crisis and after the U.S. jobs data
sent the dollar tumbling 1 percent.
 Stocks in Europe ended slightly lower, but analysts
predicted the overall trend is for equity markets to push
higher. The late-day U.S. stock gains in the face of a slack
labor market suggested investors believed there could be gains
into year-end, analysts said.
 ""Every other economic data point has been constructive,""
said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated
Investors, in New York.
 Wall Street's recent rally only slowed after the Labor
Department said U.S. businesses added 39,000 nonfarm payrolls
in November, falling short of the 140,000 expected by
economists. The unemployment rate rose to a seven-month high of
9.8 percent. For details see, [ID:nN02238002]
 Overall employment for September and October was revised
upward to show 38,000 more jobs created than first estimated.
 Investors also expect the weak employment report will keep
government support for financial markets in play.
 ""The Fed is not going to be able to abandon quantitative
easing in the face of this weak jobs number,"" said Orlando,
referring to the central bank's efforts to lower interest rates
with the purchases of U.S. debt. ""And if Congress thought they
could begin to raise taxes at this point in the fragility of
the economic cycle they are sadly mistaken,"" he added.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed 19.68
points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,382.09, near a four-week high.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 3.18 points, or
0.26 percent, to 1,224.71 and the Nasdaq Composite Index

 The European benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> share
index declined 0.2 percent to 1,103.97, following the earlier
decline in U.S. shares. In Asia trading, the Nikkei <.N225>
closed 0.1 percent higher.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> knocked out a
0.82 percent gain to reach its highest since Nov. 12.
 Many analysts viewed the disappointing employment report as
an outlier amid a slew of generally positive U.S. data released
over the last few weeks that suggest traction for the economy.
 Retailers this week reported much stronger-than-expected
year-over-year sales in November. All-time highs for online
sales on so-called Cyber Monday also illustrated strong holiday
spending, galvanizing investor optimism.
 ""If people who are employed are spending money, the
unemployment rate is not going to be as important,"" said
Charles Day, a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
in Purchase, New York.
 ""The mind-set people are in right now is to look for good
news, and the good news of what's happened over the last two
days of the economy turning is overshadowing bad news.
Investors are looking for reasons to be in the market.""
 For the dollar, however, the U.S. jobs report injected
enough caution to create a fresh downdraft on the currency.
 The euro-zone debt crisis is expected keep the euro under
pressure for some time. European authorities may have bailed
out Ireland, but investors are speculating euro-zone nations
such as Spain and Portugal will require assistance.
 The dollar fell against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 1.4 percent

 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  slumped 1.49
percent to 82.62 yen.
 U.S. Treasury prices were mixed as traders first bought
bonds in reversal of short positions after the jobs data.
 Other reports on Friday showed the U.S. services sector
grew for an 11th straight month in November and new factory
orders fell. [ID:nN0397260] [ID:nN0391037].
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell slightly, and yields
extended their climb to three days for the highest closing
level since July 27.
 European shares and the euro drew support among chatter
that the European Central Bank was in the market for bonds from
euro-zone nations in danger of rising borrowing costs and in
possible need of bailouts.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose
$1.35, or 1.53 percent, to $89.35 per barrel. Gold rose $29.50,

 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a third
straight day on Friday, after falling more than 7.0 percent
last month, though analysts say it's unclear whether it will
extend its gains next week.
 The euro's gains on Friday accelerated after data showed
the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected in November,
driving the jobless rate up to 9.8 percent. [ID:nN02238002].
 The euro rose 1.5 percent to $1.3414  on Friday,
capping off its best three-day performance since May. It hit a
2-1/2-month low beneath $1.30 on Tuesday.
 Traders said European Central Bank's purchases of Irish and
Portuguese debt this week helped support the euro.
 But with a light U.S. economic data calendar next week,
analysts said lingering euro zone debt worries could weigh on
the euro again next week. European authorities may have bailed
out Ireland, but investors are still worried about the next
euro-area country to require assistance.
 ""The strong rally in the euro we have seen in recent days
will likely fizzle out next week,"" said Greg Anderson, G10
strategist at Citigroup in New York. ""There are few drivers
left in the market.""
 Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar fell to a 2-1/2-week low at
82.53 . It was last at 82.57, down 1.6 percent.
 THE EURO'S NEXT MOVE
 If investors start to worry anew about the strength of the
U.S. economy, the euro could sustain its recent gains. The
unexpectedly weak U.S. employment report on Friday unnerved
some investors.
 Also weighing on the dollar were reports that Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in an interview to be aired
on CBS-TV on Sunday that markets should not dismiss the
possibility of the central bank buying more than $600 billion

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar closed on a
flat note on Friday after initially sagging on disappointing
U.S. and domestic job data that undermined hopes of stronger
economic growth in coming months.
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose far less than expected in
November -- up 39,000 versus forecasts of 140,000 -- and the
jobless rate jumped to a seven-month high of 9.8 percent,
dampening hopes for a self-sustaining economic recovery in
Canada's biggest trading partner. [ID:nN02238002]
 In the aftermath of the weak U.S. data, the Canadian
currency  dropped as low as C$1.0081 against the U.S.
dollar, or 99.20 U.S. cents.
 The currency was already pulling back after Canadian
employment data showed a mixed performance in November with
tepid job gains of 15,200 versus expectations of 18,000. The
unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent from 7.9 percent, but
that was largely due to young people dropping out of the job
market. [ID:nN03271210]
 ""A weak Canadian jobs report and a weak U.S. jobs report is
not painting the rosiest of pictures for the Canadian
fundamental outlook,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency
strategist at Scotia Capital.
 The Canadian dollar  regained ground after its
initial retreat and closed the North American session at
C$1.0033 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.67 U.S. cents, little
changed from Thursday's close at C$1.0039 to the U.S. dollar,
or 99.61 U.S. cents. For the week, it was up 1.7 percent.
 Overnight, the Canadian dollar was only two basis points
shy of parity at C$1.0002, or 99.98 U.S. cents.
 Sutton said speculation of large currency flows being
generated by the C$3.3 billion deal by U.S.-based Walter Energy
Inc  to buy Canada's Western Coal   was a
factor behind the move toward parity and may help explain the
Canadian dollar's standout performance on Thursday when it
surged to a three-week high. [ID:nLDE6B20EU]
 Looking ahead, next week's focus will be on the Bank of
Canada's interest rate announcement on Tuesday. But with the
jobs data doing little to change expectations it will almost
certainly stay on hold at 1 percent.
 ""The Bank of Canada would care deeply about both figures
and at this point neither argues shriekingly for a hike in the
near term,"" said Eric Lascelles, chief Canadian macro
strategist at TD Securities.
 ""I think we can sit comfortably and imagine that next week
is a pause and for that matter that early 2011 probably brings
more of the same.""
 On Sunday, the Federal Reserve will also be in the
spotlight, as Chairman Ben Bernanke appears on the U.S. TV news
program ""60 Minutes."" [ID:nN02276467]
 Scotia's Sutton said comments by Bernanke to defend the
Fed's controversial $600 billion U.S. Treasury bill purchase
could spur some U.S. dollar weakness.
 She noted that near term support for the U.S. dollar was a
recent low of C$0.9980 and the year trough from April at
C$0.9931.
 Canadian government bonds erased earlier losses, up
modestly alongside Treasuries on an unwind of short positions
after the weak U.S. jobs report.[US/]
 The two-year government of Canada bond  was up 8
Canadian cents to yield 1.637 percent, while the 10-year bond
 gained 4 Canadian cents to yield 3.196 percent.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro rallied sharply versus
the dollar on Friday after weak U.S. jobs data, gaining for a
third straight day, but the single currency should remain under
pressure next week as concerns about euro-zone debt problems
persist.
 The dollar dropped across the board after Labor Department
data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 39,000 last month, much
weaker than expectations for 140,000 new jobs. The unemployment
rate also increased to 9.8 percent. See [ID:nN02238002].
 With a light U.S. economic data calendar next week, the
focus will likely shift to overseas events, such as Anglo
central bank meetings, Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at
Citigroup in New York.
 ""The strong rally in the euro we have seen in recent days
will likely fizzle out next week,"" he said. ""This rally will
either peter out or outright pause as there are few drivers
left in the market.""
 Anderson sees the euro ending next week unchanged against
the dollar at around $1.34.
 ""The shorts were shaken out over the last two weeks and
over the last few days the longs got destroyed, so many people
will choose to just sit on their hands until the end of the
year,"" he said.
 While the payrolls numbers further support the Federal
Reserve's quantitative easing, a dollar-negative factor,
analysts said the Fed would need a series of anemic data in
order to exhaust all of the $600 billion allocated for boosting
the economy.
 ""I don't think the big picture has changed much. Clearly,
the U.S. is dealing with very high unemployment. But there are
indications that the U.S. economy is gradually starting to pick
up again,"" said Ugo Lancioni, currency strategist and portfolio
manager at Neuberger Berman in London.
 The firm has $180 billion in assets under management and
Lancioni helps oversee the company's fixed-income assets
totaling about $80 billion.
 By contrast, the euro zone's peripheral countries remain
mired in a debt cesspool, which should keep the euro's
downtrend intact for now. European authorities may have bailed
out Ireland, but investors are still worried about the next
euro-area country to require assistance.
 The euro, however, recovered on Friday, posting its best
three-day gain since May 2010, mainly due to the European
Central Bank's purchases of peripheral euro zone bonds. On the
week, the single euro zone currency was on track for a 0.7
percent rise.
 KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS
 In early afternoon New York trade, the euro rose about 1
percent at $1.3364 , blowing past the key 100-day
moving average at $1.3325 and well above a 2-1/2 month low of
$1.2969 hit on Tuesday.
 The next key level to watch is $1.3467, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the euro's move from its peak at $1.4283 in
early November to the $1.2969-trough.
 In the options market, analysts reported that the negative
market sentiment on the euro has turned about two days ago and
are currently neutral.
 David Tien, a director at Credit Suisse's Global
Algorithmic Strategy and Modeling group in New York, said the
extreme demand for bearish options structures on euro/dollar
which began in mid-November has significantly diminished as
""the extension of special ECB liquidity facilities appears to
have calmed the market in the near term.""
 On Thursday, the ECB extended non-standard provisions,
committing to provide unlimited one-week, one-month and
three-month funding for euro zone banks until at least April.
 In line with the euro's recovery, other euro-zone linked
assets The CurrencyShares Euro Trust traded on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange rose 1.7 percent to $133.18 . This
ETF holds euro on-demand deposits in euro-denominated bank
accounts.
 Meanwhile, shares in the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index
Bullish Fund  fell 1.12 percent to $22.90.

 WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - South Korea has agreed to
give the United States five years to phase out a 2.5 percent
tariff on Korean-built cars rather than cut the tariff
immediately, clearing the way for a deal on a stalled bilateral
trade pact, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.
 An article on the newspaper's website quoted people
familiar with the negotiations as saying the phase-out was
intended to encourage union support when the agreement moves to
Congress, where a political battle is likely.
 The United States and South Korea had been edging closer to
a deal to revive prospects for the agreement, which is subject
to review by President Barack Obama and South Korean President
Lee Myung-bak.
 South Korea is the United States' seventh-largest trading
partner and eighth-largest export market. Last year, the United
States exported $28.6 billion worth of goods to South Korea and
imported $39.2 billion of products from that country, for a
U.S. deficit of $10.6 billion.
 Details of the revised pact, which must still be ratified
by both nations' legislatures, are expected to be released
later Friday, barring any last-minute snag, the Wall Street
Journal reported.
 It said negotiators discussed a possible four-year
phase-out of the U.S. auto tariff but opted for a longer
agreement to better attract union support.

 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell and
stocks' rally stalled on Friday after the U.S. unemployment
rate rose last month, but investors latched onto a larger trend
of economic strength and resisted heavier selling.
 Gold  jumped above $1,400 an ounce on Friday, headed
for its biggest weekly gain since April after the jobs data
sent the dollar tumbling 1 percent.
 Some investors shifted away from riskier assets, lifting
prices of U.S. Treasury securities.
 Stock in Europe ended slightly lower, but analysts

 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped across the
board on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created far
fewer jobs than expected, although persistent euro zone debt
problems may limit losses, particularly against the euro.
 Many analysts viewed the weak employment report as an
outlier amid a slew of generally positive U.S. data released
the last few weeks that suggested the economy was slowly
gaining traction.
 Labor Department data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose
39,000 last month, much weaker than expectations for 140,000
new jobs. Also, the unemployment rate increased to 9.8
percent.
 While the numbers further support the Federal Reserve's
quantitative easing program, which is a dollar-negative factor,
analysts said the Fed would need a series of anemic data to
exhaust all of the $600 billion allocated for boosting the
economy.
 ""U.S. nonfarm payrolls are extremely volatile, so one data
point is not probably enough to tell much about future trends,""
said Ugo Lancioni, currency strategist and portfolio manager at
Neuberger Berman in London.
 The firm has $180 billion in assets under management and
Lancioni helps oversee the company's fixed-income assets
totaling $about $80 billion.
 ""I don't think the big picture has changed much. Clearly,
the U.S. is dealing with very high unemployment. But there are

 By contrast, the euro zone's peripheral countries remain

Ireland but investors are still worried about which may be the
next euro-area country to require assistance.
 The euro, however, recovered on Friday, posting its best
three-day gain since May, mainly due to the European Central
Bank's purchases of peripheral euro zone bonds. On the week,
the euro zone single currency was on track for a 0.7 percent
rise.
 KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS
 In midday New York trade the euro was up 1.1 percent at
$1.3369, blowing past the key 100-day moving average at $1.3325
and well above a 2-1/2-month low of $1.2969 hit on Tuesday.
 The next key level to watch is $1.3467, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the euro's move from its peak at $1.4283 in
early November to the $1.2969 trough.
 In the options market, analysts said negative sentiment on
the euro had turned about two days ago and was now neutral.
 David Tien, a director at Credit Suisse's Global
Algorithmic Strategy and Modeling group in New York, said
extreme demand for bearish options structures on the euro
versus the dollar which began in mid-November has significantly
diminished ""as the extension of special ECB liquidity
facilities appears to have calmed the market in the near
term.""
 On Thursday, the ECB extended nonstandard provisions,
committing to provide unlimited one-week, one-month and
three-month funding for vulnerable euro zone banks until at
least April.
 A rise in euro zone service sector activity, retail sales
and the Bundesbank's raising of Germany's growth forecasts for
this year also supported the single currency.
 In line with the euro's recovery, other euro-zone-linked
assets such as exchange-traded funds also gained. The
CurrencyShares Euro Trust traded on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange rose 1.7 percent to $133.18. This ETF holds euro
on-demand deposits in euro-denominated bank accounts.
 The euro VIX index, meanwhile, declined to 13.85 percent,
the lowest in about two weeks, suggesting easing anxiety about
euro zone worries. This index measures the market's expectation
of 30-day volatility of the dollar/euro exchange rate by
applying the VIX methodology to options on the euro ETF.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell to 2-1/2-week lows at
82.53. It was last at 82.70, down 1.4 percent.

 MADRID, Dec 4 (Reuters Life!) - There may be a gulf between
their incomings and outgoings and a debt crisis sweeping through
Europe, but that won't stop Spaniards from making the most of
the ""puente"" this long pre-Christmas holiday weekend.
 Despite news of tax rises, austerity budgets, soaring
unemployment and a euro zone crisis, most Spaniards will take a
""puente"" (bridge) day in between Monday's Constitution Day and
Wednesday's Feast of the Immaculate Conception to create a
five-day weekend of shopping, eating, visiting and spending.
 Madrid hotels are fully booked by people from across the
country coming to gawk at the Christmas lights and take in the
shows, despite the government's announcement of a new tax rise
and a speeding up of pension reforms to combat a euro zone
sovereign debt storm that threatens to undermine the euro.
 ""We're fully booked in Madrid this weekend, and reservations
are looking much higher than last year,"" a source from a leading
hotel group said.
 Spain's own economic problems stem from a decade-long
debt-driven construction and property boom that left Spaniards
up to their ears in debt when the bubble burst two years ago.
 The good news for the economy is that demand hasn't waned
for Christmas knick-knacks from the Plaza Mayor square or
discouraged queues along the busy Gran Via for lottery tickets
from Dona Manolita, famous for having sold many winning numbers
for the ""El Gordo"" Christmas draw.
 ""When you look around right now, it seems as if people still
haven't learned their lesson about over-spending,"" said
39-year-old Madrid resident Ana Lumbreras.

 COUNTING ON THE FAMILY
 The national traffic authority estimates 7 million journeys
in the coming days, with Madrid residents reversing the flow and
heading to the coast to avoid chaos in the capital.
 The country is struggling to emerge from an 18-month
recession, but the recovery has stagnated and unemployment
hovers near 20 percent, the highest in the euro zone.
 Spain already suffered salary cuts and VAT hikes as the
government tries to rein in its public deficit, and a string of
new measures, including a higher tobacco tax, were announced on
Friday to stave off a bailout like in Greece and Ireland.
 The recession and sluggish recovery have devastated some
sectors of society. While middle class salaries are down,
Spaniards make a special effort during the Christmas period,
when they traditionally exchange gifts for the Epiphany.
 Joblessness has especially hit young people, most of whom
continue living with their parents well into their 20s or 30s.
 ""Crises in Spain aren't as harsh socially because there's
still a strong family cushion to lean on,"" Juan Carlos Rodriguez
of consultancy Analistas Socio-Politicos said.

 * Victory for China in first WTO dispute against EU 
 
 (Adds details, background, Chinese quote)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - European Union duties on fasteners
like screws and bolts from China break international trade rules
in many cases and should be revised, a panel of World Trade
Organization experts said on Friday.
 The ruling, against which both sides have 60 days to appeal,
marks a victory for China in its first WTO dispute against the
European Union.
 It is also a setback to the European Union in dealing with
imports from countries that it considers are not market
economies, such as China, Vietnam and Cuba.
 Earlier this week China appealed against a ruling in another
case involving U.S. duties, in which a panel upheld the right of
the United States to levy duties on goods from non-market
economies to compensate for both unfair pricing and subsidies.
 China welcomed Friday's ruling, saying the way the EU had
calculated the duties had imposed ""great burdens and unfair
treatments"" on Chinese enterprises, and called on Brussels to
withdraw the regulations.
 ""The Panel's rulings make it clear that the EU's
anti-dumping legislation and practice are discriminatory and
inconsistent with WTO rules,"" it said in a statement.
 Friday's ruling confirmed a Reuters report in August that
China had prevailed in the case.
 But the panel did not back all of China's claims in its
394-page report, and did not meet China's request that it
recommend how the EU should bring its practices into conformity
with global trade rules.
 WTO rules allow countries to set extra duties on imports
that are ""dumped"" -- sold below their price at home -- if that
harms industry in the importing country.
 But calculating these anti-dumping duties is difficult with
imports from non-market economies, because state intervention in
the economy means there is no obvious fair domestic price to
take as a reference.
 China successfully argued that the EU's approach to
calculating these duties was wrong in many cases.
 China has been involved in an escalating dispute with the
European Union over fasteners, imposing its own anti-dumping
duties on EU imports.
 In October the EU's executive commission started to
investigate whether Chinese exporters were trying to evade the
EU duties by shipping screws and bolts via Malaysia.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped and
stocks were little changed on Friday after the U.S.
unemployment rate rose last month, but investors latched onto
signs of economic strength, resisting heavier selling.
 Nevertheless, some shift away from riskier assets lifted
prices of U.S. Treasury securities.
 Stock gains in Europe evaporated and Wall Street opened
lower after the Labor Department said businesses added 39,000
nonfarm payrolls in November, falling short of the 140,000
expected by economists. The unemployment rate rose to a
seven-month high of 9.8 percent. For details see,
[ID:nN02238002]
 But overall employment for September and October was
revised upward to show 38,000 more jobs created than previously
estimated.
 What's more, other labor market indicators and consumer
spending reports have raised optimism about the economy after a
soft patch during the summer.
 ""The question is, was the number so weak that it creates
concern about the economy, market volatility and risk aversion?
I think probably not,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of FX
strategy at Wells Fargo in New York. ""It's not bad enough to
raise concerns of a renewed recession.""
 U.S. stock indexes paused after two days of powerful gains,
falling but clawing back losses at one point.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> declined 12.75
points, or 0.11 percent, to 11,349.66. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 2.21 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,219.32
and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 0.30 point, or
0.01 percent, at 2,579.65.
 The European benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> share
index declined 0.31 percent to 1,102.73, after closing its last
session at a two-week high. In Asia trading, the Nikkei <.N225>
closed 0.1 percent higher.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> managed a 0.38
percent gain, coming off its highest since Nov. 22.
 Many analysts viewed the disappointing employment report as
an outlier amid a slew of generally positive U.S. data released
the last few weeks that suggest traction for the economy.
Strong holiday spending, including all-time highs for online
sales on so-called Cyber Monday have made investors more
optimistic about year-end.
 For the dollar, however, the U.S. jobs report injected
enough caution to create a fresh downdraft on the currency.
 ""Wall Street is going to reevaluate and go back to a slow
recovery kind of mode,"" said Subodh Kumar, chief investment
strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto.
 Despite Friday's downward move in the dollar, the euro-zone
debt crisis is seen as a drag on the euro and is expected keep
it under pressure for some time. European authorities may have
bailed out Ireland, but investors are speculating euro-zone
nations such as Spain and Portugal will require assistance.
 The dollar fell against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.99 percent
at 79.51. The euro  gained 0.98 percent to $1.3353.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  slumped 1.23
percent to 82.84 yen.
 U.S. Treasury prices jumped as traders unwound short
positions after the payrolls data, and others saw softer U.S.
growth supporting lower interest rate policy.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield declined 0.04
percentage point to 2.96 percent.
 Before U.S. jobs data, European shares and the euro drew
support among chatter that the European Central Bank was in the
market for bonds from euro-zone nations in danger of rising
borrowing costs and in possible need of bailouts.
 The euro zone debt of nations like Portugal outperformed as
the purchases reassured investors the bank would continue to
support markets despite the lack of any sign from President
Jean-Claude Trichet it would ramp up the program. [GVD/EUR]
 Portugal's five-year credit default swaps tightened further
by midday to 409 basis points from 448 basis points, data from
Markit showed, while the premium paid for 10-year Portuguese
debt  over German bunds  declined.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 6
cents, or 0.07 percent, to $88.06 per barrel, and spot gold
 rose $17.30, or 1.25 percent, to $1401.50.

 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Investors are looking to use any
stabilisation in government bond markets to reassess their game
plans as risks from the euro zone debt crisis and upside
economic surprises darken the outlook for sovereign debt.
 In rollercoaster trade in the past week, euro zone
government bond markets fell sharply and the euro hit a 2-1/2
month low versus the dollar before stabilising as European
Central Bank buying of peripheral debt eased concerns the crisis
would spread to bigger economies such as Spain and Italy.
 But event risks loom in the coming week.
 Ireland's government faces a parliamentary vote on its 2011
budget, the first major test set as a condition of its IMF/EU
bailout, while European finance officials are also due to meet
in Brussels for an ECOFIN meeting.
 More broadly, uncertainty remains over private sector
burden-sharing if sovereign debt is restructured, leading to a
repricing of ""risk free"" assets.
 Upbeat data from China, the United States and even the euro
zone point to reasonable growth in 2011, which argues against
holding low-yielding assets which also lose value when inflation
returns. That in turn could lead to a general shift away from
fixed income assets in 2011.
 ""Next year will be a year of growth in the order of 4
percent. Investors are well advised to focus on secure sources
of growth and avoid the lure of the crowded trade,"" said Bill
O'Neill, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Asset
Management.
 ""We generally still prefer equities and commodities to
government and corporate debt. Investors are richly rewarded for
taking risks ... Investors should also treat emerging market
debt with caution, taking care to avoid overvalued assets.""
 The move may be already underway. Reuters global asset
allocation polls released in the past week showed investors cut
their allocation to fixed income, which includes government
bonds and corporate debt, to its lowest level since February.
Equity holdings hit eight-month peaks.
 According to fund tracker EPFR, bond funds posted
back-to-back weeks of outflows for the first time since March
2009, with investors pulling $1.8 billion out of U.S municipal
bond funds.
 According to Citi, government bonds in Germany and Britain
have returned more than 7 percent this year in hedged U.S.
dollar terms. 
 That compares favourably with the benchmark MSCI world
equity index which rose 7.1 percent, although the latter figure
does not include dividends.
 ""We would be very cautious towards medium to long term
maturities across the world which we feel are significantly
overvalued owing to QE (quantitative easing) activity and undue
risk aversion,"" said Andreas Utermann, global chief investment
officer at RCM.
 
 INFLATION PROTECTION
 For asset managers, protection against inflation is going to
be a key theme in 2011 given ultra-loose monetary policy from
the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan and the prospect of
further quantitative easing from the European Central Bank.
 The ECB pledged on Thursday to keep giving banks unlimited
liquidity well into 2011, extending three-month liquidity
operations with full allotment at fixed rates until March.
 And inflationary pressures are on the rise in the euro zone,
according to a forward-looking indicator from the Economic Cycle
Research Institute.
 ""The global economic recovery has reached a point where it
is starting to put general upward pressure on prices ... we
think it just a matter of time before inflation in developed
markets starting trending higher rather than lower,"" Morgan
Stanley strategist Graham Secker noted.
 ""Investors are likely to look increasingly to switch out of
nominal assets such as bonds and cash and into real assets such
as equities, commodities and real estate. Equity investors
should overweight stocks with good pricing power, such as
mining, oil services and chemicals.""

 By Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Isabel Versiani
 BRASILIA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Brazil raised bank reserve
requirements on Friday, looking to cool a credit boom that is
fueling inflation as the country's economy expands at its
fastest pace in almost three decades.
 The move allows the central bank to tighten credit and curb
rising consumer prices without hiking interest rates, which
would risk attracting a further flood of funds from abroad.
Brazil's real  has surged about 6 percent since the end
of June in part due to the nation's high interest rates, making
it one of the world's most overvalued major currencies.
 Yields on interest rate futures contracts <0#DIJ:> fell
sharply after the central bank unveiled the measures as
investors pared bets on future rate hikes. Markets had priced
in an interest rate hike as early as next week, when central
bank policymakers are due to meet, but now do not expect an
increase until January at the earliest.
 ""Changing reserve requirements is no substitute for
monetary policy, but it is enough to delay an interest rate
hike,"" said Ines Filipa, an economist at ICAP Brasil, a
brokerage in Rio de Janeiro.
 The measures, which Central Bank President Henrique
Meirelles described as ""prudent,"" were announced on the same
day that China said it would switch to a ""prudent monetary
policy"" as it seeks to curb inflation. [ID:nTOE6B2062]
 That contrasts sharply with policy in more developed
economies such as the United States and Japan, where
policymakers are holding interest rates near zero and taking
other measures to stoke flagging consumer demand.

 Brazilian officials want to slow consumer lending in a
red-hot economy that is set grow more than 7 percent this year.
Bank lending is expanding at an annual pace of 20 percent,
fueling a real-estate boom and stoking fears of a bubble in
sectors like automobile and payroll-deductable loans.
 The measures dovetail with a push by President-elect Dilma
Rousseff, who takes office on Jan. 1 and has made lowering
borrowing costs a top priority.[ID:nN30260435]
 The higher reserve requirements will sap 61 billion reais
($36 billion) from circulation, or about 6 percent of total
outstanding loans, excluding government subsidized credit.
 However, the steps do not impose any restrictions on state
development bank BNDES, which analysts say is the main driver
behind Brazil's rapid credit expansion.
 Reserve requirements on term deposits were lifted to 20
percent from 15 percent, while an additional requirement for
demand, or cash deposits, rose to 12 percent from 8 percent.
Banks must also allocate more capital for consumer loans with
maturities of more than two years.
 ""This measure ... reduces liquidity in markets and the
emergence of unsustainable trends, the bubbles in credit volume
growth and the assumption of risk that could be negative to the
economy,"" Meirelles said.
 Brazil slashed reserve requirements in late 2008, during
the global financial meltdown, to ensure banks kept lending. It
started to unwind those measures last June, when it lifted
requirements on demand deposits to 43 percent from 42 percent.
 A month later, it raised rates by 50 basis points to 10.75
percent but credit growth remains strong. Auto loans, for
example, surged 44 percent in the 12 months through October,
while mortgage lending jumped 52 percent, according to central
bank data.
 Signs of the credit boom are everywhere. Lenders cold call
consumers almost daily offering cash loans and credit cards,
people hand out flyers on street corners offering mortgages for
new real estate projects, and auto showrooms are packed.
 BANK STOCKS SLUMP
 The lending surge has stoked inflation in a country still
haunted by its long history of runaway prices.
 Annual inflation rose 5.47 percent through mid-November,
well above the center of the central bank's year-end target of
4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.
 The central bank's monetary policy committee meets on
interest rates next Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts in a
Reuters survey predicted it will leave the benchmark Selic rate
unchanged at a lofty 10.75 percent. [ID:nSPG003161]
 The meeting will be Meirelles' last as central bank chief
before he is slated to hand over to Alexandre Tombini in
January. A career technocrat who lacks Meirelles' political
skills, Tombini is widely expected to provide continuity at the
central bank. [ID:nN23137506]
 Bank shares tumbled in the wake of the new measures, which
will hamper their ability to lend.
 Shares of state-controlled Banco do Brasil 
slumped 2.7 percent, Itau Unibanco  1.8 percent and
Bradesco  2.1 percent. Santander Brasil ,
the local unit of Spain's Santander, dropped 3.2 percent.
 ""This will definitely make it costlier for lenders to
operate,"" said Lucio Bagio, a trader with Concordia Corretora
in Sao Paulo.

 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday after
data showed the U.S. economy created far fewer jobs than
expected, although persistent euro-zone debt problems may limit
losses.
 Labor Department data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose
39,000 last month, much weaker than expectations for 140,000
new jobs. The unemployment rate also increased to 9.8 percent.
See.
 Many analysts viewed the weak jobs report an outlier amid a
slew of generally positive U.S. data released the last few
weeks that suggest the economy is slowly gaining traction.
 The euro-zone debt crisis remains a drag on the single
euro-zone currency and will keep it under pressure for some
time. European authorities may have bailed out Ireland, but
investors are still worried about the next euro-area country to
require assistance.
 ""A softer-than-expected jobs number probably makes people a
little more comfortable with the idea that the Fed will
steadily progress with its planned quantitative easing,"" said
Nick Bennenbroek, head of FX strategy at Wells Fargo in New
York.
""The question is, was the number so weak that it creates
concern about the economy, market volatility and risk aversion?
I think probably not. It's a disappointing number, but it's not
bad enough to raise concerns of a renewed recession.""
 In early New York trade, the euro rose 0.9 percent on the
day at $1.3342,, blowing past the key 100-day moving average at
$1.3325 and well above a 2-1/2 month low of $1.2969 hit on
Tuesday.
 The next key level to watch is $1.3467, the 38.2 percent
retracement of the euro's move from its peak at $1.4283 in
early November to the $1.2969-level trough.
 The euro was underpinned earlier by the fall in risk
premiums on government bonds issued by euro-zone periphery
states on Friday, with further bond buying by the European
Central Bank reassuring investors.
 A rise in euro-zone service sector activity, retail sales
and the Bundesbank raising Germany's growth forecasts for this
year also supported the single currency.

pension funds have agreed a 100 billion crown ($862.4 million)
deal to ease mortgage repayments for households hit by the
collapse of the island nation's economy.
 About a quarter of households have difficulty paying their
mortgages, and finding a solution for restructuring private and
corporate debt -- equal to around half Iceland's $12.1 billion
gross domestic product -- has held up economic recovery.
 The government's plan will see the write-off of mortgage
debts over a certain limit, increased mortgage tax relief and
the lowering of repayment interest rates for some borrowers.
 ""The total sum involved is likely to exceed one hundred
billion krona,"" the government said in a statement.
 Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said the deal would
help around 60,000 households in the nation of just 320,000
people and would support growth.
 ""It is important that we clean out debts that were created
by the banking crash so that the recovery can continue,"" she
told news conference.
 The government said the cost of the measures would be
two-thirds borne by the banks and other financial institutions,
like pension funds, and one-third by the state housing fund.
 Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson said an agreement
over debt relief for small and medium-sized businesses was in
the works, while a deal with pension funds over financing public
investment over the next few years was very close.
 Debt restructuring is a key issue to get the economy moving
again after the country's main banks collapsed within the space
of a week in 2008, burdened by mountainous borrowing racked up
over a decade of aggressive overseas expansion.
 The financial sector has been restructured and new, smaller
banks have taken over from the old lenders but still carry much
of their debt burden.
 Analysts had worried that restructuring would simply shift
more of that debt onto the government's balance sheet, meaning
even bigger cuts in spending by the government than currently
planned.
 The economy, which shrank 6.8 percent in 2009, is expected
to contract a further 2.6 percent this year, before returning to
growth again in 2011.

 COLUMBIA, Md., Dec 3 (Reuters) - The United States and

Chairman Max Baucus to address his concerns about remaining
restrictions on imports of U.S. beef, but South Korea did not
commit to any immediate action, the sources said.

 * Fine Gael seen unlikely to stand in way of passage
 * Failure in vote would trigger election, stall EU/IMF funds
 
 By Noah Barkin
 DUBLIN, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Irish government's tough 2011
austerity budget is expected to pass a first test in parliament
next week, averting a snap election and assuring the country
wins quick access to EU/IMF rescue funds.
 But some economists see the aid deal and the draconian cuts
it relies on as unsustainable and say a new government could
look to make changes as early as next year, possibly forcing
senior bondholders in Irish banks to take some losses.
 Prime Minister Brian Cowen, whose popularity has plunged
into the single digits, has a razor-thin majority in parliament
that depends on two independent lawmakers who have not yet
stated how they plan to vote.
 If those two withhold their support, however, the main
opposition party Fine Gael is expected to abstain on Tuesday
when the first of three votes on the budget is held, keeping it
on track for passage.
 Fine Gael has sharply criticised the government's 85 billion
euro ($112.1 billion) aid deal this week with the European Union
and International Monetary Fund.
 But it is not in its interests to see the budget fail as
that could expose the party to accusations of deepening the
crisis, caused by the massive cost to the state of shoring up
banks that lent recklessly during a property boom. This year's
budget deficit is set to exceed 30 percent of GDP.
 ""I think it's very unlikely that it won't pass, despite some
of the strong rhetoric we've seen lately,"" said John McHale, an
economics professor at the National University of Ireland in
Galway. ""Everything would be on hold if it failed. A lot of
damage would be done to the credibility of the state.""
 The main details of the budget are already known. It
foresees a whopping 6 billion euros in savings next year,
including roughly 4 billion euros in spending cuts and tax
adjustments designed to boost revenues by some 2 billion euros.
 Roughly half of the additional tax income will be generated
by lowering income tax bands and tweaking tax credits, allowing
the government to target the 45 percent of Irish adults, on
lower incomes, who did not previously pay income tax.
 The parliamentary vote on Tuesday will be focused on VAT and
excise tax changes, with a separate vote on social welfare
measures due later in the month and a third on general finance
steps in the first quarter of 2011. Cowen has committed to
calling an election once the final hurdle is out of the way.
 
 ""POLITICALLY UNSUSTAINABLE""
Thomas Conefrey, a researcher at the Economic and Social
Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin, said he expected the 2011
measures and additional savings laid out in the government's
four-year, 15 billion euro austerity plan to subtract a full
percentage point from annual growth in the coming years.
 That could make it difficult for the government to achieve
its target for gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.75
percent next year. The EU/IMF agreement foresees a more modest
expansion of 0.9 percent.
 A Reuters poll on Friday showed economists expect growth of
1.6 percent next year. But that depends on robust exports, which
could disappoint if the economies of Ireland's biggest trading
partners, Britain and the United States, falter.
 Opposition parties and economists have stepped up criticism
of the Irish government's deal with the EU/IMF in recent days,
particularly the EU's decision to spare senior bond holders in
Ireland's crippled banks from shouldering some of the costs.
 Instead, Irish taxpayers will take all the pain in a deal
economic historian Barry Eichengreen has called a ""disaster"" and
likened to the punitive Versailles Treaty imposed on Germany
after World War One.
 He predicted in an article this week that a new Irish
government would be compelled to reject the deal negotiated by
its predecessor, calling it ""politically unsustainable.""
 Fine Gael and Labour Party leaders also signalled on Friday
that they could seek changes to the deal if they take power, as
expected, next year.
 ""A populist backlash is inevitable,"" Eichengreen, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley said. ""As
it is, the program will have to be revisited, perhaps as soon as
next year. Investors know this, which is why Irish (bond)
spreads have barely budged.""

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Friday as the
European Central Bank continued buying Portuguese and Irish
government bonds, easing euro zone debt concerns and helping the
currency rebound from a 2-1/2 month low hit earlier this week.
 But price movements were limited ahead of U.S. payrolls
data, especially after a firm ADP jobs report earlier in the
week, and a surprisingly strong U.S. housing number on Thursday
adding to views of a U.S. economic recovery.
 ""Expectations are creeping up so a (nonfarm payrolls) number
bigger than 150,000 would be needed to get any market reaction,""
said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 He said the dollar/yen pair would be most sensitive to the
data, with a recent high around 84.40 yen as a level to watch.
 A further rise above 3 percent in 10-year U.S. Treasury
yields would also boost the dollar against the Japanese unit, he
added.
 A Reuters poll showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls would increase by
140,000 in November, rising for the second month amid strong
gains in private hiring.. The jobless rate is expected to remain
at 9.6 percent.
 The dollar changed hands at 83.50 yen, down 0.4 percent from
late U.S. levels by 1205 GMT, off Monday's two-month high of
84.41 yen. Strong support was seen at the top end of the pair's
Ichimoku cloud at around 83.18.
 
 EURO UNDERPINNED
 The euro was underpinned as risk premiums on government
bonds issued by euro zone periphery states fell on Friday, with
further bond buying by the European Central Bank reassuring
investors.
 A rise in euro zone service sector activity, retail sales
and the Bundesbank raising Germany's growth forecasts for this
year also supported the single currency, as investors' immediate
concerns about the euro zone were alleviated.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3252, remaining
above a 2-1/2 month low of $1.2969 hit on Tuesday after massive
selling in euro zone periphery government bonds.
 Large euro/dollar option expiries at $1.3200 and $1.3250
were slowing the rally, while the technical picture was helped
by the euro holding above its 200-day moving average at $1.3123.
 But many analysts were not persuaded the euro had turned a
corner.
 ""The ECB has done a good job in reassuring the markets this
week and the euro zone PMI this morning has also helped, but the
euro is not out of the woods yet,"" said Jane Foley, senior
currency analyst at Rabobank.

 * German and France to discuss euro at bilateral meet

(Adds details and background)
 By Dave Graham
 BERLIN, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Germany delivered a firm rebuff on
Friday to calls for a joint tax policy in the euro area, saying
tougher rules on budget deficit limits would bring Europe closer
together as it seeks a way out of debt crisis.
 Some European policymakers have argued the bloc's debt
problems will only be solved with more centralised coordination
of fiscal resources, though Germany is wary of anything that
could lead to its taxpayers bailing out other countries.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told a
regular news conference joint fiscal policy was not an option.
 ""There are no plans and there is no desire for a joint
fiscal policy,"" Seibert told reporters. ""A decisive reform of
the stability and growth pact already leads to closer
cooperation on economic policy.""
 Germany has led a push to toughen up the stability pact,
which is designed to ensure member states' annual deficits do
not exceed three percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
 Most EU countries' deficits are expected to exceed the three
percent cap this year and next, many of them by a sizeable
margin. However, Germany now believes it could get its deficit
back within the limits next year. [ID:nLDE6B11TJ]
 The case of Ireland's low corporate tax illustrated
resistance to joint fiscal policy, Seibert said.
 Dublin has rejected suggestions from European politicians,
including German ones, that it should raise its low corporate
tax to reduce its deficit.
 The official position of most EU leaders is that deciding on
tax levels is a matter for individual governments.
 
 NO TRANSFERS
 However, there has been discussion in the euro zone, led by
France, on the need for some form of fiscal union or ""economic
government"" in the 16-member euro zone -- an idea Merkel began
supporting in early 2010.
 Berlin voices strong objections to anything that risks
turning the bloc into a ""transfer union"" where one country --
most likely Germany -- bails out the others. It tends to see
policy convergence as a way of encouraging German-style fiscal
discipline among its more wayward European partners.
 France and Germany hold a regular bilateral summit at the
end of next week and Seibert said the euro would be on the
agenda when Merkel meets French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 ""In every meeting Germany and France hold at the moment, the
problems relating to European policy and the euro are always
near the top of the agenda, so you can assume that this will be
discussed,"" Seibert said.
 However, he denied there were any plans for a special
European summit this weekend to discuss the financial crisis.
 The German and French leaders upset some of their partners
by bilaterally agreeing in the French resort of Deauville in
October to propose changes to the EU treaty in order to set up a
permanent mechanism for handling future euro-zone crises.
 Merkel's subsequent insistence that this should involve
making private investors share in the sovereign debt risk from
2013 onwards, when the new mechanism would come into effect,
roiled markets ahead of the Irish rescue deal.
 The German government has denied any responsibility for
pushing up the debt costs of peripheral euro zone countries such
as Greece, Ireland and Portugal with this position.
 ""I reject any direct link that is sometimes made between the
political initiatives that Germany and France have made and the
development of interest rates on (government bonds),"" said
Seibert, adding there was no single explanation for the euro's
instability.

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - European shares and U.S. stock
futures fell sharply and the dollar weakened on Friday, after
forecast-lagging U.S. jobs data cast doubts on the strength of
recovery in the world's largest economy.
 Non-farm payrolls data showed 39,000 jobs were added in
November, well below expectations for 140,000 new posts,
although October's reading was revised up by 38,000.
[ID:nN02238002]
 The prospect of a slower recovery hit stocks and oil 
and helped Bunds pare losses while U.S. Treasuries pushed into
positive territory.
 Gold  was boosted to a three-week high.
 The dollar slumped more than 1 percent versus the yen and
extended losses against the euro . The euro traded at up
0.9 percent against the dollar at $1.3340.
 Among other currencies, the dollar <.DXY> traded down 1
percent against a basket of other currencies.
 ""This is definitely a sign that the U.S. labour market
recovery is not on track and is not improving ... compared to
expectations this is an awful labour market report,"" said
Kornelius Purps, strategist at Unicredit in Munich.
 Shares went into reverse, with the benchmark FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> index down 0.6 percent, after closing the previous
session at a two-week high, while the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.3 percent.
 U.S. stock futures  pointed to falls of
0.5-0.7 percent at the Wall Street open.
 
 ECB BUYING
 Stocks and the euro had opened steady and moved higher ahead
of the jobs data, on talk of renewed buying by the European
Central Bank of peripheral euro zone debt, albeit in small
sizes, which had supported markets in the previous session.
 The purchases helped peripheral euro zone debt outperform,
reassuring investors the bank would continue to support markets
despite the lack of any sign from President Jean-Claude Trichet
it would ramp up the programme. [GVD/EUR]
 ""It remains to be seen whether the ECB is really picking up
the pace of bond buying, but I wouldn't count on it. They've
certainly shown a lack of appetite in the past,"" said Everett
Brown, strategist at IDEAglobal in London.
 Portugal's five-year credit default swaps tightened to 409
basis points from 448 basis points, data from Markit showed,
while the premium paid for 10-year Portuguese debt 
over benchmark German bunds  edged lower.
 Elsewhere in the periphery, Ireland's yield spread over
bunds  tightened slightly to 583 basis points.
 In contrast to the weak U.S. macroeconomic release, the PMI
survey of business purchasing managers, released earlier, showed
the euro zone's service sector economy pulled ahead in November
thanks to strengthening German and French business.

(Adds detail, background)
 GENEVA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - China has appealed against a
ruling by a World Trade Organization panel upholding the right
of the United States to impose extra duties on Chinese goods
that Washington said were unfairly priced and subsidised, an
official at China's WTO mission said on Friday.
 The appeal, launched on Dec. 1 in the complex case involving
treatment of goods from a country that is not a market economy
and where the state influences prices, demonstrates China's
increasing assertiveness in the global trading system.
 China had challenged the way the United States calculated
the duties and the fact that it suffered a double penalty of
anti-dumping duties for unfairly priced goods and countervailing
duties for subsidised products.
 But the original ruling published on Oct. 22 had backed the
right of an importer to set duties on goods from non-market
economies to compensate for unfair pricing and for subsidies --
something a U.S. court had previously struck down.
 The two-year-old dispute involved duties imposed by the
United States on imports of Chinese steel pipes, off-road tyres
and woven sacks.
 Under normal practice, the WTO's appellate body will issue a
ruling on the appeal within 90 days.
 As the world's largest exporter, China is frequently the
target of trade actions by other countries, but it has been
building up expertise in handling the global trading system by
launching its own cases and appealing adverse judgments.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Friday as
reported central bank buying of Portuguese and Irish debt in
recent days soothed investor nerves and helped the currency
rebound from a 2-1/2 month low, but sentiment remained fragile.
 The market's immediate focus moved to U.S. payrolls data
later in the day, with a surprisingly strong U.S. housing number
on Thursday adding to budding optimism on the U.S. economy.
 The euro stood at $1.3260, up 0.3 percent on the day and
well above a 2-1/2 month low of $1.2969 plumbed on Tuesday after
massive selling in euro zone periphery government bonds.
 Traders said the ECB continued to buy Portuguese and Irish
debt on Friday, easing investor panic over euro zone debt for
now.
 Large euro/dollar option expiries at $1.3200 and $1.3250
were slowing the rally, while the technical picture was helped
by the euro holding above its 200-day moving average at $1.3123.
 Some analysts said the euro's bounce could have further to
go, given the positioning in the market and thin liquidity.
 ""The euro has further room to correct to the upside as
strong ECB bond-buying will support sentiment and speculative
positioning is short,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at
UBS in Zurich.
 ""It can move up to $1.3400/$1.3450 but it remains a sell on
rallies - the overall trend is still down,"" he said.
 Sentiment towards the smaller euro zone states remained
precariously balanced after Standard and Poor's warned on
Thursday it may downgrade Greece in three months.
 ""The ECB has done a good job in reassuring the markets this
week and the euro zone PMI this morning has also helped, but the
euro is not out of the woods yet,"" said Jane Foley, senior
currency analyst at Rabobank.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers Index
(PMI), which surveys more than 2,000 businesses ranging from
banks to hotels, rose in November to 55.4 from 53.3 in October
and beating an earlier flash estimate of 55.2.
 The euro's 100-day moving average, at around $1.3327, was
seen as the next resistance level. More important resistance
lurked in the $1.3334-64 area, its August peak and a 38.2
percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 The sharp fall in the yields on Spanish, Portuguese and
other countries' bonds offset initial disappointment after ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet did not explicitly commit the bank
to ramping up bond buying on Thursday.
 
 PAYROLLS
 Traders were looking to the U.S. jobs data, due at 1330 GMT,
which is expected to show an increase of 140,000 jobs last
month, according to a Reuters survey.
 Although data on Thursday showed initial jobless claims rose
more than expected, anecdotal evidence of strong sales around
the Thanksgiving holiday and a surprise jump in the house sales
index boosted investor risk appetite.
 ""The impact of today's U.S. payrolls report on risk appetite
is likely to be the key determinant of the dollar's response.
Since the trend has been towards stronger data flow in the U.S.,
a weak report is likely to represent a bigger shock to the
market than strength,"" said Citibank analysts in a note to
clients.
 Some traders said a strong jobs figure was likely to
encourage more risk appetite, which could help the euro.
 The dollar changed hands at 83.50 yen, down 0.4 percent from
late U.S. levels and off Monday's two-month high of 84.41 yen.
Strong support was seen at the top end of the pair's Ichimoku
cloud at around 83.18.

 * Analysts say emphasis of policy could shift to rate rises
 * Markets unperturbed
 * Fiscal policy keeps door open to big investment plans

 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch 
 BEIJING, Dec 3 (Reuters) - China will switch to a prudent
monetary policy from a moderately loose stance, the Communist
Party's top leaders decided on Friday, a change that could
pave the way for more interest rate increases and lending
controls.	
 At the same time, the Politburo elected to maintain
China's proactive fiscal policy, an indication that the
government wants to continue to ramp up investment spending
even while taking tightening steps to control inflation.	
 That was underscored on Thursday when sources told Reuters
that China is considering investments of up to $1.5 trillion
over five years to promote the production of high-value
technologies. [ID:nLDE6B20EQ] 
 Chinese and global markets were little affected by the
policy announcement, with investors seeing the new wording as
an affirmation of the gradual tightening that Beijing has
already started to implement.	
 But while the change in policy description had been
discussed for several weeks by central bank advisers, the
Politburo's endorsement, reported by the official Xinhua news
agency, could still mark a decisive turning point.	
 
 ""It means that all sorts of monetary policy tools to
control liquidity and to control inflation can now be used,""
said Ken Peng, an economist with Citigroup in Beijing.	
 ""In the past we've been clearly focusing on administrative
measures. Going forward we could be using more price
adjustments via interest rates,"" he said, adding that he
expected five rate increases by the end of next year.	
 China has raised interest rates just once this year as it
has guided its monetary policy back to normal from the
ultra-loose settings it adopted to counter the global
financial crisis. Instead, it has used quantitative tools to
do the heavy work, officially raising banks' reserve
requirements five times.	
 ""The prudent monetary policy stance means compared with
this year, policy next year will be biased toward tightening,""
Xia Bin, an academic adviser to the central bank, told Reuters.	
 
 EXPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE	
 Along with playing a role in the fight against inflation,
policy tightening also signals confidence that the world's
second-largest economy is on solid ground, even as the U.S.
and European recoveries remain fragile.	
 ""China has no need now to worry about overall demand at
all,"" said Dong Xian'an, chief economist with Industrial
Securities in Beijing. ""Instead, the top priority is to curb
inflation and avoid economic overheating.""	
 ""The sooner China acts and the more forceful measures it
takes, the better,"" he said.	
 Consumer inflation hit a 25-month high in October, as
price rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier, and is expected to
have edged higher in November. Although it has been driven
almost exclusively by food prices, pressures have been
broadening on the back of higher global commodity costs.	
 China's cabinet vowed last month to take ""forceful""
measures, including price controls if necessary, to rein in
inflation.	
 But in maintaining a proactive fiscal policy, the
government sent a strong message that it wants to keep cash
flowing through the economy to power its development.	
 The $1.5 trillion, five-year investment plan will target
sectors that include alternative energy, biotechnology,
new-generation information technology, high-end equipment
manufacturing, advanced materials, and environmentally
friendly technologies.	
 The Central Economic Work Conference, they key annual
meeting at which top leaders chart out economic policies for
next year, is expected to discuss the plan when it convenes
later this month.	
 
 LENDING CONTROLS	
 A major prong of the government's stimulus programme was a
flood of lending by banks. China has already begun to rein in
loan issuance this year and the shift to a prudent monetary
policy could signal more restrictions next year.	
 Banks are on track to issue 7.5 trillion yuan in new loans
this year and that could fall to 7 trillion yuan next year,
Xia, the central bank adviser, said. This would imply about 15
percent lending growth, down from this year's nearly 20
percent clip, he added.	
 Money market rates have spiked in the last couple of
weeks, as a flurry of reserve requirement increases drained
cash from the financial system and prompted banks to sit on
funds in anticipation of further credit curbs.	
 China's key measure of short-term liquidity, the weighted
average seven-day bond repurchase rate , jumped
from 1.75 percent in mid-November to over 3.33 percent on
Friday, just shy of a more than two-year high.

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - European shares rose ahead of the
release of fresh U.S. jobs data later on Friday, while the euro
paused for breath after bouncing from a 2-1/2 month low.
 Both asset classes had opened steady ahead of the
much-watched payrolls data, seeking further evidence about the
extent of European Central Bank bond buying, which had supported
markets in the previous session.
 Peripheral euro zone debt outperformed as the ECB continued
purchases, reassuring investors that the bank would continue to
support markets despite the lack of any sign from President
Jean-Claude Trichet it would ramp up the programme.
 ""The ECB really are the only buyer out there and there's
certainly some people looking to get out on the client side,"" a
trader said.
 A generally improved economic picture, supporting stock
markets and riskier assets, has been marred by the euro zone's
fiscal crisis.
 By mid-morning, the cost of insuring Portuguese and other
peripheral debt had fallen further, and while the ECB was back
in the market buying Portugal and Ireland bonds, traders said,
its purchases were in small sizes only.
 Portugal's five-year credit default swaps tightened to 430
basis points from 448 basis points, data from Markit showed,
while the premium paid for 10-year Portuguese debt over
benchmark German bunds edged lower.
 Elsewhere in the periphery, Ireland's yield spread over
bunds tightened slightly to 595 basis points.
 After previously rallying on talk of the ECB bond buying, in
the hope it would help shore up confidence in the euro zone
periphery, the single currency was steady in early trade on
Friday, hovering around a key technical resistance level.
 The euro traded at $1.3241 at 0958 GMT, above a 2-1/2 month
low hit on Tuesday and just below its 100-day moving average and
below key resistance at $1.3334-64, its August peak and a 38.2
percent retracement of the June-November rally.
 ""I suspect the euro has bottomed out in the near term and
will test $1.33-34,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage
house.
 Among other currencies, the dollar traded down 0.2 percent
against a basket of other currencies.
 
 STOCKS RISE
 The benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 share index extended gains by
midmorning, after closing the previous session at a two-week
high, and all eyes remained on the U.S. jobs data, Justin
Urquhart Stewart, London-based director at Seven Investment
Management, said.
 ""There's a positive tone to the market, despite all the
negative news on sovereign debt ... If the payrolls are
positive, it could easily push the market even higher,"" he said.
 A strong overnight showing in U.S. stock markets had slowed
by the close of play in Asia, with gains of just 0.1 percent in
the Nikkei, mostly on buying in technology shares.
 The MSCI world equity index is also higher, up 0.4 percent,
while U.S. stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open
on Wall Street.
 Oil was steady near 25-month highs following a recent slew
of upbeat U.S. economic data that bodes well for demand from the
world's top user, and ahead of the jobs report which is expected
to show employment expanded for a second straight month in
November.
 Non-farm payrolls are forecast to have risen 140,000, with
private hiring increasing by more than 100,000 for a fifth
straight month in November, according to a Reuters survey.
 The unemployment rate is forecast to have held steady at 9.6
percent.
 Such a positive reading would add further weight to the
notion the country's recovery is picking up pace, and follows
data showing the number of jobless benefits claimants hit a
two-year low last week.
 The PMI survey of business purchasing managers showed the
euro zone's service sector economy pulled ahead in November
thanks to strengthening German and French business, although
debt-burdened Ireland and Spain continued to lag behind.

 ISTANBUL, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet
Simsek said on Friday said the government should discuss
possible measures to curb portfolio inflows amid a steep rise in
asset prices in emerging markets.
 There were no plans at present to rein in such ""hot money""
inflows but the government does have a number of steps it could
take, including taxation, Simsek told CNBC-e in an interview.
 Investors have poured money into Turkish stocks, bonds and
the lira this year, seeking higher-yielding markets after
developed economies slashed interest rates.
 Governments in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand and other
emerging markets have directly or indirectly intervened in
recent months to keep their currencies from strengthening.
 ""The government should discuss 'hot money.' As a principle,
I am someone who believes we can't just be observers to
portfolio inflows at this time,"" Simsek said.
 The central bank has stepped up purchases of foreign
exchange at weekly auctions, and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan
has said Turkey needs to build up its forex reserves.
 The central bank also raised both lira and forex reserve
requirements as part of an exit strategy from a policy to stem
the effects of the global financial crisis and drain excess
liquidity.
 Turkish exporters have said the lira's strength is hurting
manufacturing, the country's main driver of economic growth.
Analysts have said the currency looks overvalued.
 Simsek also said the government's 2010 budget deficit may be
below 44 billion lira ($29.6 billion). The government has
previously said it targets an end-year deficit of 44.2 billion
lira.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Friday,
hemmed in by option expiries, after reported central bank buying
of Portuguese and Irish debt in recent days soothed investor
nerves and helped the currency rebound from a 2-1/2 month low.
 The market's immediate focus moved to U.S. payrolls data
later in the day, with a surprisingly strong U.S. housing number
on Thrursday adding to budding optimism on the U.S. economy.
 The euro stood at $1.3205, little changed on the day and
well above a 2-1/2 month low of $1.2969 plumbed on Tuesday after
massive selling in euro zone periphery government bonds.
 Traders said the ECB bought Portuguese and Irish debt on
Thursday, easing investor panic over euro zone debt for now.
 Large euro/dollar option expiries at $1.3200 and $1.3250
were limiting moves, while the technical picture was helped by
the euro holding above its 200-day moving average at $1.3123.
 Some analysts said the euro's bounce could have further to
run, given the positioning in the market and thin liquidity.
 ""The euro has further room to correct to the upside as
strong ECB bond buying will support sentiment and speculative
positioning is short,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at
UBS in Zurich.
 ""It can move up to $1.3400/$1.3450 but it remains a sell on
rallies - the overall trend is still down,"" he said.
 Sentiment towards the smaller euro zone states remained
precariously balanced after Standard and Poor's warned on
Thursday it may downgrade Greece in three months.
 The euro's 100-day moving average, at around $1.3327, was
seen as the next resistance level. More important resistance
lurked in the $1.3334-64 area, its August peak and a 38.2
percent retracement of its June-November rally.
 The sharp fall in the yields on Spanish, Portuguese and
other countries' bonds offset initial disappointment after ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet did not explicitly commit the bank
to ramping up bond buying.
 As widely expected, the ECB extended nonstandard provisions,
committing to provide unlimited one-week, one-month and
three-month funding for vulnerable banks until at least April.
 
 PAYROLLS
 Traders were looking to the U.S. jobs data, due at 1330 GMT,
which is expected to show an increase of 140,000 jobs last
month, according to a Reuters survey.
 Although data on Thursday showed initial jobless claims rose
more than expected, anecdotal evidence of strong holiday sales
and a surprise jump in the house sales index on Thursday boosted
investor risk appetite.
 ""The impact of today's U.S. payrolls report on risk appetite
is likely to be the key determinant of the dollar's response.
Since the trend has been towards stronger data flow in the U.S.,
a weak report is likely to represent a bigger shock to the
market than strength,"" said Citibank analysts in a note to
clients. 
 Some traders said a strong jobs figure was likely to
encourage more risk appetite, which could help the euro.
 But others said it the dollar could benefit from a strong
number this time given the perception that the U.S. growth
outlook is much more positive than that of the euro zone.
 The dollar changed hands at 83.68 yen, down 0.1 percent from
late U.S. levels and off Monday's two-month high of 84.41 yen.
Strong support was seen at the top end of the pair's Ichimoku
cloud at around 83.18.

 * FACTORS TO WATCH: 
 The key indicator to watch in China's suite of November
data
is consumer price inflation, the most important predictor of
monetary policy at this juncture in the economic cycle.	
 All 36 economists polled by Reuters believe that consumer
inflation in November was at least level with the
25-month-high of 4.4 percent in the year to October and most
likely edged up.	
 The higher the number, the more expectations will mount of
additional monetary tightening.	
 
 * MARKET IMPACT:	
 A stronger-than-expected rise in CPI -- for example, above
the 5 percent threshold -- may trigger selling in the Chinese
stock market on tightening fears. 
 But a strong rise could also encourage residents to
transfer
more money from their bank accounts to investment channels from
property to precious metals as a way to manage the negative
real
interest rates.	
 Strong industrial production and investment figures would
provide a reminder about China's economic health, welcome
reassurance for international commodity investors and other
Asian countries that look to the world's second-largest
economy as a principal source of demand.

 LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - European shares were little
changed in early trade ahead of the release of fresh U.S. jobs
data later on Friday, while the euro also paused for breath
after bouncing from a 2-1/2 month low.
 Traders were unwilling to take big positions in either asset
class ahead of the much-watched payrolls data, and were seeking
further evidence about the extent of European Central Bank bond
buying, which had fuelled markets in the previous session.
 Bund futures  opened flat, with traders waiting to
see if the ECB buys bonds in any size, in spite of the bank's
president, Jean-Claude Trichet, refusing to respond to market
speculation that it would mount a much more aggressive
bond-buying programme. [GVD/EUR]
 ""It's really all about what the ECB does today. The ECB
really are the only buyer,"" a trader said.
 After previously rallying on talk of the ECB bond buying, in
the hope it would help shore up confidence in the euro zone
periphery, the single currency was steady in early trade on
Friday, hovering around a key technical resistance level.
 The euro  was trading at $1.3236 at 0850 GMT, above a
2-1/2 month low hit on Tuesday and just below its 100-day moving
average and below key resistance at $1.3334-64, its August peak
and a 38.2 percent retracement of the June-November rally.
 ""I suspect the euro has bottomed out in the near term and
will test $1.33-34,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage
house.
 The benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> share index opened
marginally higher, after closing the previous session at a
two-week high, a move that could be extended if the U.S. jobs
data is positive, London-based Justin Urquhart Stewart, director

 ""There's a positive tone to the market, despite all the

the Nikkei <.N225>, mostly on buying in technology shares.
 
 JOBS IN FOCUS
 Oil was steady near 25-month highs following a slew of
upbeat U.S. economic data that boded well for demand from the
world's top user, and ahead of the jobs report which is expected
to show employment expanded for a second straight month in
November. [O/R]
 Nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have risen 140,000, with
private hiring increasing by more than 100,000 for a fifth
straight month in November, according to a Reuters survey.
 The unemployment rate is forecast to have held steady at 9.6
percent. [ID:nN02238002]
 Such a positive reading would add further weight to the
notion the country's recovery is picking up pace, and follows

782,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2010 03:28AM ET</span>",Q+A-Is China's $1.5 trillion investment plan be money well spent?," BEIJING, Dec 3 (Reuters) - China is working on plans to
spur up to $1.5 trillion of investment over five years in
seven strategic industries, from alternative energy to
biotechnology. 
 For the story, please see: [ID:nL3E6N221U] 
 Here are some questions and answers about the economic
implications of the plans: 
 
 WHY WOULD CHINA DO THIS? 
 The vast spending programme would be integral to the
government's ambition to turn China into a top maker of
high-tech, environmentally friendly products and move it away
from its current focus on cheap manufactured goods and
energy-intensive, polluting factories. 
 Beijing has made no secret of this goal. Since last year,
the government has talked about promoting strategic industries
to lay a foundation for the next phase of economic development. 
 
 In September, the State Council, China's cabinet, named
the seven industries, and said it would encourage banks and
private investors to finance their growth. It reaffirmed this
in October in its five-year plan for 2011-2015, a key policy
blueprint. 
 A large-scale investment plan would focus the minds of
officials and businesses and ensure that the powerful
machinery of the state-owned banking system is geared towards
the government's strategic objectives. 
 
 CAN CHINA AFFORD SUCH INVESTMENT? 
 At 2 trillion yuan ($300 billion) a year, the investment
in the strategic industries would consume nearly a quarter of
the central government's budget. 
 But Beijing won't put up so much cash itself. Rather, it
will marshal financial support from all corners of the
economy: from local governments, banks, firms and private
investors. 
 The stimulus plan launched in 2008 to counter the global
financial crisis offers a rough model. Of the headline 4
trillion yuan total, the central government only directly
delivered 30 percent. 
 Once all of these players are on board, China's spending
power is greatly magnified. Viewed on an economy-wide basis,
the annual spending on the strategic industries would
represent about 5 percent of gross domestic product. That
would be hefty but feasible. 
 
 WILL THE INVESTMENT BE WASTED? 
 Possibly. The seven target industries account for 2
percent of GDP now and the government has said that it wants
them to generate 8 percent of the total by 2015. 
 In other words, the government would be spending nearly 5
percent of GDP to get 6 percent of GDP -- a paltry rate of
return. 
 There is also scope for waste on a sector-specific level.
One focus is alternative energy, but the government has
already warned of overcapacity in equipment production for the
wind and solar power industries. 
 Nevertheless, the final investment figure might fall well
short of the 10 trillion yuan under discussion. And
double-counting could also inflate the total -- for example,
the government has already vowed to spend 5 trillion yuan on
new energy over the next decade.
WOULD IT BREACH WTO RULES?
The scale of these plans could certainly trigger a
volley of accusations that China is violating free-trade
agreements.
But the devil is in the details. Under the WTO's
non-discrimination provision and anti-subsidy law, China is
prohibited giving favourable treatment, including direct
subsidies, to domestic firms.
Beijing has a way of skirting this: since China's
banks are state-owned but presumed to operate on a commercial
basis, loans might not violate WTO regulations, said Wang
Jiangyu, a professor of law at the National University of
Singapore.

 * Markets unperturbed by signal of tighter policy to come
(Adds market reaction, quotes, details)	
 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Dec 3 (Reuters) - China will switch to a prudent
monetary policy from a moderately loose stance, the Communist
Party's top leaders decided on Friday, a change that could
pave the way for more interest rate increases and lending
controls.	
 At the same time, the Politburo elected to maintain
China's proactive fiscal policy, an indication that the
government wants to continue to ramp up investment spending
even while taking tightening steps to control inflation.	
 Chinese and global markets were little affected, with
investors taking the view that the new wording was an
affirmation of the gradual tightening that Beijing has already
started to implement in recent months.	
 But while the change in description of policy had been
discussed for several weeks by central bank advisers, the
Politburo's endorsement, reported by the official Xinhua news
agency, could still mark a decisive turning point.	
 ""It means that all sort of monetary policy tools to
control liquidity and to control inflation can now be used,""
said Ken Peng, an economist with Citigroup in Beijing.	
 ""In the past we've been clearly focusing on administrative
measures. Going forward we could be using more price
adjustments via interest rates,"" he said, adding that he
expected five rate increases by the end of next year.	
 China has raised interest rates just once this year as it
has guided its monetary policy back to normal from the
ultra-loose settings it adopted to counter the global
financial crisis. Instead, it has used quantitative tools to
do the heavy work, officially raising banks' reserve
requirements five times.	
 
 EXPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE 
 Along with playing a role in the fight against inflation,
policy tightening also signals confidence that the world's
second-largest economy is on solid ground, even as the U.S.
and European recoveries remain fragile.	
 ""China has no need now to worry about overall demand at
all,"" said Dong Xian'an, chief economist with Industrial
Securities in Beijing. ""Instead, the top priority is to curb
inflation and avoid economic overheating.""	
 ""The sooner China acts and the more forceful measures it
takes, the better,"" he said.	
 Consumer price inflation hit a 25-month high in October of
4.4 percent and is expected to have edged higher in November.
Although it has been driven almost exclusively by food prices,
pressures have been broadening on the back of higher global
commodity costs.	
 China's cabinet vowed last month to take ""forceful""
measures, including price controls if necessary, to rein in
inflation.	
 A major prong of the government's stimulus programme was a
flood of lending by banks. China has already begun to rein in
loan issuance this year and the shift to a prudent monetary
policy could signal more restrictions next year.	
 Wang Han, economist with advisory firm CEBM in Shanghai,
said a prudent policy could imply a new lending target of 6.5
trillion yuan, down about 15 percent from this year's total.

extended again if they fail to strike a deal, according to
Yonhap. 
 Autos and beef are the top issues that U.S. and Korean
officials are striving to iron out in negotiations in
Columbia, Maryland. 
 However, Kim implied that the talks were focused on autos. 
 ""Beef was not discussed,"" the Yonhap quoted Kim as saying.	
 The two countries signed a free trade agreement on June
30, 2007 but it has been stalled in the U.S. Congress because
of opposition from the U.S. auto industry. South Korean
barriers to U.S. beef have also delayed action.	
 The United States is asking South Korea to renegotiate the
auto terms of the agreement, something that is politically
difficult for Seoul with concessions in return.	
 The United States exported 7,663 cars and light trucks to
South Korea in 2009, while it imported 476,857 vehicles in
return, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures.	
 Ford Motor Co. and its supporters in Congress
complain the lopsided trade is due to South Korean tax and
regulatory barriers the free trade deal fails to adequately
address.

 * Euro may have bottomed out near-term
 * Some traders say strong U.S. jobs figure could boost dlr
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro's rebound from a 2-Â½
month low stalled on Friday, though it retained most gains made
after talk of European Central Bank buying of euro zone
periphery debt helped knock down those yields.
 The immediate focus of the market moved to U.S. payrolls
data later in the day, with a surprisingly strong U.S. housing
number adding to budding optimism on the U.S. economy.
 The euro nestled at $1.3220, little changed on the day and
floating well above a 2-Â½ month low of $1.2969 plumbed on
Tuesday in the wake of massive selling in euro zone periphery
government bonds.
 ""I suspect the euro has bottomed out in the near term and
will test $1.33-34,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage
house.
 Its 100-day moving average, at around $1.3327, is seen as
the next resistance level. More important resistance lurks in
the $1.3334-64 area, its August peak and a 38.2 percent
retracement of its June-November rally.
 Traders said the ECB was buying Portuguese and Irish debt on
Thursday, calming investor panic over euro zone debt for now,
helping the single currency.
 The sharp fall in the yields of Spanish, Portuguese and
other countries' bonds offset initial disappointment after ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet did not explicitly commit the bank
to ramping up bond buying.
 As widely expected, the ECB extended nonstandard provisions,
committing to provide unlimited one-week, one-month and
three-month funding for vulnerable banks until at least April.
 Traders are now looking to the U.S. jobs data, due at 1330
GMT, which is expected to show an increase of 140,000 jobs last
month, according to a Reuters survey.
 Although data on Thursday showed initial jobless claims rose
more than expected, anecdotal evidence of strong holiday sales
and a surprise jump in the house sales index on Thursday are
boosting investor risk appetite.
 Some traders said a strong U.S. jobs figure is likely to
encourage more risk appetite, which could help the euro.
 But others said it would likely be the U.S. dollar that
benefits from a strong number this time given the perception
that the growth outlook is much more positive for the United
States compared to the euro zone, whose debt woes are far from
solved.
 ""Many investors outside Europe, including Asian investors,
may still want to reduce euro zone government debt holdings,""
said another trader at a Japanese bank, noting that there has
been persistent selling in euro/yen in recent days.
 Euro/yen dipped 0.1 percent in early Friday to 110.58 yen.
Though it kept some distance from a 2-Â½ month low of 108.33
yen marked earlier in the week, it could face strong resistance
around 111.65 yen, where its 14-day and 90-day moving averages
are converging.
 The dollar changed hands at 83.72 yen, down 0.1 percent from
late U.S. levels and off Monday's two-month high of 84.41 yen.
Strong support is seen at the top end of the pair's ichimoku
cloud at around 83.18.
 While option triggers at 84.50 and 85.00 as well as offers
from Japanese exporters are seen hampering the dollar's advance,
if the payroll data boosts U.S. bond yields further, that could
help the dollar test those resistance levels, traders said.
 The 10-year U.S. bond yield rose above 3 percent on Thursday
on an improving U.S. economic outlook. Two Fed officials also
said on Thursday that the second bout of quantitative easing
that began last month is subject to regular review.
 The Australian dollar hovered at around $0.9765, flat on the
day and still up more than two percent from Wednesday's
two-month low of $0.9536.
 Its 55-day moving average, which comes in at around $0.9803,
could be seen as a possible target.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Friday
and stocks edged higher ahead of payroll data that could show
more evidence of a strengthening U.S. recovery and give
investors a reason to push more money into riskier assets.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European companies
rose 0.1 percent in early trade, echoing a slightly
firmer tone in Asia, but U.S. stock index futures 
slipped 0.2 percent.	
 The euro was largely unchanged against the dollar
after two days of gains, supported overnight by talk that the
European Central Bank of was buying bonds of peripheral
countries such as Ireland and Portugal.	
 With the euro holding at $1.3225 above its 200-day moving
average despite the euro zone fiscal crisis, investors ahead
of the U.S. payrolls report put cash to work in stock markets,
lifting Japan's Nikkei share average briefly to a 6-month
intraday high and propelling technology shares.	
 ""We expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) to report
that the employment situation improved further last month.
Indeed, the largest Census-adjusted job gain since April,
along with a dip in the jobless rate, should buoy consumers'
spirits and purchases during the holiday shopping season,""
Brian Jones, senior economist with Societe Generale in New
York, said in a note.	
 The Nikkei closed 0.1 percent higher , driven
mainly by buying of technology stocks such as Canon Inc, which
rose 1.5 percent .	
 Around the region, tech-related shares rallied, partly on
expectations for strong U.S. holiday sales. The Thomson
Reuters same-store sales index, based on 27 retailers
reporting, showed an increase of 6 percent for November, the
biggest increase since September 2006.	
 Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd
popped 3.2 percent to a 2-1/2-year high on trading
volume that was 3 times its 30-day average. 
 For a second day, the technology sector also outperformed
in the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
. The MSCI index was up 0.5 percent, while the
information technology index climbed 1.9 percent.	
 The broad index extended a 3.5 percent gain in the week,
exceeding the weekly returns of Japanese stocks for the first
time in three weeks.	
 
 MACRO OUTLOOK	
 The U.S. economy is forecast to have generated 140,000 new
jobs in November, with signs of a sustained recovery in
private sector hiring combined with solid auto sales and
continued industrial growth boding well for the macro outlook.
[ID:nN30116474][ID:nN02209260]	
 The improving U.S. economic picture has been a factor
lifting the entire U.S. government bond yield curve higher. 
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
edged down to 3 percent compared with a four-month high of
3.03 percent reached on Thursday. Since Monday, the yield has
risen 16 basis points, half of the entire rise since November.	
 Though the U.S. labour market report will be centre stage
on Friday, investors will also been watching for
follow-through on Thursday's unexpected narrowing in the
spread of higher risk European government bond yields over
German bond yields.	
 ""Many investors outside Europe, including Asian investors,
may still want to reduce euro zone government debt holdings,""
said another trader at a Japanese bank	
 Market chatter about the European Central Bank stepping
into the market to buy bonds in tranches of as much as 100
million euros of at-risk countries such Ireland and Portugal,
as reported by the Financial Times, caused the Ireland/Germany
10-year yield spread to narrow to 590 basis points, the least
in two weeks.	
 The Portugal/Germany 10-year yield spread was at 352 basis
points, the narrowest since Oct 28.

 * South Korea is America's seventh-largest trading partner
(Updates with talks continuing)
 By Doug Palmer
 COLUMBIA, Maryland, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The United States and
South Korea were continuing high-stakes talks into the night on
Thursday in the hopes of resolving auto and beef issues that
have blocked approval of a free trade pact for three years.
 Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade
Representative's office, would not comment on the possibility
the talks would be extended into a fourth day on Friday. Nor
would she say whether a deal was imminent.
 South Korean Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon told reporters
before heading into an afternoon session that the two sides
were still ""far away"" from an agreement.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk seemed to offer a more
upbeat assessment, telling reporters ""things are good"" when
asked how the talks are going. He did not elaborate.
 Although Kim has said both sides are committed to getting a
deal this week, U.S. officials have said their main goal is to
make progress on the outstanding issues.
 Negotiators failed to meet a self-imposed deadline last
month to solve the problems.
 South Korea is the United States' seventh-largest trading
partner and eighth-largest export market. Last year, the United
States exported $28.6 billion worth of goods to South Korea and
imported $39.2 billion of products from that country.
 The two countries signed a free trade agreement on June 30,
2007, but it has been stuck in the U.S. Congress because of
opposition from the U.S. auto industry. South Korean barriers
to U.S. beef have also delayed action.
 The United States is asking South Korea to renegotiate the
auto terms of the agreement, something that is politically
difficult for Seoul to do without getting concessions of equal
weight from Washington in return.
 The United States exported 7,663 cars and light trucks to
South Korea in 2009 while it imported 476,857 from automakers
there, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures.
 Ford Motor Co and its supporters in Congress complain the
lopsided trade is due to South Korean tax and regulatory
barriers the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) fails to
adequately address.
 ""STRONGEST MARKET-OPENING PROVISIONS""
 Karan Bhatia, a former deputy U.S. trade representative,
defended the agreement he helped negotiate while serving in the
administration of George W. Bush.
 ""This is probably the strongest FTA (free trade agreement)
with the strongest market-opening provisions that have ever
existed in an FTA. That's true with respect to services. That's
true with respect to agriculture and that's true also with
respect to manufacturing,"" Bhatia said.
 ""The notion that we might not get that benefit because we
are trying to satisfy one auto company -- I just think that
would be tragic.""
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus also wants
Seoul to commit to a process for fully reopening its market to
U.S. beef exports, another politically difficult demand because
of strong South Korean public opposition.
 U.S. beef exporters have already recovered much of their
lost market share in South Korea under a voluntary industry
agreement to address lingering concerns about several cases of
mad cow disease found in the U.S. cattle herd as far back as
December 2003.
 Much of the beef industry is eager to have the pact
approved because it phases out a 40-percent South Korean tariff
on U.S. beef and because a major competitor, Australia, is
negotiating its own free trade pact with South Korea.
 U.S. officials have declined to say if the United States is
willing to make concessions on its side to compensate South
Korea for changing the terms of the deal the two countries
signed in 2007 after a year of negotiation.
 The deal would be the second-largest U.S. free trade
agreement after the North American Free Trade Agreement with
Canada and Mexico. Supporters also see it as linchpin of U.S.
economic engagement in the fast-growing Asian region.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday and global stocks rallied as talk that
the European Central Bank had increased its buying of sovereign
debt and recent upbeat economic data lifted sentiment.
 Wall Street posted its biggest two-day gain since September
and crude oil ended the session at its highest level in 25
months as concerns about the European debt crisis eased and a
weaker dollar prompted investors to buy riskier assets.
 Investors also cheered upbeat U.S. data on retail sales and
housing, the latest signs that the recovery was in fuller
swing. Copper notched its largest three-day gain since July.
 Disappointment that ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet did
not announce a more aggressive policy response to ease the debt
crisis initially weakened stocks and the euro. But traders said
the ECB was buying Portuguese and Irish debt at a modestly
higher rate than of late, bolstering sentiment.
 U.S. gold futures were on the verge of breaking above
$1,400 an ounce, but safe-haven buying faded after the ECB
offered a liquidity safety net for vulnerable banks and the
U.S. data pointed to an improving economy.
 Bank stocks led the rally on Wall Street after Goldman
Sachs said improving economic conditions will favor that
sector. For details, see [ID:nN02228894]
 The KBW bank index <.BKX> shot up 3.9 percent. The S&P 500
financial index <.GSPF> rose 2.6 percent, making it the largest
gainer among S&P sectors. The S&P 500 retail index <.RLX> rose
1.8 percent.
 ""The fears had been centered on Europe. That seems to have
stabilized,"" said Mark Bronzo, portfolio manager at Rydex-SGI

international growth will look like. People are betting that
growth will be better than people had feared.""

 Stocks in Tokyo were poised to open slightly lower, with
the December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the
Nikkei 225 <0#NK:> off 5 points at 10,315.
 With the ECB's meeting concluded, traders shifted their
focus to U.S. labor market data due on Friday. The government
is expected to report that nonfarm payrolls rose 140,000 last
month, according to a Reuters survey.
 Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York, said there does not seem to be
any reason not to look for a relatively robust jobs report.
 The string of data for the past several weeks has been not
only better than expected but also suggested some modest
acceleration of the U.S. economy, he wrote.
 ""There is some risk that the work week and hourly earnings,
important elements of the report, may not show the same
improvement as the job creation, but on balance a strong U.S.
jobs report is likely,"" Chandler said.
 Oil prices rose in anticipation of strong demand ahead.
 U.S. crude for January delivery  settled up $1.25, or
1.44 percent, at $88 a barrel, the highest since October 2008.
 In London, ICE January Brent crude  ended $1.82

 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, with benchmark yields

U.S. jobs report on Friday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 9/32 in price to yield a hair under 3.0 percent.
 ""The market is recalibrating itself for a higher level of

804,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2010 05:16PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Will debt spotlight shift from Europe to U.S.?," By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Already rattled by Europe's
debt crisis, nervous bond investors may take aim at the United
States next year, especially if political bickering frustrates
efforts to cut the U.S. budget deficit and hold down national
debt.
 The United States has unique advantages, including the
world's reserve currency and the ability to print it.
 But Europe's problems have investors reconsidering whether
lending to developed countries is always a risk-free endeavor.
Citigroup's chief economist said this week the euro zone
turmoil may be the ""opening act"" of a debt crisis that could
even infect the United States and Japan, while a top Federal
Reserve official said it was ""a wake-up call"" for America.
 In that environment, U.S. ailments -- a rising ratio of
debt-to-gross domestic product, one of the highest peacetime
budget deficits, strapped state governments, and banks that
many fear are still ""too big to fail"" -- make investors
queasy.
 While the prospect of U.S. default is remote, that doesn't
mean the United States will always be able to borrow money at
less than 3 percent for 10 years, as it can today.
 ""Americans are kind of sleeping at the switch,"" said Joseph
Quinlan, chief market strategist at US Trust and author of ""The
Last Economic Superpower."" ""Markets want to see we're serious
about tackling deficits. We should never be so complacent as to
think the market won't impose discipline on us.""
 AVOIDING SOVEREIGN
 Higher borrowing costs haven't been a problem for the
United States in recent years. Since the onset of the financial
crisis in 2007, yields across the curve have trended lower as
investors took refuge in Treasuries, seen as safer than other
assets in times of crisis.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to a
five-decade low in 2008 near 2 percent and has since not
climbed above 4 percent even as U.S. debt levels rose.
 Ireland, by contrast, must pay nearly 9 percent to borrow
money for 10 years, while Greece pays 12 percent.
 But if market anxiety about sovereign debt in general
continues to grow, some investors are bracing for U.S. yields
to rise next year. That could complicate efforts by policy
makers to boost a struggling economy, lifting mortgage rates
and interest payments on outstanding public debt, which at $9.3
trillion is more than 60 percent of gross domestic product.
 The Federal Reserve said last month it would buy $600
billion of Treasuries by the middle of 2011 to push long-term
rates down.
 And while lawmakers and policy officials have started to
focus more on deficit reduction, suggestions for slashing the
$1.3 trillion budget deficit from a bipartisan presidential
commission have provoked strong criticism from left and right.
 ""I think markets will lose patience with gridlock,"" said
Quinlan. ""The market will sense it and you'll see a lot of
volatility.""
 Some say the U.S. situation is not quite on par with the
crisis in Ireland, which this week needed an emergency EU
bailout to shore up its banks and slow a run on its debt. But
some investors say it's enough to make buying Treasuries
risky.
 ""Our positioning has been to move away from sovereign debt""
of all kinds, said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist
at Standard Life Investments, who said she prefers corporate
bonds, equities and real estate outside the United States.
 ""The mantra we have is one of sustainable yield. We're
fairly indifferent as to where we get it, but it has to be
sustainable,"" she said. ""That's not really what you're getting
from sovereign debt markets at the moment.""
 While Standard Life has on a $1.5 billion short euro/long
dollar position in its $9.5 billion Global Absolute Return
Strategies portfolio, Hudson said, ""It's less a positive call
on the dollar than a negative one on the euro.""
 Hudson warned U.S. growth could hit snags, particularly if
U.S. states require assistance from Washington similar to what
Ireland and Greece have received from Brussels and Frankfurt.
 GROWING OUT OF TROUBLE
 The United States still has some things going for it, such
as its ability to grow its way out of crisis.
 Recent economic data has suggested aggressive federal
spending and the Fed's stimulative policies that have ballooned
U.S. deficits may also be helping the economy gain traction, at
long last, after the worst downturn since the 1930s.
 Tony Crescenzi, a portfolio manager at Pimco, the world's
largest bond fund, said absent no new spending initiatives, a
2.5 percent to 3 percent U.S. growth rate in 2011 should chip
away at the deficit, increase tax revenues and allow the
economy to ""muddle through.""
 While it won't address longer-term issues like entitlement
spending, he said the expected growth illustrates the
differences with Ireland or Greece, which investors fear won't
grow enough to service or redeem outstanding debt or withstand
planned spending cuts.
 According to the latest Reuters poll, the U.S. economy is
seen growing at a 2.7 percent rate next year, up from 2.4
percent in 2010. [ID:USGDP]
 Richard Bernstein, chief executive at Richard Bernstein
Advisors, said he is bullish on the U.S. economy, stocks and
the dollar, and he called the euro zone panic and worries about
U.S. public finances ""vastly over-dramatized.""
 He said firmer U.S. growth will relieve pressure to tighten
fiscal policies too aggressively and may even allow the Fed to
scale back its planned bond purchases.
 ""Long-term U.S. interest rates are likely to rise next year
simply because the economy is stronger than people think,"" he
said. ""It's not because people fear the United States is
turning into Argentina or Ireland or Greece.""
 The dollar also remains the world's reserve currency, with
no obvious alternatives for central banks and private investors
to park their money.
 But as the last few years have illustrated, market
expectations and long-held maxims can change very quickly.
 Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund and a professor at the MIT Sloan
School of Management, said he fears another U.S. downturn could

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday on
market talk the European Central Bank was buying bonds, but
lingering concerns about the outlook for peripheral euro zone
countries should continue to put pressure on the currency.
 With the ECB's meeting concluded, the focus in markets
shifted to U.S. data due on Friday on the labor market. The
government is expected to report that nonfarm payrolls rose
140,000 last month, according to a Reuters survey.
 Traders said the ECB was buying Portuguese and Irish debt,
but there was disappointment ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
did not announce a more aggressive policy response to the euro
zone debt crisis.
 The premium that investors demanded to buy Portuguese and
Irish debt over German benchmarks fell on Thursday, with
traders saying the ECB had been buying the two countries'
bonds.. That caused the euro to recover from losses triggered
after Trichet spoke.
 Most analysts said the euro's 2-1/2 month low hit earlier
this week would act as a strong support level for now. Traders
are looking at the euro's 100-day moving average at $1.3325 as
the next resistance level.
 ""Euro/dollar was overdone to the topside on quantitative
easing part 2 and went overdone on the downside on fears of an
imminent euro zone crisis. I think we have come back to the
euro's fundamental valuation, which in our view, is actually
$1.32-$1.33,"" said Bob Sinche, global head of currency strategy
at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Sinche said he wouldn't be surprised if the euro ends the
week ""somewhere north of the 200-day moving average and
somewhere south of the 100-day moving average"" depending on the
the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday.
 In late New York trading, the euro was up 0.6 percent at
$1.3223, with session lows at $1.3060. Traders cited stops
right above $1.3225.
 The ECB extended nonstandard provisions, committing to
provide unlimited one-week, one-month and three-month funding
for vulnerable banks until at least April, a move viewed by the
market as too soft.
 JOBS DATA SEEN STRONG
 A stronger-than-expected gain in payrolls should bode well
for the dollar.
 Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York, said there does not seem to be
any reason not to look for a relatively robust jobs report.
 The string of data for the past several weeks has been not
only better than expected but also suggested some modest
acceleration of the U.S. economy, he wrote.
 ""There is some risk that the work week and hourly earnings,
important elements of the report, may not show the same
improvement as the job creation, but on balance a strong U.S.
jobs report is likely,"" he said.
 SOME UNSURPRISED BY ECB
 The ECB has been under pressure to soothe markets after a
bailout plan for Ireland stoked speculation other euro zone
nations struggling to repay debts may also seek help from the
European community.
 But some analysts were not surprised the ECB did not
announce any new bond buying program as many members of the
bank have opposed such action.
 ""So unless the now highly politicized situation is
resolved, the euro is likely to continue to be under pressure
in the near term,"" said Aston Chan, portfolio manager at global
macro hedge fund GLC in London. GLC has assets under management
of around $1.2 billion.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent against the yen at 83.85,
weighed down earlier by a rise in the latest U.S. weekly
jobless claims.

 TORONTO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar climbed more
than a penny against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday, peaking
near a three-week high and outperforming the rest of the major
currencies on the back of a broad risk rally.
 The Canadian dollar  hit a session high of C$1.0028
against the greenback, or 99.72 U.S. cents, its highest level
since Nov. 12.
 With no Canadian economic data to move on, direction was
largely driven by global markets as stocks and commodity prices
rallied, due in part to upbeat U.S. housing and retail data.
[ID:nN02209260]
 ""The Canadian dollar is just on a tear,"" said David Tulk,
senior macro strategist at TD Securities.
 The strength of the currency was supported by crude oil
futures that ended at their highest level in 25 months and by
gold's push to nearly $1,400 an ounce. [O/R] [GOL/]
 ""But, generally, we're looking at a fairly positive risk-on
day and the Canadian currency is viewed as a risk play as part
of the commodity basket,"" Tulk said
 The euro rebounded against the U.S. dollar on further
evidence of economic recovery in Europe and the United States.
Traders also cited European Central Bank buying of Portuguese
and Irish bonds. [FRX/]
 ""It's very much a flow driven story,"" said Sacha Tihayni, a
currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 ""Everything is going in the same direction today against
the U.S. dollar so that provides the pretext for Canadian
dollar strength.""
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0039 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.61 U.S. cents, up
sharply from C$1.0170 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.33 U.S. cents,
at Wednesday's close.
 The currency is expected to be fairly rangebound and remain
close to current levels near parity with the U.S. dollar over
the next 12 months, according to a Reuters poll released on
Thursday. [ID:nN02224928]
 Tihanyi said parity represented a significant support level
for the U.S. dollar on Thursday.
 The Canadian dollar's upside may be challenged ahead of
Friday's release of the Canadian November jobs report, which is
expected to show a modest gain. [ID:nN26125524]
 It will be the last major piece of data to consider before
the Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision on Dec. 7. The
U.S. jobs report is also due.
 In another poll released on Thursday, primary dealers and
global forecasters surveyed by Reuters said unanimously they
expected the Bank of Canada to keep interest rates on hold next
week, but the uneven economic recovery left them divided on the
timing of rate hikes in 2011. [ID:nN02264459]
 Canadian government bond prices fell amid the risk-on theme
of the day, tracking U.S. Treasuries lower after perceived
hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President
Charles Bullard. [US/]
 The two-year government of Canada bond  was off 3
Canadian cents to yield 1.690 percent, while the 10-year bond
 was down 25 Canadian cents to yield 3.208 percent.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday and global stocks gained amid a recent
raft of upbeat economic data and on speculation the European
Central Bank had boosted its buying of sovereign debt.
 Investors were disappointed by the lack of a more
aggressive policy response by the ECB to the debt crisis after
its monthly meeting, but the euro  rose on reports the
bank was buying Portuguese and Irish debt.
 Traders reported ECB purchases triggered a drop in the
premium investors demand to buy Portuguese and Irish bonds over
German benchmarks. They said the ECB had been buying the two
countries' debt at a modestly higher rate recently. [GVD/EUR]
[ID:nLDE6B10I4]
 President Jean-Claude Trichet said the ECB decided to
conduct three-month liquidity operations in January, February
and March ""with full allotment."" Until recently the central
bank had been expected to phase out unlimited liquidity
measures.
 The ECB kept interest rates on hold at 1.0 percent as
expected and extended its liquidity safety net for vulnerable
euro zone banks, promising to provide unlimited weekly, monthly
and three-month funding until at least April.
 European equities hit a two-week closing high after falling
on news of weaker-than-expected U.S. jobless claims data.
Analysts stayed positive on the equity market's outlook.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
finished up 1.6 percent at 1,106.18 points, its highest close
since Nov. 18.
 The ECB ""basically said we will do what it takes and while
you can never know what a band-aid will look like at any point
in time, I think the overall theme is that those band-aids will
be found,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for
fundamental equities at BlackRock Inc .
 Data for pending U.S. home sales showed an unexpected jump
in October and higher-than-expected sales by U.S. retailers in
November boosted investor sentiment.
 Also, Goldman Sachs Group Inc  said U.S. banks are on
stronger footing due to an improving economy, higher equity
prices and a favorable interest rate environment.
[ID:nSGE6B109L]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 101.90
points, or 0.91 percent, at 11,357.68. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 13.40 points, or 1.11 percent, at
1,219.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 24.38
points, or 0.96 percent, at 2,573.81.
 Some analysts said Trichet's comment that he never said
what the limit was of the ECB's bond-buying program also helped
the euro bounce off session lows around $1.3060.
 The euro  was up 0.59 percent at $1.3219, while the
dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.65 percent at 80.187.
 Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said Trichet's comments suggest the option
of further bond purchases ""is not necessarily off the table at
all.""
 Bond prices trimmed losses to trade close to break-even.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was flat
at 2.96 percent.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  gained 75 cents to $87.50
a barrel, while spot gold prices  rose $9.71 to $1,396.40

 NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro gained in volatile
trading on Thursday, boosted by reports the ECB was buying
bonds, but uncertainty over the outlook for peripheral euro
zone countries should keep the currency under pressure.
 Reports the European Central Bank was buying Portuguese and
Irish debt followed investor disappointment ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet did not announce a more aggressive policy

 While the euro's fundamentals have remained the same
post-Trichet, most analysts said the common currency's 2-1/2

 PREVIOUS BOND BUYING
 The euro rallied, however, on talk the ECB bought
peripheral bonds. Market sources suggested the bank purchased
more bonds than they did all of last week. The ECB had bought
1.348 billion euros in euro zone bonds last week, with total
purchases at 67 billion euros since May, when the bond-buying
program was launched.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 0.6 percent at
$1.3224, with session lows at $1.3060 in the wake of Trichet's

 The ECB has been under pressure to soothe market sentiment
after a bailout plan announced for Ireland last month stoked
speculation that other euro zone nations struggling to repay
their debts may also seek help from the European community.
 The dollar was down 0.6 percent against the yen at 84.20 ,
earlier weighed down by a rise in the latest U.S. weekly
jobless claims. Robust U.S. data and higher U.S. bond yields
have been supportive of the greenback of late.

 * Urges EU voting reform to shield EU against pressure
 * Voting reform could be decided by this year
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Some governments threaten EU
member states with retaliation unless they back their trade
interests inside the bloc, weakening the EU's defences against
unfair competition, the bloc's trade chief has said.
 The statement was made in a confidential letter to a
minister of an EU country, seen by Reuters on Thursday.
 ""Exports to or investment in the third country are
threatened with retaliation if the member state does not oppose
(import barriers that would harm the third country),"" EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht wrote in September.
 De Gucht's warning has stoked debate about reforming EU
voting on trade policy to give more power to Europe's central
institutions and less to EU capitals.
 EU lawmakers and government officials are discussing the
reform this week and may agree on it this month.
 De Gucht and the reform's advocates -- among them Europe's
largest industrial sectors -- say reform is crucial to tempering
the power of foreign trading nations to lean on small EU states
to influence EU import duties.
 ""The situation is clearly undesirable both in terms of the
effect on member state exports and investment in third countries
and in terms of the distortions it brings to EU decision-making
on trade defence measures,"" the letter said.
 Greater centralisation of power over the setting of EU
import duties ""would make member states and their exports and
investors far less vulnerable to direct and indirect lobbying"".
 
 ""LIKE CLOCKWORK""
 Reeling from economic crisis, the EU has increased import
duties on a slew of products from low-cost exporters, above all
China, leading to regular official rebukes from the EU's trade
partners but few direct measures of retaliation.
 But people familiar with the issue say that behind closed
doors, Europe's trade partners regularly lean on individual
member states to oppose rises in duties.
 ""This is not something that happens once or twice, it
happens all the time. It's almost like clockwork. Licenses get
revoked, imports are delayed, exports are delayed. It makes (EU)
member states nervous,"" said one.
 Current EU law gives each European state one vote to decide
duty increases. Cast during closed-door meetings, the vote
outcomes -- decided on a simple majority principle -- are
watched closely by foreign exporters affected by the tariffs.
 Votes rejecting duties -- whether or not under foreign
pressure -- have resulted in downward adjustments of Europe's
defensive duties, or strict time limits being set.
 Drafts of the voting reform seen by Reuters would largely
eradicate the one-country-one-vote system despite capitals'
opposition and hand more power to the Commission. 
 ""Eventually we will have rules in place that will help close
the door on this sort of pressure,"" said Adrian van den Hoven,
Director for International Affairs at BusinessEurope, Europe's
largest employers' group. 
 ""De Gucht has a point. Many third countries defend their
economic interests, and put pressure on member states with
threats of retaliation.

 * Markets worry over haircuts on senior bank debt
 * Senior bank debt no longer seen as risk-free
 * Funding costs for banks to rise
 
 By Douwe Miedema and Alex Chambers
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Hints from European politicians
that there could be greater risk in lending to banks in the
future will raise the cost of funding for those deemed
trustworthy and shut out the weak completely.
 The 85 billion euro ($111.3 billion) bail-out of Ireland and
its banks seemed to confirm a widely held market belief before
the crisis: no country will ever allow a bank to go bust, making
senior bank debt almost as safe as government bonds.
 But European Union plans for new rules, in 2013, on how to
deal with sovereign crises have done away with the notion that
banks are always tacitly backed by governments, and may lead to
a permanent rise in their cost of capital.
 ""It will be a very uncomfortable process. If you bought bank
bonds five years ago, thinking it was pretty certain (you'd) be
made whole by a government, that's maybe now changed,"" said Mike
Harrison, an analyst at Barclays Capital.
 ""Bank debt could be becoming more (like) non-financial
corporate debt, and so you price that accordingly.""
 In the years leading up to the crisis, investors charged
banks as little as 0.3 percentage points more than governments
pay, Barclays Capital data shows. At the height of the crisis,
the difference had soared to 5.3 percentage points.
 The spreads have roughly halved from that peak, but the new
risks mean they are unlikely to return to their pre-crisis
levels anytime soon, if ever at all.
 Investors will charge the weakest banks more for borrowing,
just at a time that regulators are telling them to hold more
capital for every dollar they lend, and to shed some of their
most lucrative but also riskiest businesses.
 Next year will see heavy refinancing requirements from most
banks, with a total of $340 billion in senior debt and 74.4
billion of government-backed bonds maturing throughout the year,
according to data from JP Morgan.
 
 BAIL-OUT, BAIL-IN
 Fears that Brussels would force holders of senior bank debt
to share the burden of Ireland's bail-out had rocked markets in
the days leading up to the rescue package, designed to stem a
crisis rooting in the country's banking system.
 They recovered slightly when Finance Minister Brian Lenihan
said the package was granted only on the explicit condition that
taxpayers were to foot the entire bill, leaving investors in
senior bank notes off the hook.
 Forcing losses on the debt -- considered the safest because
investors get paid out first in case of a default -- would have
caused a market rout similar to the one after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers, people in the market said.
 But the threat remains.
 Europe's so-called European Stability Mechanism to deal with
future crisis, planned to come into force in mid-2013, will
include ""private sector involvement"", the exact form of which
will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
 The package is designed for governments in trouble, not
banks. But markets no longer clearly distinguish between the
two, given the large government involvement in the banking
sector in Europe since the start of the crisis.
 ""The crisis resolution package clearly points to increased
likelihood of both sovereign (and) senior bank debt bail-ins and
haircuts in future,"" brokerage Execution Noble said in a note.
""We remain Underweight the European banks.""
 Depressed prices on subordinated debt, which regulators have
insisted must take a hit when banks are bailed out, shows the
market is fearful of additional bank failures.
 Perpetual hybrid Tier 1 from Portugal's BCP and BES for
instance, are trading at a whopping 1,300 and 1,200 bps over the
risk-free rate respectively.
 This year's stress tests proved most European banks had
adequate capital, but the real problem is funding. With
investors remaining reluctant to lend, the European Central Bank
remains a crucial life support.
 Investors are already gearing up for more change.
 ""No-one likes retroactive changes to the rules but they do
happen and we get used to it, said Nigel Sillis, director of
fixed income and currency research at Baring Asset Management.
 ""The most concerned parties are buy-and-hold investors with
a lot in their bank book, like insurance companies. For the
hot-money investors and more tactical asset manager, it's
something we'll get over in a quarter or two.""

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded
against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and global stocks gained as
traders cited European Central Bank buying of Portuguese and
Irish bonds as well as further evidence of economic recovery in
Europe and the U.S.
 Hopes that the ECB would anounce new anti-crisis measures
had helped lift both the euro  and global stock markets
on Wednesday.
 The ECB kept interest rates on hold at 1.0 percent as
expected and extended its liquidity safety net for vulnerable
euro zone banks, promising to provide unlimited weekly, monthly
and three-month funding until at least April.
 ECB president Jean Claude Trichet did not announce an
expansion of its bond buying, but traders reported ECB bond
purchases that triggered a drop in the premium investors demand
to buy Portuguese and Irish debt over German benchmarks.
[ID:nLDE6B10I4]
 Some analysts said Trichet's comment that he never said
what the limit of the bond buying program was also helped the
euro bounce off session lows around $1.3060.
 Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said Trichet's comments suggest the option
of further bond purchases ""is not necessarily off the table at
all.""
 Pressure had grown on the ECB to act since last weekend's
85 billion euro ($110.7 billion) rescue of Ireland by the
European Union and International Monetary Fund failed to dispel
fears that other eurozone countries could require a bailout.
[ID:nLDE6B018F]
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.6 percent at 1,095.42 points mid-morning after the ECB
decision and after the GDP for the July-September period in the
16-nation euro zone was reported up 0.4 percent and up 1.9
percent year-on-year.
 U.S. stocks extended gains on Thursday after data showed
pending sales of existing homes unexpectedly surged in October
and on news of higher-than-expected sales by U.S. retailers in
November.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 69.85 points,
or 0.62 percent, to 11,325.63. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> added 8.54 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,214.61. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> advanced 15.87 points, or 0.62
percent, to 2,565.30.
 ""Retail sales are positive. Some of the numbers coming in
are really far above consensus, and that's a good thing,"" said
Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services
in Suffern, New York.
 The dollar, meanwhile, trimmed gains against the Japanese
yen after new claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose more
than expected last week. [ID:nN02201654]
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.22 percent at 80.537.
Against the yen, the dollar  was down 0.11 percent at
84.10.
 Bond prices were lower. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
note  was down 9/32 in price to yield just below 3.0
percent.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 15 cents to $86.60 a
barrel, while spot gold prices  rose 71 cents to
$1,387.40 an ounce.
 Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average hit a
five-month high, rising 1.8 percent <.N225> to the highest
close since June 22. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks
outside Japan was up 1.5 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>.

 NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose in volatile
trading on Thursday, boosted by reports the ECB was buying euro
zone bonds after its president Jean-Claude Trichet disappointed
investors by not announcing an aggressive bond-buying program.
 The common currency, however, should remain under pressure
due to uncertainty about the outlook for euro zone peripheral
countries given the debt crisis in the 16-member grouping.
 In tandem with the euro's rise, the premium that investors
demand to buy Portuguese and Irish debt over German benchmarks
fell on Thursday, with traders saying the European Central Bank
had been buying the two countries' bonds. That caused the euro
to recover from losses triggered after Trichet's remarks.
 ""We had been hearing talk that the ECB has been buying
peripheral bonds,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""As a result, we have
seen yields in those bonds fall and the euro rise.""
 Market participants had been expecting the ECB to unveil an
aggressive new bond buying program. Instead the ECB extended
nonstandard provisions, committing to provide unlimited
one-week, one-month and three-month funding for vulnerable euro
zone banks until at least April, a move viewed by the market as
too soft.
 ""People were geared up to hear about new extraordinary
measures. What they didn't want to see was any talk at all
about an exit strategy."" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex in New York.
 ""The market is starting to fear not only that they're not
doing anything to help the current crisis, but may actually be
exacerbating it. That caused the euro to dip lower.""
 In midmorning New York trading, the euro was up 0.3 percent
at $1.3187, with session lows at $1.3060 in the wake of
Trichet's remarks.
 Traders said hedge funds and other short-term players such
as commodity trading advisors earlier sold euros and bought the
dollar against the Swiss franc. The dollar, however, has now
fallen versus the franc to 0.9945 francs.
 EURO/DOLLAR SHORT-TERM BIAS NEUTRAL
 Overall, the intraday bias in euro/dollar remains neutral
for now as the currency consolidates from lows at $1.2969
earlier this week, traders said. Another rise cannot be ruled
out, according to ActionForex.com analysts, at the hourly
55-day exponential moving average around $1.3279. But they said
strong resistance is expected at $1.3447.
 Some analysts were not surprised the ECB is not engaging in
any new bond buying program as many members of the bank have
opposed any such action.
 ""So unless the now highly politicized situation is
resolved, the euro is likely to continue to be under pressure
in the near term, which is our expectation because a lack of
consensus in the ECB and EU would make credible and substantial
responses hard to come by,"" said Aston Chan, portfolio manager
at global macro hedge fund GLC in London. GLC has assets under
management of around $1.2 billion.
 The ECB has been under pressure to soothe market sentiment
after a bailout plan announced for Ireland last month stoked
speculation that other euro zone nations struggling to repay
their debts may also seek help from the European community.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent against the yen at 84.20
after a rise in the latest U.S. weekly jobless claims. Robust
U.S. data and higher U.S. bond yields have been supportive of
the greenback of late.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2010 10:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-LME sees dangers in EU financial regulation," * Fear that European regulation drive too political
 * Concern over UK representation in EU financial regulation
 * Commods cannot function freely without short selling
 
 (Combines previous stories, adds background)
 By Michael Taylor and Pratima Desai
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME)
warned on Thursday that the drive towards greater European
financial regulation lacks sufficient UK representation and
could become too political.
 LME Chief Executive Martin Abbott also told the UK
Parliament's Treasury Committee in London that short-selling is
essential to the functioning of commodities markets.
 France is lobbying for commodity markets to come under the
jurisdiction of the new European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA), a body due to open in January 2011.
 ""We have a concern about the level of UK representation on
ESMA, were ESMA in fact to become the dominant regulatory body,""
Abbott said.
 The UK, home to Europe's most liquid commodity markets as
well its biggest financial market, could be outvoted as a lone
voice on ESMA and is seen as having the most to lose from
overbearing regulation.
 ""The problem that we have, therefore, with the concept of
another layer or a different type of regulation coming from
Europe is that it will necessarily come from countries that have
no expertise in regulating our type of market,"" Abbott said.
 ""We're hopeful that the European regulators will recognise
where the areas of excellence are in the European regulatory
framework, and the area of excellence in commodity regulation is
here in London,"" he added.
 
 SHORT-SELLING 
 In September, the European Union unveiled a blueprint to
curb or ban short selling and tighten controls on derivatives --
including commodities -- in one of its most ambitious financial
reforms since the economic crisis unfolded.
 Market players take short positions in metals and other
commodity markets by selling material they do not own, on
expectations they can buy it back at a cheaper price at a later
date.
 ""It is not possible for commodity markets or for their
participants to function, without freely available short
selling,"" Abbott said. ""It is utterly essential to the commodity
markets."" 
 ""This is an area, not of semantic difference but of critical
difference,"" he added.
 The U.S. futures regulator, meanwhile, intends to unveil on
Dec. 16 its long-awaited revised plan to limit speculative
positions held by commodity traders.
 U.S. lawmakers are expected to pressure Europe to follow in
its footsteps by clamping down hard on speculation to prevent an
exodus of business from one region to another.
 Britain's financial regulator recently said it had received
a complaint over plans for physically backed base metal
exchange-traded products, reflecting fears these products could
tip a finely balanced copper market into deficit and distort
prices. 
 At the LME's annual dinner in mid-October, Abbott said that
large physical base metals positions held by ETPs could be
subject to the exchange's lending guidelines.
 These guidelines, designed to preserve an orderly market,
govern the cost at which metal must be lent or made available to
other market players by holders of dominant positions.

 * Putin spokesman says claims are ""ridiculous""

(Adds U.S. ambassador's blog comment)
 By Guy Faulconbridge
 MOSCOW, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin rules Russia by
allowing a venal elite of corrupt officials and crooked spies to
siphon off cash from the world's biggest energy producer,
according to a picture painted by leaked U.S. diplomatic cables.
 The stars of the U.S. Foreign Service cast ""alpha-dog"" Putin
as Russia's paramount leader, presiding over a system where
greed and oil money decide everything. Laws mean nothing.
 U.S. diplomats speculate about Putin's personal wealth and
repeat Moscow rumours that the former KGB spy has assets abroad
and links to Russia's lucrative oil export trade.
 Putin has denied amassing a vast fortune while president and
has dismissed speculation about his personal wealth as snot
smeared over paper.
 His spokesman on Thursday told Reuters the ""simply
ridiculous"" claims in the U.S. diplomatic cables were based on
unverified rumour.
 ""These are simply rumours, with neither facts nor arguments.
Simply nothing,"" Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said by
telephone. ""But if we suppose that these are genuine telegrams,
then one could only wonder that diplomats write such rubbish.""
 The U.S. cables present Russia as a ""corrupt autocracy""
where money has replaced Communism as the driving ideology for
the elite since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
 ""People are paying bribes all the way to the top,"" U.S.
Ambassador to Russia John Beyrle paraphrased an unidentified
source as saying in February 2010, in one of the cables
published on the website WikiLeaks.
http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2010/02/10MOSCOW317.html
 The source, whose name was obscured in the documents,
described a system in which the security services, police and
local politicians collected bribes in a well organised
protection racket that reached the top levels of the Kremlin.
 ""They need money to get to the top, but once they are there,
their positions become quite lucrative money making
opportunities,"" Beyrle's cable said.
 
 KREMLIN CORRUPTION?
 Western executives say the biggest barriers for business in
Russia are alarming levels of official corruption, mounds of red
tape and the arbitrary rule of law.
 Corruption, which plagued tsars and communist general
secretaries for centuries, blossomed as the Soviet Union
collapsed and is now a way of life for many Russians, from small
bribes paid to traffic police to multi-million dollar kickbacks
for officials who hold sway over the $1.2 trillion economy.
 But never before have U.S. assessments of Russia's giant
system of kick-backs been made so public at such a sensitive
time, just when President Barack Obama is battling to repair
better ties with the Kremlin.
 U.S. Ambassador Beyrle, in a cable to Washington from
November 2008, repeated rumours that Putin was linked with Swiss
based trader Gunvor.
http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/09/08MOSCOW2632.html
http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2008/11/08MOSCOW3380.html
 ""The company is rumoured to be one of Putin's sources of
undisclosed wealth,"" Beyrle wrote, citing oil traders. In
another cable of the same period, he said Putin was rumoured to
be an owner of Gunvor, though he gave no hard facts to back up
the claim.
 When asked about this statement, Putin spokesman Peskov
said: ""This is a completely stupid claim without any support.
These rumours have been aired repeatedly but they have been
repeatedly denied. It is rather ridiculous.""
 A Gunvor spokesman said: ""It is just repeating old rumours.
They are over two years old and the questions of things like who
owns Gunvor are now a matter of public record.""
 The company has previously said its two main shareholders
were its founders, Gennady Timchenko and Torbjorn Tornqvist, and
that a small stake belongs to an employee trust. 
 Timchenko has repeatedly denied media speculation he was a
close friend of Putin.
 It was not possible to verify if the documents were genuine.
 The U.S. Embassy in Moscow declined comment, but Beyrle
wrote in his blog that part of a diplomat's job for centuries
has been to report home on what he hears from a broad spectrum
of contacts ""and sometimes add his own conclusions"".
 In his Russian-language blog, Beyrle wrote that ""our
relations with our allies and partners around the world, which
we have succeeded in strengthening seriously in the last two
years, have weathered this moderate test with dignity"".
 ""As for me and my colleagues at the embassy, we will as
before do everything we can to help the governments and people
of the United States and Russia know and understand each other
better."" http://beyrle.livejournal.com/ 
 Undersecretary of State William Burns -- a former ambassador
to Moscow who is quoted in some of the leaked cables -- has said
the disclosures were a ""despicable breach of trust"" that would
hurt U.S. diplomacy. [ID:nWAT014761]

 * Zain's stake in Zain Saudi worth about $700 million

(Adds valuation)
 By Eman Goma and Victoria Howley
 KUWAIT/LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Kuwaiti telecoms carrier
Zain has appointed UBS to sell its 25 percent stake in Zain
Saudi, sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
 Zain selling its part in the business is a regulatory
condition for Abu Dhabi group Etisalat's $12 billion bid for a
controlling stake in Zain.
 Etisalat and Zain both have units in Saudi Arabia and
compete for market share there. The stake is worth about $700
million based on Zain Saudi's current share price of 7.6 riyals
($2.03), according to Thomson Reuters data. 
 Bahrain Telecommunications, or Batelco, and South African
group MTN were in talks to buy Zain's stake, the sources said.
It was unclear whether other parties were also involved.
 Major Zain shareholder Kharafi group is the main player in a
plan to sell a 46 percent stake in Zain to Etisalat.
 But Sheikh Khalifa Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, a member of
Kuwait's ruling family and a Zain board member, told Reuters
this week that another shareholder, Al Fawares Holding, had
filed a lawsuit to stop Etisalat's due diligence.
 Batelco is one of the smaller operators in the Gulf Arab
region, trying to find a niche besides heavyweights Saudi
Telecom, Zain and Etisalat.
 Operators in the region are wrestling with lower margins at
home due to new competition in increasingly liberalised markets
and the financing costs for acquisitions and new licences
abroad. 
 India's Bharti Airtel bought Zain's African operations for
$9 billion earlier this year.
 UBS, Zain and MTN declined to comment. Batelco could not be
reached for comment.

 * Pumping money into system won't solve debt crisis-Miklos
 * Structural reforms in western Europe a must
 * EFSF, ESM alone not a solution for current euro troubles
 * Markets calculate rationally that bailouts may continue
 
 By Martin Santa
 BRATISLAVA, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Financial markets are behaving
rationally in pricing in a risk that more euro zone economies
may need bailouts, Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said on
Thursday, calling for greater budget discipline in the bloc.
 In an interview, Miklos told Reuters the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
alone would not solve the euro zone's government debt problems
and said it was useless to blame the crisis on speculators.
 Miklos, an advocate of fiscal discipline in Slovakia's
right-wing cabinet, rejected the idea that financial markets
were acting irrationally and exacerbating the crisis that has
forced Greece and Ireland to take tens of billions of euros in
emergency loans.
 ""To blame speculators (because) a crisis has emerged is like
blaming gravity for a plane crash,"" Miklos said. 
 ""Markets are calculating rationally, they price in that
bailouts will continue.""
 Slovakia, a central European country which joined the euro
zone as its poorest member last year, has already made a mark as
a dissenter, supporting tough policies for countries with big
deficits.
 It refused to take part in the rescue of Greece, in part
because of popular resistance to bailing out a country where
wages are much higher than in Slovakia.
 
 BOND-BUYING 'RISK'
 Miklos said that the European Central Bank's bond-buying
programme was a clear breach of its principles, delaying a
market clean up and restoration of balance.
 ""To stop an expansive monetary policy and the pumping of
more money into the economy is part of the solution on how to
clean up markets and to restore balance,"" he said. ""If not,
there is a risk the problems will only balloon.""
 The ECB says it withdraws funds from the market to offset
any money it injects by buying bonds, thus differentiating its
operations from the U.S. policy of quantitative easing which is
designed specifically to pump extra money into the economy.
 Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue of
Portugal although the government in Lisbon denies, as Irish
leaders initially did, that the country needs outside aid.
 While a Portuguese rescue could be covered from the EFSF,
assistance for its neighbour Spain would sorely test EU
resources, raise deeper questions about the integrity of the
currency area and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe.
 Miklos said he was ""feeling pressure towards a fiscal union""
among euro zone members, although he could not imagine one
actually existing.
 Slovak public debt stood at 35.4 percent of gross domestic
product GDP at the end of last year, far below the EU average --
a policy that investors have rewarded. The market premium for
holding Slovak 10-year bonds rather than euro zone benchmark
German Bunds was 146.7 basis points on Thursday, compared with
Portugal's extra cost of 352.9 basis points.
 Miklos said instead of printing money, western Europe must
reform pensions and health care to curb costs.
 Slovaks plan to cut the public deficit to 4.9 percent of the
GDP from 7.84 percent seen in 2010, with help of tax hikes and
lower state spending.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2010 09:28AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Germany sees no turning back from the euro,"* Merkel's ruling coalition united on euro
* Return to national currencies ruled out
 * Future seen in closer tax and spending policies
 
 By Stephen Brown and Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Germany sees no alternative to the
euro and Angela Merkel's government believes the best way to
strengthen the currency which has helped make the German economy
so competitive is closer policy convergence across Europe.
 But with German public support in the balance for rescuing
euro partners Greece, Ireland and possibly others, it is a tough
message for the domestic audience. This explains the apparently
mixed messages emerging from Berlin.
 Germany voices strong objections to some of the proposed
solutions to the euro crisis, such as joint euro zone bonds, and
Merkel's insistence on a crisis mechanism from 2013 involving
private investors has upset markets.
 ""But in the end Germany has a vital interest in the survival
of the currency union,"" Dekabank economist Andreas Scheuerle
said. 
 While mass-selling daily Bild runs headlines like ""How Long
Will the Euro Hold Out?"" and some pundits suggest a north-south
euro divide, the crisis seems to have hardened the German
establishment's view that there is no alternative to the single
currency.
 The government, including the sometimes fractious members of
Merkel's centre-right coalition, plus the business world and the
serious media are at pains to nix any talk of Germany losing its
enthusiasm for the euro or returning to the deutschemark.
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle, from the Free Democrats,
Merkel's often uneasy coalition partners, said on Thursday
reinstating national currencies in the euro area was ""not
realistic"".
 Merkel repeats that Europe's fate is inextricably tied to
the currency shared by 16 countries and her comments on private
investors needing to share in sovereign risk from 2013 reflect a
belief that the euro will still be around.
 Currently enjoying a much stronger economic recovery than
its partners, Germany may return to pre-crisis growth levels as
early as next year, largely thanks to exports.
 So grumbles about the euro are slapped down with
the argument that a revived deutschemark would quickly render
German exports too expensive.
 ""The mark would be so overvalued against other currencies
that our exports would be in trouble,"" said Andre Schwarz of the
exporters' association BGA. ""The solution is not to let the euro
break up.""

 DEFECT
 The alternative to ditching, dividing or diluting the euro
must then be to bring its disparate economies closer together
via policy convergence or ""economic government"", analysts say.
 ""It was a birth defect of the euro for a currency union to
be created without fiscal union,"" wrote Thomas Straubhaar,
director of the Hamburg Institute of International Economics.
 Fiscal and eventually political union would be ""better than
going into reverse and provoking trench warfare between north
and south or Germany and France"", Straubhaar wrote in Die Welt
newspaper, using language that reflects the vision of the euro
as a guarantor of broader geopolitical unity in Europe.
 Merkel signed up to the idea of economic government early in
2010 and the crisis seems to have strengthened this conviction.
 She still pays more than lip service, though, to German
objections to turning the currency union into a ""transfer union""
where one country -- inevitably Germany -- bails out the others.
 One group of eurosceptic German economists say the EU treaty
forbids this in a ""no bailout"" clause. Germany's constitutional
court will rule on the Greek and euro zone bailouts next year.
 This worry partly explains Merkel's constant need to stress
tough conditions in exchange for assistance and member nations'
need to retain the right to veto each request for a rescue.
 It also helps explain Germany's rejection of the idea of
joint euro zone bonds, which Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker
argues would improve access to credit. Germany feels this looks
too much like a ""transfer union"" and can only happen when, or
if, political union becomes a reality.
 Merkel speaks of the need to show markets who is in charge,
requiring what Scheuerle called a ""clear, unambiguous solution
that makes markets realise that the political will to keep the
euro is so great that speculation and panic can be turned off"".
 One solution could be a central body for economic government
to monitor imbalances in euro zone finances, said Scheuerle.

832,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2010 09:17AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CAD extends losses after jobless claims increase,
833,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2010 09:16AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-China plans to boost seven strategic sectors," BEIJING, Dec 2 (Reuters) - China is considering investments
of up to $1.5 trillion over five years in seven strategic
industries, sources said, a plan aimed at accelerating the
country's transition from the world's supplier of cheap goods to
a leading purveyor of high-value technologies.
 Here is a look at what China is doing in the seven sectors.
 ALTERNATIVE FUEL CARS
 China is fast reaching the point of economic development
where millions of its citizens can afford their own car. That is
a headache for the government because of pollution and carbon
emissions and because China's refineries are already dependent
on foreign suppliers for more than half their crude oil.
 One alternative fuel source, ethanol made from crops, is
deliberately restricted because China's government is keen to
ensure supplies of corn and other grains reach the food market,
which is already stretched by fast growing demand.
 China's vehicle fleet has turned to many other power
sources, including fuel cells, compressed natural gas, liquefied
petroleum gas and even liquefied natural gas, which is most
commonly associated with huge storage tanks aboard ocean-going
tankers.
 In June the government launched a pilot programme in five
cities to subsidise electric and hybrid cars. Among the
beneficiaries was Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co Ltd.
 BIOTECHNOLOGY
 China is slowly turning to biotechnology to improve crop
yields, since demand is rising quickly but supply is constrained
by a lack of available water resources and land area.
 The chairman of state grains trading firm COFCO Ltd, Frank
Ning, told Reuters in an interview earlier this week that
technology was the key to keeping supply and demand in balance
in the future.
 ""Using technology to produce more on the same land and maybe
agricultural policy to give more incentive to the farmers to
grow more to increase their productivity. The government is
doing so, but I think the room to improve is still big,"" he
said.
 While the United States and other rich countries have
embraced genetically modified crops, China approved the safety
of its first GMO strains of corn and rice last year, paving the
way for commercial production to begin in 2-3 years.
 More than 20 GMO crops have been approved for field trials.
 China's rapidly expanding demand has forced the government
to accept imports of GMO soybeans and, since earlier in 2010,
corn.
 ENERGY-SAVING AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES
 China is investing heavily to upgrade its infrastructure and
leapfrog the developed world in areas such as electricity
transmission and power metering.
 With total power capacity set to reach 1,430 gigawatt by
2015 from 874 gigawatt at the start of 2010, China has to figure
out how to bring trillions of kilowatt hours of power to more
than a billion customers, sometimes over very long distances.
 Premier Wen Jiabao called for ""pushing forward with building
a smart grid"" in the annual report to the National People's
Congress in March.
 State Grid Corp of China, which operates the bulk of the
country's power transmission networks, envisages building an
""informationised, automatic and interactive"" grid with ultra
high voltage (UHV) power lines over the next five years.
 ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
 China already relies on foreign oil for more than half its
oil consumption and is also determined to cut back on coal, the
cheapest but dirtiest fossil fuel, so the government needs to
find energy-efficient technology to keep China's economy growing
without driving up demand for either of those staple fuels.
 It has already launched a major drive into hydropower and,
to a lesser extent, wind, gas and nuclear, to supplement the
coal sector that provides about 70 percent of its electricity.
 The government is expected to unveil a new alternative
energy plan within months to raise its targets for power
generating capacity from such sources by 2020, since the country
has already surpassed many of the targets it set out in 2007.
 China has an abundance of coal but has promised to cut
carbon emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40-45 percent from
2005 levels, so it is also actively pursuing technologies that
may allow it to exploit its coal resources while keeping
emissions to a minimum.
 HIGH-END MANUFACTURING
 China is leading the world in manufacturing high-speed
trains, wind turbines and solar panels, both for its own use and
for export.
 China plans to build 13,000 km (8,078 miles) of high-speed
rail lines by 2012, more than the rest of the world combined,
and to invest 2 trillion yuan in railways by 2020, while
building a fleet of state-of-the-art trains with the help of
foreign firms including Bombardier Inc, Siemens, Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd and Alstom SA.
 ADVANCED MATERIALS
 China irked the world earlier this year by tightening its
grip on the supply of rare earth metals, an obscure group of
elements with many uses in hi-tech from Apple's iPhone to flat
screen TVs.
 Critics say China's dominant position, supplying 97 percent
of the world's rare earths, gives it a stranglehold on new
technologies and puts huge costs on foreign competitors.
 China is the world's largest producer of indium, a small but
vital component for the flat-panel screens used in televisions
and computer monitors.
 China is also one of the world's top miners of lithium, a
metal used in batteries, metal alloys, ceramics and nuclear
weapons, which is expected to dominate the electric car industry
in the next decade.
 NEW-GENERATION INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
 A Chinese-built supercomputer, the Tianhe-1, was ranked the
world's fastest in October, with a theoretical speed of 4.7
petaflops per second.
 China is also investing heavily in cutting-edge science,
from nanotechnology to an array of 35 satellites that will
provide a navigation alternative to the U.S. Global Positioning
System by 2020.

 WARSAW, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Polish Finance Minister Jacek
Rostowski said there is no need to intervene on the currency
market, but if there is serious market turmoil the central bank
could step in.
 The zloty has recently hit four-month lows against the euro
on the back of the increased fears over the condition of the
euro zone peripheries threatening to inflate Poland's soaring
public debt.
 ""We don't have a target exchange rate at this point, we have
a free float,"" Rostowski told parliament on Thursday. ""There is
no need to intervene now. If serious turbulences occur the
central bank may intervene.""
 Speaking separately on Thursday central bank head Marek
Belka reiterated Zloty ""was doomed"" to gain in the long run and
a Deputy Finance Minister Dominik Radziwill said the economic
fundamentals justified zloty appreciation.
 [ID:nWSF009779] [ID:nWSF009777]
 At 1322 GMT the euro traded at 4.0050 zlotys, a lot weaker
than the 4.11 level it hit on Monday.
 
 ZLOTY MEETS DEBT
 The recent zloty slide threatens to boost the value of
Poland foreign-denominated debt which is key as the European
Union's largest ex-communist economy battles rising liabilities
that may top a key safety level.
 Rostowski said debt would likely stand at 53.0-53.5 percent
of gross domestic product at the end of 2010 and thus would stop
short of the key level of 55 percent.
 Once this threshold is breached the government is obliged by
law to introduce painful fiscal cuts, a move the centre-right
government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk would like to avoid
ahead of the 2011 parliamentary elections.
 So far polls show Tusk's Civic Platform (PO) is well ahead
of its main rival Law and Justice (PiS) and PO has recently
emerged as the strongest party in the local elections.

 * China is very worried about EU protectionism, envoy says
 * Envoy: yuan rise won't end imbalances, could hurt EU firms

(Adds details, background)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - China's envoy to the European
Union struck a conciliatory tone in a row over public
procurement on Thursday, but warned the EU against growing
protectionism in the bloc.
 Speaking to deputies at the European Parliament, Ambassador
Song Zhe said Beijing would address EU concerns about a lack of
access to Chinese public works contracts.
 ""Premier Wen (Jiabao) has promised we will make steady steps
to make improvements in these areas and for foreign businesses
to grow in China. We will fulfil what we have promised,"" Song
told the trade committee of the European Parliament.
 European firms' frustrated attempts to enter the lucrative
public tender market of China -- valued at about 10 percent of
China's GDP -- have prompted EU warnings of reciprocal market
closures across the 27-nation bloc.
 Song warned Europe against rising protectionism. Reeling
from economic crisis, Europe has recently launched a range of
defensive measures against cheap Chinese imports.
 ""We are very much worried about the increasing number of
trade protectionism and antidumping measures adopted by the
European Union,"" Song said, speaking through an interpreter.
 The EU and the United States, among others, have accused
China of keeping its currency artificially cheap, which has
resulted in global trade imbalances and undermined their own
industries.
 While China says it is committed to reforming its currency,
it insists it alone will decide how this is done.
 ""It is not objective and it is unfair to put the blame of
domestic unemployment ... on the undervalued renminbi,"" Song
said. ""The appreciation of the renminbi cannot help address
global imbalances.""
 Song told the EU legislators China would push ahead with
gradual currency reform, but that any sudden change would
undermine the profitability of European firms operating in
China, where their operations outperform those in OECD
countries.
 He also emphasised China's willingness to help the EU
overcome its economic downturn.
 ""China has stood by the side of Europe to tide over the
difficulties. Our support for Europe is mutually beneficial and
win-win,"" he said.
 ""We cannot save the European Union in absolute terms but we
are willing to contribute our own share.""
 Responding to foreign demands and internal economic reforms,
China will further open its markets to foreign participation in
the booming services sector including finance, education, health
care, IT and sports, Song said.
 ""The important thing ... is to continue to reform and open
up. We encourage our friends in Europe to have more patience.""

 * Trichet awaited; focus on liquidity, bond buy measures
 * Euro supported after Spanish, French bond auction results
 
 (Adds detail, updates prices)
 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro held firm on Thursday
after rising the previous day as investors waited to see if the
European Central Bank would take more steps to calm euro debt
concerns, but could fall again if the central bank disappoints.
 The euro offered limited reaction to the ECB's widely
expected decision to hold its main refinancing rate at 1.0
percent. President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to offer more
policy details when he speaks to reporters at 1330 GMT.
 Investors expect the ECB will keep unlimited liquidity
operations in place for longer to help banks secure funding,
while speculation has been brewing that the central bank may
step up its bond purchases.
 ""The focus is on whether Trichet will announce a numerical
target for bond purchases. If he keeps to saying they are ready
to buy more bonds but without a numerical target, the markets
will be disappointed and turn negative on the euro,"" said
Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 The ECB has been under pressure to soothe market sentiment
after a bailout plan announced for Ireland last month stoked
speculation that other euro zone nations struggling to repay
their debts may also seek help from the European community.
 By 1252 GMT, the euro was up 0.2 percent on the day at
$1.3177, holding gains after jumping more than 1 percent the
previous day as investors pared short positions in the single
currency. 
 Earlier this week, it sank to an 11-week low of $1.2969 on
concerns that countries including Portugal and Spain may be the
next countries to seek an EU bailout.
 Some investors were expected to dump euro/dollar long
positions ahead of key U.S. payroll data due out on Friday.
 ""The (U.S.) ADP numbers raised expectations Friday's jobs
report will not be so bad, making players adverse to holding
excessive euro/dollar longs,"" Unicredit's Mialich said.
 Early gains in the euro were limited by bids from Asian and
Middle East accounts seen around $1.3130, traders said.
 It rose to the day's high of $1.3217 after stop-loss orders
were triggered above $1.3180 and after the results of Spanish
and French government bond auctions showed they were relatively
well received.
 The euro held above its 200-day moving average at $1.3123,
but analysts said disappointment from the ECB could see it
resume the fall it began in early November and head back below
$1.30.
 
 ""If (the ECB) can get a temporary positive spin on things
we will get a chance to sell at $1.33 and if they don't we will
have to crush the euro back through $1.30,"" a London-based
trader said. 
 ""Either way, it's a sell,"" he said, adding the ECB at this
point can do ""nothing more than keep the wolves at bay for a bit
longer.""
 The euro was earlier supported after a U.S. official told
Reuters Washington would support boosting an EU rescue facility
via IMF funds, although a Treasury Department spokesman later
said an ""extra commitment is not something we're discussing
right now""..
 The U.S. dollar was little changed against the yen at 84.25
yen, not far from a two-month high of 84.41 yen hit on Monday.
Robust U.S. data and higher U.S. bond yields may support the
greenback, traders said.

 * Crown seen extending gains in 2011, leu to rebound
 * Forint to underperform, though seen firming 2.5 percent
 
 By Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Economic recovery will lift
currencies in the European Union's east in 2011 but the past few
weeks' falls can resume any time if the euro zone debt crisis
escalates, analysts in a monthly Reuters poll said.
 The Nov. 29-Dec. 1 poll which had 37 respondents projected
that the Polish zloty would firm 5.5 percent from its Wednesday
close to 3.8 against the euro in the next 12 months, adding to
its 2.5 percent gain posted so far this year.
 The Czech crown, the region's top performer in 2010 with
gains over 5 percent, is expected to strengthen further by 3.2
percent to 24.2. The Romanian leu is also seen firming 3.2
percent to 4.16 after shedding more than one percent this year.
 But a projected 2.5 percent rise of Hungary's forint would
offset only part of the 3 percent loss suffered in 2010 amid
concerns about how Budapest is dealing with its budget deficit.
 The units are all expected to firm in the next few weeks
except for the forint, which is seen closing the year broadly
unchanged from Wednesday's closing level.
 The currencies underperformed forecasts this year as
investors' hunger for yield soured over the Greek debt crisis in
the summer and Ireland's woes in the past weeks.
 Fears that Portugal and Spain may also fall prey to the
crisis weigh on the outlook of the EU's emerging markets.
 But analysts have so far maintained their forecasts for a
firming of their currencies, putting an expected economic
recovery and monetary tightening in the region in the balance.
 
 EYES SHARPENED TO FISCAL RISKS
 The recovery has made a strong start in Poland and the Czech
Republic, though it remains sluggish in Hungary.
 Romania which is carrying out fiscal austerity measures is
still in recession but its debt is well below that of Hungary
whose government has often confounded markets in the past months
with unorthodox economic policy measures.
 The median 12-month forecasts improved to 24.20 per euro for
the Czech crown from 24.25 in a poll a month ago, to 4.16 from
4.19 for the Romanian leu, remained flat at 3.8 for the zloty,
but Hungary's forint is seen weaker at 272.50 than the previous
forecast of 270.
 Hungary is expected to cut its budget deficit to one of the
lowest levels in the EU, below 3 percent of GDP next year.
 But investors remain concerned over its medium-term fiscal
sustainability and debt ratings as one-off measures reduce the
budget gap, including special taxes on big firms and a plan to
spend savings to be taken over by the state from pension funds.
 ""There is a big hole in the budget looking ahead to
2013-2014,"" said Zsolt Kondrat of MKB Bank. ""The government will
need to do something and I expect that they will do something...
there will be some kind of a reform, spending cuts.""
 Early this week Hungary's central bank became the first in
the region since the 2008 global crisis to increase interest
rates, but a central bank law amendment to put government
appointees in the rate-setting body has triggered concerns.
 Poland may be the first to follow Hungary's rate increase.
The zloty's prospects are also brightened by the country's
robust growth, privatisation revenue inflows and the possible
conversion of funds from the EU in the zloty market.
 But even analysts' favourite, the zloty, is vulnerable to
sentiment shifts over the euro zone crisis, which has made
investors more sensitive to any fiscal weakness in Europe.
 ""Poland, despite its growth, has one of the largest deficits
in CEE (Central Europe),"" Nomura said in a note dated Dec. 1.
 ""Although investors still hope fiscal consolidation will
take place after next October's elections, we believe a lack of
momentum could lead to a downgrade and possible
investor flight with currency implications,"" it said.
 The crown, the region's safe haven currency has also
suffered from the concerns over the euro zone in the past weeks.
 ""The focus will most likely remain on the euro zone in the
coming days and even weeks and will lead the way for EUR/CZK
development,"" said Helena Horska of Raiffeisenbank in Prague.
 For the leu the fragility of the Romanian government which
needs to implement further budget cuts remains a key risk.
 ""Uncertainty around the budget law for 2011 with negative
implications for the (country's) IMF (loan) deal are likely to
weigh on the RON (leu) for the near-term,"" said Nicolaie
Alexandru-Chidesciuc of ING Bank in Bucharest.

 * Euro zone debt crisis weighs on forecasts
 * Yen to weaken against dollar over coming year
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The battered euro will fail in the
coming year to recoup its recent sharp losses as the debt crisis
in the bloc rumbles on and fears over the economic stability of
periphery members weighs on minds, a Reuters poll found.
 The poll of 60 foreign exchange strategists, taken this week
ahead of the European Central Bank's announcement on monetary
policy, predicted the euro would be trading at $1.31 in a year's
time, weaker than the $1.33 predicted in last month's poll.
 The euro, trading around $1.31 on Thursday, is seen at $1.32
in one and six months, significantly down from the respective
$1.40 and $1.35 predicted last month.
 ""EMU tensions continuing to affect the EU periphery will
easily represent a source of volatility for EUR-USD until the
end of the year and likely throughout Q1 2011,"" said Roberto
Mialich at UniCredit.
 The ECB is under pressure to act when it meets later on
Thursday to help the euro zone contain a crippling debt crisis
that has stoked contagion fears in the United States and Asia.
 After an Irish rescue package of 85 billion euros from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund announced
this week, worries remain that bailouts will be needed in other
euro zone countries.
 Hopes that the ECB will rush through new anti-crisis
measures, such as expanding its government bond buying, helped
the euro -- which posted its biggest one-day rise in more than a
month on Wednesday -- stabilise and lifted stock markets on
Thursday.
 But the central bank risks disappointing markets if, as
several analysts predict, it will only decide at its monthly
meeting that its liquidity taps for euro zone banks will stay
wide open and merely hint at more government bond purchases.
 A Reuters poll published on Tuesday predicted the ECB would
not announce the return of competitive auctions for its
three-month refinancing operations and keep its supply of
unlimited funds open to help struggling banks in the euro zone's
periphery.
 The United States Federal Reserve said last month it would
buy $600 billion worth of U.S. government debt by June 2011 to
boost the country's economic recovery but knocking the
greenback.
 Uncertainty in the market was seen driving up volatility for
the euro and the yen this month. Analysts say the divergence of
forecasts in Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator
of exchange rate volatility in the following month.

 POUND GAINS SOME WEIGHT
 Sterling will hold in a relatively tight trading band
against the dollar over the coming year as a fairly strong
economic recovery is offset by the impact of deep government
spending cuts.
 The poll showed cable at $1.57 in one month before nudging
up to $1.59 in six and holding there for a further six months,
compared to 1-,6- and 12-month forecasts of $1.60, $1.59 and
$1.58 in November's poll.
 A Reuters poll published on Wednesday showed the chances of
the Bank of England echoing the Fed and extending its own
quantitative easing programme were diminishing but did not see a
hike from record low interest rates until next October at least.
 ""Strong growth data backed by impressive PMI leading
indicators suggest sterling will strengthen into the year end
before fiscal retrenchments undermines its advance,"" said
Alexandre Dolci at Societe Generale.
 Data released on Wednesday showed British manufacturing
activity accelerated unexpectedly to a 16-year high in November
and employment climbed at a record pace, suggesting the economy
may not need more monetary stimulus to stay on track for
recovery.
 Against the euro, the pound will also hold its own,
strengthening gently over the coming year.
 The euro was seen worth 84.2 pence in one and
84.4p six months before dropping to 83.0p in a year. That
compares to respective 87.5p, 85.7p and 84.5p forecasts in last
month's poll.
 The Japanese yen is expected to weaken gradually as
geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula coupled with debt
worries in the euro zone drive investors to the relative safety
of the dollar.
 The survey saw the dollar at 83.6 yen in a month from now,
85 in six months and 89.9 in a year.
 This compared with 80.9, 85.0 and 88.0 in the previous
month's survey. The dollar closed at 83.7 yen on Nov. 30, the
last trading day of November and was trading around 84.1 earlier
on Thursday.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for a second
straight day on Thursday and Wall Street looked set to join in
while the euro extended hefty gains as expectations grew the
European Central Bank might deliver measures to alleviate
worries over euro zone debt.
 The bank, as expected, left interest rates unchanged. But
attention focused on what ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
might say in a news conference.
 The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default eased and yield spreads of peripheral issues over German
Bunds also narrowed as hopes grew for decisive steps to stop the
crisis from spreading to larger economies such as Spain.
 Analysts cautioned there was scope for disappointment,
saying the ECB was unlikely at this stage to expand its bond
purchase programme.
 ""The focus is on whether Trichet will announce a numerical
target for bond purchases,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency
strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""If he keeps to saying they are ready to buy more bonds but
without a numerical target, the markets will be disappointed and

 MSCI world equity index rose 0.8 percent to a one-week high,

 Despite recent volatility, the MSCI index is still up 5.8
percent on the year, having risen more than 31 percent last

firmer open on Wall Street.

 The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.3177 after posting its

 ""Decisive action by governments and the ECB would be
required to prevent a further deterioration of funding

 ""However, the steps that are likely to be taken in the near

spreading of debt worries from the periphery into the core,
which has been our dreaded base case all year.""
 The yield premium for 10-year Spanish bonds over their
German counterparts fell, indicating less investor unease over
Madrid's ability to finance itself.

 * Prices up more than 10 percent since Nov. 23
 
 (Adds details)
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Benchmark European gasoline traded
at a two-year high of $824 a tonne on Thursday in a rare price
rally during the Northern Hemisphere winter.
 Analysts attributed the rally to a recent drop in gasoline
inventories in key consumer markets, an increase in spot
international demand and a squeeze from expensive naphtha.
Benchmark Eurobob gasoline prices have risen more than 10
percent since Nov. 23 to trade between $817 and $824 a tonne fob
in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area on Thursday.
 Reuters data showed that was the highest price since early
October 2008.
 Historically, gasoline is the oil market leader during
summer, when demand from holidaymakers peaks in the United
States and Europe. Then it tends to give up the role to gas oil
and heating oil during winter.
 ""It is very interesting to observe the gasoline market over
last couple of months, prices are very volatile,"" David Wech,
oil analyst at JBC Energy, said.
 Wech pointed out that a boost came from the fall in U.S.
gasoline stocks, which have remained lower than year-earlier
levels since early November, and demand from West Africa and the
eastern part of Mediterranean.
 Wech and Christophe Barret, global oil analyst at Credit
Agricole, also said the tight supply of naphtha was reducing
overall gasoline supply. Naphtha can be used as a petrochemical
feedstock and blended into gasoline.
 ""Another important factor is the push from naphtha, which is
extremely strong and is having a knock on effect on gasoline,""
Wech said.

 * Analysts say Russia ""out of fashion""
 * C.bank FX policy plays against rouble assets

 By Andrey Ostroukh
 MOSCOW, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The rouble faces a tough time as
inflation erodes returns, capital outflows surge and the central
bank slackens its reins, making Russia the odd one out among
emerging markets who are waging a war against currency strength.
 Low interest rates, high inflation, lacklustre growth,
corporates' acquisitions abroad and foreign debt repayments, a
broken-down correlation with oil and rising imports are all
factors pressuring the rouble -- and here to stay for now.
 ""We still expect the rouble to weaken through to year-end.
The main argument for this is the problem with capital outflows.
It is the factor which keeps on driving the Russian forex
market,"" analysts at Troika Dialog said in a research note.
 In a few weeks this autumn, the rouble lost all its 2010
gains to hit its weakest level so far this year of 36.42 against
the euro-dollar basket. Some $21 billion left Russia between
January and October.
 Russia's trade surplus is shrinking; exports increased just
13.8 percent year-on-year during that period, while imports rose
27.3 percent, fanned by improving domestic demand and food
purchases following a summer drought that killed one-third of
the harvest. Analysts now see little room for a surge in exports
unless oil prices soar towards $100 per barrel.
 The trade surplus is expected to shrink by nearly a fifth in
2011 to $115 billion, according to a Reuters poll.
 Foreign debt redemptions are another factor weighing on the
rouble, with Russian banks and companies due to pay back more
than $25.5 billion in November-December.
 Pressure also comes from corporate acquisitions abroad, such
as TNK-BP's $1.8 billion purchase of oil and gas fields in
Vietnam and Venezuela.
 
 SMALL RETURNS, WEAK DATA
 Russia can offer little premium to investors as inflation
accelerates, while the central bank keeps interest rates at
record lows to revive lending.
 Nominal yields on Russian financial instruments remain at
relatively high levels, but in real terms, inflation erodes
returns from holding Russian debt to almost zero.
 Consumer prices have risen 7.4 percent so far this year,
inching close to the central bank's 7.75 percent benchmark
refinancing rate.
 With average yields on the most liquid corporate bonds, such
as gas behemoth Gazprom and railroad monopoly RZhD, at around
7.5 percent, potential returns are limited for investors using
low-yielding dollars and euros to fund carry-trade positions in
Russian assets.
 ""Such operations have become less attractive now due to the
decrease in bond yields. Moreover, short-term currency risks
have increased,"" said Dmitry Kharlampiev, analyst at
Petrocommerce bank.
 The central bank has moved to discourage short-term capital
inflows, such as carry trades, allowing more flexibility in the
rouble and changing the pattern of interventions. That suggests
the currency will be increasingly vulnerable to external and
internal shocks.
 Lacklustre growth offers little help, with Russia's economy
growing 2.7 percent in the third quarter -- a weak result
compared to other emerging markets.
 The data is ""a negative development for the local equity
markets and the rouble, as it calls for greater monetary support
from the authorities, even despite the continued acceleration of
inflation,"" Vladimir Osakovsky, economist at Unicredit, said.
 
 OUT OF FASHION
 As a result the rouble has not benefited from the increased
level of global liquidity seeking a home after the Federal
reserve announced the second round of quantitative easing.
 ""More obvious places to invest ... are Turkey, Brazil,
India,"" said Roman Pakhomenko, chief dealer at Lanta bank.
 The Brazilian real has added 0.9 percent against the dollar
year-to-date, while the Indian rupee has gained 1.3 percent. The
rouble has lost 4.0 percent.
 ""The rouble was the worst performer among commodity
currencies and was also lagging among BRICs, as capital flows
into Russia remained negative,"" said Paul Biszko at RBC Capital.
 The pile-up of anti-rouble factors has led to a breakdown of
the correlation with oil -- Russia's major export and once a key
support for the currency, the price of which has held above $80
per barrel for almost three months.
 As a result, analysts and markets alike have turned more
bearish on the rouble. The latest Reuters poll showed it at
35.30 versus the basket by year-end compared with late April
forecast of 33.48 and the present rate of 35.90.
 Implied yields of three-month non-deliverable forwards for
the dollar versus the rouble rose to their highest levels in six
months, 4.2 percent, in late November, up from 3.0 percent seen
before the rouble's slump started in mid-September.
 ""Russia is out of fashion today,"" deputy chief executive of
Russia's biggest lender Sberbank, Bella Zlatkis, said in
mid-November after meeting with international investors.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for a second
straight day on Thursday while the euro extended its hefty gains
as expectations grew the European Central Bank might deliver
measures to alleviate worries over euro zone debt.
 The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default eased and yield spreads of peripheral issues over German
Bunds also narrowed as hopes grew for decisive steps to stop the
crisis from spreading to larger economies such as Spain.
 Analysts cautioned there was scope for disappointment,
saying the ECB was unlikely at this stage to expand its bond
purchase programme.
 ""The focus is on whether (ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet
will announce a numerical target for bond purchases,"" said
Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""If he keeps to saying they are ready to buy more bonds but
without a numerical target, the markets will be disappointed and
turn negative on the euro.""
 MSCI world equity index rose 0.8 percent to a one-week high,
having hit its weakest level in nearly two months earlier this
week. 
 Despite recent volatility, the MSCI index is still up 5.8
percent on the year, having risen more than 31 percent last
year.
 U.S. stock futures rose around 0.3 percent, pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose half a percent while
emerging stocks gained 1.2 percent.
 
 PREVENTING CONTAGION
 The euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.3194 after posting its
biggest one-day rise in more than a month on Wednesday from an
11-week low on Tuesday. The dollar fell 0.3 percent against a
basket of major currencies.
 ""Decisive action by governments and the ECB would be
required to prevent a further deterioration of funding
conditions for European sovereigns and banks,"" Morgan Stanley
said in a note to clients.
 ""However, the steps that are likely to be taken in the near
term probably won't suffice to end the crisis and prevent a
spreading of debt worries from the periphery into the core,
which has been our dreaded base case all year.""
 The yield premium for 10-year Spanish bonds over their
German counterparts fell, indicating less investor unease over
Madrid's ability to finance itself.
 Five-year credit default swaps for Greece, Ireland, Spain
and Portugal fell.
 The spread between 10-year Spanish and German debt narrowed
for a second day, by 10 basis points to 246 basis points, down
from a euro lifetime high of 290 basis points struck on Monday.
Bund futures fell 50 ticks.
 U.S. crude oil was up 0.1 percent to $86.87 a barrel,
staying near a three-week peak.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro held firm on Thursday
after rising the previous day as investors waited to see if the
European Central Bank would take more steps to calm euro debt
concerns, but could fall again if the central bank disappoints.
 The euro posted its biggest one-day rise in more than a
month on Wednesday on speculation the ECB would massively step
up its bond purchases, after the single currency struck 11-week
lows against the dollar.
 All eyes were on the ECB, which is expected to keep
unlimited liquidity operations in place for longer but hold off
from more radical measures.
 The ECB will announce the outcome of its policy meeting at
1245 GMT, followed by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's news
conference at 1330 GMT.
 ""The focus is on whether Trichet will announce a numerical
target for bond purchases. If he keeps to saying they are ready
to buy more bonds but without a numerical target, the markets
will be disappointed and turn negative on the euro,"" said
Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Furthermore, traders may take advantage of such a situation
to dump euro/dollar long positions ahead of key U.S. payroll
data due out on Friday.
 ""The (U.S.) ADP numbers raised expectations Friday's jobs
report will not be so bad, making players adverse to holding
excessive euro/dollar longs,"" Mialich said.
 By 1001 GMT, the euro was up 0.3 percent on the day at
$1.3187. It had jumped more than 1 percent the previous day
after hitting an 11-week low at $1.2969 on Tuesday.
 Bids from Asian and Middle East accounts seen around $1.3130
supported the downside, traders said.
 It rose to the day's high of $1.3197 as stop-loss orders
were triggered above $1.3180 and after the results of Spanish
and French government bond auctions showed they were relatively
well received.
 Offers were seen around $1.3180/1.3200, traders said.
 The euro has fluctuated on either side of its 200-day moving
average at $1.3123 and analysts said disappointment from the ECB
could see it resume the fall it began in early November and head
back below $1.30.
 
 ""If (the ECB) can get a temporary positive spin on things
we will get a chance to sell at $1.33 and if they don't we will
have to crush the euro back through $1.30,"" a London-based
trader said. 
 ""Either way, it's a sell,"" he said, adding the ECB at this
point can do ""nothing more than keep the wolves at bay for a bit
longer.""
 The euro was earlier supported after a U.S. official told
Reuters Washington would support boosting an EU rescue facility
via IMF funds, although a Treasury Department spokesman later
said an ""extra commitment is not something we're discussing
right now."".
 The U.S. dollar was little changed against the yen at 84.12
yen, not far from a two-month high of 84.41 yen hit on Monday.
Robust U.S. data and higher U.S. bond yields may support the
greenback, traders said.

currency, the litas, would be put at risk if parliament votes to
reverse pension cuts imposed a year ago to tackle the rising
budget deficit, the prime minister said on Thursday. 
 Lithuania, facing a serious recession, opted for wage and
price cuts to restore competitiveness and avoid a devaluation of
the litas, which is pegged to the euro under a currency board.
 A devaluation would have had hit Scandinavian banks such as
SEB  and Swedbank , which have invested
heavily in the country, as most of the loans issued in Lithuania
are in foreign currencies, mostly the euro.
 ""If someone wants to see how life is with an unstable
currency, which means the litas being devalued, let's have such
an experiment,"" Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius told commercial
radio, referring to an opposition initiative to reverse pension
cuts.
 ""I am not trying to scare anyone here, I am talking about
reality,"" he added.
 Parliament has given two readings to a bill initiated by the
centre-left opposition to restore pensions to pre-crisis levels.
A final vote is still pending. The president can veto the bill,
but parliament can also override the veto.
 The government has taken measures such as spending cuts and
tax rises, worth about 10 percent of GDP, to cut the budget
deficit. Public sector wages were cut by an average 12 percent
and old age pensions by an average 5 percent.[ID: nLDE6960T8]
 The government said any move to restore pensions to previous
levels would require an additional 500-600 million litas in
spending, boosting the public sector budget deficit, which is
now projected at 5.7 billion litas, or 5.8 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), in 2011.
 The move would also mean the government would have to borrow
more to foot the pension bill.
 ""Raising debt can cause huge problems... We might see
markets' confidence eroding, or even being unable to borrow,""
Kubilius said.
 ""Look what's happening with Greece, with Ireland. We have
been able to avoid such problems so far,"" he added.
 Kubilius said the government saw the possibility to start
compensating for pension cuts from 2012, as the economic
recovery, already seen this year, is expected to get stronger.

 MADRID, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Spain insisted on Thursday it will

Rodriguez Zapatero said the time has come for the euro zone to
move towards a more integrated fiscal and economic policy.
 Spain is quickly moving into the eye of the storm in
Europe's debt crisis and its cost of borrowing at a three-year
bond tender on Thursday was around 50 percent higher compared to
the beginning of October.
 But the jump was not as bad as feared and demand was solid,
reflecting expectations the European Central Bank will prop up
markets with more bond buying and the belief of some players
that Spain is not as much at risk as recent market action
suggests.
 ""Spain isn't going to have to tap any EU fund or resort to
them,"" Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said,
according to a transcript of an interview with CNBC.

 With billions in aid for Greece and Ireland having failed to
stem the debt crisis, EU policymakers have begun to think of
radical solutions, with ideas so far mentioned on the sidelines
of meetings, discussed informally or only sketched out.
 The argument for a more unified approach on budgets is that
the lack of a full fiscal union among the 16 euro members
creates tensions and risk differentials that are now being
exploited.
 ""What Spain advocates is that if we have a single currency,
it's not enough just to have a central bank, a single central
bank. It's not enough to have a single monetary policy. We also
need to have a common economic policy,"" Zapatero said. 
 ""We need to have a much more integrated fiscal policy, "" he
added.
 
 FIGHTBACK
 The interest investors charge on Spanish benchmark 10-year
bonds  over the German benchmark 
narrowed for a second day on Thursday, after hitting a euro era
high above 300 basis points on Tuesday.
 After a brief rally following the auction, the leading
Spanish blue-chip index, the IBEX <.IBEX> later turned negative
after the European Central Bank gave no commitment to step up
the pace of its sovereign bond-buying programme.
 That pushed the benchmark bond spread out to 243 bps.
 The euro zone's largest bank Santander , however,
was up 1.1 percent and BBVA  up 1.2 percent at 1429
GMT. The two banks make up around 30 percent of the IBEX.
 The Bank of Spain said Spanish banks were accessing the
interbank lending markets as normal. [ID:nMDT009554]
 Madrid on Wednesday announced the sale of stakes in leading
airports and its state lottery as well as plans to raise tax
brackets for smaller companies and cut one-off welfare payments

 The privatisation proposals were met with almost immediate
opposition by unions at state-owned airports operator AENA. The
unions said they would meet next week to ""establish a calendar
of conflicts, demonstrations and strikes in all the airports and
control centres"".
 Economy Minister Elena Salgado said in an interview with the
Financial Times the sale of state assets would allow it to
reduce new debt issues next year by around a third to 30-31
billion euros ($40.6 billion).
 The government's biggest problem, however, remains growth
and how to reboot its economy after the collapse of a property

rose in November and would top 20 percent of the workforce in
the fourth quarter overall, after falling for the first time in

 Salgado noted Italy and Belgium as well as Spain and
Portugal had been hit by volatile market movements. These have
pushed Spanish 10-year bond yields to as high as 5.6 percent
from 4.2 percent a month earlier.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro sat tight after surging
higher the previous day, as investors waited to see if European
Central Bank policy makers meeting later on Thursday would take
any measures to alleviate worries over euro zone debt.
 The euro posted its biggest one-day rise in more than a
month on Wednesday, in a dramatic turnaround from 11-week lows
against the dollar, as players cut short positions in the hope
the ECB might calm the region's debt crisis by taking new steps.
 Analysts cautioned there was scope for disappointment,
however, saying the central bank was unlikely at this stage to
expand its bond purchase programme to support beleaguered
peripheral euro zone government debt markets as some might hope.
 The euro, which jumped more than 1 percent to $1.3183 on
Wednesday, eased to $1.3120 on Thursday as players turned more
cautious but it remained well above an 11-week low at $1.2969
set on Tuesday.
 It was fluctuating either side of its 200-day moving average
at $1.3123 and analysts said disappointment could see it resume
the fall it began in early November and head back below $1.30.
One trader in Singapore said for now, however, there were euro
bids from $1.3060 down to $1.30.
 ""If the ECB decide to do nothing more on bond purchases,
that could go down quite badly with European debt markets and
the euro,"" said Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at
Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 ""If they open the door at least, it might stem a fall in the
euro but markets just want to see some concrete action.""
 Societe Generale analysts said in a client note if the ECB
wanted to stop contagion, it needed to announce a plan of 1
trillion euros or more over the coming quarters, but they
thought this was unlikely to happen this week.
 The ECB will announce the outcome of its policy meeting at
1245 GMT, followed by a news conference at 1330 GMT.
 What analysts see as more likely is for the ECB to agree
that it would send the wrong signal if it pushed on with phasing
out unlimited liquidity measures right now, as had been
expected, and instead for it to possibly add to those liquidity
measures to ease strains.
 ""The ECB will make a distinction between crisis measures and
quantitative easing,"" said Hiroshi Yokotani, fixed income
director at Alliance and Bernstein.
 ""It will take some measures to counter the debt crisis but
at the same time it will make sure that is not going to lead to
expansion of its balance sheet.""
 The euro's rebound on Tuesday was accompanied by a rally in
European equities and peripheral euro zone bonds, which saw
Spanish and Irish 10-year yields fall.
 A U.S. official also told Reuters that Washington would
support boosting an EU rescue facility via IMF funds, although a
Treasury Department spokesman later said an ""extra commitment is
not something we're discussing right now""..
 If the euro does rise, the trader in Singapore said there
were automatic buy orders up in the $1.3190 to $1.3200 region.
 A Japanese newspaper report that North Korea could carry out
shelling against mainland South Korea before year end encouraged
players to close out some riskier positions in early Asian
trade, taking a little shine off the euro and Australian dollar,
although share markets around the region rose.
 The euro eased 0.3 percent to 110.25 yen, after rising
nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, while the Australian dollar lost
0.6 percent to 80.99 yen.
 The Aussie also fell 0.4 percent to $0.9638, knocked back by
an unexpected fall in Australian retail sales, which dented
hopes for an economic revival in the fourth quarter.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average
hit a five-month high and the euro stayed within sight of
overnight highs on Thursday ahead of a European Central Bank
meeting that investors speculate could bring new steps to
contain the euro zone's fiscal crisis.	
 Major European stock markets also rose, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 opening up 0.4 percent and London's
FTSE 100 rising 0.6 percent . U.S. stock index futures
 edged up 0.1 percent.	
 Gains in Europe and Asia followed Wall Street's 2 percent
rally on Wednesday led by companies most sensitive to economic
turning points and a U.S. Treasuries sell-off after reports
showed strength in labour and industrial sectors. 
 Markets remained nervous, however, as even after Ireland's
85 billion euro bailout investors have been losing confidence
that Portugal and Spain and perhaps others could escape a
similar fate. That led to expectations the ECB will announce
backstop measures to keep cash flowing in its financial
system, though it may disappoint investors by not being ready
to increase bond purchases just yet.

 ""The sovereign debt crisis has shown early signs of
transforming into a banking and liquidity crisis,"" Todd Elmer,
currency strategist with Citi in Singapore, said in a note.	
 ""A breakdown in market function is likely to drive risk
reduction among investors, which should favor sharp dollar
strengthening vs euro.	
 ""Such price action could eventually force a stronger
response from both fiscal and monetary authorities in Europe,
but expectations for imminent action are probably premature.""Â Â 	
 In a sign that investors were far from being swept away by
a tide of optimism, shares of Toyota Motor Corp
slipped 0.6 percent in active trade after the world's top car
maker reported its U.S. sales dropped 3 percent drop in
November compared with the 17 percent rise in U.S. auto
industry sales.	
 UPSIDE FOR JAPAN STOCKS?	
 The Nikkei rose 1.8 percent to the highest close
since June 22. Trading volume has been picking up as well,
with the 5-day moving average of total turnover holding above
the 20-day moving average for longer than a month. 
 As one of its top trade trades for next year, Goldman
Sachs recommended a bet that the Nikkei will rise 20 percent
from current levels in 2011 based on the view Japan will
continue to ease monetary policy next year even as other
central banks tighten. 
 Analysts at the bank also pointed out the index was
trading at 0.9 times book value despite their forecast for
corporate profits to reach 2007 highs.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1.5 percent after hitting a two-month low on
Monday, with the materials and technology sectors
outperforming. 
 The euro traded at $1.3155 , little changed on the
day. The currency ended the New York session above its 200-day
moving average at $1.3122. In addition, Wednesday's highs and
closing level were both higher than the prior day -- usually a
signal of more gains ahead. 
 With so much hinging on the whims of policymakers though,
the risk of disappointment was high and therefore a resumption
of the euro decline a strong possibility.	
 ""I'd think the euro is quite possibly going to return to
below $1.30,"" said Sean Callow, currency strategist at Westpac
Bank in Sydney. 
 The Australian dollar fought back from early losses at the

China to make a number of trade reforms to open its market to
more U.S. goods and services at a high-level bilateral meeting
this month, the U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
 The Dec. 14-15 U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and
Trade meeting ""provides an important opportunity for us to
address key trade issues such as intellectual property rights,
government procurement and innovation polices with the goal of
supporting our global competitiveness, increasing U.S. exports
and creating jobs in the United States,"" U.S. Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke said in a statement.
 The high-level annual bilateral forum caps a year of
friction between the two countries over China's currency policy
and helps set the stage for Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit
to the United States in January.
 Locke and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk will co-chair
the meeting for the United States, while Chinese Vice Premier
Wang Qishan heads up China's delegation.
 U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will also take part
in the talks, reflecting both the importance of China's huge
market to U.S. farmers and their frustration over China's
restrictions on some U.S. farm goods like beef.
 U.S. officials are likely to hear concern from China over
proposed U.S. legislation that would allow the Commerce
Department to treat currency ""undervaluation"" as a subsidy
under U.S. trade law.
 That bill, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in
September and pending in the Senate, is aimed mainly at China.
 Many U.S. manufacturers complain Beijing undervalues its
currency by 15 percent to 40 percent to give its companies an
unfair price advantage in international trade.
 U.S. companies are looking for progress on a host of other
concerns, including China's ""indigenous innovation"" policies,
which could require foreign companies to develop new patents
and other intellectual property in China to order to win
lucreative government procurement contracts.

 NEW YORK , Dec 1 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
jumped on Wednesday on hopes the United States would further
support debt-burdened euro-zone countries and bets the
European Central Bank could step up its bond-buying program.
 Better-than-anticipated economic data in China, Europe and
the United States also whetted investors' appetite for risk,
driving major U.S. and European stock indexes up more than 2
percent.
 Asia looked set to rise as well, with Japan's Nikkei
futures  rising 225 points in Chicago.
 Portuguese debt costs fell along with those of other
peripheral euro-zone countries as some investors bet the ECB
will take further action at its meeting on Thursday.
 Portugal also was able to sell 500 million euros in
12-month T-bills but, in a sign of sagging investor confidence
in the country, yields paid on the debt rose to a euro
lifetime record of 5.281 percent, from 4.813 percent two weeks
ago.
 The euro jumped 1.2 percent and traded above $1.31, also
lifted by news that the United States would be ready to
support the extension of the European Financial Stability
Facility via additional commitment of cash from the
International Monetary Fund. [ID:nLDE6B023Z]
 ""It seems that as bad as Europe's issues are, there is a
growing sense that this is not a systemic problem that is
going to bring the whole system down,"" said Jack Ablin, chief
investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
 ""Beyond their troubles, we're seeing strong results in
other parts of the world.""
 Some analysts warned, however, that the rebound of the
European single currency seemed to be just temporary.
 ""I personally think the market will be disappointed
tomorrow because the lack of a consensus within the ECB about
bond purchases will cause it to deliver less than what the
market is hoping for,"" said Aston Chan, portfolio manager at
GLC, a $1.2 billion London-based global macro hedge fund.
 Others said dramatic action after the ECB policy meeting
on Thursday was unlikely, but that the spreading euro-zone
debt crisis demanded radical measures at some point.

 In Europe, the euro zone's manufacturing sector expanded
at its fastest pace in four months in November, led by
heavyweights Germany and France. Britain's manufacturing hit a

 TORONTO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was firmer
against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, supported by strong
global economic data and new hope for debt-strapped euro zone
countries.
 The upbeat economic outlook saw riskier assets being bought
across the board, pushing up equities and commodity prices.
 U.S. crude oil futures jumped more than 3 percent to end at
a two-week high as U.S. private sector hiring posted its
biggest gain in three years, while China's manufacturing data
showed signs of robust growth. [O/R]

currencies after Washington showed readiness to back a bigger
EU stability fund and investors bet the European Central Bank
could step up its bond-buying program. [ID:nBRU011183]
[ID:nLDE6B00QU]
 ""The euro is basically embarrassing us all,"" said David
Watt, senior fixed income and currency strategist at RBC
Capital Markets.
 Apart from the euro, commodity currencies such as Canada's
shone, driven largely by the rise in oil prices to above $86 a
barrel.
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0170 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.33 U.S. cents, up
from Tuesday's close at C$1.0266 to the greenback, or 97.41
U.S. cents.
 ""We are getting a relatively sizable bounce. What's going
on in equity markets, some of the easing of concerns about EU
periphery issues, that's all playing out and we've got the data
that came out of the U.S. today which was fairly solid,"" Watt
said.
 ""Our major trading partner is maybe on the road to recovery
once again and the cyclical backdrop might not be as fretful as
it was a month and half to two months ago.""
 The currency's began the new trading month with a strong
advance, after recording a 0.6 percent retreat in November, its
first monthly drop in three months.
 Watt said the 200-day moving average of C$1.0289, tested on
Tuesday, still represented significant resistance for the U.S.
dollar against Canada's.
 BONDS SAG
 Canadian government bonds tracked U.S. Treasuries lower as
appetite for riskier assets such as stocks drew investors away
from the relative safety of government debt.
 The two-year government of Canada bond  was off
10 Canadian cents to yield 1.668 percent, while the 10-year
bond  slipped 85 Canadian cents to yield 3.169
percent.
 In new issues, Canada's auction of 30-year real return
bonds met with weaker than usual demand, after investors pushed
up prices heading into the sale, making the issue less
attractive. [ID:nN01153360]
 Canada's data calendar is bare until Friday when the
November jobs report is published. It will be the last major
piece of data to consider before the Bank of Canada's next
interest rate decision on Dec. 7.
 The market is already pricing near-certainty that the
central bank will leave unchanged the target for the overnight
interest rate at 1 percent.

 NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Wednesday,
snapping a three-day decline, on speculation the European
Central Bank may take bold steps to ease the region's debt
crisis at a meeting on Thursday.
 The euro zone single currency remained vulnerable, however,
given persistent fears about Europe's fiscal problems although
an apparent U.S. pledge on further International Monetary Fund
support pushed the euro to session highs at $1.3183 on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 A U.S. Treasury Department spokesman said on Wednesday,
however, that the United States is not discussing an extra
commitment of funds for a European stabilization fund right
now.
 The euro traded in a two-cent range ahead of Thursday's
meeting where the ECB is expected to keep interest rates
unchanged and possibly announce an extension of crisis support
measures beyond their scheduled expiration in mid-January.
 Some analysts also expect the ECB to keep its three-month
liquidity operations unlimited to help banks struggling for
cash.
 Still, some market participants think the ECB could
disappoint the market given the well-publicized conflict within
the bank about buying bonds. That could prompt a resumption of
the euro's sell-off in fairly short order, analysts said.
 ""I personally think the market will be disappointed
tomorrow because the lack of a consensus within the ECB about
bond purchases will cause it to deliver less than what the
market is hoping for,"" said Aston Chan, portfolio manager at
GLC, a $1.2 billion London-based global macro hedge fund. 
 Chan added that the euro zone crisis has morphed into a
political problem given Germany's doubts about funding more
bailouts. Germany is the euro zone's largest economy and its de
facto lender of last resort.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was up 1.2
percent at $1.3133, pulling away from Tuesday's 2-1/2-month low
of $1.2969 but off the day's highs at $1.3183.
 The euro/dollar moved back above its 200-day simple moving
average at the peak and at current prices would close above
that measure for the first time since Friday.
 A slight narrowing of yield premiums of government debt in
Portugal, Spain, and Italy over safe-haven German bonds also
supported the euro, as did a rise in European stocks and a
decline in the costs of periphery credit default swaps.
 Relief that the Portuguese auction went well helped euro
bulls counter offers at the $1.3090-$1.3100 area.
 EURO -- A SELL ON RALLIES
 Depending on what the ECB announces on Thursday, traders
are still targeting $1.2794, a level representing the 61.8
percent retracement of the June to November rally. A breach of
that should bring the August lows around $1.2600 in sight.
 ""Tomorrow is just one of many bridges that need crossing
before we can properly value euro zone assets; as such the euro
ought to be sold on rallies,"" said Deutsche Bank in a note.
 Investors also cautioned on reading too much into news the
United States would be ready to support an extension of the
European Financial Stability Facility via an extra commitment
of money from the IMF.
 The ""show of support is nice but this is far too vague a
comment to get excited about,"" said GLC's Chan. ""Can the U.S.
help another country given its own deficit problems? How would
that go down with the voters?""
 Analysts and traders said the euro's 9 percent fall from
its Nov. 4 high of $1.4283 to Tuesday's low left many feeling
it was a good time to take profits on short euros.
 The euro's drop below $1.3080 meant it had already retraced
50 percent of its rise from the June low of $1.1876 to the
November high in less than four weeks. Traders said there was
support above $1.2950, where options barriers were reported.
 GLC's Chan said his firm has placed the euro's fair market
valuation in the low $1.20s. ""Although the euro has come down a
lot since that high in November, the peripheral widening of
credit spreads has actually made the euro more
expensive.""

* Top euro partners Holland, France, Italy stand to profit
* Top EU import products cars, machinery components
 
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Imports to Germany should rise by
two percent for every percentage point of annual growth in
German domestic demand, a trade expert from the Ifo economic
think tank said on Wednesday.
 Rising German private consumption -- underlined earlier in
the day by retail data which showed sales recording their
biggest monthly gain since January 2008 -- should thus play an
increasingly important role for European partners.
 ""China may profit the most, but the growth should be spread
among top import partners -- demand for products from countries
like France and Italy will surely rise,"" Ifo trade expert
Steffen Elstner told Reuters.
 An abundance of positive economic data from Europe's
dominant economy in recent months has suggested that Germany
will have enough momentum going into next year to ride out the
debt crisis engulfing parts of the region.
 European Union members like France, who have in the past
decried Germany's traditionally weak consumer spending as a
cause of economic imbalances within the bloc, should find some
satisfaction in the news.
 Germany's main sources of imports -- China, Holland, France,
the U.S. and Italy according to the most recent data from
September -- stand to profit the most from the fresh demand.
 Domestic demand rose 0.4 percent in the third quarter, after
surging 1.8 percent in the second. Signs increasingly point
towards sustained growth into next year, as falling unemployment
increasingly emboldens consumers.
 The falling savings rate is one indicator -- data from the
statistics office shows Germans were saving only 9.6 percent of
their income in the third quarter, as compared to 11 percent in
the second quarter and 15.2 percent in the first.
 Meanwhile, the government's economic advisers expect
consumer spending to grow some 1.5 pct in 2011, while the HDE
retail association sees sales rising by at least 1 percent in
the same year.
 With around 20 percent of German imports dedicated to
consumer goods, a pickup in that sub-component of domestic
demand will stoke demand for products from elsewhere in Europe.
 ""It's mostly cars in France, and also to some extent in
Spain and Italy, although there we import more machinery,
equipment, and industrial components,"" Elstner said.
 One percent of growth in German private consumption over a
year, he said, leads to around 0.2 percent annual growth in
imports. The figure is higher for equipment investment, where a
1 percent rise yields some 0.4 percent growth.

 * Next year's global growth forecast trimmed to 3.1 pct
(Adds quotes from report's author)
 By Patrick Worsnip
 UNITED NATIONS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The world's recovery from
the 2008 financial crisis is losing steam, with growth, hit by
austerity drives in rich countries, not enough to restore the
30 million lost jobs in the next two years, the United Nations
said on Wednesday.
 ""The road to recovery from the Great Recession is proving
to be long, winding and rocky,"" said an annual U.N. survey,
""World Economic Situation and Prospects 2011.""
 ""After a year of fragile and uneven recovery, growth of the
world economy is now decelerating on a broad front, presaging
weaker global growth in the outlook.""
 The report forecast that, after a better-than-expected rate
of 3.6 percent this year, the world economy's growth would slow
to just 3.1 percent next year -- slightly less than a mid-year
U.N. review predicted in May -- and 3.5 percent in 2012.
 The projections were broadly in line with those issued in
the past two months by the International Monetary Fund and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which
both forecast a 4.2 percent rise next year.
 U.N. economists said the discrepancy with their figures was
mainly due to different ways of calculating exchange rates.
 The report said U.S. economic growth was expected to be 2.3
percent next year -- a drop of 0.3 percent on its May forecast
-- after 2.6 percent this year. Growth would be still weaker in
the euro zone at 1.3 percent, and Japan at 1.1 percent.
 The recovery will continue to be driven by developing
countries -- led by China, India and Brazil -- which had
contributed to more than half of global expansion since late
2009, the U.N. report said. But even their growth was expected
to slow to around 6 percent over the next two years.
 ""The core message is that no, we're not out of the woods
yet and still major risks are looming,"" the report's lead
author, Rob Vos, told reporters.
 Tax hikes and spending cuts were also worsening
unemployment, the report said. Saying at least 30 million jobs
had been lost worldwide due to the financial crisis, it
predicted that it would take some five years to restore them.
 NO QUICK FIX
 Weaknesses in developed economies, including sluggish
growth in the United States and debt crises on the periphery of
Europe, were dragging down the global recovery and posing risks
for world economic stability, it said.
 ""There will be no quick fix for the problems these
economies are still facing in the aftermath of the (2008)
financial crisis,"" it said.
 The report implicitly faulted nations that have dropped
stimulus packages in favor of slashing budgets. ""As governments
shift from fiscal stimulus to austerity, the recovery process
is being placed in further jeopardy,"" it said.
 Repeating long-standing U.N. calls for more international
coordination of economic policy, the report urged more stimulus
""to reignite the global economy."" Its cost would be ""low
relative to the growth risk of fiscal consolidation,"" it said.
 ""Withdrawal of stimulus is understandable given the large
fiscal deficits and the mounting public debt in many of the
developed countries, but at the same time we see there's still
a lot of fiscal space available for more stimulus,"" Vos said.
 Focusing on debt reduction without stimulus could be a
""self-defeating strategy"" because failing growth rates could
worsen debt problems, he said.
 The report also queried the policy of ""quantitative easing""
-- or pumping money into the economy by buying government debt.
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a program on Nov. 3 to buy
$600 billion in government bonds by mid-2011.
 ""Further quantitative easing and a further depreciation of
the dollar could be a way for the United States to try to
inflate and export its way out of its large foreign liability
position,"" the report said. ""But it could more likely risk
disruption of trade and financial markets.""
 On the positive side, the report said inflation was likely
to remain low around the world for the next two years, except
in a few Asian economies, while world trade continued to
recover in 2010, although momentum slowed in the second half.

 NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
jumped on Wednesday after Washington showed readiness to
further support debt-burdened euro-zone countries and
investors bet the European Central Bank could step up its
bond-buying program.
 Better-than-anticipated economic data in China, Europe and
the United States also whetted investors' appetite for riskglobally, driving major U.S. and European stock indexes up
more than 2 percent.
 Portuguese debt costs fell along with those of other
peripheral euro-zone countries as some investors bet the ECB
will take further action at its meeting on Thursday.
 Portugal was also able to sell 500 million euros in
12-month T-bills but, in a sign of sagging investor confidence
in the country, yields paid on the debt rose to a euro
lifetime record of 5.281 percent, from 4.813 percent two weeks
ago.
 The euro jumped 1.1 percent and traded above $1.31, also
boosted by news that the United States would be ready to
support the extension of the European Financial Stability
Facility via additional commitment of cash from the
International Monetary Fund. [ID:nBRU011183]
 ""The market's been caught short on euros. Periphery yield
spreads have tightened somewhat, and the market is pricing in
the possibility that the ECB won't be too aggressive
tomorrow,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 Some analysts warned, however, that the rebound of the
European single currency seemed to be just temporary.
 ""I think this is just caution ahead of the ECB meeting
tomorrow,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. ""If anything, this is a
very tentative bounce until we hear from the ECB tomorrow.""
 Others said dramatic action after the ECB policy meeting
on Thursday was unlikely, but that the spreading euro-zone
debt crisis demanded radical measures at some point.

 ECONOMIC DATA BOOST
 Appetite for risky assets also got a boost from
better-than-expected Chinese factory data in November, which
showed one of the world's largest economic engines was in good
health. [ID:nTOE6B004C]
 In Europe, the euro zone's manufacturing sector expanded
at its fastest pace in four months in November, led by
heavyweights Germany and France. Britain's manufacturing hit a
16-year high.
 U.S. private sector payrolls also registered their biggest
rise in three years in November, ADP Employer Services said,
lifting optimism about the job market ahead of Friday's key
government employment report. [ID:nN01127417]
 ""We're going to focus more on China's data today and the
fact that the ADP report came in better than expected,"" said

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded on Wednesday
on hopes the European Central Bank may take bold steps to ease
the region's debt crisis and on news the United States could
back the effort through higher IMF commitments.
 The single euro zone currency remained vulnerable given
persistent fears about Europe's fiscal problems but the U.S.
pledge on International Monetary Fund support pushed the euro
to session highs at $1.3183.
 Traders in general were happy to keep the euro within a
tight range ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting.
 The ECB is expected to keep interest rates unchanged and
possibly announce the extension of crisis support measures
beyond their expiration in mid-January.. Some analysts also
expect the central bank to keep its three-month liquidity
operations unlimited to help banks struggling for cash.
 Still some market participants think the ECB could
disappoint the market given the well-publicized conflict within
the bank about buying bonds. That could prompt a resumption of
the euro's sell-off in fairly short order, analysts said.
 ""I personally think the market will be disappointed
tomorrow because the lack of a consensus within the ECB about
bond purchases will cause it to deliver less than what the
market is hoping for,"" said Aston Chan, portfolio manager at
GLC, a $1.2 billion London-based global macro hedge fund.
 Chan added that the euro zone crisis has morphed into a
political problem given Germany's doubts about funding more
bailouts. Germany is the euro zone's largest economy and its de
facto lender of last resort.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 1.3 percent at
$1.3147, pulling away from Tuesday's 2-1/2-month low at
$1.2969, but off the day's highs at $1.3183.
 A slight narrowing of yield premiums of government debt in
Portugal, Spain, and Italy over safe-haven German bonds also
supported the euro, as did a rise in European stocks and a
decline in the costs of periphery credit default swaps.
 Relief that the Portuguese auction went well helped euro
bulls counter offers at the $1.3090-$1.3100 area.
 EURO -- A SELL ON RALLIES
 Depending on what the ECB announces on Thursday, traders
are still targeting $1.2794, a level representing the 61.8
percent retracement of the June to November rally. A breach of
that should bring the August lows around $1.2600 in sight.
 ""Tomorrow is just one of many bridges that need crossing
before we can properly value euro-zone assets, as such the euro
ought to be sold on rallies,"" said Deutsche Bank in a note.
 Analysts and traders said the euro's 9 percent fall from
its Nov. 4 high of $1.4283 to Tuesday's low left many feeling
it was a good time to take profits on short euros.
 The euro's drop below $1.3080 meant it had already retraced
50 percent of its rise from the June low of $1.1876 to the
November high in less than four weeks. Traders said there was
support above $1.2950, where options barriers were reported.
 GLC's Chan said his firm has placed the euro's fair market
valuation in the low $1.20s. ""Although the euro has come down a
lot since that high in November, the peripheral widening of
credit spreads have actually made the euro more expensive.""
 Overall though, concerns remain that other countries may
follow Ireland and Greece in asking for bailouts, with Portugal
widely seen as next in line, especially after ratings agency
Standard & Poor's on Tuesday put its A- rating on review for
downgrade.times of global expansions and increased risk-taking.
The Australian dollar rose 0.7 percent to US$0.9645.
 The greenback slipped 0.2 percent versus a currency basket
to 80.998, but stayed near a 2 1/2-month high hit on Tuesday as
the currency, the most liquid and therefore considered safe,
has benefited from the euro's problems.
 A bevy of positive U.S. data also added to upbeat sentiment
on the dollar.

895,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2010 12:32PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-WTO's Lamy warns of trade impact of stimulus measures," * WTO to review stimulus, bailout packages in early 2011
 * Protectionist dangers persist
 
 (Adds countries concerned by bailouts, latest trade data)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Stimulus and bailout packages
undertaken to cope with the economic crisis can have an impact
on trade and investment and need to be managed carefully,
according to the head of the World Trade Organization.
 Director-General Pascal Lamy said the WTO would hold a
special meeting in early spring of next year to examine the
effect of those measures on trade and competition.
 ""In the meantime, exit strategies to unwind them should be
transparent and accountable and should not be used as a pretext
to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against foreign traders
or investors,"" he said in his annual report to the WTO on the
international trading environment.
 WTO members will review the report, published on the WTO
website last week, on Dec. 9.
 Argentina, Ecuador, India and South Africa have expressed
concern that stimulus packages or bailouts for industries like
automobiles or banking undertaken by rich and emerging economies
amounted to subsidies that poor nations could not afford and
which in other times would be open to challenge under WTO rules.
 Lamy's report also repeats previous recent warnings of an
increase in protectionist pressures generated by global
imbalances. [ID:nLDE69I1KQ] [ID:nLDE6A22B5]
 Large trade imbalances, high unemployment and disorderly
currency moves had macro-economic causes, he said.
 ""Restricting trade cannot correct those problems, but it
could easily provoke retaliation which would seriously threaten
jobs and growth worldwide,"" Lamy said.
 Another danger to international trade was the accumulation
of restrictive measures, which since the end of 2008 had grown
to cover 1.9 percent of total imports while only 15 percent of
measures introduced since the crisis have been removed.
 New measures introduced between November 2009 and October
2010 cover around 1.2 percent of world imports, especially in
base metals and products, machinery and transport equipment.
 Lamy confirmed the WTO's forecast that world trade (measured
by export volume) would grow by 13.5 percent this year, despite
weaker growth in recent months, with the strongest growth seen
in developing countries in Asia.
 World trade recovered to pre-crisis levels in the middle of
the year following a record 12 percent contraction in 2009.
 But in value terms it has not yet fully regained pre-crisis
levels, data issued by the WTO on Wednesday showed. World trade
in the third quarter of this year was 18 percent higher than a
year earlier, slowing from a 26 percent year-on-year increase in
the second quarter.
 But economic recovery has not been strong enough to have
much impact so far on unemployment levels in many countries,
where the consensus in favour of open trade and investment was
under strain from high jobless rates, he said.
 Despite an improvement in the environment for trade finance
since mid-2009, traders in low-income countries, especially
Africa, still faced difficulties accessing funds at affordable
prices, he said.
 New regulatory requirements were also deterring
international banks from doing business in these areas, he said
in an apparent reference to stricter international banking rules
known as Basel III. [ID:nLDE6AE0S6]

898,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2010 11:04AM ET</span>","World recovery slows, will be hit by austerity-UN"," * Growth rates won't restore lost jobs soon, report says
 * Next year's global growth forecast trimmed to 3.1 pct
 By Patrick Worsnip
 UNITED NATIONS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The world economic
recovery from the 2008 financial crisis is losing steam, with
growth, hit by austerity drives in rich countries, not enough
to restore the 30 million lost jobs in the next two years, the
United Nations said on Wednesday.
 ""The road to recovery from the Great Recession is proving
to be long, winding and rocky,"" said an annual U.N. survey,
""World Economic Situation and Prospects 2011.""
 ""After a year of fragile and uneven recovery, growth of the
world economy is now decelerating on a broad front, presaging
weaker global growth in the outlook.""
 The report forecast that, after a better-than-expected rate
of 3.6 percent this year, the world economy's growth would slow
to just 3.1 percent next year -- slightly less than a mid-year
U.N. review predicted in May -- and 3.5 percent in 2012.
 The projections were broadly in line with those issued in
the past two months by the International Monetary Fund and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which
both forecast a 4.2 percent rise next year.
 U.N. economists said the discrepancy with the U.N. figures
was mainly accounted for by different ways of calculating
exchange rates.
 The report said U.S. economic growth was expected to be 2.3
percent next year -- a drop of 0.3 percent on its May forecast
-- after 2.6 percent this year. Growth would be still weaker in
the euro zone at 1.3 percent, and Japan at 1.1 percent.
 The recovery will continue to be driven by developing
countries -- led by China, India and Brazil -- which had
contributed to more than half of global expansion since late
2009, the U.N. report said. But even their growth was expected
to slow to around 6 percent over the next two years.
 Tax hikes and spending cuts were also worsening the
employment situation, it said. Saying at least 30 million jobs
had been lost worldwide due to the financial crisis, it
predicted that it would take some five years to restore them.
 NO QUICK FIX
 Weaknesses in developed economies, including sluggish
growth in the United States and debt crises on the periphery of
Europe, were dragging down the global recovery and posing risks
for world economic stability, it said.
 ""There will be no quick fix for the problems these
economies are still facing in the aftermath of the (2008)
financial crisis,"" it said.
 The report implicitly faulted nations that have dropped
stimulus packages in favor of slashing budgets. ""As governments
shift from fiscal stimulus to austerity, the recovery process
is being placed in further jeopardy,"" it said.
 Repeating long-standing U.N. calls for more international
coordination of economic policy, the report urged more stimulus
""to reignite the global economy."" Its cost would be ""low
relative to the growth risk of fiscal consolidation,"" it said.
 The report also queried the policy of ""quantitative easing""
-- or pumping money into the economy by buying government debt.
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a program on Nov. 3 to buy
$600 billion in government bonds by mid-2011.
 ""Further quantitative easing and a further depreciation of
the dollar could be a way for the United States to try to
inflate and export its way out of its large foreign liability
position,"" the report said. ""But it could more likely risk
disruption of trade and financial markets.""
 On the positive side, the report said inflation was likely
to remain low around the world for the next two years, except
in a few Asian economies, while world trade continued to
recover in 2010, although momentum slowed in the second half.
 Global oil demand was expected to increase further next
year, but at a more moderate pace, with most of the demand
growth continuing to come from emerging economies, especially
China and India, it said.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Manufacturing in China
and India accelerated last month even as a debt crisis caused
turmoil in Europe, while U.S. factory output growth slowed
slightly but still posted a 16th straight month of expansion.
 Two Chinese purchasing managers' indexes registered their

 ASIAN GROWTH ... AND INFLATION?
 There was little sign that Europe's trouble was hurting
global econmic growth, driven by Asia's powerhouse economies.
 But the strong manufacturing surveys also highlighted a
worry for investors: rising inflationary pressure in China and
India and the need for more monetary tightening in economies
that have driven much of the global recovery.
 That, rather than Europe's debt troubles, could pose the
biggest threat to global economic growth.
 ""Good news from the economy may not be that good for the
market as it is concerned about more tightening,"" said Ting Lu,
an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. ""The high PMI
reading could convince Beijing to tighten a bit more.""
 China raised interest rates in October for the first time
in nearly three years and most analysts still expect two to
four more increases by the end of next year.
 India has already raised interest rates six times this
year, and its strong PMI followed data on Tuesday that showed
its economy grew by 8.9 percent in the September quarter
compared to a year earlier. Traders for now do not expect
another rate hike until early next year. [ID:nBMA009007]
 Thailand's central bank surprised financial markets on
Wednesday by raising its benchmark interest rate, while the
Reserve Bank of Australia raised rates earlier this month.
 Attempts to rein in growth in Asia could be a bitter pill
to swallow, with Europe teetering on the brink of more serious
debt troubles and U.S. growth that still seems fragile.
 In Japan, the picture is bleak.
 Prolonged economic weakness may keep Japan in deflation
longer than the Bank of Japan's current forecast, a member of
its policy board said on Wednesday, offering the bleakest view
to date by a central bank policymaker.
 Board member Miyako Suda said there was a strong chance
Japan's economy would contract in the final quarter of this
year after strong growth in July-September. [ID:nTOE6B002F]

 * Governor King says main worry is global economy
 * Inflation stands in way of further policy action for now
 
 By Matt Falloon
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is in danger of
overestimating the strength of Britain's recovery, raising the
chances it will have to inject more stimulus to counter the
shock waves from Europe's debt crisis and the UK fiscal squeeze.
 Britain's economy has bounced back surprisingly well from an
18-month recession and inflation has held well above the central
bank's two percent target this year, forcing many investors to
take bets on further quantitative easing off the table.
 A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed only a third of analysts
think the BoE will restart its asset purchase scheme
[ID:nLDE6AT1WQ] and a key manufacturing survey put activity at a
six-year high and jobs growth at a record pace this month.
 But the Irish crisis, and fears that others in the euro zone
may soon need help, increase the risk that the BoE may need to
act next year to support a recovery that was meant to be driven
by exports and a credit-reliant private sector.
 There is also a chance, as central bank dove Adam Posen
argues, that the BoE has underestimated the impact of Britain's
push to all but eliminate a record budget deficit by 2015, which
starts in earnest next year.
 ""The economic recovery will be much weaker than the Monetary
Policy Committee expects,"" said Vicky Redwood, a senior UK
analyst at Capital Economics. 
 ""Once the signs that the financial problems (in Europe) are
translating into big economic problems, then they'll start to
get worried about the prospects for UK exports.""
 The government wants to see the private sector expand
rapidly to take up the slack as it slashes departmental spending
by about 20 percent over four years. Ministers also want a
rebalancing of the economy towards exports.
 It is in these areas where some of the biggest dangers lie. 
 With Britain's top export market -- Europe -- embroiled in a
sovereign debt crisis, there is a real danger that, despite
sustained weakness in sterling, export demand will fail to
sustain the recovery at rates which will drive economic growth.
 ""Over 60 percent of our exports go to a part of the world
that isn't exhibiting particularly buoyant growth and clearly
has quite significant challenges within the area in terms of
sovereign debt,"" BoE Governor Mervyn King said this month.
 A private sector-led recovery also needs credit and there
has been little evidence that banks are eager to return to
pre-credit crunch levels of lending.
 Financial market ructions across Europe have not helped.
 ""Recent events in the last month have made everyone more
pessimistic,"" said Ray Barrell, director of macroeconomic
research and forecasting at the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research. ""If the economy is significantly slower,
they may have to think about it (QE) again.""
 
 COUNTARGUMENT: TIME TO TIGHTEN
 Some analysts and BoE hawk Andrew Sentance argue the central
bank has done enough already -- slashing interest rates to a
record low of 0.5 percent and embarking on an unprecedented 200
billion pound ($312 billion) asset-buying spree which it halted
earlier this year.
 With inflation set to stay strong next year because of a
rise in VAT sales tax, they say the next move should be a slow
tightening of interest rates to counter price pressures and
maintain confidence in the BoE's inflation-busting credentials.
 ""There's been a huge amount of stimulus pumped into the
economy,"" said George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank.
""The balance of risks is moving away from more QE to rate
increases next year.""
 But the central bank could argue that since it is
forecasting inflation below target on the two-year horizon at
which it calibrates policy it could embark on another round of
asset-buying with new money even if price pressures are high in
2011.
 The Federal Reserve has already done so in the United
States.
 The risks to the Bank's forecasts -- it is expecting the
economy to expand by about 2.6 percent next year, accelerating
to more than 3 percent growth in 2012 and beyond -- are large.
 Those estimates, updated on Nov. 10, are among the highest
out there. The consensus among economists is for growth of about
1.9 percent in 2011 and around 1.8 percent in 2012.
 The Bank has proved too optimistic before.
 ""They have had to slash their growth forecasts over the last
few years,"" Buckley said.
 This week, Britain's independent Office for Budget
Responsibility, whose forecasts feed into fiscal policy, cut its
estimates for 2011 to 2.1 percent and for 2012 to 2.6 percent.
 If the BoE's forecasts are too high, inflation could fall
even lower below target in the medium term and strengthen the
case for action.
 ""It's premature to completely write it (more QE) off,"" said
Moyeen Islam, a gilts strategist at Barclays Capital. 
 ""I think the market -- particularly if the fiscal problems
in Europe remain, and banks highlight the external risks to the
economy from that -- might creep to pricing more QE in.""

905,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2010 09:24AM ET</span>",FEATURE-Egypt's consumer boom tempts foreign investors," * Growing consumption helps Egypt shrug off downturn 
 * Young middle class spends more in cafes, restaurants 
 * Millions of poor left out as middle class gets wealthier 
 
 By Sherine El Madany and Shaimaa Fayed
 CAIRO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The owners of Cairo's City Stars
mall like to compare it to a Pharaonic temple, and its cavernous
halls and acres of cream marble might have stirred jealousy in
the most luxuriant of Egypt's ancient rulers.
 Many brands on display -- such as Zara, Hush Puppies or Etam
-- may seem drearily familiar to a Western eye, but the vast
shopping centre drew bigger crowds than the Pyramids of Giza in
the year after it opened, underlining Egypt's growing reputation
as a frontier retail market with major potential.
 The French cakes, Spanish socks, Asian meals and skimpy
Brazilian underwear available in City Stars are out of reach to
most Egyptians, a fifth of whom struggle on less than $1 a day,
according to a United Nations estimate.
 Free-market reforms that spurred years of strong economic
growth have not created enough jobs to rid Cairo of its teeming
slums, but they do make it easier to invest, to import and sell
to the middle class and repatriate the profits.
 Growing purchasing power and a consumer base expected to
grow at 2 percent per year is keeping foreign investors upbeat
on Egypt, outweighing the downside of red tape, inflation and
uncertainty over the future leadership as the country heads
towards a presidential election in 2011.
 Those Egyptians with money left over after feeding their
families can spend it in a plethora of malls, hypermarkets and
boutiques that have sprung up in Egypt's big cities in a decade.
 ""Ten years ago, my husband and I did all our shopping
abroad. Now I buy almost everything here -- clothes,
electronics, kid's toys, everything,"" said Dina Ahmed, a
42-year-old marketing executive visiting City Stars.
 Tax cuts, privatisations and other reforms since 2004 pushed
Egypt's economy to its fastest growth in almost two decades,
reaching 7.2 percent before the global financial crisis hit.
 The economy fared better than many more developed economies
during the downturn, growing by around 5 percent, with analysts
forecasting 5.5 percent in the year to the end of June 2011.
 ""The market in Egypt is different to any other market. There
was recession abroad that was not felt. There were problems in
Dubai, Kuwait and Lebanon. But we didn't feel it,"" said Adel Al
Bana, senior operations manager of Fashion International Group,
which brought brands including Mango to Egypt.
 
 PRIVATISED PARADISE
 City Stars, which lies far from central Cairo and near the
main airport, drew an annual 22 million visitors when it opened
three years ago, according to analysts. About 12.5 million
tourists came to Egypt in 2009, government figures show.
 Much of the appeal lies in its 6,000 car park spaces and
shiny-clean air conditioned interior, which contrasts with many
older, open-air Cairo shopping areas with their grimy, uneven
and pot-holed pavements, pollution and sweltering summer heat.
 The scale of the $800 million complex has ensured its
cachet, with a 21-screen cinema, 643 shopping outlets, dozens of
restaurants and cafes, prayer room and medical centre, but new
rivals are getting in on the game.
 ""Imagine over 5,000,000 customers with great purchasing
power are waiting for Dandy Mega Mall to open within 30 minutes
radius from the center's location,"" said another mall on its Web
site, which promises a ""5-star luxury boutique motel"".
 With an overwhelmingly young middle class, the Arab world's
most populous country has a thriving eating-out culture, with
new food courts and mall coffee-shops buzzing with customers.
 ""Outings and gatherings are always surrounded with food. My
friends and I mainly meet in cafes, and that's why you find
cafes opening up everywhere,"" said student Mohamed Nabil, 22.
 Statistics from state-run CAPMAS agency say Egyptians spend
43 percent of their incomes on food and beverages. Beltone
consumer goods analyst Kamal Khedr said the sector is especially
attractive during an economic downturn.
 Egypt's only initial public offering since early 2008 was
carried out by dairy and juice maker Juhayna Food Industries
, which was oversubscribed 6.8 times. [ID:nLDE65924A]
 
 ROBUST DEMAND
 EFG-Hermes economist Mohamed Abu Basha said private
consumption will represent almost three quarters of Egypt's GDP
this year and was the main reason the economy grew 4.7 percent
in 2008-9 even while the global economy was in turmoil.
 ""We ... are selling Egypt as a domestic demand player. Given
lower global growth, everyone is looking at resilient
countries,"" he said.
 EFG-Hermes forecast that foreign direct investment would
rise to $8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year, close to
pre-crisis levels, up from $6.8 billion in 2009-10.
 Analysts say Swedish firm Electrolux's  2.7
billion Egyptian pound deal to buy Egyptian appliance maker
Olympic Group  in October showed a growing a foreign
desire to tap Egypt's consumer market.
 Investors remain wary ahead of a 2011 presidential election
in which President Hosni Mubarak has not said whether he would
run for a sixth six-year term.
 ""Until the elections are over, political risk is embedded in
the price. You can't expect a growth of 30 percent without risk.
Political risk is the highest risk now in Egypt,"" said Beltone
consumer goods analyst Hamed Hesham.
 Government critics say the poor are failing to benefit from
the spending of the new middle class, many of whom live far out
of town in desert villa settlements.
 Double-digit inflation this year has pushed the goods in
City Stars further out of the reach of Egypt's working class.
 ""The trickle-down effect is not felt. The wealthy are
getting wealthier, and the poor are getting poorer, and the gap
is expanding,"" Beltone's Khedr said.

 * Reflects sector's prominence during economic slump
 
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Britain's private accountancy
sector is to more than double its bonus payouts to 1.3 billion
pounds ($2 billion) this year compared with last, a recruitment
company survey said on Wednesday.
 Recruitment firm Ambition said the surge, which contrasts
with an expected decline at many investment banks, reflected the
industry's increased importance during the economic slump.
 ""When times are tough, businesses turn to the accountancy
department to tighten the company belt and weed out areas of
overspending,"" said Ambition managing director Tim Gilbert.
 ""Accountants are often the unsung heroes of recessions as
they keep a keen eye on the bottom line and help steer companies
out of trouble,"" he added.
 In October, the Centre for Economics & Business Research
said that Britain's City finance district was set for 7 billion
pounds ($10.9 billion) worth of bonuses in 2010, down 4 percent
from 2009..
 However, some parts of the City may still pay out bumper
bonuses for 2010, such as top-performing hedge funds or private
equity firms.
 Standard Chartered said last week it had pulled out of a
pact among Britain's top banks to moderate their bonus packages.

 The world's accountancy sector is dominated by the ""Big
Four"" firms of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst & Young
and KPMG.
 The accountancy sector has come under scrutiny in the wake
of the financial crisis as regulators have questioned their
evaluation of debt assets whose value plummeted during the
credit crunch, causing taxpayers to bail out banks.

 * Protectionist dangers persist
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Stimulus and bailout packages
undertaken to cope with the economic crisis can have an impact
on trade and investment and need to be managed carefully,
according to the head of the World Trade Organization.
 Director-General Pascal Lamy said the WTO would hold a
special meeting in early spring of next year to examine the
effect of those measures on trade and competition.
 ""In the meantime, exit strategies to unwind them should be
transparent and accountable and should not be used as a pretext
to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against foreign traders
or investors,"" he said in his annual report to the WTO on the
international trading environment.
 WTO members will review the report, published on the WTO
website last week, on Dec. 9.
 Several developing countries have expressed concern that
stimulus packages or bailouts for industries like automobiles or
banking undertaken by rich and emerging economies amounted to
subsidies that poor nations could not afford and which in other
times would be open to challenge under WTO rules.
 Lamy's report also repeats previous recent warnings of an
increase in protectionist pressures generated by global
imbalances.
 Large trade imbalances, high unemployment and disorderly
currency moves had macro-economic causes, he said.
 ""Restricting trade cannot correct those problems, but it
could easily provoke retaliation which would seriously threaten
jobs and growth worldwide,"" Lamy said.
 Another danger to international trade was the accumulation
of restrictive measures, which since the end of 2008 had grown
to cover 1.9 percent of total imports while only 15 percent of
measures introduced since the crisis have been removed.
 New measures introduced between November 2009 and October
2010 cover around 1.2 percent of world imports, especially in
base metals and products, machinery and transport equipment.
 Lamy confirmed the WTO's forecast that world trade (measured
by export volume) would grow by 13.5 percent this year, despite
weaker growth in recent months, with the strongest growth seen
in developing countries in Asia.
 World trade recovered to pre-crisis levels in the middle of
the year following a record 12 percent contraction in 2009.
 But economic recovery has not been strong enough to have
much impact so far on unemployment levels in many countries,
where the consensus in favour of open trade and investment was
under strain from high jobless rates, he said.
 Despite an improvement in the environment for trade finance
since mid-2009, traders in low-income countries, especially
Africa, still faced difficulties accessing funds at affordable
prices, he said.
 New regulatory requirements were also deterring
international banks from doing business in these areas, he said
in an apparent reference to stricter international banking rules
known as Basel III.

 * Portugal's one-year borrowing costs soar
 
 (Updates throughout with detail, comment)
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Germany encountered the worst
demand for its five-year debt in over six months at a sale on
Wednesday as low yields and growing concern over the cost to
Berlin of future aid payments eroded appetite for its bonds.
 Portugal's one-year borrowing costs hit euro lifetime highs
at a bill sale as investors fretted Lisbon would follow Ireland
and Greece in seeking emergency funding from the EU and the IMF.
 The German government sold 4.13 billion euros of the
re-opened 1.75 percent five-year Bobl note for an average yield
of 1.73 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.1, the lowest
achieved since May this year.
 ""Simply, market volatility is keeping a lot of investors on
the sidelines. We've seen yields jumping back and forth from one
day to another, not just periphery yields but also the core,""
Michael Leister, strategist at WestLB said.
 ""On the other hand, there seems to be growing concern out
there that at the end of the day Germany has to support the
whole euro system and will eventually have to pay the bill.""
 The German Finance Agency, the federal government's debt
management office, as usual retained some of the issue for
""market smoothing"" purposes -- 0.87 billion euros this time.
 However, with the total amount on offer at 5 billion euros,
external bids did not cover all the paper for sale, a similar
result to last week's Bund auction.
 The last sale of this paper achieved an average yield of
1.65 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.6.
 
 YIELDS CREEP UP
 Although yields on the five-year Bobl are low by historical
standards, having averaged 1.797 percent so far this year,
compared with 2.397 percent in 2009, this was the highest yield
achieved at a five-year auction since April.
 This also marked the second consecutive rise in yields
achieved at auction after three successive declines.
 Portugal meanwhile sold 500 million euros worth of 12-month
bills for an average yield of 5.281 percent, up from 4.813
percent at the previous sale of this maturity on Nov. 17.
 While the bid-to-cover ratio rose to 2.5 from 1.8 at the
last sale of 12-month paper, the achieved yield was the highest
for the euro area, reflecting a rise in market pressure for the
country to seek an international bailout.
 ""There is no place to hide on the curve for Portugal any
more. Once again, the auction increases pressure to find a
circuit-breaker to limit the damage, which is most likely to
mean asking for aid,"" said David Schnautz, debt strategist at
Commerzbank in London.
 The premium investors demand to hold Portugese 10-year debt
over benchmark German Bunds fell by 22 basis points to 426
basis points with traders saying the European Central Bank was
buying debt of the euro zone's weakest sovereigns. The
Portuguese spread hit its highest since the launch of the euro
in mid-November at nearly 480 basis points.

 (Adds quotes, detail)
 By Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Germany said on Wednesday a euro
zone nation can ""in principle"" become insolvent, but reassured
its own taxpayers they would not end up footing the bill for any
rescue package against the will of the German people.
 With the crisis in the 16-nation currency bloc deeping after
the Irish bailout on fears that euro-zone member states might be
forced to default on their debt, German Economy Minister Rainer
Bruederle said Portugal and Spain were not going to need help.
 But he did allow for the possibility that a euro-zone member
nation could default in theory and addressed wariness in Germany
about having to bail out more of its euro zone partners.
 Such rescue deals required unanimity and could not be pushed
through ""against the will of Germany"", he said.
 ""Our taxpayers won't go along with everything,"" said the
minister, referring to the feeling in Germany that it has become
the ""paymaster"" of its struggling partners, first with the Greek
bailout and euro zone rescue mechanism, and then with Ireland.
 Bruederle also stressed any tool for assisting debt-ridden
euro-zone economies ""must not become transfer mechanisms"", but
should just buy time for economic problems to be corrected.
 The minister emphasized that without close cooperation
between Germany and France, who have forced some of their ideas
on the design of future euro-zone crisis measures upon their EU
partners, ""not much would get achieved"" in Europe.
 
 ""RESCUE OUR MONEY""
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced criticism among
European policymakers for driving up euro zone debt costs, and
even prompting the Irish crisis, with her insistence on private
investors sharing in the risk of future euro zone debt crises.
 She roiled currency and bond markets last week by stressing
the ""exceptionally serious"" plight of the euro and saying a new
euro zone rescue mechanism taking effect from mid-2013 should
involve banks and investors facing potential losses too.
 Bruederle was speaking as a guest at the launch of a book by
a former head of the Germany industry federation BDI, Hans-Olaf
Henkel, titled ""Rescue Our Money"". One of Henkel's proposals is
to split the euro zone in two, with northern Europe in one camp
and southern euro countries like Spain and Italy in another.
 This would ""reflect the differences in mentality between
different countries"", said Henkel.
 The centre-right German government has repeatedly reaffirmed
its commitment to the euro while insisting that those receiving
aid adhere to strict conditions, including deep spending cuts.
 German public support for solidarity with the likes of
Greece and Ireland is precarious: in an opinion poll for Focus
magazine, 48 percent were in favour and 47 percent against.
 Some statements on the crisis by German leaders are aimed at
addressing potential concerns about the bailouts raised by
Germany's constitutional court, which has rulings pending on the
Greek and broader euro rescue packages agreed in May.
 Its rulings are expected next year and if they ruled the
bailouts unconstitutional, Germany would be blocked from
participating, pushing the euro zone deeper into crisis.
 Merkel also faces half a dozen difficult state elections
next year, having already lost control of North Rhine-Westphalia
state this year partly because of the unpopular Greek bailout.

(Adds Reuters poll, comment from IMF report, background)
 By Orathai Sriring
 BANGKOK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank
surprised financial markets on Wednesday by raising its
benchmark interest rate 25 basis points to 2.0 percent and made
it clear there would be further tightening to curb inflation,
pushing up the baht.
 Most economists had expected no change because of
uncertainty about the global economy and the likelihood of
higher rates making the currency even stronger, when exporters
are already complaining they can no longer compete..
 The central bank said the economy was expected to grow next
year due to robust domestic demand, and repeated that keeping
rates low for too long would cause problems.
 Economists said its statement was surprisingly hawkish and
they expected rates to rise to 2.75 percent by the end of 2011,
according to a Reuters snap poll.. Many of them saw another
quarter-point rise in January.
 ""We keep our forecast of further rate rises, it's just a
matter of time. If the baht is not too strong and capital
inflows are not heavy, we think they may gradually increase
rates next year by at least another 75 basis points,"" said
Thanomsri Fongarunrung, an economist at Phatra Securities.
 In an annual report on the Thai economy compiled in
September but published on Wednesday after the rate decision,
the International Monetary Fund said policy rates were far from
neutral and significant adjustments would eventually be needed.
 ""Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook,
staff agree that interest rate normalisation should nonetheless
proceed gradually, as evidence accumulates that the recovery is
truly becoming entrenched,"" it said.
 The baht rose to 30.02 per dollar after the rate decision,
against 30.09/14 just before. Five-year government bond yields
rose about 5 basis points to 3.05 percent.
 SUBDUED INFLATION
 Data earlier on Wednesday showed inflation remained subdued
for now, holding at 2.8 percent in November, with core
inflation also unchanged from October at 1.1 percent..
 However, the central bank has said core inflation could
breach its 0.5-3.0 percent target range next year and it
highlighted such concerns in its statement on Wednesday.
 ""Inflationary pressure, while stable at present, is
expected to rise in line with rising input costs due to rising
demand pressure on the back of economic expansion. As a result,
pressure on core inflation, going forward, is expected to
rise,"" it said.
 A similar picture is emerging in other Asian countries,
with a jump in input prices recorded in manufacturing surveys
from both China and India on Wednesday.
Barclays Capital noted that utility subsidies might be
extended next year and that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva
had indicated the government may approve a larger-than-normal
increase in minimum wages in 2011 to support low-income
workers.
 ""Such a move would be likely to stimulate domestic demand
further as the marginal propensity to consume tends to be
higher among lower income levels,"" it said.
 The central bank had kept its policy rate steady in
October, pausing after increases in July and August that had
taken it to 1.75 percent from a record low of 1.25 percent held
since April 2009 to help the economy recover from the global
economic crisis.
 Some Asian central banks, such as those in Malaysia and
Indonesia, kept rates on hold last month because of similar
concerns, although South Korea, India and Australia tightened
policy to curb inflation.
 Thailand, like other emerging markets in Asia, has
attracted heavy inflows of funds, drawn by relatively fast
economic growth compared with the West, but that has raised
fears about possible asset price bubbles and an uncompetitive
exchange rate.
 However, the Bank of Thailand said interest rates were not
the only factor attracting capital inflows.
 And although recent data showed the economy slipped into a
technical recession in the third quarter, the central bank is
still forecasting growth of 7.3 to 8.0 percent this year and
3.0 to 5.0 percent in 2011. The IMF repeated its forecast of
7.5 percent and 4 percent respectively.

 * Yield spreads for Portugal, Spain vs Germany tighten
 * Focus on ECB meet, liquidity ops, possible bond buys
(Adds comment, updates throughout)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Wednesday as a
three-day selling spree lost steam, but doubts about whether the
euro zone can contain debt problems facing some states kept the
single currency in range of a 2 1/2-month low versus the dollar.
 A slight narrowing of yield premiums of government debt in
Portugal, Spain and Italy over safe-haven German bonds also
supported the euro, but market participants said the single
currency remained vulnerable to more selling.
 Investors awaited a European Central Bank policy meeting on
Thursday. Some expect the central bank to keep its three-month
liquidity operations unlimited to help banks struggling for
cash, which analysts said was also supporting the euro.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on Tuesday suggested the
central bank may expand purchases of government bonds to help
drive down rocketing yields.
 ""The market's been caught short on euros. Periphery yield
spreads have tightened somewhat, and the market's pricing in the
possibility that the ECB won't be too aggressive tomorrow,"" said
Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 ""The euro's come down quite quickly from $1.40, so some
people just want to take a breather.""
 Investors largely brushed off a relatively smooth auction of
12-month Portuguese Treasury bills even as Lisbon was required
to pay a premium on its borrowing as its fiscal problems mount.
 Still, many believe investors are still speculating that
other countries may follow Ireland and Greece in asking for
bailouts, and any suggestions of this would drag the euro lower.
 Portugal is widely seen as being next in line for a bailout.
Ratings agency S&P on Tuesday put its A-minus rating on review
for possible downgrade.
 By 1114 GMT, the euro had climbed 1 percent to the day's
high of $1.3111, pulling away from a 2 1/2-month low of $1.2969
hit on Tuesday.
 Some traders said the euro was supported around $1.2950,
which was seen to be the bottom of a selling target. Others
suspected options at that level were due to expire on Friday.
 Still, many in the market believe euro trading will become
more volatile in the near term, with one-month implied
volatility in the currency climbing to roughly 16 percent early
on Wednesday, its highest since June.
 
 DOLLAR SLIDES
 The euro's rise lifted other currencies also considered to
be higher risk, including the Australian dollar. The Aussie rose
0.6 percent to $0.9630, recouping earlier losses versus the U.S.
currency suffered on weak economic growth data.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc fell to 1.0066 francs per dollar,
its weakest since late September.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat on the day at 83.70.
 The greenback slipped 0.5 percent versus a currency basket
to 80.795, but stayed near a 2 1/2-month high hit on Tuesday as
the currency, the most liquid and therefore considered safe, has
benefited from the euro's problems.
 Euro zone debt problems are also raising the cost of
accessing dollar cash for companies and banks.
 While dollar interest rates such as three-month LIBOR have
risen only slightly in the past few days, euro/dollar basis swap
spreads have risen sharply in recent weeks in a possible sign
that some euro zone banks are trying to raise dollar cash
through swaps.
 Analysts said any move by the ECB to loosen its policy
stance or extend bond buying on Thursday may help to stabilise
market sentiment.
 ""The rhetoric and action by the ECB will become more
actively targeted at securing some stability in the sovereign
bond market. This ... should help support the euro or at least
re-introduce some two-way risk,"" analysts at Credit Agricole
said in a note.

with neighbour and major trade partner Iran, a senior Dubai
economy official said on Wednesday, as pressure on Tehran to
curb its uranium enrichment drive keeps mounting.
 The United Arab Emirates, to which Dubai belongs, has
signalled it will rein back its role as a trading and financial
lifeline for Iran after the U.N. Security Council imposed a
fourth round of sanctions on Iran in June over accusations it is
developing a nuclear bomb.
 ""It's never an option to end trade with Iran,"" Sami
al-Qamzi, director general of Dubai's Department of Economic
Development, told reporters on the sidelines of an event.
 Asked what effect sanctions would have on Dubai's economy,
he said: ""There will be a weight, there will be an impact, but
we hope that through negotiations we'll come to a solution to
reduce the negative impact.""
 ""This is a federal issue, the UAE will comply with all the
resolutions...,"" he said.
 Talks between Iran and a representative of the six major
powers -- the United States, France, Russia, Britain, China and
Germany -- are due to resume next week in Geneva in the first
such meeting in more than year.
 Tehran rejects the charge it is seeking to develop nuclear
bombs.
 Separately, Qamzi told reporters that Dubai's economy was
expected to grow 3-3.5 percent in 2011, while inflation should
remain at or below 4 percent.
 ""We are forecasting 3 to 3.5 percent growth in 2011,"" he
said, adding: ""This year it is around 4 percent and we hope that
inflation will stay or be less than 4 percent.""

 * Euro zone PMI up but country divergence remains wide

 By Jonathan Cable and Langi Chiang
 LONDON/BEIJING, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Manufacturers in China and
India cranked up the pace of production last month and Germany
and France led the way in Europe, offering a boost to the global
economy in spite of a spreading euro zone debt crisis.
 But while strong numbers from the largest European economies
provide good news for policymakers worried about the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe's single currency bloc, they highlighted a
growing divergence among its members.
 Data from Germany showed its manufacturing sector expanded
significantly faster last month than in October while France's
PMI bounced to a level not seen in 10 years.
 Italian numbers showed conditions improved at their weakest
rate for nine months, however, and Spanish manufacturing
stagnated.
 Ireland, which accepted an 85-billion-euro European Union
emergency aid package on Sunday, saw a slight upturn in activity
but still below levels needed for a meaningful recovery and
Greek manufacturing activity contracted as it has done for the
past 15 months.
 ""It is worrying to see Italian activity lose momentum in
addition to ongoing weak activity in Spain, Ireland and,
especially, Greece,"" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.
 The Irish bailout has failed to reassure investors and
global officials are also focusing on the problem, with the G20
deputy finance ministers holding a teleconference about it on
Monday and a top U.S. Treasury official travelling to Europe.
 European policymakers came out in force on Tuesday to try to
calm markets, with European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet warning that pundits were underestimating the
determination of governments to keep the euro zone stable.
 But markets paid little attention, targeting Portugal, Spain
and Italy only days after the EU came to Ireland's aid.
 Outside the euro zone, British manufacturing activity leapt
unexpectedly to a 16-year high in November.
 
 ASIAN GROWTH ... AND INFLATION?
 For all the maelstrom in Europe, there is little sign it is
derailing global economic recovery, driven by Asian powerhouses.
 Signs of robust growth in China helped lift world stocks on
Wednesday while the euro halted its recent slide.
 Two Chinese purchasing managers' indexes registered their
strongest readings in seven months and the story was similar in
India, where the HSBC Markit PMI climbed to a six-month high.
 But the surveys also highlighted a worry for investors:
rising inflationary pressure in China and India and the need for
more monetary tightening in economies which have driven a large
part of the global recovery.
 That, rather than Europe's debt troubles, could pose the
biggest threat to global economic growth.
 ""Good news from the economy may not be that good for the
market as it is concerned about more tightening,"" said Ting Lu,
an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
 ""The high PMI reading could convince Beijing to tighten a
bit more on the margin.""
 China raised interest rates in October for the first time in
nearly three years and most analysts still expect 2-4 more
increases by the end of next year although for now it is
focusing on raising banks' required reserves to drain excess
cash from the economy and prevent inflation taking off.
 India has already raised interest rates six times this year
and its strong PMI followed data on Tuesday that showed its
economy grew by a blistering 8.9 percent in the September
quarter from a year earlier.
 That is likely to add pressure on the central bank to
continue raising rates, though traders do not expect another
hike until early next year.
 Thailand's central bank surprised financial markets on
Wednesday by raising its benchmark interest rate, while the
Reserve Bank of Australia raised rates earlier this month.
 Attempts to rein in runaway growth in Asia could be a bitter
pill to swallow with Europe teetering on the brink of more
serious debt troubles and the United States showing only
tentative signs of picking up.
 The Institute for Supply Management is expected to say later
on Wednesday that the pace of manufacturing growth in the U.S.,
the world's biggest economy, tailed off last month.
 And in Japan, the picture is bleak.
 Prolonged economic weakness may keep Japan in deflation
longer than the Bank of Japan's current forecast, a member of
its policy board said on Wednesday, offering the bleakest view
to date by a central bank policymaker.
 Board member Miyako Suda said there was a strong chance
Japan's economy would contract in the final quarter of this year
after strong growth in July-September.

 By Luke Baker and John O'Donnell
 BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is
under pressure to unveil new steps to stabilize the euro zone
when it meets on Thursday as the currency bloc battles a
crippling debt crisis that has stoked contagion fears in the
United States and Asia.
 Germany struggled to sell its government debt on Wednesday
and Portugal's borrowing costs soared in further signs that an
85 billion-euro ($110.7-billion) EU/IMF rescue of Ireland last
weekend and public assurances from leaders that the euro will
be defended at any cost have failed to impress investors.
 European Union leaders appeared to pass the baton to the
ECB, which holds its monthly meeting on Thursday. Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said recent EU actions
provided a sound basis for further stabilization measures by
the central bank, and European Commission President Jose Manuel
Barroso said he was confident the ECB would take whatever
action was needed.
 ""I'm sure the ECB is analyzing the current situation and
that it will take the decisions necessary to guarantee the
financial stability of the euro zone,"" he said.
 In Washington, the White House said President Barack Obama
was receiving regular updates during his daily economic
briefings, while a senior Treasury official was heading to
Berlin for talks on the economic situation after meetings on
Wednesday in Madrid.
 ""It's important to the global economy and to our economic
recovery,"" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. A senior
G20 source in Asia also told Reuters that deputy finance
ministers discussed the situation on Monday..
 A U.S. official also told Reuters that Washington would
support boosting an EU rescue facility via IMF funds, news that
bolstered the euro currency. ""It is up to the Europeans,"" the
U.S. official said. ""We will certainly support using the IMF in
these circumstances.""
 A Treasury Department spokesman later said an ""extra
commitment is not something we're discussing right now."" Still,
the prospect of further help for the EU lifted the euro
currency, which was trading at $1.3136 late on Wednesday,
ending three days of losses that it had taken it to a 10-week
low.
 HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL
 Markets were focusing on ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet's news conference due at 1330 GMT on Thursday where the
central bank could announce an expansion of its government bond
purchase program, launched in May after Greece was bailed out.
 But it has been highly controversial within the bank and
used erratically. Influential Bundesbank head Axel Weber has
called for the program to be scrapped, and fellow ECB members
have criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to buy $600
billion of U.S. debt in a policy known as quantitative easing.
 Any sense from fiercely independent central bankers that
they were being bullied by EU politicians into making bond
purchases could further deepen opposition to such a step.
 With the euro under threat, however, they may decide they
have no other choice.
 In recent days, economists have urged the ECB to throw out
its rule book and do all it can to save the euro, particularly
since governments seem to be running out of ideas for restoring
confidence in their monetary union.
 ""There is a feeling that things have got to a point where
the ECB has to do more,"" said Gilles Moec, an economist at
Deutsche Bank.
 The premium investors demand to hold Portuguese, Spanish
and Italian bonds instead of German benchmarks fell and
European bank stocks rebounded, with Spain's Banco Santander
and BBVA up more than 7 percent after the Spanish government
announced new steps to reduce the national debt.
 Debt auctions in Portugal and Germany, however, showed
investors remain nervous. Lisbon's borrowing costs surged in a
12-month bill auction and a German five-year note sale drew the
weakest demand in half a year.
 Manufacturing data underscored the economic divergences
plaguing Europe.
 Citigroup's chief economist said this week euro zone
turmoil might be the ""opening act"" of a global sovereign debt
crisis that could infect the United States and Japan.
 EU plans to make private bond holders bear some of the pain
from any sovereign debt restructuring after mid-2013 have led
investors to reassess the risk of putting their money in the
government bonds of high-debt countries.
 But German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on
Wednesday that all the anxiety in financial markets was
overblown.
 LIMITED OPTIONS
 Strong action by the ECB is one of a small number of
unattractive options for stopping the rot, given divisions
among European governments over how to respond.
 Germany has resisted pressure from France and others to
turn the euro zone into a ""fiscal union,"" a step that could
help the bloc address its economic imbalances but require
members to sacrifice sovereignty for the good of the group.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel is also sceptical about putting up
more funds for bailouts, concerned that German taxpayers could
end up underwriting the rescues of countries her government
believes have become targets because of economic
mismanagement.
 Pressure from Germany's partners is mounting. Portuguese
Treasury Secretary Carlos Pina told Reuters the EU needed to
""deepen its budget and create a European Treasury"" to defend
the euro, a move that would be anathema to Berlin.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Wednesday as a
three-day selling spree lost steam, but doubts about whether the
euro zone can contain debt problems facing some members kept the
single currency in range of a 2 1/2-month low versus the dollar.
 A slight narrowing of yield premium of government debt in
Portugal, Spain and Italy over safe-haven German bonds, also
supported the euro but market participants said the single
currency remained vulnerable to more selling.
 Investors awaited an auction of 12-month Portuguese Treasury
bills on Wednesday, and analysts said the euro could be stung by
weak results, whether a lack of demand or a jump in the premium
Lisbon must pay to borrow.
 ""Spreads in Portugal, Italy and Spain are a bit narrower,
and that's leading to the correction in the euro,"" said Lutz
Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 But he added that investors were still speculating that
other countries may follow Ireland and Greece in asking for
bailouts, and any suggestions of this would drag the euro lower.
 ""If the (auction results) disappoint, they would immediately
put the debt crisis back into focus, and be used to sell the
euro versus the dollar.""
 Portugal is widely seen as being next in line for a bailout.
Ratings agency S&P on Tuesday put its A-minus rating on review
for possible downgrade, citing uncertainties stemming from the
risk Lisbon may need financial aid.
 ""You really need some aggressive action from the authorities
in Europe to try and calm nerves and that's really the key at
this stage,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in Sydney.
 By 0852 GMT, the euro had climbed 0.7 percent on the day
to the day's high of $1.3091.
 Last month, the euro fell from a high of $1.4281 to around
$1.3446 when speculation grew that Ireland may require a
bailout. A short-lived correction took the single currency to
$1.3785, before opening the way to more selling.
 Some in the market said a fall equivalent to that seen in
early November would take the euro down to $1.2950, adding that
that level may provide short-term support. Others in the market
suspected options at that level were due to expire on Friday.
 The rise in the euro lifted other currencies also considered
to be higher risk, including the Australian dollar. The Aussie
rose 0.6 percent to $0.9630, recovering earlier losses versus
the U.S. currency suffered on weak economic growth data.
 At the same time, the safe-haven Swiss franc fell to 1.0060
francs per dollar, its weakest since late September.
 The dollar was flat on the day at 83.70 yen.
 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent versus a currency basket to
80.926, but stayed near a 2 1/2-month high hit on Tuesday as the
U.S. currency, the most liquid and therefore considered safe,
has benefited from the euro's problems, which has fuelled a
retrenchment in investor confidence.
 Euro zone debt problems are also raising the cost of
accessing dollar cash for companies and banks.
 While dollar interest rates such as three-month LIBOR have
risen only slightly in the past few days, euro/dollar basis swap
spreads have risen sharply in recent weeks in a possible sign
that some euro zone banks are trying to raise dollar cash
through swaps.
 The one-year spread of more than 50 basis points is above
the peak it hit in the wake of the Greek debt crisis in May,
though still far below the peaks after the Lehman Brothers
collapse in 2008.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Signs of robust economic growth in
China and recovery in parts of Europe lifted world stocks on
Wednesday while a relatively successful Portuguese debt sale
helped ease short-term fears about the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Sovereign debt spreads and the cost of insuring Portuguese
and other peripheral euro zone sovereign debt against default
fell, in part because of a belief that the European Central Bank
will take further action at its meeting on Thursday.
 The euro was up more than 1 percent, rising above $1.31
, European shares rose 1.3 percent and Japan was half a
percent higher. Wall Street also looked set to open strongly.
 ""The markets are expecting (the EBC) to announce some
upscaling of their purchases of government debt and perhaps
other unorthodox measures,"" said Deutsche Bank's Gilles Moec.
 ""There is a feeling that things have got to a point where
the ECB has to do more.""
 Others said dramatic action after the ECB policy meeting on
Thursday was unlikely but that the spreading euro zone debt
crisis demanded radical measures at some point. [ID:nLDE6B00SW]
 Macro data, meanwhile, was driving risk appetite.
 Better-than-expected Chinese factory data in November, with
the official Chinese purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to
a seven-month high of 55.2, showed one of the world's largest
economic engines to be in rude health. [ID:nTOE6B004C]
 In Europe, the euro zone's manufacturing sector expanded at
its fastest pace in four months in November, led by heavyweights
Germany and France. Britain's manufacturing hit a 16-year high.
 Focus remained, however, on the pressure on euro zone debt
and the methods by which it might be eased.
 Fears were eased slightly after debt-ridden Portugal
successfully sold 500 million euros in 12-month T-bills although
borrowing costs rose to 5.281 percent from 4.813 percent
previously, in a fresh sign of that investors expect Portugal to
follow Ireland and Greece to seek a bailout.
 Attention moved to a Spanish bond auction, due on Thursday.
 There were signs that the euro zone debt crisis was raising
concerns among global policymakers. G20 deputy finance ministers
discussed ""the financial situation in Europe"" on Monday in a
teleconference, a senior G20 source in Asia said, and a top U.S.
Treasury official is travelling to Europe.
 ""You really need some aggressive action from the authorities
in Europe to try and calm nerves and that's really the key at
this stage,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in Sydney.
 The extent of the damage to bond holders was underlined by
new Citi bond returns data showing euro zone bonds lost 2.69
percent in November, with Ireland tumbling more than 11 percent,
Spain more than 7 percent and nearly Portugal 5.8 percent.
 
 STOCKS REBOUND
 The Chinese and European data lifted risk appetite on stock
markets. Although some countries fear Chinese policy tightening
if the economic is deemed to be rising too fast, good growth in
China is typically a booster for export-oriented countries.
 MSCI's all-country world stocks index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
0.8 percent and its emerging market counterpart <.MSCIEF> gained
a solid 1.6 percent.
 European stocks also rose sharply with the FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> gaining 1.3 percent.
 As with the euro, however, analysts said the sentiment could
easily be flipped by poor news on the euro zone bond front.
 ""We're getting a technical rebound. A number of indicators
showed the indexes as 'oversold', and some investors have
started looking for bargains. But we're keeping a close eye on
bond yield spreads to see if this stock rebound has legs,"" said
Harry Sebag, head of sales trading at Saxo Banque.

 * German, French growth offsets other countries
 * Firms building a backlog of orders
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro zone's manufacturing
sector expanded at its fastest pace in four months in November,
although slightly slower than previously thought, as Germany and
France continued to outshine smaller members, surveys showed on
Wednesday.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index
(PMI) rose to 55.3 in November, nudged down from an earlier
estimate of 55.5 but comfortably above the final reading of 54.6
for October.
 While still firmly above the 50 mark that divides growth
from contraction, the reading is some way off April's
post-recession high of 57.6.
 Manufacturers reported improved output last month, with the
index rising to 55.8 from October's 54.7, but they still managed
to build up a backlog of work, the survey of about 2,000
companies showed.
 ""November's PMIs showed that manufacturing conditions picked
up at greatly improved rates in Germany and France. However,
conditions are far less rosy in other parts of the euro zone,""
said Chris Williamson at Markit.
Data from Germany on Wednesday showed its manufacturing
sector expanded significantly faster last month than in October
while France's PMI bounced to a level not seen in 10 years.
 But Italian numbers showed conditions improved at their
weakest rate for nine months and stagnation was seen in Spain.
 Ireland, which accepted an 85-billion-euro European Union
emergency aid package on Sunday, saw a slight upturn in activity
but still below levels needed for a meaningful recovery.
 A similar two-speed recovery is happening in the bloc's
dominant service sector, according to flash numbers expected to
be confirmed on Friday. [EUR/PMIS]
 The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest
rates on hold at a record low 1.0 percent when it meets on
Thursday -- and at least until next October -- as it battles to
support the bloc's fragile recovery. [ECB/INT]
 The bloc as a whole escaped from its worst post-war
recession in the third quarter of last year. However, the
recovery is expected to be slow and steady, with austerity
measures introduced to tackle the region's debt crisis weighing
on consumer sentiment. 
 Still, the euro zone PMI's backlogs of work index rose to
53.5 from October's 53.1 and has been above the 50.0 mark for a
year, suggesting firms are accumulating work as the
manufacturing-led recovery continues.
 Data released on Wednesday showed unemployment rose to 10.1
percent in October, slightly up from the 10.0 seen in September,
but the PMI survey showed manufacturing firms in the euro zone
took on workers at the fastest rate last month since mid-2007.

its slowest growth in November since February and firms shed
jobs at a faster pace, a survey showed on Wednesday, adding to
signs that the sector's recovery has already passed its peak.
 The Markit/ADACI Purchasing Managers Index unexpectedly
slipped to 52.0 from 53.0 in October, still above the 50
threshold separating growth from contraction.
 The average forecast in a Reuters survey of 12 analysts had
pointed to a rise to 52.6.
 Companies shed staff in November for the 4th straight month
as a return to hiring in July proved short-lived, with the
relevant sub-index falling to 49.3 from 49.9.
 New orders contracted for the first time since September
2009 although manufacturing output still grew but at a slower
pace than in October.
 Other recent manufacturing data has painted a mixed picture.
Business morale as measured by the ISAE institute rose in
November to its highest since March 2008, but official output
figures, for September, plunged 2.1 percent from the month
before.
 Economic growth slowed sharply to 0.2 percent in the third
quarter after growth of 0.5 percent in the second and 0.4
percent in the first quarter.
 The euro zone's third-largest economy is under close market
scrutiny amid signs that its debt may face a concerted market
attack.
 The premium demanded by investors for holding Italian bonds
rather than less risky German bunds rose on Tuesday to the
highest level since the launch of the euro.
 Silvio Berlusconi's unpopular government, which forecasts
growth of 1.2 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2011, faces
confidence votes this month which could bring it down half way

 SINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro wavered on Wednesday
as Europe's debt crisis deepened, but global stock markets
drew comfort from stronger-than-expected manufacturing data
from China and growing signs that the U.S. economy is improving.	
 Leading European stocks rose 0.9 percent in early
trade, echoing gains in Asia after surveys showed China's
factories ramped up production in November amid a jump in new
orders from both domestic and foreign customers. [ID:nTOE6B004C]	
Similar surveys showed a pick up in manufacturing activity
in South Korea and India as well, helping to ease fears about
Europe's debt problems after Standard & Poor's put Portugal's
credit rating on review for a possible downgrade.	
 U.S. stock futures  rose 0.4 percent, pointing to a
higher opening on Wall Street later in the day.	
 The index of shares outside Japan rose 1.3
percent, powered by resource stocks and consumer staples,
while Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.5 percent after
falling nearly 2 percent the previous day.	
 ""People are looking at the raft of positive data from the
region, and past the euro zone's problems,"" said Wai Ho Leong,
senior regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore.	
 ""Asia is still the region to be in, and stocks are looking
attractive after last week.""	
 Adding to the encouraging news from Asia, data overnight
showed U.S. consumer confidence rose to its highest level in
five months in November, while business activity in the
Midwest grew faster than expected, providing further evidence
of economic recovery. [ID:nN30263756]	
 The U.S. government's monthly employment report on Friday
is forecast to show another month of job gains.	
 
 EURO WOES 
 The euro fell to around $1.2969 in early Asia
trade, a level not seen since mid-September, before paring
losses. It was trading at $1.3036 by 0805 GMT, slightly above
late U.S. levels.	
 But it remained near 11-week lows against the dollar as
markets waited to see if other fiscally weak euro zone
countries can avoid the debt crisis that has engulfed Greece
and Ireland.	
 Although Portugal, much like Ireland earlier, has denied
it needs aid, markets are already discounting an eventual
rescue for Lisbon and watching growing signs of distress in
far larger economies such as Spain and Italy. [ID:nLDE6B005K]	
 While rescuing Portugal would be manageable, assistance
for Spain would sorely test the European Union's resources,
raising deeper questions about how long the 16-country euro
zone bloc can hold together and if the crisis will spread
beyond Europe.	
 ""You really need some aggressive action from the
authorities in Europe to try and calm nerves and that's really
the key at this stage,"" Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in
Sydney, said.	
 The euro has fallen some 9 percent from a November high
around $1.4281 and was down about 7 percent in November, the
biggest monthly fall since May.	
 ""Our risk aversion barometer has reached the highest since
October 4 and shows little sign of turning around,"" Credit
Agricole said in a research note, adding the failure of an 85
billion euro bailout package for Ireland to stem the
haemorrhaging in the eurozone bond markets highlighted
difficulties policymakers faced.	
 The U.S. two-year swap spread widened to the most in four
months on Wednesday, driven by higher interbank rates, as
fears the euro zone's debt crisis may take a heavy toll on
the region's banks left dealers hungry for more dollar funding.	
 But Japanese government bond futures soared more than half
a point and yields plunged across the board on Wednesday, as
players covered short positions following a
10-year bond auction. [ID:nTOE6B0007] 
 Oil  rose 67 cents to $84.79 a barrel while cash
gold priced in euros hit a record at 1,068.70 euros an ounce,
reflecting the worries over Europe and investor moves into
safe-haven asset.

 BEIJING/BANGALORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Factories in China
and India cranked production up a gear last month, offering a
small boost to the global economy faced by a spreading debt
crisis in the euro zone and sluggish recoveries in the United
States and Japan. 
 But manufacturing surveys in
both Asian giants also highlighted a worry that has clouded
the outlook for investors: rising inflationary pressure and
the need for more monetary tightening in fast-growing
developing economies. 
 That could be a bitter pill
to swallow with Europe teetering on the brink of more serious

 The manufacturing sector in
Asia provided some solace from the gloomy prognosis in Europe.

 Two purchasing managers' indexes in China
registered their strongest readings in more than half a year
and helped lift Asian shares outside Japan by
0.6 percent. 
 The story was similar in India, where
the HSBC Markit PMI climbed to a six-month high.

in China, the biggest increases came in input prices.

 ""Good news from the economy may not be that good for the
market as it is concerned about more tightening,"" said Ting
Lu, an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. 
 ""The high PMI reading could convince Beijing to tighten a
bit more on the margin."" 
 
 ASIAN RESILIENCE? 
 The strong Indian PMI followed data on Tuesday that showed
its economy grew by a blistering 8.9 percent in the September
quarter from a year earlier. 
 That is likely to add pressure on the central bank to
continue raising interest rates, though traders do not expect
another hike until early next year. [ID:nBMA009007] 
 South Korea was another bright spot in Asia. Exports from
the region's fourth-largest economy rose slightly more than
expected in November from a year earlier, while a key index
measuring its manufacturing-sector activity reversed a
six-month falling streak. [ID:nTOE6AR01G] 
 But in Asia's leading developed economy, the picture was
far less rosy. 
 Prolonged economic weakness may keep Japan in deflation
longer than the Bank of Japan's current forecast, a member of
its policy board said on Wednesday, offering the bleakest view
to date by a central bank policymaker. 
 Board member Miyako Suda said there was a strong chance
Japan's economy would contract in the final quarter of this
year after strong growth in July-September. [ID:nTOE6B002F] 
 She also warned of lingering downside risks to the
export-reliant economy, including market jitters over Europe's
sovereign debt woes. 
 Australia also flashed a warning sign, with its economy
growing at the slowest pace in almost two years last quarter,
according to data published on Wednesday. [ID:nSGE6AT0FR] 
 
 G20 CALL	
 Efforts by European policymakers to reassure investors
have so far come up short. Global officials are also focusing
their attention on the problem, with the G20 deputy finance
ministers holding a pre-arranged teleconference about it on
Monday. 
 ""It's a tradition of the G20 to share information whenever
there's an important situation going on,"" the source, who took
part in the call, told Reuters on Wednesday. 
 The source added that the participants reviewed the 85
billion euro ($110.7 billion) bailout package for Ireland
announced at the weekend. They discussed what could be done on
the part of the G20, but the source declined to elaborate. 
 The euro zone's debt crisis deepened on Tuesday when
investors pushed the single currency lower and spreads on
bonds of fiscally weak member states to new highs.
[ID:nLDE6AT0Z0]	
 European policymakers came out in force to try to calm
markets, with European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet warning that pundits were underestimating the
determination of governments to keep the euro zone stable. 
 But markets paid little attention, pressuring Portugal,
Spain and Italy only days after the EU agreed to an 85 billion
euro ($110.7 billion) bailout for Ireland. 
 Later in the day, Standard & Poor's warned it could cut
Portugal's credit ratings within the next three months if the
country' growth prospects weaken further or if private
creditors become subordinated to public creditors in a
possible financial aid program.|

934,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2010 02:04AM ET</span>",Irish manufacturing expands in Nov for 2nd month -PMI," DUBLIN, Dec. 1 (Reuters) - Ireland's manufacturing sector
expanded for the second month in a row in November with the rate
of growth picking up slightly as exports helped drive stronger
output and new orders, a survey showed on Wednesday.
 The NCB Purchasing Managers' Index, which measures Irish
manufacturing activity, rose to 51.2 from 50.9 in October, above
the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the second
month in a row and at the highest level since July.
 Ireland's manufacturing industry and the wider economy is
relying on exports, in particular the output of multi-nationals
operating in Ireland such as chipmaker Intel , to pull
the country out of a prolonged recession.
 Domestic demand is set to remain subdued given high
unemployment and an aggressive series of austerity budgets
planned over the next four years following an 85 billion euro
($111 billion) EU/IMF bailout announced on Sunday.
 ""Fiscal and banking issues rightly continue to be the focus
in Ireland, but the underlying economy, especially those areas
directly involved in exporting are still alive and kicking,""
said Brian Devine, economist at NCB Stockbrokers.
 The output and new order components of the PMI edged up in
November from a month earlier while the reading for export
orders stood at 54.7, a fraction below the 54.9 recorded in
October.
 Irish businesses are cutting back, in particular wages and
jobs, to improve competitiveness after years of spiralling
prices during the ""Celtic Tiger"" economic boom.
 The picture for employment remained negative, dropping
slightly month-on-month although it remained the third-strongest
reading in three years.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2010 01:48AM ET</span>",FOREX-Euro decline pauses but debt worry keeps it vulnerable," * Euro holding just above 11-week lows, more downside seen
 * S&P says may cut Portugal's credit ratings
 * Market wants to see more pre-emptive action
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro inched up on Wednesday
after a drubbing the previous day but remained near 11-week lows
against the dollar in a market waiting to see what European
policymakers will do next to contain worries about euro zone
debt.
 The euro suffered yet another setback as Standard & Poor's
threatened to cut the credit ratings of Portugal, but then
stabilised above the previous day's low of $1.2969, a level not
seen since mid-September.
 Still, while small recoveries are not ruled out few expect
that its trials are over, with downside targets now at about
$1.2800 and then its August lows around $1.2600.
 The euro was also near 11-week lows against the yen after
falling 1.8 percent on Tuesday, and 10-week lows against sterling
after premiums on Spanish and Italian bonds over German debt rose
their highest in the euro's lifetime.
 Analysts said the market was looking for more pre-emptive
action by policy-makers in the region after a rescue package for
Ireland at the weekend, as pressure in the euro zone bond market
was widening to more countries including Belgium.
 ""The general feeling is that this is a mess that is not going
to be easily escaped,"" said Robert Ryan, a FX strategist at BNP
Paribas in Singapore.
 Citing uncertainties stemming from the risk of Portugal
having to seek international financial aid, S&P put the
country's A-minus rating on review for possible downgrade.
 S&P's warning came after Ireland secured an 85 billion euro
($110 billion) bailout package on Sunday, seven months after
Greece was thrown a lifeline to tackle its debt problems.
 Markets worry that other debt-ridden euro zone countries such
as Portugal and Spain will also need aid and if so whether the
region can really afford it. Portugal's prime minister said it is
not facing any pressure to ask for a bailout and does not need
any such help.
 ""You really need some aggressive action from the
authorities in Europe to try and calm nerves and that's really
the key at this stage,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in
Sydney.
 Euro zone's debt woes are also raising suspicions that
European banks could find it costly to access dollar cash, if not
impossible.
 While dollar interest rates such as three-month LIBOR have
risen only slightly in the past few days, euro/dollar basis swap
spreads have risen sharply in recent weeks in a possible sign
that some euro-zone banks are trying to raise dollar cash through
swaps.
 The one-year spread, now over 50 basis points, is above the
peak it hit in the wake of Greek debt crisis in May, though still
far below the peaks after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.
 The next event in focus is a European Central Bank meeting on
Thursday that analysts say has taken on added significance as
confidence in the region has deteriorated.
Investors will be looking for comments on how the ECB can help
address growing anxiety in the credit and currency markets, and
Ryan at BNP said the ECB could eventually be forced into making
more government bond purchases.
 On Wednesday, though, the euro edged up to $1.3020 after
languishing below $1.3000 for much of the session, with support
at about $1.2795, a 61.8 percent retracement of its June-November
rally, and resistance at about $1.3060.
 The euro has fallen 9 percent from its November high of
$1.4283 and shed 7 percent in November alone, the biggest monthly
fall since May.
 Momentum indicators such as stochastics signal its fall is
well and truly stretched, building the chance of a rebound, but
chartwise scope for a recovery, at least in the near term, is
seen a limited to $1.3060-$1.3100.
 It fell to 108.33 yen on Tuesday, a level last seen on Sept.
15, the day Japan intervened to stem yen strength, and plumbed a
record low versus the Australian dollar at about A$1.3515. It was
at 108.65 yen on Wednesday.
 The dollar has been a beneficiary of the euro's problems,
which has helped fuel a retrenchment in investor confidence,
denting higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of other major currencies, rose to
its highest since Sept. 20 on Tuesday at 81.444 and was stable on
Wednesday just below its 200-day moving average of 81.78.
 The yen has fared the best in the past 24 hours as investors
have unwound yen-funded positions in higher yielding currencies
and Japanese exporters bought the yen.
 The dollar dipped to 83.38 yen, its lowest level in a week
and retreating a full yen from a two-month high of 84.41 yen hit
on Monday.
 The rise in the yen has prompted Japanese margin traders --
known collectively to be contrarian -- to increase their net
yen-selling positions to near a record high, putting a brake on
the yen's rise.
 Meanwhile the Australian dollar dipped to its lowest since
late September at $0.9536 after Australian GDP data showed the
economy grew less than expected in the third quarter and
suggested there was no urgency for the central bank to tighten
interest rates again soon.
 The Aussie was at $0.9593, up 0.1 percent.

937,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2010 12:32AM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-Vietnam PM calls for ""strong"" steps to control the dong"," (Adds detail, context)	
 HANOI, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen
Tan Dung has told the central bank to take ""strong"" steps to
stabilise the foreign exchange and gold markets, and requested
the finance ministry to implement price controls on certain
goods.	
 The calls came as the dong weakened to
21,470/21,570 per dollar on unofficial markets, nearly 10
percent below the legal limit mandated by its trading band,
and as forecasts put full-year inflation above 10 percent. The
official government target is 8 percent.	
 The State Bank of Vietnam should ""implement in a timely
manner strong and effective measures to ensure the control and
stability of exchange rates, gold prices and interest rates"",
Dung said in instructions issued on Tuesday, according to the
government's website, www.chinhphu.vn.	
 Unlike other currencies in that region that have been
strengthening on the back of U.S. quantitative easing, the
dong has been slipping under domestic pressures including
rising inflation, a persistent trade deficit, soaring gold
prices and widespread expectations of its weakness.	
 Gold prices and the dong are strongly correlated: when
gold prices rise the dollar tends to gain against the dong
onshore.	
 On Wednesday, gold was trading in Hanoi at 36.27/36.37
million dong per tael, putting it on par with global gold
prices . One tael equals 1.21 ounces.	
 The central bank should cooperate with provincial
authorities to investigate and handled cases of speculation,
illegal gold trading and foreign exchange market manipulation,
Dung's instructions said.	
 It gave no further details.	
 In early November the authorities said they would not
devalue the beleaguered dong before at least Tet, the Lunar
New Year festival, which falls in early February 2011,
pledging instead to tap foreign exchange reserves to meet
dollar demand.	
 The central bank also raised its three policy interest
rates by 100 basis points on Nov. 5, and also granted fresh
gold import licenses and quotas to narrow a gap between
domestic and global prices that traders said had fuelled
dollar demand.	
 The dong has slipped steadily since, however, putting the
central bank and the government, which approves policy, in a
tight spot.	
 Dung's instructions also ordered the finance ministry to
keep prices for electricity, coal for power production,
cement, fertiliser and other goods stable, while using
""financial, monetary and tax measures"" to stabilise prices of
petrol.	
 The ministry should also ""resolutely stop the registration
of price increases of goods and services subject to price
registration if the increases are unreasonable"", it said.	
 That final measure could raise concern among the foreign
and local business community, which have spoken out against a
finance ministry circular that took effect at the start of
October requiring companies to register prices on a range of
products, including milk and cement, and threatening price
controls.	
 Vietnam's consumer price index this month will rise
1.3-1.5 percent from November, bringing annual CPI growth to
over 10 percent, Wednesday's edition of the state-run
newspaper Tuoi Tre quoted deputy industry and trade minister
Ho Thi Kim Thoa as saying.	
 Consumer prices in Vietnam traditionally rise in the
fourth quarter and in the run-up to Tet.

 * Euro worries overshadow better than expected China data
 * Gold, treasury in demand as safe haven
 * Portugal rating warning weighs

 By Sanjeev Miglani	
 SINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The euro slipped further on
Wednesday and stocks in Asia were struggling, despite
stronger-than-expected manufacturing data from China, as fears
of a wider euro zone debt crisis grew.	
 Investors turned to the safety of gold, which hit a record
in euro terms in early trade, and to U.S. government bonds
after Standard & Poor's put Portugal's credit rating on review
for a possible downgrade, saying the country may have to turn
to the EU and IMF for funding.	
Although Lisbon, much like Ireland earlier, denies Portugal
needs aid, markets are already discounting an eventual
Portuguese emergency financial rescue. 
 While rescuing Portugal would be manageable, assistance
for Spain would sorely test the European Union's resources,
raising deeper questions about the integrity of its
12-year-old currency and possible contagion beyond Europe. 
 The euro fell to around $1.2969 in early Asia
trade, lows not seen since mid-September, and experts said it
could fall further unless there was strong action. 
 ""You really need some aggressive action from the
authorities in Europe to try and calm nerves and that's really
the key at this stage,"" Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in
Sydney, said.	
 The euro has fallen some 9 percent from a November high
around $1.4281 and was down about 7 percent in November, the
biggest monthly fall since May.	
 
 CHINA DATA	
 Stock markets have tracked the euro zone's rolling debt
crisis closely, and on Wednesday the MSCI index of shares
outside of Japan drifted 0.16 percent lower,
despite data from China that showed it had revved up
production in November more than expected, with the official
purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to a seven-month high.	
 Shanghai stocks were down 0.2 percent in early
trade and Japan's Nikkei's share average also inched
lower, brought down by constant concern over Europe's debt
problems. The Nikkei fell nearly 2 percent the previous day,
pulled down by tumbling China stocks following a liquidity
squeeze in the share market. On Wednesday, it was 0.2 percent
lower. 
 ""Investors were worried over interest hikes in China and
the
euro zone yesterday and are now waiting for this Friday's U.S.
employment figures and Christmas sales figures to trade on,""
said Fumiyuki Takahashi, equity strategist for Barclays
Capital Japan.
Oil  was steady near $84 a barrel while cash gold
priced in euros hit a record at 1,068.70 euros an ounce,
reflecting the worries Europe.

quarantine agreements to allow the import to China of deboned

 China, the world's-largest beer producer, does not have

 By Manuela Badawy and Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Growing fears about Portugal's
debt drove the euro to a 10-week low against the dollar on
Tuesday, while U.S. stocks fell for a third straight day even
as the U.S. economy showed some encouraging signs.
 The euro fell below the technically critical $1.30 level
after Standard and Poor's put Portugal's A-minus credit ratings
on review for a possible downgrade, citing uncertainties
related to a possible financial rescue by the European Union
and the International Monetary Fund.
 Investors fled to to safe-haven assets on the worries about
euro zone sovereign debt, driving U.S. government bond prices
higher and sending gold prices to a 2-1/2 week peak.
 The strengthening dollar helped drive down the price of oil
by almost 2 percent, adding to ongoing concerns about China's
economic growth.
 The pressure is building around debt-soaked Portugal and
Spain as investors worry about a repeat of this year's Irish
and Greek bailouts.
 Although Lisbon, much like Ireland earlier, denies Portugal
needs aid, markets are already discounting an eventual
Portuguese emergency financial rescue.
 While rescuing Portugal would be manageable, assistance for
Spain would sorely test the European Union's resources, raising
deeper questions about the integrity of its 12-year-old
currency and possible contagion beyond Europe.
 S&P late on Tuesday said it was placing its A-minus
long-term and A-2 short-term ratings on Portugal on creditwatch
with negative implications, meaning a possibility of a
downgrade.
 ""The market has taken what to happened to Ireland as a road
stop, not the final destination,"" said Vincent Boberski, senior
vice president at Vining Sparks in Memphis, Tennessee.
 The spreads on bonds of peripheral European countries rose
to new highs on Tuesday amid concern weak member states may
ultimately be forced to default.
 EUROPEAN JITTERS
 On Wall Street, stocks finished lower, but showed some
resilience as the Conference Board, an industry group, reported
that U.S. consumer confidence rose to its highest level in five
months in November.
 In another positive sign, the Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago reported that U.S. Midwest business activity
grew faster than expected in November.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 46.47
points, or 0.42 percent, at 11,006.02. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> dipped 7.21 points, or 0.61 percent, at
1,180.55. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> shed 26.99
points, or 1.07 percent, at 2,498.23.
 Google Inc  shed 4.5 percent to $555.71 following
media reports that the company was close to a deal to buy local
advertising website Groupon Inc in what could be the Web search
leader's biggest acquisition to date. [ID:nN30246836]
 ""You do have a bit of a tug of war between those investors
who see the environment as positive for equities over the
intermediate to long-term (and) traders who are more concerned
about the short-term impact of European debt concerns,"" said
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset
Management in Bedford Hills, New York.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
European companies closed 0.2 percent lower at 1,067.22 points,
posting a 1.8 percent loss for November, its heaviest monthly
slump since May.
 In Europe, The December futures contract for the Nikkei 225
stock index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 155 points to
9,940.
 MSCI's all country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down
0.62 percent.
 The euro posted its worst month since May on Tuesday, with
more losses likely next month.
 ""The European credit market is in panic mode because of
fears of insolvency, and the euro is trading off those credit
yields,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT
in New York.
 ""For the euro to stabilize, credit yields need to stabilize
and for that to happen, we need action from the European
Central Bank. The Irish bailout was not enough and so the
pressure is building.""
 The euro  fell to $1.2980, its lowest level since
mid-September, amid fear of regional contagion and uncertainty
over the currency's future.
 With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued to
gain, hitting a more than two-month high against a currency
basket <.DXY> at 81.310.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rose on the anxiety over the fiscal
and debt problems in Europe, but the bond market was still
poised for its worst month since December 2009.
[ID:nN30289284]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
5/32, with the yield at 2.8077 percent. The two-year U.S.
Treasury note  rose 3/32, with the yield at 0.4607
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  gained to
12/32, with the yield at 4.1203 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  settled down 1.89 percent to $84.10
per barrel, and spot gold prices  rose $17.16, or 1.26
percent, to $1383.60 an ounce, a 2-1/2 week-high as investors
bought the metal as a safe store of value.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro slumped to
2-1/2-month lows against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday and more
losses are likely as fears about euro zone sovereign debt
prompt widespread risk aversion.
 A financial rescue deal for Ireland failed to contain
contagion fears as the euro fell below the critical $1.30 level
and investors took out many options barriers on the way. The
next key figure to watch, traders said, is $1.2794, the 61.8
percent retracement of the June to November rally.
 The euro was down nearly 7 percent on the month, on track
for its worst monthly performance since May when Greece
received a 110-billion-euro bailout.
 In tandem with euro weakness, the premiums investors demand
to hold Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds over German debt
jumped to lifetime highs while yields on Portuguese, Irish and
Belgian bonds also widened. [GVD/EUR]
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, said downside pressure on the euro remains well in
place after going below the $1.30 level in European trading.
Should support at the pivotal $1.30 sustainably give way,
$1.2920 and then the August-September support in the $1.2600 to
$1.2650 range present the next logical targets to the downside,
she wrote.
 ""Europe is making some very bad decisions with respect to
the whole region and the currency,"" said Peter Schiff, chief
executive officer at Euro Pacific Capital, an asset management
firm overseeing customer accounts of about $3 billion.
 ""They should not have bailed out Greece and Ireland, they
should have allowed them to restructure their debt, and allowed
their bondholders to take losses. Countries would now want to
go into debt because they want those bailouts and the countries
that are responsible get stuck with the bill,"" said
Connecticut-based Schiff.
 Given sharply negative sentiment on euro zone assets, the
European Central Bank should take a more active hand in
managing the crisis, analysts said. Talk of an ECB quantitative
easing would not be surprising, said Boris Schlossberg,
director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 The ECB's meeting this Thursday is therefore crucial as
investors will be looking for comments on how the bank could
help address growing jitters in the credit and currency market.
It is also widely expected to keep rates on hold and sources
say it could extend banks' access to unlimited three-month
funds beyond January. See [ID:nLDE6AS0F6].
 KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS
 The euro  fell to $1.2969 on EBS, its lowest since
Sept. 15, before recovering to $1.3008, still down 0.7 percent.
Some traders said there is minor support at $1.2920, the Sept.
6 high. That level preceded a steep rally in the euro that took
it all the way to that early November high at $1.4283.
 A slew of strong U.S. economic data lifted risk sentiment a
bit from midmorning, drawing bids away from the safe-haven
dollar and giving the heavily-battered euro some reprieve. For
a wrapup of U.S. economic data click on [ID:nN30263756].
 Some traders said $1.3040 could act as resistance on any
intraday rebound.
 Other euro-zone-linked assets such as euro exchange-traded
funds also fared poorly on Tuesday. The CurrencyShares Euro
Trust  traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange was
down 0.86 percent at $129.60 after hitting a 2-1/2-month low at
$129.23. This ETF holds euro on-demand deposits in
euro-denominated bank accounts.
 Traders said the ease with which the euro had broken key
levels in recent days reflected the extent of negative
sentiment towards the currency, which has lost roughly 9
percent against the dollar since its peak this month.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities spiked on Tuesday to a
peak of 15.55 percent , the highest since at least
June, suggesting nervousness about the euro zone currency.
 The one-month 25-delta risk reversals, a gauge of currency
sentiment, traded as low as -2.85 vols  for euro
puts versus a close of -2.73 on Monday.
 Further reflecting the euro's negative bias, the latest
positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators going net short on the euro for the first
time since Sept. 14. [IMM/FX]
 The euro zone single currency slid to 1.2934 Swiss francs
, 108.33 yen , and 83.495 pence
against sterling , all more than 10-week lows.
 With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued to
gain, hitting a more than two-month high at 81.444 against a
currency basket <.DXY>, lifted by safe-haven flows and recent
evidence of an improving U.S. economy. It last traded up 0.42
percent at 81.187.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2010 02:52PM ET</span>","ISDA, investors urge U.S. exemption for forex swaps"," By David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Prominent asset managers and
a key derivatives trade group are urging the U.S. Treasury to
exempt foreign exchange swaps and forwards from new derivatives
regulations that would require central clearing under a revamp
of U.S. financial rules enacted in July.
 But exchanges that stand to benefit from the shift and two
Democratic U.S. senators say foreign exchange derivatives were
standard instruments that should be forced onto central
clearing platforms as the landmark legislation intended.
 The Dodd-Frank financial reform act gave U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner the authority to decide whether the
$53.1 trillion market for foreign exchange derivatives should
receive an exemption from the new regulations.
 The Treasury fought unsuccessfully to exclude foreign
exchange from regulation under the new law. A decision by
Geithner to grant an exemption would prompt sharp criticism
from Democrats in Congress that he is creating a new loophole
that defies the intent of the law.
 In public submissions to the Treasury just before a
midnight deadline on Tuesday, the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, or ISDA, and a number of investment
firms said subjecting forex swaps and forwards to the new rules
would increase hedging costs and could increase systemic risks
to the financial system with little benefit.
 ISDA, BlackRock Inc , T Rowe Price Group Inc
 and other investment groups argued in their
submissions that the foreign exchange spot and derivatives
markets are already transparent and conducted by well-regulated
entities.
 Most foreign exchange swaps, for example, are used by
corporations and investors to lock in future exchange rates to
hedge volatility risks.
 Subjecting forex swaps and forwards to central clearing
would increase costs, reduce the amount of risk-hedging
activity and reduce the flexibility of forex trade, ISDA
argued.
 This ""would increase systemic risk and threaten overall
U.S. financial stability, without offering any benefit to the
market or the broader economy,"" the group said. ""The decrease
in volume of FX activity will also reduce liquidity and
ultimately the pricing transparency that a liquid market
provides.""
 ""The FX forward market was not one of the root causes of
the financial crisis, and in our view, this market already has
a sufficient level of transparency,"" wrote Jonathan Siegel,
senior legal counsel of T Rowe Price, which manages over $439
billion in assets.
 The comments urging an exemption were similar to those made
on Nov. 15 by a coalition of lobbying groups for some of the
largest Wall Street and international banks. The Global FX
Division warned that the failure of a foreign exchange central
clearing counterparty could be ""catastrophic with detabilizing
effects on foreign exchange and the global economy as a
whole.""
 SENATORS: OBEY LAW'S INTENT
 But two prominent Democratic U.S. senators warned Treasury
not to grant an exemption that would encompass roughly 10
percent of the derivatives market.
 ""The fundamental rule of Dodd-Frank is that derivatives
should be subject to mandatory trading and clearing
requirements, and we insist that foreign exchange derivatives
be subject to the same transparency and accountability rules as
other derivatives,"" wrote senators Maria Cantwell of Oregon and
Tom Harkin of Iowa. ""No justification for an exemption is
evident.""
 The World Federation of Exchanges, which represents 52
regulated stock, futures and options exchanges around the world
including CME Group Inc  and Deutsche Boerse 
argued that foreign currency derivatives were no different than
other classes of swaps subject to the legislation.
 ""Implementing such an exemption at this time would create
greater systemic risk, rather than mitigate risk. This cuts
directly against the overarching goal of the (Dodd-Frank) Act
and similar derivative reform proposals being contemplated by
the European Commission and other policy bodies around the
globe,"" the group said in its submission.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 10-week low
against the dollar and stocks fell for a second day on Tuesday
on fears Europe's debt crisis is far from contained after
Ireland's financial rescue.
 Gold rallied to a 2-1/2 week peak and U.S. government bond
prices rose as concern over sovereign debt levels in European
countries fueled buying of safe-haven assets. Oil slipped
closer to $85 a barrel as the dollar rose.
 Manufacturing in the U.S. Midwest grew faster-than-expected
in November and U.S. consumer confidence gained, data showed.
Nevertheless, markets were dragged lower by deepening
uncertainty about the outlook for the euro zone.
 Two days after Europe approved an 85 billion euro ($111.7
billion) emergency aid package for Ireland, worries about
contagion to Portugal and Spain persisted and the borrowing
costs of large countries like Italy and France shot higher.
 ""The European credit market is in panic mode because of
fears of insolvency (for some euro zone countries) and the euro
is trading off those credit yields,"" said Boris Schlossberg,
director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 ""For the euro to stabilize, credit yields need to stabilize
and for that to happen, we need action from the European
Central Bank. The Irish bailout was not enough and so the
pressure is building.""
 In tandem with euro weakness, the premium investors demand
to hold Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds over German bonds
hit their highest since the euro's launch, while some of the
region's ""core"" debt issuers, including France, were
pressured.
 European stocks ended flat struggling to halt a sharp
three-week sell-off as investors continued to dump banking
shares on mounting fears of a domino effect in the euro zone
after Ireland's bailout.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed 0.03 percent higher at 1,069.52 points, but the index
suffered a 1.6 percent loss for November, its first monthly
loss since August.
 U.S. stocks were weaker as the latest data on home prices
signaled rough recovery ahead and added to worries of the euro
debt crisis.
 ""We are starting to see many warning signs of global
contagion, including lower U.S. stock prices,"" said Zach Pandl,
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 32.77

slowly than forecast. [ID:nNLLTME6O7]

 While a Portuguese rescue would be manageable, assistance

currency area and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe.
 EURO UNCERTAINTY
 The euro  fell below the critical $1.30 level to
$1.2977, its lowest since mid-September, before bouncing back
to $1.3027 amid fear of regional contagion and uncertainty over
the currency's future.
 With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued to
gain, hitting a more than two-month high at 81.444 against a
currency basket <.DXY>, before backing to 81.119, lifted by
safe-haven flows and recent evidence of an improving U.S.
economy.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose, adding to the previous day's
gains, as investors turned to government debt as a safe haven
from the recent flare-up in volatility.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
15/32, with the yield at 2.7694 percent. The 2-year U.S.

 By Rex Merrifield
 BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone's debt crisis
deepened on Tuesday, with investors pushing the single currency
lower and the spreads on peripheral bonds up to new highs amid
concern weak member states may ultimately be forced to default.
 European policymakers came out in force to try to calm
markets, with European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet warning that pundits were underestimating the
determination of governments to keep the euro zone stable.
 Markets paid little attention, pressuring Portugal, Spain
and Italy only days after the European Union agreed to an 85
billion euro ($110.7 billion) bailout for Ireland.
 The borrowing costs of countries such as Belgium and France
also rose as investors looked beyond the euro zone periphery and
focused on core founding members of the bloc.
 ""The crisis of confidence in Europe can't be resolved
quickly,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm
LibertyView Capital Management in New York. ""No single event can
put things back in order.""
 A Reuters survey of 55 leading fund management houses showed
U.S. and British investors had significantly cut back their
exposure to euro zone bonds this month, piling into equities
instead despite a weakening in global shares.
 Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue of
Portugal although the government in Lisbon denies this, as Irish
leaders initially did, that the country needs outside aid.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates told reporters on Tuesday
Portugal was not facing any pressure to ask for a bailout and
did not need any such help.
 While a Portuguese rescue would be manageable, assistance
for its larger neighbour Spain would sorely test EU resources,
raise deeper questions about the integrity of the 12-year-old
currency area, and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe.
 Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter described the
turbulence hitting the euro zone as an ""opening act"" and
predicted that sovereign default fears could soon extend to
Japan and the United States.
 ""There is no such thing as an absolutely safe sovereign,"" he
wrote in a research note.
 Trichet, speaking at a European Parliament hearing in
Brussels, said the bloc needed to regain its sense of direction
and move towards a ""quasi budget federation"" to address concerns
about fiscal and economic imbalances.
 
 EURO HIT, SPREADS WIDEN
 The euro fell for a third day in succession, dipping to a
10-week low of $1.2969 before paring its losses to rise above
$1.30 in late European trading. The currency has lost more than
7 percent of its value against the dollar this month.
 The yield spreads of 10-year Spanish, Italian and Belgian
bonds over German benchmarks spiked to their highest levels
since the birth of the euro in January 1999 and the cost of
protecting against a euro zone sovereign default surged.
 Jitters also hit European banking shares, which were led
lower by French banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit
Agricole on market rumours Standard & Poor's might cut France's
outlook.
 ""There is no reason for concern, no risk,"" said Francois
Baroin, France's budget minister and government spokesman. S&P
declined to comment.
 Italian officials scrambled to play down the threat to
their economy, the euro zone's third largest, which some
economists have labelled ""too big to bail"".
 ""Italy's public finances are sound, we are not among the
countries at risk,"" said Treasury Undersecretary Luigi Casero.
 Weakened governments in Italy, Ireland and Portugal have
deepened the sense of crisis by sowing doubts among investors
about their ability to act swiftly and decisively to bring their
debt and deficits under control.
 Portugal's central bank said on Tuesday its country's banks
faced an ""intolerable risk"" if the government in Lisbon failed
to consolidate public finances.
 The minority Socialist government in Portugal approved an
austerity budget for 2011 last week, but is struggling to meet
its targets for deficit reduction.
 
 DIVERGENCES
 Data released on Tuesday underscored the degree of economic
divergence within the euro zone, which represents an increasing
challenge to the European Central Bank and its one-size-fits-all
monetary policy.
 German unemployment fell in November for a 16th successive
month while joblessness in Italy jumped and Greek retail sales
plunged under the weight of crushing austerity agreed in
exchange for its 110 billion euro bailout.
 In addition to sealing Ireland's bailout, European leaders
on Sunday approved the outlines of a long-term European
Stability Mechanism which will create a permanent bailout
facility and make the private sector gradually share the burden
of any future default.
 Although private bondholders will not be asked to share the
cost of debt restructurings until late 2013, and then only on a
case-by-case basis, the mechanism has aroused fears of defaults
and so-called ""haircuts"" down the road.

 * CEE exchanges to have central clearing house by end-2011
 * Merger with Warsaw stock exchange would be ideal
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Five to eight companies could
sell stocks in initial public offerings in Austria next year,
reviving a market that has been frozen since the 2008 global
economic crisis, said Michael Buhl, the CEO of the Vienna stock
exchange.
 The number of IPOs could reach 12 with potential deals in
Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, whose stock exchanges
are part of a group controlled by the Austrians, Buhl
forecast.
 Capital markets may become more appealing to European
companies next year as stricter capital rules for banks make
credit more expensive.
 ""With Basel III (capital rules) coming, which means credit
is going to be more expensive and more difficult to get, we can
have a revival of capital markets in general in Europe,"" Buhl
told Reuters in a recent interview during Auerbach Grayson's
Austrian Investor Conference in New York.
 With plans to lead a consolidation of the Central-Eastern
European market, Vienna has been acquiring other exchanges in
the region but hasn't seen IPOs in its domestic market since
2007.
 By contrast, the competing Warsaw stock exchange has based
its recent growth on a series of IPOs of privatized companies.
 EXPANSION PLANS
 Poland and the group led by Austria have become fierce
competitors in the Central-Eastern European capital market in
the past few years, with Warsaw shunning Vienna as a bidder in
an initial privatization attempt of the exchange last year.
 This month Poland succeeded in floating shares of its
exchange in its own market while keeping state control over it,
but Buhl has not lost hope of a deal between the two bourses.
 ""Our ambition is to consolidate the Central-Eastern
European stock exchange landscape. That's not possible without
Poland and it's also not possible for the Poles without us,"" he
said.
 ""So it would be obvious that we actually do some exchange,
some cross shareholding, something like that. And at the end
come up with one common company.""
 Meanwhile, Vienna will keep looking into acquiring smaller
exchanges in the region. Natural candidates, according to Buhl,
would be the exchanges of Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria
and even the tiny bourses of Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
 Buhl says most of those exchanges, if acquired by the
Austrian group, would remain as separate markets operating on a
same platform, the German XETRA system, which will go live in
Vienna in Dec. 6.
 By the end of 2011 the exchanges controlled by Vienna
should also share a central clearing house, which will likely
reduce margin requirements, Buhl said.
 ""If someone buys for 10 million euros in Austria and sells
for 10 million euros in Prague, then it's going to be zero
margin,"" he said. ""This is going to bring additional money to
the market because the money can work and ... not be sitting
there as margin.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro slid across the board
on Tuesday, plunging to 2-1/2-month lows against the U.S.
dollar, with losses seen accelerating on nagging worries about
euro zone sovereign debt.
 A financial rescue deal for Ireland failed to contain
contagion fears as the euro fell below the critical $1.30 level
and investors took out many options barriers on the way. The
next key figure to watch, traders said, is $1.2794, the 61.8
percent retracement of the June to November rally.
 The euro was down nearly 7 percent on the month, on track
for its worst monthly performance since May when Greece
received a 110-billion-euro bailout.
 In tandem with euro weakness, the premiums investors demand
to hold Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds over German debt
jumped to lifetime highs while yields on Portuguese, Irish and
Belgian bonds also widened.
 ""Europe is making some very bad decisions with respect to
the whole region and the currency,"" said Peter Schiff, chief
executive officer at Euro Pacific Capital, an asset management
firm overseeing customer accounts of about $3 billion.
 ""They should not have bailed out Greece and Ireland, they
should have allowed them to restructure their debt, and allowed
their bondholders to take losses. Countries would now want to
go into debt because they want those bailouts and the countries
that are responsible get stuck with the bill,"" said the
Connecticut-based Schiff.
 Analysts suggested that given the sharply negative
sentiment on euro zone assets, the European Central Bank should
take a more active hand in managing the crisis. As a result,
talk of an ECB quantitative easing would not be surprising,
said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT in New
York.
 The ECB's meeting this Thursday is therefore crucial as
investors will be looking for comments on how the bank could
help address growing hysteria in the credit and currency
market. It is also widely expected to keep rates on hold and
sources say it could extend banks' access to unlimited
three-month funds beyond January.
 KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS
 The euro fell to $1.2969 on EBS, its lowest since Sept. 15,
before recovering to $1.3022, still down 0.7 percent. Some
traders said there is minor support at $1.2920, the Sept. 6
high. That level preceded a steep rally in the euro that took
it all the way to that early November high at $1.4283.
 A slew of strong U.S. economic data lifted risk sentiment a
bit midday, drawing bids away from the safe-haven dollar and
giving the heavily battered euro some reprieve.
 Some traders said $1.3040 could act as resistance on any
intraday rebound.
 Other euro-zone-linked assets such as euro exchange-traded
funds also fared poorly on Tuesday. The CurrencyShares Euro
Trust traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange was down 0.7
percent at $129.83 after hitting a 2-1/2-month low at $129.23.
This ETF holds euro on-demand deposits in euro-denominated bank
accounts.
 Traders said the ease with which the euro had broken key
levels in recent days reflected the extent of negative
sentiment towards the currency, which has lost roughly 9
percent against the dollar since its peak this month.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities spiked on Tuesday to a
peak of 15.55 percent, the highest since at least June,
suggesting nervousness about the euro zone currency.
 The one-month 25-delta risk reversals, a gauge of currency
sentiment, traded as low as -2.85 vols for euro puts versus a
close of -2.73 on Monday.
 Further reflecting the euro's negative bias, the latest
positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators going net short on the euro for the first
time since Sept. 14.
 The euro zone single currency slid to 1.2934 Swiss francs,
108.33 yen, and 83.520 pence against sterling, all more than
10-week lows.
 With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued to
gain, hitting a more than two-month high at 81.444 against a
currency basket, lifted by safe-haven flows and recent evidence
of an improving U.S. economy. It last traded up nearly 0.3
percent at 81.058.

 * Tariffs will replace bans, finance minister says
 
 By Felix Onuah
 ABUJA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government said it
would abolish import bans on goods including textiles and
furniture, a decision that could help attract retailers to one
of the world's largest untapped consumer markets.
 Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga said the bans, particularly
on finished textiles, were meant to protect domestic industry
but had encouraged corruption and hindered growth in the retail
sector in Africa's most populous country.
 In an annual briefing on sub-Saharan Africa's second-biggest
economy, he said import tariffs would be imposed instead.
 ""Import bans are ineffective and result in a huge revenue
loss to the government through significant trade diversion to
neighbouring countries and the routine smuggling of banned
goods,"" Aganga said in the review, released on Monday.
 ""It is expected these trends are likely to continue;
therefore we have received presidential approval to replace the
bans with tariffs to protect domestic industries.""
 Nigeria banned imports of finished textiles and designs to
try to give domestic manufacturers a chance to thrive.
 The domestic industry has all but collapsed because of
chronic electricity shortages, which force manufacturers to rely
on expensive generators and make local production uncompetitive.
The smuggling of cheap goods from Asia has also been crippling.
 
 PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE
 Aganga said levies and duties of between 10 and 20 percent
would be imposed on imports including furniture, textiles and
energy drinks. The age ban on imported motor vehicles would be
raised to 15 years from the time of manufacture, up from 10
years.
 A percentage of revenue from the tariffs would be set aside
for the Bank of Industry, a government-backed bank designed to
support the manufacturing sector, except for income from
textiles, which would be used to support the domestic textile
industry.
 New shopping malls have been springing up in the commercial
capital Lagos and other cities around Nigeria, but they mostly
sell consumables and electronics. Clothes retailers have yet to
establish themselves, partly because of the import ban.
 Private equity firm Actis and South Africa's Rand Merchant
Bank said earlier this year they had agreed to help finance a
$100 million shopping mall in Ikeja, a sprawling middle-income
neighbourhood of Lagos.
 South African-listed grocery chain Spar Group opened its
first store in Nigeria in August and South African retailer
Shoprite has said it is planning dozens of new shops in the
country in the next decade.
 Most of Nigeria's 140 million people live on $2 a day or
less, but there is a growing middle class.
 There are still significant logistical difficulties for
foreign companies seeking a foothold in Nigeria, including its
shambolic transport and infrastructure network.

 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble needs to be
weaker to boost companies' competitiveness in the medium term,
though increased investment could also help achieve this, Deputy
Economy Minister Andrey Klepach said on Tuesday.
""From my point of view, maybe not now, but .... in the
mid-term future (the rouble exchange rate) can be some
impediment for growth,"" Klepach told Reuters Insider television
in an interview.
 ""We have really weak competitiveness in many Russian
industries and to improve this competitiveness we need a much
lower exchange rate than we have.""
 The Russian central bank has been moving to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility as it shifts to inflation targeting,
and officials have repeatedly said they have no plans to
reintroduce any form of capital controls.

 Klepach said a post-recession recovery in investment could
also help improve competitiveness -- a key goal for Russia as it
strives to reduce dependence on natural resources and develop
other sectors of the economy, such as high technology.
 ""We hope that as Russian companies, as foreign investors can
invest in Russia more, there is scope to improve
competitiveness,"" he said, speaking in English.
 He added that foreign direct investment in Russia needs to
recover to ""a minimum"" of 2 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) -- or some 1 trillion roubles ($31.8 billion).
 In 2009, Russia received just $16 billion in FDI as it
suffered its worst recession in 15 years -- down from the $60-70
billion that came in annually before the crisis.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 10-week low
against the dollar and stocks dropped on Tuesday on speculation
weaker member states of the euro zone may be forced to ask for
financial support.
 Gold rallied to a 2-1/2 week peak as concern over sovereign
debt levels in European countries fueled buying of the precious
metal as a safe store of value. Oil dropped while U.S.
government bond prices trimmed gains after data signaled
faster-than-expected manufacturing growth in the U.S. Midwest.
 The data on regional business activity in November as well
as gains in U.S. consumer confidence did little to halt the
drag on markets due to deepening uncertainty about the euro
zone.
 ""We are starting to see many warning signs of global
contagion, including lower U.S. stock prices,"" said Zach Pandl,
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
 An 85 billion euro emergency loan package for Ireland and
plans for a permanent system to resolve debt crises announced
on Sunday failed to stem fiscal concerns, as speculators
targeted Portugal and Spain.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 62.70
points, or 0.57 percent, at 10,989.79. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 8.64 points, or 0.73 percent, at 1,179.12
while the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 26.10 points,
or 1.03 percent, at 2,499.12.
 Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue of
Portugal although the government in Lisbon denies the country
needs outside aid, much as Ireland did before its bailout.
 While a Portuguese rescue would be manageable, assistance
for its larger neighbor, Spain, would sorely test EU resources,
raise deeper questions about the integrity of the 12-year old
currency area and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.12 percent, paring losses after data showed a
better-than-expected reading of U.S. consumer confidence.
 The Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes
increased to 54.1 in November, the strongest since June, from a
revised 49.9 in October, helped in part by improving labor
market conditions. [ID:nN30178922]
 MSCI's all country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down
0.58 percent.
 CRITICAL DROP
 The euro  fell below the critical $1.30 level to
$1.2977, its lowest since mid-September, before bouncing back
to $1.3008 amid fear of regional contagion and uncertainty over
the currency's future.
 With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued to
gain, hitting a more than two-month high at 81.444 against a
currency basket <.DXY>, lifted by safe-haven flows and recent
evidence of an improving U.S. economy.
 ""The European credit market is in panic mode because of
fears of insolvency (for some euro zone countries) and the euro
is trading off those credit yields,"" said Boris Schlossberg,
director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 ""For the euro to stabilize, credit yields need to stabilize
and for that to happen, we need action from the European
Central Bank. The Irish bailout was not enough and so the
pressure is building.""
 In tandem with euro weakness, the premium investors demand
to hold Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds over German bonds
hit their highest since the euro's launch, while some of the
region's ""core"" debt issuers, including France, were
pressured.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose, adding to the previous day's
gains, as investors turned to government debt as a safe haven
from the recent flare-up in volatility.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose
13/32, with the yield at 2.7785 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the yield at 0.4843
percent, while the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond 
gained 25/32, with the yield at 4.097 percent.
 Spot gold  rose $18.58, or 1.36 percent, to $1,385.00
an ounce after having touched a 2-1/2 week-high of $1,385.85 an
ounce. U.S. crude oil futures  fell 18 cents, or 0.21
percent, to $85.55 per barrel.

 By Andrei Khalip and Noah Barkin
 LISBON/DUBLIN, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone's debt
crisis deepened on Tuesday, with investors pushing the risk
premium on Spanish and Italian government bonds to euro lifetime
highs amid concern weaker member states may ultimately be forced
to default.
 European policymakers appeared at a loss to calm markets
hell-bent on testing their determination to rescue countries
like Portugal and Spain after approving an 85 billion euro
($110.7 billion) bailout for Ireland at the weekend.
 The borrowing costs of countries like Belgium and France
also rose -- and the euro hit a 2-1/2 month low versus the
dollar -- as investors looked beyond the so-called euro
periphery and targeted core founding members of the bloc.
 A Reuters survey of 55 leading fund management houses showed
U.S. and UK investors had significantly cut back their exposure
to euro zone bonds this month, piling into equities instead
despite a weakening in global shares.
 ""The crisis of confidence in Europe can't be resolved
quickly,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm
LibertyView Capital Management in New York. ""No single event can
put things back in order.""
 Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue of
Portugal although the government in Lisbon denies, as Irish
leaders initially did, that the country needs outside aid.
 While a Portuguese rescue would be manageable, assistance
for its larger neighbour Spain would sorely test EU resources,
raise deeper questions about the integrity of the 12-year old
currency area, and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe.
 Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter described the
turbulence hitting the euro zone as an ""opening act"" and
predicted that sovereign default fears could soon extend to
Japan and the United States.
 ""There is no such thing as an absolutely safe sovereign,"" he
wrote in a research note.
 
 EURO SLIDES, SPREADS WIDEN
 The euro fell as low as $1.2969 and has shed nearly 8
percent of its value against the dollar this month.
 The yield spreads of 10-year Spanish, Italian and Belgian
bonds over German benchmarks spiked to their highest levels
since the birth of the euro in January 1999 and the cost of
protecting against a euro zone sovereign default surged.
 Jitters also hit European banking shares, which fell 1.2
percent, led lower by French banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale
and Credit Agricole on market rumours Standard & Poor's might
cut France's outlook.
 ""There is no reason for concern, no risk,"" said Francois
Baroin, France's budget minister and government spokesman.

 Italian officials also scrambled to play down the risks for
their economy, the euro zone's third largest, which some
economists have labelled ""too big to bail"".
 ""Italy's public finances are going well, we are not among
the countries at risk,"" said Treasury Undersecretary Luigi
Casero.
 Weakened governments in Italy, Ireland and Portugal have
deepened the sense of crisis by sowing doubts among investors
about their ability to act swiftly to bring their debt and
deficits under control.
 ""It's very worrying because Spain is almost too big to be
bailed out ... whereas Italy is too big to be bailed out,"" said
Everett Brown, European bond strategist at IDEAglobal.
 Portugal's central bank warned on Tuesday that its country's
banks faced an ""intolerable risk"" if the government in Lisbon
failed to consolidate public finances.
 Although the minority Socialist government in Portugal
approved an austerity budget for 2011 last week, it is
struggling to meet its targets for deficit reduction.
 Data released on Tuesday underscored economic divergences
within the euro zone, which pose an increasing challenge to the
European Central Bank and its one-size-fits-all monetary policy.
 German unemployment fell in November for a 16th straight
month while Italy's unemployment rate jumped to 8.6 percent in
October from 8.3 percent the month before.
 Greek retail sales plunged 9.9 percent year-on-year in
September under the weight of crushing austerity measures agreed
in exchange for its 110 billion euro bailout.
 In addition to Ireland's bailout, European leaders approved
on Sunday the outlines of a long-term European Stability
Mechanism (ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal, that will
create a permanent bailout facility and make the private sector
gradually share the burden of any future default.
 Although private bondholders will not be asked to share the
cost of debt restructurings until after mid-2013 and then only
on a case-by-case basis, the mechanism has stoked fears of
future defaults and the likelihood of so-called ""haircuts"" down
the road.
 Eurointelligence, an online commentary service, said markets
were growing increasingly concerned about the solvency of euro
zone peripheral states after focusing mainly on their short-term
liquidity problems in past weeks.
 ""We at Eurointelligence consider a default of Greece,
Ireland and Portugal a done deal,"" they wrote on Tuesday. ""The
question is only now whether Spain can scrape through.""

 * Chojna-Duch says zloty undervalued, sees no rate hike
 * Polish PM says recent zloty volatility not ""dramatic""

(Adds PM Tusk, Fitch on zloty, detail)
 WARSAW, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The head of Poland's central bank
played down the recent weakness of the zloty currency on
Tuesday, saying he expected the unit to resume its appreciation
once calm returns to global markets.
 The zloty  lost about two percent of its value
against the euro on Monday, extending previous losses as
investors fled assets perceived as more risky amid concerns over
euro zone contagion from Ireland's debt crisis.
 The Polish unit traded at about 4.06 against the euro at
1415 GMT, firmer than its previous day's close.
 ""Fluctuations in the zloty's exchange rate are not
dramatic,"" central bank governor Marek Belka told RMF FM radio.
 ""The zloty will strengthen (again). When the global market
turbulence related to Ireland ends, it will return to its
appreciation trend,"" he said.
 Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed Belka by saying the recent
zloty moves were not ""dramatic"". He was, however, slightly less
optimistic than Belka because he said he expected further
volatility over the winter months.
 ""Unfortunately it seems like this winter will be
interesting, not only in Poland... The possibilities to
influence the currency from here are relatively small. I hope
there won't be a need for such verbal-political moves as two
years ago,"" Tusk told a news conference.
 ""Today we have a different and better situation than in 2008
when it comes to the stability of the Polish zloty. For now, the
zloty's movements aren't dramatic. There will be more volatility
this winter but we should emerge from this unharmed.""
 The zloty fell sharply during the global financial crisis,
almost touching an all-time low of about 4.93 against the euro
and prompting the PM to intervene verbally in early 2009 to help
stop the currency's falls.
 Before the latest market turbulence hit, the Polish unit had
been appreciating and this fact encouraged the central bank last
week to keep its main interest rate on hold at an all-time low
of 3.5 percent.
 It is supported by strong domestic growth -- Poland is the
only country in Europe to have avoided a contraction in the
crisis -- though there are concerns Warsaw is not doing enough
to bring down a budget deficit that has jumped to almost 8
percent of GDP.
 
 POTENTIAL
 MPC member Elzbieta Chojna-Duch told TVN CNBC late on Monday
that December would also not be a good moment to raise interest
rates. Most analysts now expect the first interest rate increase
in Poland to come in the first quarter of 2011.
 Chojna-Duch also said she thought the zloty was currently
undervalued and would ""certainly firm back to a level below 4
(to the euro)"".
 Her comments stand in line with the governor, who said last
week that he saw ""great"" potential for the zloty to appreciate,
possibly by more than 10 percent.
 Analysts said the central bank's expectation that the zloty
would gain down the road meant that policymakers did not see an
immediate need to raise borrowing costs. The bank is seen
raising rates in the first months of 2011.
 Also Fitch Ratings Agency, which has recently warned Poland
should tighten its grip on public finances to avoid pressures on
its rating, expects, in its base scenario, that the zloty would
gain. 
 The unit may strengthen by 1 percent per annum in the medium
term, Fitch analyst David Heslam told a teleconference.

 By Sujata Rao and Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Russia's economic recovery
remains fragile and it is too early for the central bank to
start raising interest rates, Deputy Economy Minister Andrey
Klepach said on Tuesday.
 Russia's interest rates remain at a record low of 7.75
percent but central bank officials have hinted that chances of a
rate increase are growing thanks to an improvement in the growth
outlook and higher inflation. [ID:nLDE6AS0DX]
 The bank left rates on hold this month but in its
post-meeting statement, it removed a phrase about policy likely
remaining unchanged in coming months.
 Klepach agreed with the central bank's view of an improving
economy but said it was too early for policy tightening.
 ""We don't think there is any need to raise rates just yet.
When inflation picks up more, there will be a case but right now
economic growth is still very fragile,"" he told reporters on the
sidelines of an Adam Smith banking forum in London.
 Speaking in Russian, he said the economy's continued
recovery from its worst recession in 15 years will result in
industrial production growth this year of 8 percent instead of
the previous estimate of 7.6 percent.
 Economic growth in Russia lags other big emerging markets
and the pace slowed further in the third quarter to just 2.7
percent. Klepach said Russia is likely to end 2010 with growth
of around 3.8 percent.
 One reason for the weakness was the disastrous drought that
hit Russia earlier this year and devastated the harvest in one
of the world's biggest grain producers.
 Klepach said the government forecasts a strong rebound in
the agricultural sector next year, with the harvest seen at 85
million tonnes versus this year's 60.5 million.
 ""It's tough to make concrete forecasts at this stage... we
have to see how the winter goes. But our expectation is of a
significant rise in agricultural output,"" he added.
 Klepach reiterated forecasts for 6.5-7.0 percent inflation
in 2011 down from 8.3-8.5 percent this year.
 Since the start of 2010, prices have risen 7.4 percent but
inflation tends to spike towards year-end as the government
ramps up spending.
 ""The base case is inflation won't exceed 0.8 percent in
November and the same in December, those are our preliminary
estimates,"" Klepach said.
 He added that the rouble  would likely
appreciate 2-3 percent in real terms next year.
 
 BUDGET DEFICIT
 Russia has benefited this year from oil prices of over $80
per barrel but is nevertheless expected to post a budget deficit
of between 4.4-5.0 percent of gross domestic product.
 However, Klepach told the conference the gap could be less
than 4 percent.
 ""The key difference (in deficit) was not oil revenues. The
main factor for the (smaller) deficit is 400-500 billion
(roubles) less expenditure,"" he said.
 His estimate is more optimistic than that of Finance
Minister Kudrin who was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying
the budget deficit would be 4.3 percent of GDP this year.
 In his state of the nation address on Tuesday, President
Dmitry Medvedev pledged to work on reducing the budget deficit
in coming years. [ID:nLDE6AT13N]
 But Klepach said the need for higher spending on healthcare,
education, science and defence would likely prevent Russia from
achieving its goal of a zero budget deficit by 2015.
 ""By 2015 our objective is to achieve a zero deficit in the
budget. If we want to implement healthcare, defence, education
...we are not able to achieve zero...you make your own
calculations. that's why we are still looking for solutions,"" he
said.
 A stable economic system and steady growth rates of 4-5
percent is ideal, he noted, warning that otherwise the economy
would remain vulnerable to outside shocks.
 The country will continue to suffer capital outflows this
year, Klepach noted, predicting a hefty $22-$25 billion.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro fell across the board
on Tuesday, plunging to 2-1/2-month lows against the U.S.
dollar, with losses seen accelerating given nagging worries
about euro zone sovereign debt.
 A financial rescue deal for Ireland failed to contain
contagion fears as the euro fell below the critical $1.30 level
and investors took out many options barriers on the way. The
next key figure to watch, traders said, is $1.2794, the 61.8
percent retracement of the June to November rally.
 In tandem with euro weakness, the premiums investors demand
to hold Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds over German debt
jumped to lifetime highs while yields on Portuguese, Irish and
Belgian bonds also widened.
 ""The European credit market is in panic mode because of
fears of insolvency (for some euro zone countries) and the euro

director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 ""For the euro to stabilize, credit yields need to stabilize
and for that to happen we need action from the European Central
Bank. The Irish bailout was not enough and so the pressure is

 The ECB meeting this Thursday is therefore crucial as
investors will be looking for comments on how the bank could
help address growing hysteria in the credit and currency
market. It is also widely expected to keep rates on hold and
sources say it could extend banks' access to unlimited
three-month funds beyond January.
 The euro fell to $1.2969 on EBS trading systems, its lowest
since Sept. 15, before modestly recovering to $1.2977, down
more than 1 percent. Some traders said there is minor support
around $1.2920, the Sept. 6 high. That level preceded a steep
rally in the euro that took it all the way to that early
November high at $1.4283.
 The euro also stayed well below its 200-day moving average,
currently around $1.3127, having closed beneath it on Monday to
signal a bearish trend ahead.
 BEARISH SENTIMENT, RISE IN VOLATILITIES
 Traders said the ease with which the euro had broken key
levels in recent days reflected the extent of negative
sentiment towards the currency, which has lost around 9 percent
against the dollar since its peak this month.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities spiked on Tuesday to a
peak of 15.55 percent, the highest since at least June,
suggesting nervousness about the euro zone currency.
 The one-month 25-delta risk reversals, a gauge of currency
sentiment, traded as low as -2.85 vols for euro puts versus a
close of -2.73 on Monday.
 Further reflecting the euro's negative bias, the latest
positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators going net short on the euro for the first
time since Sept. 14.
 ""With euro positioning nowhere near any extreme there is
more scope for downside over the coming sessions,"" a
London-based trader said. ""Flows retained a negative euro bias
with macro funds selling euro cash and positioning to the
downside via options."", 108.90 yen, and 83.665 pence against
sterling, all more than 10-week lows.
 With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued to
gain, hitting a more than two-month high at 81.444 against a
currency basket, lifted by safe-haven flows and recent evidence
of an improving U.S. economy.

 OTTAWA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Canada's economy disappointed in
the third quarter with the weakest growth rate in a year, while
the economy shrank outright in September, adding pressure on
policy makers to safeguard the patchy recovery.
 Gross domestic product growth slowed to a 1.0 percent
annual rate in the July-September period as a strong currency
hit exports and the housing market cooled, according to
Statistics Canada data on Tuesday.
 The performance fell short of market predictions of 1.4
percent growth and was down from revised 2.3 percent in the
second quarter and 5.6 percent in the first quarter. The agency
originally reported a second-quarter figure of 2.0 percent
growth.
 Although Canadian officials often boast of the country's
stellar comeback from last year's recession, it was outshined
in the third quarter by the United States which posted 2.5
percent growth, as well as by some other major economies.
 ""I must say, it contrasts rather sharply with the rest of
the world,"" said Eric Lascelles, chief Canada macro strategist
at TD Securities.
 ""We took a look and based on the historic relationship with
some of those international GDP numbers and ours, you would
have expected we'd be up in the mid 3s (percent), based on how
everybody else did and we just didn't pull it off,"" he said.
 The economy contracted 0.1 percent in September from August
-- the worst showing since August 2009 -- as oil and gas
extraction and factory production fell.
 The Canadian dollar  weakened immediately after the
data and hit a session low of C$1.0286 to the U.S. dollar, or
97.22 U.S. cents, down from 98.17 U.S. cents at Monday's close.
Canadian government bond yields were lower.

***********************************************************
 RATES TO STAY LOW
 Analysts said the weak GDP could prompt the Bank of Canada
to keep its benchmark interest rate on hold longer than
previously thought.
 The central bank lifted borrowing costs three times between
June and September, becoming the first among the Group of Seven
advanced countries to do so after the global financial crisis.
It has since held rates at 1 percent. While no one sees a
change at its next meeting on Dec. 7, markets are divided over
the timing of the next hike in 2011.
 ""There had been some move in recent weeks to price in
earlier Bank of Canada hikes. I think this will put the market
back a step or two,"" said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist
at TD Securities.
 In a Reuters poll of 12 primary securities dealers on Oct.
19, seven saw rates unchanged through March next year while
five expected one hike or more by then. [CA/POLL]
 Markets on Tuesday were pricing in a 99.86 percent
probability the bank holds rates steady in December, up from
95.59 percent just before the data. 
 The news also comes as officials from the Conservative
government tour the country seeking the public's opinion on the
next budget, expected in early 2011 and which will lay out
plans for fostering growth once stimulus spending ends.
 EXPORTS HOBBLED
 Canada's brisk recovery from a mild 2009 recession began to
lose momentum midway through this year as the trade-reliant
country could not shake free of the troubles hobbling its top
customer, the United States.
 Exports fell 1.3 percent in the third quarter after a year
of gains, largely because of anemic U.S. demand for
Canadian-made cars and oil. Housing investment also fell for
the first time since early 2009, dropping 1.3 percent as the
once-overheated market cooled.
 However, there was evidence that much-needed business
investment was making a comeback with growth at a five-year
high. Investment in plant and machinery grew 4.6 percent, a
trend likely to please policy makers who have been urging the
private sector to spend more to keep the recovery going.
 ""It's encouraging. It shows that business is indeed
responding to the strong Canadian dollar and the upturn in
domestic spending,"" said Porter.
 However, he said it was a ""pipe dream"" to think business
investment alone could power the recovery. ""You need the
consumer and exports to really make the recovery solid.""
 Consumer spending showed no sign of slowing and continues
to drive the economic recovery, advancing 0.9 percent in the
quarter. Likewise, the hard-hit manufacturing sector proved
resilient to the strong currency and was one of the main
contributors to growth.

 NEW DELHI, Nov 30 (Reuters) - India's domestically-powered
economy grew more than expected in the September quarter,
defying weakness elsewhere and putting pressure on the central
bank to tighten monetary policy although a rate increase next
month still looks unlikely.
 Annual gross domestic product  grew 8.9 percent
in the September quarter -- matching the revised figure for the
previous quarter and above a Reuters' forecast of 8.3 percent.
 ""Governor Subbarao has strongly hinted that the RBI (Reserve
Bank of India) will take a break from raising policy rates for
the next one or two months, but the strong growth numbers today
may change his mind,"" said Brian Jackson, strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 ""Inflation is still the number one policy focus, and we
continue to expect more rate hikes in the months ahead, perhaps
as soon as the next meeting in December,"" he said.
 The RBI's next policy review is on Dec. 16. Analysts polled
by Reuters expect the central bank to raise rates by an
additional 25 basis points by the end of March. [ID:nSGE6A2023]
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government, facing
parliamentary deadlock over a scandal in which telecom licences
are alleged to have been granted too cheaply -- is under
pressure to rein in inflation while keeping high economic growth
on track.
 Consumer price inflation eased to an annual 9.7 percent in
October from 9.82 percent the previous month, data showed on
Tuesday. Wholesale price inflation , which is more
closely watched as it covers a higher number of products, eased
to 8.58 percent in October from 8.62 percent a month earlier.

 Strong growth in India contrasted with data on Tuesday from
Japan and South Korea, where factories cut output in October
adding to evidence of an Asia-wide slowdown and boding ill for

global economy humming. [ID:nL3E6MU05H]
 China's economy grew at 9.6 percent in the September
quarter, down from 10.3 percent in the previous quarter.
 India's benchmark 10-year bond yield  closed
up 6 basis points on the day, despite further extension of
liquidity easing measures by the central bank late on Monday,
which disappointed markets that had instead been hoping for a
cut in banks' reserve requirements.
 Markets expect the RBI to hold rates steady during its
policy statement in December, after Subbarao said early this
month that the RBI was unlikely to raise rates for the next
three months. However, the long end of the swap curve rose
further than the short end on Tuesday, causing a bear
steepening, reflecting market worries of a rate increase sooner
rather than later -- or at least a more hawkish stance from the
RBI.
 The benchmark five-year swap  ended up 6 basis
points on the day at 7.30 percent, after touching 7.31 percent,
its highest since Nov. 11, while the one-year rate
 ended down 4 points at 6.78 percent.
 Investment growth slowed on an annualised basis to 11.1
percent from 19 percent in the previous quarter, while
annualised private consumption accelerated to 9.3 percent from
7.8 percent in the previous quarter, pointing to inflationary
risks.
 The services sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of
GDP, grew 9.8 percent in the September quarter, higher than 9.3
percent in the previous quarter.
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee predicted India's economy
would grow at 8.5 to 8.75 percent in the fiscal year that ends
in March 2011, up from earlier 8.5 percent government forecasts.
 INFLATION EASING
 Signs of easing inflation, a fragile global economy and
weaker industrial output in September were likely to forestall
any rise in rates in the near-term, some analysts said.
""Unless the full year growth looks likely to cross 9 percent,
the central bank is unlikely to get aggressive again in raising
rates,"" said Anjali Varma, economist at MF Global in Mumbai.
""I do not expect any more rate hikes in this fiscal year. We
also have to look at how industrial production fares going
ahead, as that has started slowing down only now.""
 Industrial output growth -- a key indicator of growth
momentum -- in Asia's third-largest economy slowed unexpectedly
in September to 4.4 percent from a year earlier, down from the
previous month's upwardly revised 6.92 percent growth.

 By Andrei Khalip and Noah Barkin
 LISBON/DUBLIN, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone's debt
crisis deepened on Tuesday as investors pushed the spreads on
Spanish, Italian and Belgian bonds to euro lifetime highs and
Portugal warned of ""intolerable risks"" facing its banks.
 The euro dipped below $1.30 for the first time since
mid-September, immune to new attempts by European policymakers
to calm markets hell-bent on testing the EU's determination to
shield its financially weak members and increasingly nervous
about the possibility of future euro zone defaults.
 Two days after the bloc approved an 85 billion euro ($111.7
billion) emergency aid package for Ireland, worries about
contagion to Portugal and Spain persisted and the borrowing
costs of large countries like Italy and France shot higher.
 Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue of
Portugal although the government in Lisbon denies, as Irish
leaders initially did, that the country needs outside aid.
 While a Portuguese rescue would be manageable, assistance
for its larger neighbour Spain would sorely test EU resources,
raise deeper questions about the integrity of the 12-year old
currency area, and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe.
 Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, is now being
referred to as ""too big to fail"" and ""too big to bail"".
 Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter described the
turbulence hitting the euro zone as an ""opening act"" and
predicted that sovereign default fears could soon extend to
Japan and the United States.
 ""There is no such thing as an absolutely safe sovereign,"" he
wrote in a research note.
 Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa, a former Italian finance minister
and ECB member who is advising Greece's government, admitted
that markets were ""very nervous"", describing worries about Spain
and other large euro members as ""excessive"".
 The euro dipped below $1.30 and has now shed more than 7
percent of its value against the dollar since early November.
The yield spreads of 10-year Spanish, Italian and Belgian bonds
over German benchmarks spiked to their highest levels since the
birth of the euro in January 1999.
 The iTraxx SovX index of western European credit default
swap prices rose to an all-time high above 200 basis points as
the cost of protecting against a euro zone sovereign debt
default surged.
 ""It's very worrying because Spain is almost too big to be
bailed out ... whereas Italy is too big to be bailed out,"" said
Everett Brown, European bond strategist at IDEAglobal.
 Jitters also hit European banking shares, which were led
lower by French banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit
Agricole on market rumours Standard & Poor's might cut France's
outlook -- talk swiftly denied by the government in Paris.
 ""There is no reason for concern, no risk,"" said Francois
Baroin, budget minister and government spokesman.

 ""INTOLERABLE RISK""
 Deepening the sense of gloom, Portugal's central bank warned
that its country's banks faced an ""intolerable risk"" if the
government in Lisbon failed to consolidate public finances.
 Although the minority Socialist government in Portugal
approved an austerity budget for 2011 last week, it is
struggling to meet its targets for deficit reduction, with the
core state sector shortfall widening 1.8 percent in the first 10
months of this year.
 The worry is that troubles in Portugal could spread quickly
to Spain because of their close economic ties.
 Data released on Tuesday underscored economic divergences
within the euro zone, which pose an increasing challenge to the
European Central Bank and its one-size-fits-all monetary policy.
 German unemployment fell in November for a 16th straight
month while Italy's unemployment rate jumped to 8.6 percent in
October from 8.3 percent the month before.
 Greek retail sales plunged 9.9 percent year-on-year in
September under the weight of crushing austerity measures agreed
in exchange for its 110 billion euro bailout.
 Ireland faces a daunting task meeting the terms of its own
bailout and cleaning up its battered banks. Irish bank debt
spreads continued to widen on Tuesday despite the rescue.
 In addition to Ireland's bailout, European leaders approved
on Sunday the outlines of a long-term European Stability
Mechanism (ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal, that will
create a permanent bailout facility and make the private sector
gradually share the burden of any future default.
 Although private bondholders will not be asked to share the
cost of debt restructurings until after mid-2013 and then only
on a case-by-case basis, the mechanism has raised fears of
future defaults and the likelihood of so-called ""haircuts"" down
the road.
 Eurointelligence, an online commentary service, said markets
were growing increasingly concerned about the solvency of euro
zone peripheral states after focusing mainly on their short-term
liquidity problems in past weeks.
 ""We at Eurointelligence consider a default of Greece,
Ireland and Portugal a done deal,"" they wrote on Tuesday. ""The
question is only now whether Spain can scrape through.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro slid to nearly 11-week
lows against the dollar and fell on the yen, Swiss franc and
sterling on Tuesday as a rescue deal for Ireland failed to quell
worries that other euro zone countries may need help.
 The euro fell 1 percent against the dollar, breaking through
reportedly strong option barriers to take it below $1.30.
 A lack of confidence the Ireland deal would contain the debt
crisis caused the premiums investors demand to hold Spanish and
Italian sovereign bonds over German debt to jump to euro
lifetime highs. Yields on Portuguese, Irish and Belgian bonds
also widened. [GVD/EUR]
 ""At the moment there is no confidence that any of these
(peripheral) countries can effectively fund,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds.
 ""Until we get some sort of market appetite for peripheral
debt these worries will continue to weigh on the euro,"" he said,
adding he believed the currency could fall as low as $1.25.
 The euro  fell to $1.2979 on EBS trading systems, its
lowest since Sept. 16, before modestly recovering to $1.3013,
with traders saying model funds and other investors were buying
at lower levels.
 It stayed well below its 200-day moving average, currently
around $1.3127, having closed beneath it on Monday to signal a
bearish trend ahead.
 Traders said the ease with which the euro had broken key
levels in recent days reflected the extent of negative sentiment
towards the single currency, which has lost around 9 percent
against the dollar since its peak earlier this month.
 Risk reversals showed a sharp increase in the premium
charged for buying euro puts -- bets on the currency falling --
over euro calls, with the one-month euro/dollar 25-delta
 trading at around 2.45 for euro puts. This is up
from 1.95 on Monday and nearing highs hit in June close to 3.0.
 The dollar gained broadly, hitting a two-month high of
81.346 against a currency basket <.DXY>, lifted by safe-haven
flows and recent evidence of an improving U.S. economy.
 
 BEARISH SENTIMENT
 The latest positioning data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed speculators going net short on the
euro for the first time since Sept. 14 [IMM/FX], but traders saw
scope for more adjustment.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2010 08:04AM ET</span>","WRAPUP 1-Investors keep faith with stocks, cut euro zone bonds"," * Poll shows global investors raised equity exposure in Nov.
 * Division over eurozone bonds
 * UK, U.S, investors cut euro zone debt, others raise
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Global investors increased their
exposure to equities in November despite weaknesses on many
bourses, while U.S. and British fund managers stepped away from
crisis-hit euro zone bonds.
 Surveys of 55 leading fund management houses in the United
States, Japan, Britain and Europe ex UK showed a continuing
desire to invest in stocks heading towards year-end.
 This was despite the fact that world stocks as measured by
MSCI have fallen close to 6 percent from a high early in the
month.
 A good part of the reason for that decline was worry about
euro zone government bonds, epitomised by fears that Ireland,
now the recipient of a bail out, would not be able to meet its
debt obligations and that the rot would spread to others such as
Portugal and Spain.
 The poll showed investors were divided over euro zone debt
with the so-called Anglo-Saxons, Britain and the United States,
cutting their exposure sharply, but others increasing.
 Eurosceptic Britain was the most negative, slicing the
average exposure to euro zone debt to 7.9 percent of the bond
portion of a typical mixed asset portfolio from 10.7 percent a
month earlier.
 ""There will be more nasty surprises next year. The European
banking system still has major issues and bad debts to write
off,"" said Jeremy Beckwith, chief investment officer at wealth
manager Kleinwort Benson.
 By contrast, primarily euro zone European investors outside
Britain increased their exposure. Some of this may have been a
case of investors bringing their assets home.
 The poll also does not differentiate between moves into core
euro zone debt such as German and peripheral debt such as
Portugal.
 Overall, however, investors appeared to be keeping
relatively bullish, boosted by both the U.S. Federal Reserve's
asset-buying quantitative easing programme and signs of
better-than-expected global economic recovery.
 The managers raised equity exposure to 53.2 percent, the
highest since March, from 52.7 percent on October. Bond holdings
slipped to 34.2 percent from 34.6 percent and cash dropped to
4.6 percent from 5.0 percent.
 
 REGIONALLY
 U.S. fund managers increased exposure to stocks and slowly
cut back on bonds for the third month in a row.
 The poll of 14 U.S.-based fund management companies showed
firms increased their equity holdings to an average 63 percent
of their assets, up from 62.4 percent in November and 61.7
percent in September.
 They trimmed their exposure to bonds to 30.2 percent from
30.4 percent in October. Cash holdings dropped to 2.8 percent
from 3.3 percent. [US/ASSET]
 Japanese fund managers also lifted their global stock
weightings, to an 11-month high in November.
 The survey showed 13 money managers raised their average
weighting for global equities to 47.2 percent from 46.6 percent
the previous month.
 The average weighting for bonds rose slightly to 46.9
percent from 46.8 percent while the average allocation to cash
fell to 3.2 percent from 3.7 percent.
 The poll of 17 Europe-based asset management firms outside
Britain showed a typical mixed portfolio holding 49.6 percent in
equities this month, the highest since February, compared with
48.4 percent in October.
 It held 37.3 percent in bonds including government and
corporate debt -- which is the lowest level since January.
 Cash holdings ticked higher to 6.1 percent in November from
a nine-month low of 6.0 percent previously.
 British fund managers bucked the global trend, cutting
exposure to equities to 52.8 percent in November from 53.5
percent in October.
 Bond holdings rose slightly, to 22.5 percent from 22.2
percent. But there was a large cutback in euro zone bonds.
 A separate poll, not included in the global calculations,
showed China-based funds cutting stocks and adding to cash.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 10-week low
against the dollar and world stocks struggled on Tuesday as euro
zone debt problems weighed on investor sentiment even after
Ireland's bailout.
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a lacklustre open on Wall
Street, after it closed down on Monday but well off its trough
as the market braced for jobs data later this week that would
help gauge the strength of the world's biggest economy.
 An 85-billion euro package for Ireland and plans for a
permanent system to resolve debt crises announced on Sunday did
little to stem fiscal concerns, as speculators targeted other
debt-laden countries.
 The premium investors demand to hold Spanish and Italian
sovereign bonds over German bonds hit their highest since the
euro's launch while some of the region's ""core"" debt issuers,
including France, were pressured.
 ""It's very worrying because Spain is almost too big to be
bailed out ... whereas Italy is too big to be bailed out,"" said
Everett Brown, European bond strategist at IDEAglobal.
 Italian 10-year yields rose to close to 5 percent, while
Spanish 10-year bonds yielded 5.7 percent, pushing the spread
over Bunds above 310 basis points.
 
 NO CONFIDENCE
 The euro fell to $1.2979 on trading platform EBS, its lowest
since mid-September, before bouncing back to around $1.3022 by
1142 GMT. The single currency also hit 2-1/2 month lows against
the yen, Swiss franc and sterling.
 ""At the moment there is no confidence that any of these
(peripheral) countries can effectively fund,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds.
 ""Until we get some sort of market appetite for peripheral
debt these worries will continue to weigh on the euro,"" he said,
adding he believed it could fall as low as $1.25.
 European shares drifted higher from the previous day's
eight-week closing lows, though euro zone debt issues kept
investors cautious. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,072.89 points.
 ""We will stay in a choppy mode for the next few weeks as the
debt problems in the euro zone stays on investors' minds. The
market will also be looking ahead to economic numbers such as
the U.S. jobs figures this week,"" said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein,
equity markets strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn.
 MSCI's all country world index was down 0.1 percent on the
day.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose, adding to the previous day's
gains, as investors turned to government debt as a safe haven
from the recent flare-up in volatility.
 Spot gold was a touch higher at $1,373 an ounce, while gold
priced in euros hit a record high. U.S. crude oil futures
slipped to around $85 a barrel, retracing sharp gains in the
previous session.

 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro slid to its lowest in
more than 10 weeks against the dollar, yen, Swiss franc and
sterling on Tuesday as a weekend rescue deal for Ireland failed
to quell worries that other euro zone countries may need help.
 The euro fell 1 percent against the dollar, breaking through
reportedly strong options barriers to take it below $1.30.
 A lack of confidence that the Ireland deal would contain the
debt crisis caused the premiums investors demand to hold Spanish
and Italian sovereign bonds over German debt to jump to euro
lifetime highs. Yields on Portuguese, Irish and Belgian bonds
also rose.
 ""At the moment there is no confidence that any of these
(peripheral) countries can effectively fund,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds.
 ""Until we get some sort of market appetite for peripheral
debt these worries will continue to weigh on the euro,"" he said,
adding he believed the currency could fall as low as $1.25.
 The euro fell to $1.2979 on EBS trading systems, its lowest
since Sept. 16, before modestly recovery to $1.3028, with
traders saying model funds and other investors bought at lower
levels.
 It stayed well below its 200-day moving average, currently
around $1.3127, having closed beneath it on Monday to signal a
bearish trend ahead.
 Traders said the ease with which the euro had broken key
levels in recent days reflected the extent of negative sentiment
towards the single currency, which has lost around 9 percent
against the dollar since its peak earlier this month.
 Risk reversals showed a sharp increase in the premium
charged for buying euro puts -- bets on the currency falling --
over euro calls, with the one-month euro/dollar 25-delta
trading at around 2.45 for euro puts. This is up from 1.95 on
Monday and nearing highs hit in June close to 3.0.
 The dollar gained broadly, hitting a two-month high of
81.346 against a currency basket, lifted by safe-haven flows and
recent evidence of an improving U.S. economy.
 
 BEARISH SENTIMENT
 The latest positioning data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed speculators going net short on the
euro for the first time since Sept. 14, but traders saw scope
for more adjustment.
 ""With euro positioning nowhere near any extreme there is
more scope for downside over the coming sessions,"" a
London-based trader said.
 ""Flows retained a negative euro bias with macro funds
selling euro cash and positioning to the downside via options.""
 The single currency slid to 1.2972 Swiss francs, 108.90
yen, and 83.66 pence against sterling, all more than 10-week
lows.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar also fell to an
eight-week low of $0.9566.

 * Euro sinks below $1.30 for first time since mid-Sept
 
 By Andrei Khalip and Noah Barkin
 LISBON/DUBLIN, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone's debt
crisis deepened on Tuesday as investors pushed the risk premiums
on Spanish and Italian bonds to euro lifetime highs and Portugal
warned of the risks facing its banks.
 The euro dipped to its lowest level against the dollar in
over two months, immune to new attempts by European policymakers
to calm markets hell-bent on testing the EU's determination to
shield its financially weak members.
 Two days after the bloc approved an 85 billion euro ($111.7
billion) emergency aid package for Ireland, worries about
Portugal and Spain persisted and the borrowing costs of
countries like Italy, Belgium and France shot higher.
 Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue of
Portugal although, as Ireland did, it says it requires no
outside help.
 Should its much larger neighbour Spain require assistance,
it would sorely test the resources of the bloc and raise
questions about the integrity of the 12-year old single currency
area.
 ""Markets are very nervous and may even target situations
that do not warrant such excessive worrying, hence no one can
really predict,"" Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa, a former Italian
finance minister and ECB member, told a Greek newspaper when
asked whether the EU would be able to save Spain.
 ""In my opinion, conditions in Spain are such that there is
absolutely no reason to expect that it will be targeted. I
repeat, however, that markets are in a very nervous mood.""
 Italy, which most analysts see as at lesser risk, is now
being referred to as ""too big to fail"" and ""too big to bail"".
 The euro dipped below $1.30 for the first time since
mid-September and the yield spreads of 10-year Spanish, Italian
and Belgian bonds over German benchmarks spiked to their
highest levels since the birth of the euro in January 1999.
 The cost of insuring most euro zone government debt against
default rose and European shares banking shares fell over 1
percent in nervous trading.
 
 ""INTOLERABLE RISK""
 Portugal's central bank warned overnight that its country's
banks faced an ""intolerable risk"" if the government in Lisbon
failed to consolidate public finances and urged financial
institutions to reinforce their capital in the coming years.
 Although the minority Socialist government in Portugal
approved an austerity budget for 2011 last week, it is
struggling to meet its targets for deficit reduction, with the
core state sector shortfall widening 1.8 percent in the first 10
months of this year.
 Troubles in Portugal could spread quickly to Spain because
of their close economic ties.
 The German economy has been robust this year on the back of
rising exports and surprisingly strong domestic demand, but
countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain face little
or no growth and high unemployment.
 Ireland faces a particularly daunting task in meeting the
terms of its bailout and cleaning up its battered banks. Irish
bank debt spreads continued to widen on Tuesday despite the
rescue.
 In addition to the bailout, European leaders approved on
Sunday the outlines of a long-term European Stability Mechanism
(ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal, that will create a
permanent bailout facility and make the private sector gradually
share the burden of any future default.
 The new mechanism could make private bondholders share the
cost of restructuring a euro zone country's debt issued after
mid-2013 on a case-by-case basis.
 Eurointelligence, an online commentary service, said markets
were growing increasingly concerned about the solvency of euro
zone peripheral states after focusing mainly on their immediate
liquidity problems in past weeks.
 Reflecting EU concerns about Greece's ability to pay back
the loans in a 110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout agreed back in
May, it was given a six-year repayment extension to 2021 at the
price of a higher rate of interest.

 * China offshore bonds to become benchmark for future issues
 * Deal was 10 times oversubscribed and bidding was
aggressive

 By Nethelie Wong and Clare Jim	
 HONG KONG, Nov 30 (Reuters) - China sold a string of
yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong on Tuesday, launching an
offshore yield curve that will become the benchmark used to
price debt issues in Hong Kong's fast-growing yuan market.	
 China issued 8 billion yuan of two-year, three-year,
five-year and 10-year bonds, showing its commitment to
developing the yuan offshore market that has attracted
American blue-chip companies such as McDonald's Corp
and Caterpillar .	
 ""This creates a yield curve and in Hong Kong it becomes
kind of like the 'risk free' benchmark interest rate. People
can use this as a reference for more corporate bonds in the
future,"" Banny Lam, economist with CCB International
Securities in Hong Kong.	
 Lam also said that once investors feel more comfortable
putting their money in yuan-denominated assets for the medium
to longer term, banks will start rolling out riskier assets
such as equity-linked investments.	
 The offshore market has taken off since July when China
broadened the ways companies and investors can use the yuan in
Hong Kong, marking the biggest step by Beijing to make the unit
-- also known as the renminbi -- an international currency.	
 Daily trade in yuan remains tiny compared with other
currencies at an estimated $100 million a day. But the
prospect of a thriving market of currency derivatives, ""dim
sum"" bond issues and even share listings, has banks scrambling
to get a piece of a potentially lucrative business.	
 
 HEAVY DEMAND	
 China's Ministry of Finance tapped the so-called CNH
market for only the second time, selling 2 billion yuan of
3-year debt priced at 1 percent, 2 billion yuan of 5-year debt
at 1.8 percent and 1 billion of 10-year bonds at 2.48 percent.	
 Reflecting heavy demand for the offshore bonds, the yields
represented a significant discount to 3-year, 5-year and
10-year government debt sold on mainland China, that were
trading around 3.25 percent, 3.80 percent and 3.94 percent,
respectively.	
 Tuesday's bond issues were 10 times oversubscribed and the
lowest bid for both the 3-year and 5-year bonds was just 0.5
percent, while for the 10-year bond it was 1.2 percent,
showing how high demand was for the paper, a banker involved
in the deal said.	
 China also sold 3 billion yuan of 2-year debt for retail
investors that priced at 1.6 percent.	
 Until China opened up the yuan to investment in Hong Kong,
foreign investors had no way of directly buying the Chinese
currency due to the country's strict capital controls.	
 But the yuan offshore market, dubbed CNH by currency
trades to distinguish Hong Kong trade from the yuan's currency
ticker CNY, has changed that.	
 Reflecting the demand for yuan in Hong Kong, the Bank of
China's Hong Kong subsidiary used up its yearly quota for
settling trade with the mainland in October.	
 Investors have gobbled up the few ""dim sum"" bonds to hit
the market.	
 Caterpillar Inc's two-year 1 billion yuan bond
last week was covered within 20 minutes of launching, and the
order book for the deal grew to 7 billion yuan ($1.1 billion).	
 Asian Development Bank's 10-year bond priced at a yield of
2.85 percent, 57 basis points lower than similar maturity
Chinese government bonds issued on the mainland.	
 
 BE AGGRESSIVE	
 China issued the yuan-denominated bonds through a Dutch
auction for the first time on Tuesday, via the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority's central money markets unit.	
 That effectively signalled to capital markets that bonds
issued in China's currency can live up to the high standards
of transparency and efficiency expected of Hong Kong dollar
bonds.	
 For investors and bankers though, the auction method is a
departure from the previous process by which lead arrangers
and issuers decided on how allotments were spread out.	
 ""This was a totally different ballgame,"" said Gina MK
Tang, managing director and head of debt capital markets at
HSBC in Hong Kong.	
 ""Allotments were based on how aggressive you are. If you
are aggressive enough, that means you get a good chunk of the
bond,"" Tang said.	
 Indeed, bids were particularly aggressive for the 3-year
bond, which ended up being 14 times oversubscribed.	
 Yuan-denominated bond issuances this year may reach 17.8
billion yuan ($2.7 billion), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
has estimated.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit its lowest in 10
weeks against the dollar, yen and Swiss franc on Tuesday after a
weekend rescue package for Ireland failed to calm worries that
bailouts would be needed in other euro zone countries.
 The premiums investors demand to hold Spanish and Italian
sovereign bonds over German debt hit their highest since the
euro's launch and some of the region's ""core"" debt issuers,
including France, were pressured. 
 An 85 billion euro deal for Ireland, agreed by European
Union finance ministers on Sunday, failed to stop euro zone
peripheral bond yields rising sharply on Monday, reflecting a
lack of confidence the deal would contain the euro zone's debt
crisis.
 ""Markets are very downbeat on the euro zone periphery, not
just about Portugal but also Spain and Italy,"" said Stephan
Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""The euro has had a hard fall and has not been lifted by the
finalising of the Irish rescue deal"".
 He added, however, that the euro may have strong support
ahead of the psychologically key $1.30 level, particularly as
much of the bad news on the euro zone may be priced in after a
fall of around 8 percent in euro/dollar since its peak earlier
this month.
 The euro fell 0.8 percent on the day against the dollar to
$1.3008, its lowest since Sept. 16. It stayed well below its
200-day moving average at $1.3127.
 The single currency also slid to 1.2990 Swiss francs and
109.35 yen, both 10-week lows.
 ""With euro positioning nowhere near any extreme there is
more scope for downside over the coming sessions,"" a
London-based trader said.
 ""Flows retained a negative euro bias with macro funds
selling euro cash and positioning to the downside via options.""
 The latest positioning data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed speculators going net short on the
euro for the first time since Sept. 14.
 ""There are just so many worries over the euro zone. The
euro will test the $1.20-1.25 area this month. I think it could
fall to $1.20 in the first quarter of next year,"" said Hideki
Amikura, forex manager at Nomura Trust and Banking in Tokyo.
 
 DOLLAR GAINS
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.5 percent
to a two-month high of 81.278, as safe-haven flows and recent
evidence of an improving U.S. economy supported the greenback.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 84.04 yen, pulled back by
month-end selling by Japanese exporters, but still close to
Monday's two-month high of 84.41.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar slipped 0.4 percent to
$0.9595, dented by falls in Chinese shares and risk aversion as
a result of the euro zone crisis.
 The Aussie erased earlier gains made after a batch of
Australian economic data lessened the risk of unwelcome weakness
in third-quarter GDP due on Wednesday.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 10-week low
against the dollar and world stocks struggled on Tuesday as euro
zone debt problems weighed on investor sentiment even after
Ireland's bailout.
 The premium investors demand to hold Spanish and Italian
sovereign bonds over German bonds hit their highest since the
euro's launch while some of the region's ""core"" debt issuers,
including France, were pressured.
 An 85 billion euro package for Ireland announced on Sunday
did little to stem fiscal concerns, as speculators targeted
other debt-laden countries.
 ""Speculators are targeting Italy and Spain and are not going
to stop. We haven't seen any selling from real money (accounts)
yet, they're all very nervous but haven't started selling, when
they do it's going to be a wash,"" one Italian trader said.
 The spread between Spanish 10-year bond yields over those of
Germany widened by 20 basis points to 297 basis points, while
Italian 10-year spreads rose for a fourth day to 210 basis
points.
 Yields on the 10-year Spanish bond rose for the eleventh
consecutive session to 5.65 percent, while Italian 10-year debt
yields rose to 4.77 percent.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3016, down 0.7 percent on the
day, and its lowest since late September.
 ""The euro has had a hard fall and has not been lifted by the
finalising of the Irish rescue deal,"" said Stephan Maier,
currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 
 FRAGILE SENTIMENT
 European shares drifted as concerns about euro zone
peripherals weighed on sentiment. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of
top European shares was flat at 1,068.46 points.
 ""Sentiment remains very fragile, with difficulties in Europe
still dominating and investors quick to book profits,"" said
Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
 Japan's Nikkei slid 1.9 percent and the MSCI ex-Japan index
fell 0.4 percent on Tuesday.
 MSCI's all country world index was down 0.2 percent on the
day.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose, adding to the previous day's
gains, as investors turned to government debt as a safe haven
from the recent flare-up in volatility.
 Spot gold was a touch higher at $1,369 an ounce, while oil
slipped, retracing part of the sharp gains in the previous
session.

 LJUBLJANA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Europe and the world's
economic situation has stabilised and the euro will see off the
current debt crisis, European Central Bank Governing Council
member Marko Kranjec was on Tuesday quoted as saying.
 He said he did not expect a wider banking crisis in the euro
area although some members ""have problems"" in their banking
systems.
 He also pointed to global imbalances between leading world
economies as ""a very big economic and political problem"".
 ""If an international agreement on balancing global current
account surpluses and deficits is not reached, trade
protectionism and currency wars can start,"" Kranjec told
Slovenian daily Finance in an interview published on Tuesday.
 When asked, he said the euro will ""surely"" survive and added
that joining the euro is irrevocable as ""there is no mechanism
on exiting this area"".
 Kranjec, who is also the governor of the Slovenian central
bank, said indicators show that the economic situation globally
and in Europe has stabilised.
 However, growth is weak in developed and more indebted
countries while relatively fast in developing and less indebted
countries, increasing global imbalances.

 SLOVENIA DEBT
 Kranjec said he was worried by a jump in Slovenia's public
debt following the global crisis, saying the country's public
finance position could become unsustainable if the government
was unable to reduce debt due to low economic growth.
 Slovenia's general government debt is one of the euro zone's
lowest but it rose to 35.4 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2009 from 22.5 percent in 2008 and is seen at 37.9
percent this year.
 He also said the government was wrong in saying that the
stability of the Slovenian banking system was ensured by the
majority domestic ownership of the country's largest bank Nova
Ljubljanska Banka (NLB).
 ""That is not true. The Bank of Slovenia as supervisor and
regulator cares for the stability of the banking system
regardless of whether NLB is in domestic or foreign ownership,""
said Kranjec.
 Slovenia's government said in October it plans to raise its
stake in NLB to over 50 percent in order to ensure banking
system stability. The government controls some 48.6 percent of
NLB at present, while Belgian banking and insurance group KBC
 has 30.6 percent. [ID:nLDE69K21N]
 Kranjec also said the government has to make it clear to KBC
and other potential foreign investors what stake in NLB could be
available to them rather than negotiating with them without
giving them clear information on what the state wants.

 * Euro on track for worst month since May
 * Aussie loses steam after rebound on current account data
 * Yen ticks up on month-end corporate flows
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro paused near 10-week lows
on Tuesday but few traders think the worst is over for the single
currency after a rescue package for Ireland failed to dampen
speculation that other bailouts will be needed in the euro zone.
 Many traders expect more selling in the euro after Italian
and Spanish 10-year bond yields jumped by more than 20 basis
points on Monday, highlighting the lack of confidence in the deal
to help contain Ireland's crisis.
 The euro managed to hold above a 10-week low of $1.3064 hit
on Monday on trading platform EBS, helped by short-term oversold
technical signs, but it slid to its latest two-month low against
the yen and the Swiss franc.
 It also eased below its 200-day moving average at $1.3128, as
a 3 percent fall in shares in Shanghai dented investor appetite
for risk in general and brought a brief bout of euro
short-covering to an end.
 The single currency slipped 0.2 percent on the day to
$1.3100, with two traders reporting talk of options at $1.3050
and $1.3000, which could generate some hedge-related euro
support, as well as automatic sell orders at those levels.
 ""You probably have more selling to come through. Movements
in European bond yields were savage last night ... and that's a
reflection of the concern that is evident in the market. I
don't think this is over just yet,"" said Richard Grace,
currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.
 The euro has fallen about 6 percent against the
dollar this month and is on track for its worst monthly
performance since May, when it posted a 7.5 percent decline.
 Momentum indicators such as stochastics show the downside for
the euro has become quite stretched, suggesting a snapback may be
on the cards in the very short term.
 But speculators were only mildly short the euro in the week
ending Nov. 23, following nine weeks of being long, according to
data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 That means in terms of positioning, there is little to stop
the euro falling further, said Gareth Berry, strategist at UBS.
 ""On the contrary, with extensive dollar shorts still in play,
further euro/dollar weakness looks like the path of least
resistance as year-end approaches,"" he wrote in a client note.
 The euro faces the immediate test of a 0.5 billion euro offer
of Portuguese bills on Wednesday and Spain's estimated 3 billion
euro sale of 3-year bonds on Thursday after a lacklustre Italian
debt sale on Monday highlighted concern over euro zone debt.
 As falling euro zone bond prices are seen hurting European
banks that hold sizable amounts of such debt, some traders are
starting to expect an eventual test of the August low of $1.2588.
 ""There are just so many worries over the euro zone. The euro
will test the $1.20-1.25 area this month. I think it could fall
to $1.20 in the first quarter of next year,"" said Hideki Amikura,
forex manager at Nomura Trust and Banking.
 FUND SHIFT
 Noting that U.S. shares fell much less than European stocks
on Monday, Amikura also said investors could be shifting funds to
the United States from Europe.
 The euro fetched 110.11 yen, down 0.4 percent after dipping
as far as 109.97 yen, its lowest since Sept. 15, the day of
Japanese yen-selling intervention.
 It flirted with a 10-week trough against sterling after it
fell as low as 0.8408 pounds on Monday, and it dropped as far as
1.3080 Swiss francs, its weakest since late September.
 The dollar slipped against the yen on month-end selling by
Japanese exporters. It fell 0.2 percent to 84.09 yen, but
remained in sight of Monday's two-month high of 84.41, having
risen nearly 5 percent from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen on Nov. 1.
 The Australian dollar slipped into the red at $0.9618 as
investors turned cautious on risk, erasing gains made after a
batch of Australian economic data lessened the risk of unwelcome
weakness in third-quarter GDP due on Wednesday.
 It has fallen some 5 percent from a 28-year peak of around
$1.0183 set early in the month.
 The U.S. dollar remained solid, with its index against a
basket of major currencies staying near Monday's two-month high
of 81.142.
 Now at 80.87, the index could target its 200-day moving
average of 81.78.

eurozone does not spell the end of the euro, Xinhua, China's
official news agency, said in a commentary on Tuesday.
 ""As a major achievement of European integration, the euro is
a landmark in the world's monetary history. It has become the

 ""Despite its shortcomings, which have been exposed by the

 The commentary was written under a Brussels dateline.
 It said the euro was facing its toughest challenge since its

deal with the drama.
 The EU's financial rescue mechanism had enough money to bail
out Portugal if necessary, Xinhua said.
 ""If the crisis engulfs Spain, it would spell big trouble, but
not the end of the euro either,"" it added.
 China, which holds an undisclosed proportion of its $2.65

 Japanese companies cut production for the fifth month and
by the biggest margin since February 2009, while South Korea's
industrial output fell for the third month in a row,
disappointing markets which had bet on a rebound.	
 In contrast, India asserted itself as a regional standout,
reporting on Tuesday that its economy grew 8.9 percent in the
past quarter from a year earlier.	
 Asia's third-largest economy handily beat market
forecasts, but it has a long way to go to become a global
source of demand that could fill the void left by debt-ridden
Europe and the United States, which are struggling to take off.	
 The fall in Japan's output was expected -- in fact a drop
of 1.8 percent was smaller than the forecast 3.3 percent
decline -- after a key stimulus measure, incentives for buyers
of fuel-efficient cars, expired in September, and exports
continued to cool.	
 The drop, however, cemented expectations that the world's
third-largest economy after the United States and China would
contract in the final quarter of the year after a
stimulus-driven spurt in the third quarter.	
 South Korea, among the first economies to regain cruising
speed after the global recession, is also losing steam, though
Seoul still bets on solid export growth next year.
[ID:nBJL002108]	
 ""The inventory rebuilding cycle after the recession has
come to an end, and what we're left with is final domestic
demand, which isn't doing that well across the globe,"" said
Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.	
 ""We will see some slowdown in G3 economies and Asia next
year. With the European situation unravelling, the risks are
more conspicuous.""	
 Weak output reports added to the bearish tone in financial
markets, with Asian stocks and the euro
under pressure from fears that other euro zone nations may be
forced to seek help after Ireland's 85 billion euro rescue.	
 
 
 ASIAN ECONOMIES COOLING MORE THAN EXPECTED?	
 The numbers follow reports from across Asia that showed
most economies were losing traction in the third quarter
faster than thought as the initial spurt of foreign demand
late last year and early in 2010 waned.	
 Economists had long expected Asia and the world economy
would slow in the second half of this year and early in 2011
as the rebuilding of inventories that had been depleted during
the recession was drawing to an end and the effects of
stimulus packages were wearing off.	
 But the cool-down came sooner and turned out to be more
pronounced than many economists had anticipated. The economies
of the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore all contracted in
the past quarter, while growth in South Korea, Taiwan and
Indonesia slowed markedly.	
 That leaves China, which slowed only marginally to a 9.6
percent annual clip in the third quarter, and India, as the
mainstays of growth in the region.	
 However, Beijing's fears that inflation may get out of
hand mean the authorities will probably try to cool the
economy further.	
 Japan's production data coincided with a purchasing
managers' survey for November that showed a third consecutive
decline in manufacturing activity and a sharp drop in export
orders. Official data also showed household spending fell last
month, boding ill for the final months of the year.
[ID:nTOE6AT00J]	
 Manufacturers' forecasts that they would crank up
production in November and December offered some hope, but did
little to change expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep
its ultra-loose monetary policy and stand ready to ease it
further.	
 The central bank would probably do it by topping up its 5
trillion yen asset buying scheme after it has already
effectively pushed interest rates down to zero.	
 In South Korea, a surprising 4.2 percent drop in output in
October from September convinced analysts that the central
bank there will keep rates on hold in December after a rise
this month, but economists and businesses were more upbeat
about the outlook than their Japanese peers.	
 ""Since the policy effects, such as advanced budget
spending in the first half of this year fizzled, the decline
was inevitable but is merely technical,"" said So Jae-yong at
Hana Daetoo Securities.	
 ""Because facility investment and exports are maintaining
strong momentum, the economy will remain fundamentally at a
solid pace.""

 * To keep inflation in check 
 (Adds quotes and details) 
 By James Pomfret 
 HONG KONG, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Brazil, Latin America's
largest economy, expects a more complicated recovery due to
uncertainties in U.S. and European economies, the country's
deputy central bank governor, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva,
said on Tuesday. 
 ""We are living now in a more complicated period for
recovery
out of the crisis,"" da Silva told a Hong Kong business forum.	
 Da Silva noted the complex external environment from
Europe's debt woes and waves of hot money bursting into
emerging markets from the U.S. -- were giving rise to an
""impossible trinity"" of macro-economic challenges for many
emerging market economies like Brazil, in keeping capital
accounts open, preserving monetary independence and keeping
exchange rates stable. 
 ""It appears the situation is unresolved of capital inflows
... playing a greater role in setting rates than fundamentals."" 
 
 Brazil, whose economy and per capital GDP has galloped over
the past decade on strong export and investment growth, is now
facing rising consumer prices and inflation expectations that
are turning up the heat on Brazil's central bank for an
interest rate hike to bring inflation back to the middle of
the target range. 
 ""The current cycle is producing some increase in observed
inflation and expectations"" said da Silva, who largely avoided
direct comment on interest rates except to say authorities
would
""carefully observe"" the situation. 
 ""The pragmatic approach for many emerging markets and
Brazil
is using, is to keep inflation in check using demand management
tools and at the same time use macro-prudential tools to avoid
excessive credit growth,"" added the former World Bank economist.	
 The central bank next week is expected to adapt its
language
to open the way for raising its Selic interest rate, which is
now at 10.75 percent , one of the world's highest.	
 On Brazil's incoming government, led by President-elect
Dilma Rousseff, which has the tricky task of prolonging
Brazil's golden economic run, he said Brazil would largely
maintain the
macro-economic framework and sound policies of the previous
administration, though these would be ""fine tuned"" as necessary.	
 On the fiscal side, Da Silva noted a need to bolster
domestic savings rates to feed higher levels of investment as
well as improving the quality of public spending to bolster
efficiences. 
 The incoming Roussef administration has spoken of making
""substantial"" and lasting budget cuts, a move that analysts say
could assuage some pressure for higher interest rates. 
 The deputy central bank governor spoke in place of
out-going
boss Henrique Meirelles, the longest serving central bank
president in Brazilian history. Meirelles will be replaced by a
veteran central bank staffer, Alexandre Tombini.

 * Investors don't give vote of confidence to Ireland aid deal
 * Aussie rebounds after current account data
 * Yen ticks up on month-end corporate flows
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro won some respite in Asian
trade on Tuesday but few traders think the worst is over for the
single currency after a rescue package for Ireland failed to help
restore investor confidence in euro zone debt.
 Many traders expect more selling in the euro after Italian
and Spanish 10-year bond yields jumped by more than 20 basis
points on Monday -- their
biggest daily rise in more than a decade -- highlighting the lack
of confidence in the 85-billion-euro deal to help contain
Ireland's debt crisis.
 The euro has managed to scrape small gains for now, however,
helped by short-term oversold technical signs, the yen's rebound
on month-end corporate bids and a rise in the Australian dollar
following local data.
 The euro ticked up to $1.3140, up just 0.1 percent from late
U.S. levels, but about 0.6 percent above a 10-week low of $1.3064
hit on Monday on EBS. It was dangling around the crucial 200-day
moving average at $1.3128.
 ""You probably have more selling to come through. Movements
in European bond yields were savage last night ... and that's a
reflection of the concern that is evident in the market. I
don't think this is over just yet,"" said Richard Grace,
currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.
 The single currency has fallen about 6 percent against the
dollar this month and is on track for its worst monthly
performance since May, when it posted a 7.5 percent decline.
 Momentum indicators such as stochastics showed
that downswing for the euro has become quite stretched, suggesting
a snapback may be on the cards in the very short term.
 Still the euro faces the immediate test of a 0.5 billion euro
offer of Portuguese bills on Wednesday and Spain's 1.75-2.75
billion euro sale of 3-year bonds on Thursday after a lacklustre
Italian debt sale on Monday highlighted concern over euro zone
debt.
 As falling euro zone debt prices are seen hurting European
banks that hold sizable amounts of such debt, some traders are
starting to expect an eventual test of the August low of $1.2588.
 ""There are just so many worries over the euro zone. The euro
will test the $1.20-1.25 area this month. I think it could fall
to $1.20 in the first quarter of next year,"" said Hideki Amikura,
forex manager at Nomura Trust and Banking.
 FUND SHIFT
 Noting that U.S. shares fell much less than European stocks
on Monday, Amikura also said investors could be shifting funds to
the United States from Europe.
 Against the yen, the euro fetched 110.52 yen, after plumbing
110.26 yen on EBS on Monday, levels last seen on Sept. 15.
 The euro also flirted with 10-week trough against the British
pound after it fell as low as 0.8408 pounds on Monday. It was
last quoted at at 0.8436.
 Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar dipped against the yen on
month-end selling by Japanese exporters. It fell 0.1 percent to
84.12 yen, but remained in sight of a two-month high of 84.41 hit
on Monday, having risen nearly 5 0 percent from a 15-year low of
80.21 yen set on Nov. 1.
 The Australian dollar climbed 0.3 percent to $0.9651 after
data showing exports from Australia were less of a drag on growth
last quarter than many feared.
 Still, the currency was down some 5 percent from a 28-year
peak of around $1.0182 set early in the month.
 The U.S. dollar remained solid, with its index against a
basket of major currencies staying near Monday's two-month high
of 81.142.
 Now at 80.70, the index could target its 200-day moving
average of 81.78.

end
 * U.S. Treasuries firm, gold edges up on safe haven support

 By Sanjeev Miglani	
 SINGAPORE, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro struggled on
Tuesday and Asian stocks fell as fears that Ireland's fiscal
problems could spread to other weak euro zone countries
weighed on investor sentiment.	
 European shares rose in early trade, however, bouncing 
back from eight-week closing lows in the previous session
after U.S. stocks finished softer but well off their lows
overnight. 
 The FTSEurofirst index of leading regional stocks
advanced 0.4 percent.	
 But financial markets in Asia were weighed down by
concerns over Europe's festering debt problems as well as data
showing Japanese and South Korean factories cut output last
month, highlighting the fragile nature of the global economic
recovery heading into 2011. [ID:nL3E6MU05H]	
 Strong Asian growth, particularly in China, has been one
of the few bright spots for the world economy this year,
giving ailing developed economies a much-needed boost in
exports to the Far East and buoying commodity prices.	
 The euro wobbled but managed to hold above a 10-week low
of $1.3064 hit on Monday on trading platform EBS,
helped by short-term oversold technical signs. But it slid to
its lowest in 10 weeks against the yen and the Swiss franc
as investors moved into so-called safe-haven
currencies. 
 Dealers said the single currency may pull back further on
fears that Portugal and Spain may soon be the next fiscally
weak European countries to be engulfed by debt problems, after
a rescue package was agreed for Ireland at the weekend.	
 Italian and Spanish 10-year
bond yields jumped by more than 20 basis points on Monday --
their biggest daily rise in more than a decade -- highlighting
the lack of confidence in the European Union's ability to deal
with the crisis.	
 ""You probably have more selling to come through. Movements
in European bond yields were savage last night ... and that's a
reflection of the concern that is evident in the market. I
don't think this is over just yet,"" said Richard Grace,
a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.	
 The euro has fallen about 6 percent against the
dollar this month alone and is on track for its biggest
monthly fall since May, when it fell 7.5 percent. 
 Profit taking ahead of the year-end also continued to erode
equities, with Japan's Nikkei sliding 1.9 percent and
the MSCI ex-Japan index falling 0.4 percent.	
 The Nikkei, though, still gained 8 percent in November,
its best monthly performance since March, helped by a global
rally in stocks which took off in late summer.	
 China's key stock index fell 1.6 percent to close
at a seven-week low, weighing on Hong Kong , as tight
liquidity in the domestic money market and fears of more
central bank policy tightening prompted retail investors to
sell heavily weighted financial and resource stocks.	
 The Shanghai index has fallen 5.3 percent this month after
rising 12 percent in October.	
 Purchasing managers surveys on Wednesday are expected to
show China's manufacturing sector continued to expand at a
solid rate in November, but stronger-than-expected readings
could prompt authorities to take more aggressive tightening
steps to curb inflationary pressures. [ID:nTOE6AP055]	
 ""Investors are dumping shares because they are afraid of
rate increases down the road,"" said Alfred Chan, chief dealer
at Pearl Investment. ""Banks are not going to be lending money
as liberally as they wish because the government has capped
lending for next year. Corporate earnings will be restricted.""	
 U.S. Treasuries rose in Asia, adding to the previous day's
rally, as investors turned to government debt as a safe haven
from the recent flare-up in volatility.	
 Spot gold was a touch higher at $1,367 an ounce,
while oil slipped, retracing part of the sharp gains in the
previous session. 
 U.S. crude for January  fell 18 cents to $85.55 a
barrel after rising $1.97 on Monday on the back of a rally in
heating fuel as cold weather gripped Europe.

 * Senators say diplomatic pressure on China has failed
 * Many business groups fear bill will make matters worse
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Monday
called for a vote on a bill to get tough with China over its
currency practices, while a U.S. business coalition warned the
legislation would backfire on the United States.
 ""We are writing to ask that a Senate vote be scheduled on
the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act,"" Senator Sherrod Brown,
an Ohio Democrat, and Senator Olympia Snowe, a Maine
Republican, said in a letter to party leaders in the chamber.
 The action signaled that supporters intended to keep
fighting for final approval of the bill, which was passed by
the House of Representatives in September and is strong backed
by U.S. labor groups, steel companies and manufacturers who
compete against lower-priced imports from China.
 U.S. lawmakers returned on Monday from a holiday break and
are expected to work for a few weeks before adjourning for the
year. House bills that have not been approved by the Senate at
that time would die when a new Congress is seated in January.
 The currency bill directs the U.S. Commerce Department to
consider currency undervaluation a subsidy under U.S. trade
law, allowing companies to win larger countervailing duties on
imports deemed by U.S. authorities to be unfairly priced.
 ""Repeated efforts by the administration to address Chinese
government currency manipulation through diplomacy have yielded
no meaningful results. The American people are demanding
legislation to stop our trading partners from rigging the game
to undercut true market competition,"" Brown and Snowe said.
 Supporters complain that China undervalues its currency by
15 percent to 40 percent, giving its companies an unfair price
advantage in international trade.
 A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said
there had been no decision on whether to schedule a vote on the
House bill. The cooperation of both Republicans and Democrats
would be required to get the legislation to President Barack
Obama's desk for signing.
 A coalition of 40 business and farm groups, including the
U.S.-China Business Council, the American Soybean Association
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warned China could retaliate
against U.S. exports if the bill became law.
 They urged Congress to work with the Obama administration
on other ways to pressure China to revalue its currency and
make various market-opening trade reforms.
 ""We share Congress' desire to have China act more quickly
to adopt a market-determined exchange rate. But the proposed
unilateral measure is not going to achieve that result,"" the
groups said in their own letter to Senate leaders.

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell and the greenback
rose as investors' optimism about Ireland's 85-billion-euro ($115
bln) debt bailout waned, exposing the unappetizing prospect that
Europe's fiscal problems will linger.
 U.S. Treasuries benefited from both the concerns about Europe's
financial health as well as from bond purchases by the U.S. Federal
Reserve as part of its quantitative easing program.
 Share prices in Tokyo are poised to open higher, extending
Monday's five-month closing high. Nikkei futures in Chicago 
are up 40 points at 10,105.
 The euro hit a two-month nadir against the greenback, cutting
back gold's gains for the day.
 But U.S. crude oil futures  rebounded, rallying more than 2
percent to settle above $85 a barrel, as a rally in gasoline and
heating oil futures -- plus tensions in the Korean peninsula --
helped spur demand for crude.
 Evidence of promising U.S. consumer spending for the end-of-year
holiday shopping season is providing little counterweight so far.
Retail stocks had moved higher in anticipation of the weekend sales,
which were better than expected. So on Monday, investors took some
profits in the retail sector. [ID:nN29201368]

 The rescue package was designed both to help Ireland and to stop

2013. [ID:nLDE6AR0MC]
 After rising to $1.3302 , one euro bought $1.3132 -- or
0.88 percent less than what could be exchanged on Friday.
 Analysts expect further losses in the euro, given the uncertainty
surrounding the fiscal outlook of the region's peripheral countries.
The next key target is $1.30 after the euro fell below the 200-day
moving average around $1.3130.
 ""There is a real possibility the euro could hit $1.30 by the end
of the week,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange in Washington D.C.
 ""Given the momentum already in place, the euro will likely be
between $1.29 and 1.32 at the end of the year,"" he said.

 The greenback rose 0.17 percent to 84.24 yen .
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose 12/32

 Sentiment remained fragile, with a sale of Italian bonds meeting
lukewarm demand and highlighting investors' unease about euro-zone
debt. [ID:nTAR001551]
 Irish bond yields reversed an early fall to end the day higher at
9.6 percent and on course to complete the largest monthly rise since
at least 1992, according to Reuters data.
 The rising likelihood that Portugal and possibly other euro zone
states will require expensive bailouts and increase the burden on
Germany, hit Bund futures  which settled 28 ticks lower at

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month low against
the dollar on Monday and may face further losses after Ireland's
rescue did little to erase investors' fears that another euro-zone
economy may require a bailout.
 At one point, the euro fell as low as $1.3065, its worst showing
against the dollar since September. It last changed hands down 0.9
percent at $1.3121.
 Analysts said uncertainty surrounding the fiscal outlook of the
euro zone's peripheral countries could push the euro as low as $1.30.
The euro fell below the 200-day moving average around $1.3130. The
currency's drop below $1.3080 -- the 50 percent retracement from its
June low to its November high -- was another bearish indicator.
 ""There is a real possibility the euro could hit $1.30 by the end
of the week,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange in Washington D.C. ""Given the momentum already in
place, the euro will likely be between $1.29 and $1.32 at the end of
the year.""
 European Union finance ministers endorsed an 85-billion-euro
rescue package for Dublin and approved outlines of a permanent
crisis-resolution system that could make private bondholders share
the burden of restructuring sovereign debt after 2013.
 Matthew Strauss, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto, said neither the agreement nor the official announcement was
able to turn sentiment around.
 Many analysts say markets are still likely to turn on Portugal
and Spain, seen as the euro zone's next weakest links.
 The negative euro backdrop is now being reinforced by an
increasingly bearish technical backdrop and levels of below $1.30
seem plausible in the near future, he wrote.
 Sentiment remained fragile, with a sale of Italian bonds meeting
lukewarm demand and highlighting investors' unease about euro-zone
debt. Also, the cost of ensuring Portuguese and Spanish debt against
default rose to a record high on Monday.
 Many traders said the European Financial Stability Facility, a
joint EU-International Monetary Fund reserve created in May, may not
have enough funds to support Spain if it needs help.
 U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission data on Monday
showed speculators were betting against the euro in the latest week
for the first time since mid-September.
 Elsewhere, the euro fell 0.7 percent to 110.58 yen while the
dollar rose 0.2 percent to 84.24 yen, off a two-month high of 84.41
yen hit earlier.
 There is plenty of U.S. economic data this week that has the
potential to sway market sentiment, culminating with Friday's
November payrolls report.
 Esiner said if data surprises to the upside, it will bode well
for the dollar,
 ""The dollar had suffered from an overly pessimistic view of the
U.S. recovery, so if there is good news about the U.S. economy, we
should see additional unwinding of short dollar positions into the
year-end,"" he said.
 ""That suggests the broader fiscal backdrop in the euro zone could
remain troubled for longer, particularly if other, larger countries
also require bailout programs,"" wrote Bob Lynch, currency strategist
at HSBC in New York.

 * Political impact on EU would be devastating
 * Economic damage on all sides would be severe
 * Germany has no interest in any country leaving euro
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Unlike true love, the euro really
is forever.
 That may seem a reckless notion to advance just as Ireland
becomes the second highly indebted member of the 16-nation
single currency area to require a bailout, following Greece, and
as bond markets close in on Portugal and Spain.
 But the cost to any country of leaving the euro zone would
be so high, and the damage that an exit would inflict on the
currency and the remaining members so great, that no government
would rationally choose to secede, or to push another out.
 Argentina's 2001-2002 economic crisis and $100 billion bond
default, which reduced millions of people to poverty, would pale
in comparison with the likely chain reaction across Europe.
 ""There would be chain bankruptcies. A run on the banks would
be certain. It would be far worse than Argentina,"" said Jean
Pisani-Ferry, director of the Brussels economic think-tank
Bruegel.
 The ""costs of the non-euro"", as they are sometimes called by
Brussels insiders, would be multiple: political, economic,
social, reputational and strategic.
 The common currency launched in 1999 is the apex of half a
century of European integration. Even a partial breakup would be
a momentous setback for the European Union, including for the 11
member states that have not, or not yet, joined the euro.
 The 27-nation EU, which struggles to make its voice heard in
a world where emerging powers are challenging U.S.-led Western
hegemony, would suffer a devastating loss of prestige.
 It is hard to imagine the EU's single market in goods,
services, capital and labour -- the foundation stone of European
prosperity -- remaining intact if countries quit the euro,
triggering disorderly devaluations and chaotic financial flows.
 The exit of a state such as Greece, Ireland or Portugal, or
the imagined departure of economic giant Germany, would cause
immense bitterness and could revive national conflicts that
European unification was meant to bury forever.
 Germany, which sells more than 50 percent of its exports to
the euro zone, would lose vital markets and likely end up with a
overvalued currency that would impede its international economic
competitiveness.
 ""The political consequences would be dreadful. There would
be almighty recriminations. A country that left the euro would
no longer be friends with the others,"" Pisani-Ferry said.
 U.S. economist Barry Eichengreen, who authored a classic
2007 paper arguing that the single currency could not be undone,
reaffirmed that belief in the midst of the Greek crisis.
 ""Adopting the euro is effectively irreversible,"" he wrote in
an article on the economics website Vox.
 ""Leaving would require lengthy preparations, which, given
the anticipated devaluation, would trigger the mother of all
financial crises,"" said Eichengreen, a professor at the
University of California, Berkeley.
 Households and companies would shift deposits to other euro
zone banks or countries to protect their savings, starting a
system-wide run on banks, capital outflows and asset sell-offs.
 Fleeing investors would create a bond market stampede. 
 Since foreign debt would still be denominated in euros, a
seceding state would almost automatically default, causing acute
solvency problems not only for its own banks but for banks
across Europe. It might be shut out of international capital
markets for years and have to balance its budget immediately.
 Domestic debts would either be converted to a devalued
national currency, inflicting severe losses on creditors, or
repayable in euros, bankrupting debtors.
 The administrative and legal costs and complications of
recreating a national currency would be enormous. Businesses
spent billions over several years to prepare for the changeover.
Any country leaving would have to start again from scratch.
 ""Households would probably try as much as possible to hoard
fiduciary euros and resist converting them into the new national
currency,"" economist Gilles Moec of Deutsche Bank wrote this
year. ""This would probably drastically reduce current spending.""
 Any attempt to fix a new exchange rate would likely come
under immediate attack on currency markets, while a float would
initially trigger an uncontrolled depreciation of the new money.
 Trade flows would be severely disrupted. Business costs
would become unpredictable, inhibiting investment. Labour unrest
and social strife would be inevitable as citizens faced mass
unemployment, inflation and brutal public spending cuts.
 That would far outweigh any potential boost to exports or
tourism revenues from a devaluation.
 ""But what if the bank runs and financial crisis happen
anyway?"" Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman asked on his
blog last week, citing a slow-motion run on Irish banks.
 An exit that is neither planned nor chosen but imposed by
irresistible market forces would dramatically reduce the
marginal cost of leaving the euro, Krugman contended.
 That economic logic underestimates the political will that
has driven European monetary union since its inception.
 The creation of the euro was a triumph of politics over
economics. Don't bank on that being reversed now.

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro sank to two-month
lows against the dollar on Monday, with more weakness expected
as investors were left unimpressed with Ireland's rescue
package and remained fearful that another debt-burdened euro
zone economy could be bound for a bailout.
 Analysts expect further losses in the euro given the
uncertainty surrounding the fiscal outlook of the region's
peripheral countries. The next key target is $1.30 after the
euro fell below the 200-day moving average around $1.3130.
 ""There is a real possibility the euro could hit $1.30 by
the end of the week,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington D.C.

 ""The markets remain concerned about prospects in the euro

economy. And this continues to weigh on the euro.""
 The euro fell to $1.3117, down 0.9 percent on the day, but
above a two-month low of $1.3065. The euro fell below a key
leve, the 50 percent retracement from the early June lows to
early November highs, at the $1.3080 level.
 Investors also took out option barriers at $1.31, traders
said.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities extended a recent rise,
reflecting nervousness about the single currency. One-month
volatilities  spiked to 15.19 percent, the highest
since at least June, from 13.85 on Friday.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell and the greenback
rose as investor optimism about Ireland's 85-billion-euro ($115 bln)
debt bailout grew stale, exposing the unappetizing prospect Europe's
fiscal problems will linger.
 The safety trade's early domination on Monday faded as U.S.
Treasury price gains, as well as the U.S. dollar's advances, were
trimmed, giving some space for gold and oil prices to rebound.
 Evidence of promising U.S. consumer spending for the end-of-year
holiday shopping season is providing little counterweight so far.
Retail stocks had moved higher in anticipation of the weekend sales,
leaving them vulnerable to a sell-off. [ID:nN29201368]
 ""This seems to be more of a macro sell-off based on fears of
what's happening in Europe,"" said Angel Mata, managing director of
listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in
Baltimore.
 ""A lot of people don't understand the ramifications here. If
Europe is having these systemic problems, it brings the question of
whether our economic recovery is put on hold."" Mata said.
 While France and Germany hailed the Irish bailout as a rescue of
the euro and set a course for a permanent debt resolution system, the
currency dropped to a two-month low against the U.S. dollar.
[ID:nLDE6AS08D]
 The rescue package was designed both to help Ireland and to stop
a rolling crisis from moving on to Portugal and, perhaps, Spain.
Yields on Irish government bonds are higher than Friday's close and
off their lows seen in early trade after the agreement was sealed on
Sunday.
 The spreads between Spanish and Italian bonds versus their German
equivalent widened to euro-lifetime highs as optimism for the Irish
deal waned.
 Credit default swap costs on Portugal and Spain both hit record
highs on Monday on fears that they may be next in line to struggle
with their debt.
 In midday New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
fell 115.91 points, or 1.04 percent, to 10,976.09, slipping below the
psychologically significant 11,000 mark. The Standard & Poor's 500

Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 28.17 points, or 1.11 percent,

 European shares closed at a seven-week low, with banks among the
casualties. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European
shares slid 1.6 percent to 1,069.24.

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro slumped broadly,
falling to two month lows against the dollar and Swiss franc on
Monday as a rescue package for Ireland failed to soothe worries
other debt-stricken euro zone members may also seek bailouts.
 Analysts expect further losses in the euro given
uncertainty surrounding the fiscal outlook of the region's
peripheral countries. The next key target is $1.30 after the
euro fell below the 200-day moving average around $1.3130.
 The euro was down 6.3 percent on the month and on pace for
its worst monthly performance since May when Greece received a
110 billion euro ($143.9 bln) bailout to avoid a debt default.

 BREAK OF 200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE SIGNIFICANT
 Traders said the euro's break below the 200-day moving
average was significant as this suggested a further slide. The
last two occasions that the euro fell below its 200-day moving

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell as investors
lunged for the safety of U.S. Treasuries on Monday, unconvinced

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2010 10:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Putin does not rule out grain intervention," * Russia may sell grain from govt stocks to curb prices
 * No timing for grain sales yet
 * Russia could import grain. No details available.
 
 (Adds more quotes, background)
 By Dasha Korsunskaya
 MOSCOW, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Russia could sell grain from its
stocks in order to curb price increases, Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said on Monday, adding that purchases on the international
market were also possible.
 ""We cannot tolerate sharp increases in food prices. What can
we do about it?"" Putin said at a meeting with regional leaders.
""We can sell grain from the intervention stocks.""
 He added that the government had yet to determine the timing
for any move.
 Russia has 9.64 million tonnes of grain in its intervention
stocks, around one third of which is feed grain.
 The president of the Russiasn grain Union lobby group,
Arkady Zlochevsky said last week the government could start
grain sales in the first quarter of 2011, starting the process
in January so that it could reach its destination by March.
 The government intends to sell grain at low fixed prices to
the regions worst hit by the most severe drought in over a
century.
 He also said Russia could purchase further grain supplies on
international markets, though he did not provide any specific
details on volumes.
 ""If it is necessary, if we see prices rising we will
implement these (import) agreements and will ship additional
grain volumes to the Russian market,"" he said.
 An Agriculture Ministry spokesman said on Friday that Russia
was in talks to buy 3 million tonnes of feed grain, including 2
million tonnes from Ukraine, 0.5 million tonnes from Kazakhstan
and another 0.5 million tonnes elsewhere, most likely in the
European Union.
 Analysts said on Monday that prices were rising but with
little trade as holders of stock were reluctant to sell.
 ""Slow sales are explained by the legitimate desire of some
farms, which had a good crop in spite of the drought, to raise
money, awaiting the market rise... and to sell on the expensive
market,"" Putin said.
 ""But we are helping the agricultural producers and we have
the right to expect that they behave with responsibility,"" he
added.
 Russia's grain crop fell to an estimated 60.3 million tonnes
this year from 97 million tonnes in 2009.

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro fell to two-month
lows against the U.S. dollar on Monday as a rescue package for
Ireland failed to soothe a market worried about the next
possible debt-stricken euro zone economy to implode.
 Analysts expect further losses in the euro given the
uncertainty surrounding the fiscal outlook of the region's
peripheral countries. The next key target is $1.30 after the
euro fell below the 200-day moving average around $1.3130.
 European Union finance ministers endorsed an 85 billion
euro rescue package for Dublin and approved outlines of a
permanent crisis-resolution system that could make private
bondholders share the burden of restructuring sovereign debt
after 2013.
 Sentiment remained fragile with a sale of Italian bonds
meeting lukewarm demand and highlighting investors' unease
about euro-zone debt.
 ""The markets remain concerned about prospects in the euro
zone,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC
Capital in Toronto. ""If Spain were to apply for a bailout, that
would require a bigger amount because of the size of its
economy. And this continues to weigh on the euro.""
 The euro fell was last at $1.3094 down 1.45 percent on the
day. Investors took out option barriers at $1.31, traders
said.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities extended a recent rise,
reflecting nervousness about the single currency. One-month
volatilities rose to 15.00 percent from 13.60 on Friday.
 The one-month 25-delta was trading around 2.0 for euro puts
versus 1.85 on Friday.
 The cost of insuring Portuguese and Spanish debt against
default rose to a record high on Monday.
 Many traders said the European Financial Stability
Facility, a joint EU-International Monetary Fund reserve
created in May, may not have enough funds to support Spain if
it needs help.
 IRELAND TO IBERIA
 Ireland said the emergency loans would run for an average
of 7.5 years, with an interest rate of around 6 percent. Many
analysts say markets are still likely to turn on Portugal and
Spain, seen as the euro zone's next weakest links.
 Another source of uncertainty is a lack of details on a
Franco-German proposal to make private bondholders share the
burden of losses on sovereign debt restructuring.
 ""That suggests the broader fiscal backdrop in the euro zone
could remain troubled for longer, particularly if other, larger
countries also require bailout programs, and as well raises
troubling questions about moral hazard,"" wrote Bob Lynch,
currency strategist at HSBC in New York.
 Analysts said the market would be watching whether European
Central Bank policymakers, meeting on Thursday, would remove
some of the emergency measures put in place earlier this year.
The euro's losses helped the dollar index to its highest in
two months, above 81.004, up 0.8 percent on the day. The dollar
also hit a two-month high of 84.34 yen, up 0.4 percent.

 By Sandor Peto and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank
unexpectedly raised interest rates on Monday and said it could
do so again, but the first hike in the EU's emerging east since
the economic crisis began did not help stem the falling forint.
 Raising the base rate to 5.5 percent, rate setters said
Hungary's risk profile was deteriorating following a string of
measures by the new right-of-centre goverment that have rattled
markets, and by growing worry over the euro zone periphery.
 The government criticized the move, which it said was not
justified by economic or budget trends -- further widening its
rift with the central bank.
 A Reuters poll conducted last week showed only one of 21
analysts expected the bank to raise rates, with the rest seeing
them on hold..
 The hike was the first since October 2008 and followed six
months of no change, although policymakers had warned government
tax measures -- including income tax cuts in 2011 and new taxes
on some business sectors -- would put pressure on inflation.
 ""The Monetary Council has decided to raise the base rate in
light of inflation remaining persistently above the 3 percent
target as well as the upside risks to inflation,"" the bank said
in a statement.
 ""It may be necessary to increase the base rate further in
the coming months in order to meet the inflation target.""
 The NBH said its economists had lifted their average
inflation forecast to 4.0 percent from 3.5 percent for 2011,
although Governor Andras Simor said the Monetary Council saw
upwards inflation risks even compared to the new forecasts.
 But analysts said they also saw the move as a bid to arrest
a slide in the forint that has accelerated since the government
revealed a plan to scrap private pension funds, the latest in a
series of steps meant to plug a fiscal gap but avoid cutbacks.
 They also said it looked like an assertion of independence
after a string of government attacks, including a plan to change
the central bank law to load the board with its own nominees and
urging the bank to keep monetary policy loose.
 The forint traded at 283.32 to the euro at 1609 GMT, weaker
from 280.84 prior to the rate decision, and near an 11-week low.
Government bond yields traded at 15-month highs and the Budapest
Stock Exchange's main index shed 2.6 percent to a
five-and-a-half month low.
 
 GOVERNMENT-SPAWNED RISK
 Simor noted that Hungary's risk premium had risen since the
government agreed to achieve a fiscal deficit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011. 
 But he added that the flurry of surprising government
measures that have confounded markets also make it difficult to
produce forecasts and make decisions for rate setters.
 ""Hungary's risk assessment has deteriorated in the past two
months. This has global and local causes... We are trying to
produce forecasts and make decisions in an extraordinarily
uncertain environment,"" he said. 
 ""We face new and new (government) measures every day, whose
impacts we are trying to analyse and take into account.""
 The government said last week that it would give a
parliamentary committee the right to appoint the four new rate
setters whose mandate expires next year, stripping Simor of the
right to nominate two rate setters.
 News portal index.hu said on Monday that the move -- which
would give the new appointees a majority in the Monetary Council
-- paved the way for a government plan to make the bank lift its
inflation target to 3.5 percent from 3 percent.
 ""I hope very much that this is a hoax,"" Simor said. ""If the
rules change, that is a factor to cause uncertainty and
uncertainty is a factor which increases the risk premium.""
 Timothy Ash, analyst at RBS, said ties between the bank and
the government had sunk to a new low just as risk aversion rises
among investors worried about the euro zone's weakest countries.
 That has been exacerbated by warnings from rating agencies
that they may cut their view of Hungary's creditworthiness if
the government does not begin pursuing credible fiscal policies.
 ""We would continue to recommend reducing exposure until the
situation in terms of ongoing pension reform, ratings and indeed
relations between the government and the NBH clarify,"" Ash said.
 The forint is the worst performing currency in the European
Union's emerging east, having fallen 4.5 percent since early
October.
 Some analysts said the central bank may raise interest rates
further before March, when the composition of the Monetary
Council will change and the bank might move in the direction of
softer monetary policy to please the government.
 ""Today's move is probably not enough to prompt a significant
strengthening of the HUF and will probably not prevent further
weakening in the near term -- we see the move most as a signal
that more may come, if necessary,"" said Anders Svendsen of
Nordea.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2010 09:20AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Euro zone 2011 growth to slow amid spending cuts," * Weaker global economy, austerity measures to slow growth
 * Deficits seen declining, but debt keeps growing
 * German growth seen slowing substantially next year

(Combines stories, adds Rehn comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro zone's economy will
slow slightly next year as governments cut spending to win back
financial market confidence, but private demand will give growth
a fresh boost in 2012, the European Commission said on Monday.
 In its twice-yearly economic forecasts for the 27-nation
bloc, the European Union executive said growth in the single
currency area would slow to 1.5 percent in 2011 from 1.7 percent
seen this year, but rebound to 1.8 percent in 2012.
 ""With private domestic demand as a whole strengthening, the
recovery is said to be increasingly self-sustaining over the
forecast horizon,"" Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Olli Rehn told a briefing.
 The main engine of growth in the euro zone will be the
biggest economy Germany, where growth is likely to slow
substantially next year from the 3.7 percent expansion seen in
2010, but still be a respectable 2.2 percent.
 A weaker global economy will cut demand for euro zone
exports, but many euro zone governments will also be slashing
spending and raising taxes to return public finances to a
sustainable path.
 The aggregated euro zone budget deficit will shrink next
year and in 2012, but debt will continue to rise, with that of
Belgium and Ireland becoming larger than their annual output,
the Commission said.
 Concern over the ability of Ireland to service its huge
debt, which was boosted by government support to the ailing
banking sector, has forced Dublin to seek EU financial help and
prompted concern Portugal and even Spain could be next.
 The budget deficit of the countries using the euro will fall
to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product next year from 6.3
percent expected this year and further to 3.9 percent in 2012.
 Government debt is set to rise to 86.5 percent of GDP next
year from 84.1 percent in 2010 and increase to 87.8 percent in
2012.
 ""A determined continuation of fiscal consolidation and
frontloaded policies to enhance growth, are essential to set a
sound basis for sustainable growth and jobs,"" Rehn said.
 ""The turbulence in sovereign debt markets underlines the
need for robust policy action.""
 
 PORTUGAL, SPAIN TARGETS
 The market spotlight has now turned to Portugal, which has a
large debt, but very slow growth and an uncompetitive economy.
 Weighed down by heavy cuts in budget spending and higher
taxes, Portugal will fall back into recession, contracting 1
percent in 2011, and return only to weak growth of 0.8 percent
in 2012, the Commission forecast.
 Lisbon plans to cut its budget deficit to 4.9 percent in
2011 from 7.3 percent this year, but its debt will rise to 88.8
percent of GDP in 2011 from 82.8 percent seen this year.
 ""In case the fiscal target would be missed because of
somewhat lower growth materialising, then the government assumes
that is essential still to meet the fiscal target if necessary
by taking additional measures,"" Rehn said.
 ""And moreover, it is clear that it is essential that
Portugal will develop and implement equally ambitious structural
reforms to reach its growth potential,"" he added.
 Ireland, which on Sunday agreed on an 85 billion euro rescue
package from the EU and the International Monetary Fund, will
see its economy grow 0.9 percent next year after a 0.2 percent
contraction this year, but growth should accelerate to 1.9
percent in 2012, the Commission said.
 Dublin will have the biggest budget gap in the EU of 32.3
percent this year, because of huge costs of supporting its
ailing banking sector, but will reduce that shortfall to 10.3
percent next year and cut it further to 9.1 percent in 2012.
 ""The Irish economy is flexible and while there are serious
challenges concerning public finances and especially the banking
sector... it has the capacity of rebounding rapidly from this
recession. Export growth is already a fact,"" Rehn said.
 Spain, also in the market spotlight because of its low
growth and a potentially costly repair of its banking system,
will contract 0.2 percent in 2010 but grow again 0.7 percent in
2011 and 1.7 percent in 2012, the Commission said.
 Its deficit is to fall to 6.4 percent in 2011 from 9.3
percent in 2010 and to 5.5 percent in 2012 as Madrid's austerity
measures kick in. Spain wants to cut its budget deficit to 6
percent next year, a target Rehn called challenging.
 ""The Spanish fiscal strategy...is on track. If growth next
year is lower than expected, it is necessary to take further
measures to make sure that the fiscal target is met,"" he said.
 While deficits will decline, debt will still rise.
 The highest debt of all EU countries will be in Greece,
where debt will balloon to 105.2 percent of GDP next year from
140.2 percent in 2010 and rise even further to 156 percent in
2012.
 Belgium will see its debt rise from 98.6 percent of GDP this
year to 100.5 percent in 2011 and to 102.1 percent in 2012.
 Ireland's debt is also likely to grow to 107 percent of GDP
next year from 97.4 percent expected in 2010, and to jump to
114.3 percent in 2012.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Ireland's debt bailout failed to
give European markets much of a boost on Monday, although
globally there was more of a willingness to buy riskier assets.
 Wall Street looked set to open modestly higher, and emerging
market stocks as measured by MSCI gained around a quarter of a
percent.
 But the euro was generally weaker and dropped below $1.32.
European stocks fell back into negative territory after some
early gains.
 European Union finance ministers endorsed an 85 billion-euro
($115 billion) loan package on Sunday to help Dublin cover bad
bank debts and bridge a huge budget deficit.
 They also approved the outlines of a long-term European
Stability Mechanism (ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal,
that will create a permanent bailout facility and make the
private sector gradually share the burden of future defaults.
 The package was designed both to help Ireland and to stop a
rolling crisis from moving on to Portugal and, perhaps, Spain.
 Irish government bond yields fell in response but elsewhere
on the periphery, the news was received more cautiously.
 Portuguese and Spanish 10-year bonds moved little and
analysts said that the EU moves were unlikely to lessen
expectations that at least Portugal would also need financial
assistance.
 ""With Portugal, we still think they eventually will have to
tap the fund because yields at the moment (above 7 percent) are
too high,"" said Peter Schaffrik, head of European rates strategy
at RBC Capital Markets.
 European assets have been hit by concerns over the spread of
the debt crisis, although the reaction has not been as great as
it was in May and June during the Greek crisis.
 Underlying market positioning also does not suggest any
immediate expectations of disaster for the euro zone.
 That said, the euro was at $1.3188, around two-month lows.
 ""The difficulty for the market is to allow itself the luxury
of letting these developments get traction in a currency market
where buying the euro is still akin to catching the falling
knife,"" Daragh Maher, deputy head of global foreign exchange
research at CIB wrote.
 Recent signs of recovery in the U.S. economy may also be
boosting the dollar. A lower euro, meanwhile, will help the euro
zone maintain what has been some steady signs of economic
improvement, notwithstanding the debt issue.
 
 WEAK STOCKS
 European shares were also weaker, with the FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent.
 ""I think it's on the euro-zone in general as there is still
no 'final solution' for the sovereign debt crisis -- everyone is
afraid of another country asking for aid ... and another ... and
another,"" on trader said.
 The underling picture for European equities has not been so
bad, however.
 Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research reported on Monday that
nearly two-thirds of the companies in the Euro Stoxx 600 index
had beaten earnings expectations in the third quarter.

 LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro fell to two-month lows
against the dollar on Monday as investors looked past a rescue

 ""The euro remains a sell on rallies and any relief is
temporary,"" said Ankita Dudani, G-10 currency strategist at RBS

is whether Portugal needs help this year or the first thing next

 Many traders think the European Financial Stability
Facility, a joint EU-IMF fund created in May, may not have
enough funds to support Spain if it needs help. [ID:nLDE6AR09R]
 The euro was down 0.56 percent at $1.3172 , having
fallen to $1.3166, its lowest since Sept. 21. It fell through
its 100-day moving average on Friday, a bearish signal, and the
next target is its 200-day moving average currently at $1.3129.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities extended a recent ascent,

 Ireland said the emergency loans would run for an average of
7.5 years [ID:nWEA2085], with an interest rate of around 6
percent. Many analysts say markets are still likely to turn on
Portugal and Spain, seen as the euro zone's next weakest links.
 ""It is going to be difficult to ringfence Ireland,"" said Tom
Levinson, FX strategist at ING. ""The euro will continue to
struggle in a week when we can expect some decent U.S. data.""
 Another source of uncertainty is a lack of details on a
Franco-German proposal to make private bondholders share the

 By Erik Kirschbaum and Daniel Flynn
 BERLIN/PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Germany and France declared
on Monday that Europe had taken decisive action to save the euro
by rescuing Ireland and laying the foundations of a permanent
debt resolution system, but investors were not convinced.
 Under pressure to arrest the threat to the currency before
markets opened and prevent contagion engulfing Portugal and
Spain, EU finance ministers endorsed an 85 billion-euro ($115
billion) loan package on Sunday to help Dublin cover bad bank
debts and bridge a huge budget deficit.
 They also approved the outlines of a long-term European
Stability Mechanism (ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal,
that will create a permanent bailout facility and make the
private sector gradually share the burden of any future default.
 ""This is a measure which is not simply a single shot taken
in response to an important crisis, it forms part of the
absolute determination of Europe -- of France and Germany -- to
save the euro zone,"" French government spokesman Francois Baroin
told Europe 1 radio.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said now that
clarity had been achieved, ""we are hoping for calming and
reality in the financial markets"", where he said speculation
against euro zone countries was ""hardly rational"".
 And French Economy Christine Lagarde said ""irrational"",
""sheep-like"" markets were not pricing sovereign debt risk in
Europe correctly.
 The euro hovered near two-month lows against the dollar as
investors looked past the Ireland rescue to the debt woes of
other peripheral euro zone economies.
 And the risk premium investors charge to hold Irish, Spanish
and Portuguese bonds rather than safe-haven German bunds fell
only slightly in early London trade.
 ""There are still lingering worries about the rest of the
countries, including Portugal and Spain,"" said Lorraine Tan,
director of Asian equity research at ratings agency Standard &
Poor's. ""It does raise risk worries and there are less people
willing to take risk at this stage.""
 Nouriel Roubini, the U.S. economist who warned of an
impending credit crisis before 2007, told the Diario Economico
business daily that Portugal was increasingly likely to need an
international bailout.
 ""Like it or not, Portugal is reaching the critical point.
Perhaps it could be a good idea to ask for a bailout in a
preventative fashion,"" he said.
 Adding to the gloom, Portuguese business confidence dipped
in November for the second straight month, on poor prospects for
the economy due to austerity measures designed to calm investor
concerns about its creditworthiness.
 Troubles in Portugal, widely seen as the next euro zone
""domino"" at risk, could spread quickly to its neighbour Spain
because of their close economic ties.
 Interest rate strategists expect Spain will have to pay more
to lure investors to Thursday's offering of three-year bonds,
but five-year credit default swaps on BBVA and Santander
tightened on Monday after widening aggressively last week.
 The new European Stability Mechanism could make private
bondholders share the cost restructuring a euro zone country's
debt issued after mid-2013 on a case-by-case basis.
 The lack of detail in an earlier Franco-German deal on a
crisis mechanism, agreed last month, and talk of private
investors having to take losses, or ""haircuts"", on the value of
sovereign bonds, helped drive Ireland over the cliff.
 
 NO SILVER BULLET
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen, who for weeks denied
Dublin needed a bailout, expressed satisfaction with the deal
despite the interest rate of close to 6 percent which Ireland
will have to pay on the loans.
 ""This agreement is necessary for our country and our people.
The final agreed programme represents the best available deal
for Ireland,"" Cowen said.
 Ireland was given an extra year, until 2015, to get its
budget deficit down below the EU limit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product in an acknowledgment that austerity measures
will hit economic growth in the next four years.
 But initial reactions from market analysts to the EU moves
ranged from sceptical to bleak. 
 ""I don't think this is going to be a silver bullet. I think
there are still going to be some question marks on Portugal and
Spain,"" said Peter Westaway, chief economist at brokers Nomura.
 ""I think it is almost impossible now to stop the contagion,""
said Mark Grant, managing director of corporate syndicate and
structured debt products at Southwest Securities in Florida.
 International Monetary Fund procedures would apply in the
ESM. The IMF's ""lending into arrears"" policy stipulates that the
Fund will lend to a country that is making good-faith efforts to
come to an agreement with bondholders.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the
important points were that the IMF's doctrine would apply, the
European Union would not get involved in debt restructuring
itself and existing bondholders would not be hit retroactively.
 Debt worries have driven the crisis for the past year,
severely denting confidence in the 12-year-old euro currency and
producing what amounts to a showdown between European
politicians and financial markets.
 The proposed permanent crisis resolution mechanism, to be
finalised in the coming weeks, is intended to prevent Europe
having to rush like a fireman from one blaze to another.
 But it breaks several longstanding taboos:
 - it effectively tears up the ""no bailout"" clause in the EU
treaty, to which a exception had already been made for Greece;
 - it creates a permanent rescue mechanism to replace the
temporary three-year facility established in May;
 - it accepts for the first time the possibility of a
sovereign default in the euro zone;
 - and it allows for the possibility of making private
bondholders share the cost with taxpayers after mid-2013.

 By Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy grew at a
record pace in the third quarter, data showed on Monday, further
widening the gap between the Nordic country and most of its
European peers and boosting the case for near-term rate hikes.
 The unprecedented expansion, which prompted a warning from
Finance Minister Anders Borg to the country's banks and other
sectors to guard against trying to grow too fast, contrasted
starkly with the disarray in parts of the euro zone.
 Dragged down by its overstretched lenders, Ireland at the
weekend became the second country in the single currency area to
agree a bailout, with the package failing to stem investors'
concerns other states might follow suit.
 The two-speed growth outlook was confirmed by data from the
European Commission, which forecast Sweden would expand 4.8
percent this year and 3.3 percent next compared with respective
rates of 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent for the euro zone.
 The surprisingly strong jump in Sweden's third quarter gross
domestic product -- by 2.1 percent from the second quarter and
6.9 percent year-on-year -- also creates a potential policy
dilemma for the central bank as faster rate hikes would put
upward pressure on the Swedish crown, crimping export growth.
 The crown hit its strongest level in a month against the
euro on the data, and Riksbank interest rate futures and bond
yields rose.
 The Statistics Office said the annual growth rate was the
highest since 1970 when comparable figures were first collated,
adding the economy was now back at the same level as the third
quarter of 2007, before the global financial crisis.
 Finance Minister Borg said he expected growth to return to
more normal rates of expansion but did not specify when.
 ""We believe the Riksbank will raise (rates) in December, and
February and in July next year,"" said Elisabet Kopelman, analyst
at Handelsbanken, adding that the strength of the data raised the
probability the central bank might also hike in April.
 The bank's policy path shows rates averaging 1.3 percent in
the first quarter of 2011 and 2.0 percent in the final three
months of 2011, compared with 1.0 percent now.
 
 AVOID OVERHEATING
 Sweden has already hiked key interest rates three times this
year as its economy rebounded swiftly from its steepest fall
since World War Two.
 ""It is very, very, very important that we do not suffer from
hubris. We will continue to be careful,"" Borg told reporters. He
hoped banks would not grow too fast nor house prices rise too
rapidly and was cautious about possible further tax cuts.
 ""The key is strong public finances,"" he added.
 Global demand for capital goods has boosted Sweden's exports
and low rates have underpinned domestic demand. In contrast to
most of Europe, the government has been able to boost growth via
spending hikes and tax cuts.
 Household consumption rose 3.5 percent and public
consumption by 1.8 percent in the quarter. Fixed capital
formation rose 11.2 percent, while inventories also grew.
 The domestic situation -- not least surging household
lending -- argues for faster hikes.
 But with rates in Europe, the United States and other major
economies likely to remain on hold through 2011, the Riksbank
will be wary of going it alone in tightening policy.
 Higher rates will likely mean a stronger crown and pain for
Sweden's key exporters. It will also push down inflation.
 Two of the Riksbank's board members voted against the last
rate hike in October, arguing a stronger currency would lead to
tighter monetary policy than intended.
 While the board hiked rates in October to 1.0 percent, it
said the pace of increases ahead would slow, mainly due to a
weak recovery in the euro zone and the United States.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near two-month
lows against the dollar on Monday as investors looked past a
rescue package for Ireland to debt problems in other peripheral
euro zone economies and sold the currency on any bounce.
 European Union finance ministers endorsed an 85 billion euro
package to help Dublin cover bad bank debts and bridge its
budget deficit, and approved outlines of a permanent crisis-
resolution system which could make private bond holders share
the burden of restructuring sovereign debt after 2013.
 A key question is whether the EU has done enough to stem
contagion to other euro zone members such as Portugal and Spain,
a problem left unresolved after Greece was bailed out in May.
 ""The euro remains a sell on rallies and any relief is
temporary,"" said Ankita Dudani, G-10 currency strategist at RBS
Global Banking. ""Ireland is taken care of but now the question
is whether Portugal needs help this year or the first thing next
year. And then you have Spain.""
 The euro was up marginally at $1.3255, having fallen as far
as $1.3182 earlier in Asia. It fell through its 100-day moving
average on Friday, a bearish signal, and the next target is its
200-day moving average currently at $1.3131.
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities maintained their recent
ascent, reflecting nervousness about the single currency.
One-month inched up to 14.35 percent from 13.60 on Friday, while
risk-reversals increasingly bid for the downside. The one-month
25-delta was trading around 1.95 for euro puts versus 1.85 on
Friday.
 Many traders think the European Financial Stability
Facility, a joint EU-IMF fund created in May, may not have
enough funds to support Spain if it needs help.
 ""The difficulty for the market is to allow itself the luxury
of letting these developments get traction in a currency market
where buying the euro is still akin to catching the falling
knife,"" Daragh Maher, deputy head of global foreign exchange
research at CIB wrote. 
 
 IRELAND TO IBERIA
 Ireland said the emergency loans would run for an average of
7.5 years, and EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said
the final interest rate was likely to be about 6 percent,
slightly lower than some had expected.
 Another source of uncertainty is a lack of details on a
Franco-German proposal to make private bondholders share the
burden of losses on sovereign debt restructuring.
 European Central Bank policymaker Christian Noyer brushed
aside the possibility of investors taking losses or ""haircuts""
on sovereign bonds. The market showed a muted response.
 Analysts said the market would be on the lookout for whether
ECB policymakers, meeting on Thursday, would go ahead and remove
some of the emergency measures put in place earlier this year.
 While some analysts think the Irish package would reduce
Irish banks' need for ECB funding, RBS's Dudani said euro zone
banks were still grappling with funding problems and the
emergency measures were needed.
 The euro's uptick saw the dollar index dip to 80.256. It
rose to its highest level in two months against a basket of
major currencies at 80.652 earlier in the session.
 The dollar briefly hit a two-month high of 84.20 yen, but
retreated to 83.95 yen, down 0.2 percent for the day.
 The Swedish crown rose to a one-month high versus the euro
after Swedish third-quarter growth came in much stronger than
forecast. The euro fell to 9.2180 crowns, its lowest since Oct.
26, compared to around 9.25 before the data.

 * To pay 148 rand per share for 51 percent of retailer
 * Will keep Massmart listed in Johannesburg
 * Massmart shares up 0.2 percent to 142 rand

 By David Dolan
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart is to pay $2.3
billion for control of Massmart, giving the world's largest
retailer a substantial presence in South Africa and paving the
way for further expansion across the continent.
 The Wal-Mart tie-up will help discount retailer Massmart
speed up expansion in sub-Saharan Africa and increase its food
retailing business, the South African company's chief executive
said on Monday.
 The deal will also likely pit Wal-Mart, which has long
battled with organised labour in the United States, against
South Africa's powerful trade unions, some of which have
threatened to strike against the U.S. giant.
 Massmart's chief executive, Grant Pattison, said the company
would retain its local listing and South African management
after the deal. Analysts have said local expertise would be
critical to avoid a bruising union fight.
 ""What isn't going to happen is a bunch of Wal-Mart people
around here start running the company,"" Pattison said on a
conference call with reporters.
 ""South African management will continue to manage the
business.""
 The two companies said in a joint statement Wal-Mart would
pay 148 rand for a 51 percent stake in the South African
company, which has a presence in 14 countries in Africa. The
value of the deal is 16.5 billion rand ($2.3 billion), Massmart
executives said.
 Massmart shares were up 0.2 percent at 142 rand at 1345 GMT.
Wal-Mart's bid, including the price, was first announced in
September.
 
 NEW BALL GAME
 ""Owning a majority stake allows them that degree of control
that they need at this stage, while it also appeases
(Massmart's) shareholders,"" said Natalie Berg, global research
director at Planet Retail, an industry research firm.
 ""Wal-Mart is not going to be making many changes initially.
Even though they are present in 16 countries around the world,
ranging from India and Costa Rica, retailing in South Africa is
a whole new ball game.""
 Wal-Mart said in September it was looking to buy up to all
of the South African retailer, but scaled that back to more than
50 percent last month.
 By taking 51 percent of Massmart, Wal-Mart will gain control
of the company but keep it listed in Johannesburg, which may be
critical to getting a go-ahead from South African authorities.
 Some foreign shareholders, mostly emerging market funds,
wanted the company to remain listed so they could stick with
their investment, Guy Hayward, Massmart's chief financial
officer said. South Africa's government and the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange also expressed an interest in seeing the company
retain its listing, CEO Pattison said.
 South Africa's government last year scuppered a $24 billion
tie-up between local telecom MTN Group and India's Bharti Airtel
due to concern that MTN would lose its local listing.
 Wal-Mart is unlikely to consider raising its stake in the
immediate future, said Andy Bond, Wal-Mart's executive vice
president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 ""This majority purchase is not a stealth way of buying 100
percent. We have every intention of the stock market listing,""
Bond told Reuters in an interview in Johannesburg. He also said
the company would rely on local management for union
negotiations.
 The deputy general secretary of the South African
Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU) said
this month he could not rule out the possibility of a strike if
the deal went through
 The two companies said Wal-Mart has received ""irrevocable""
agreements from institutional shareholders holding 35.2 percent
of Massmart shares to agree to the deal.
 In addition, it has received non-binding letters of support
from shareholders holding about 15 percent of Massmart's shares.
 The deal will help Massmart accelerate its expansion in
Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi and Uganda, Pattison said, as well as
bolster its supply chain in perishable items.

 By Erik Kirschbaum and Daniel Flynn
 BERLIN/PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Germany and France said on
Monday that Europe had acted decisively to save the euro by
rescuing Ireland and agreeing the basis of a permanent debt
resolution system, but financial markets were unconvinced.
 The euro's respite rally was brief in the early hours of
Monday's trading and European shares closed at a seven-week low,
with banks among the losers as investor optimism over Ireland's
debt bailout faded.
 Yields on Irish government bonds were higher than Friday's
close and off their lows seen in early trade after the agreement
was sealed on Sunday. The spreads between Spanish and Italian
bonds versus their German equivalent widened to euro-lifetime
highs as optimism for the Irish deal waned.
 Credit default swap costs on Portugal and Spain both hit
record highs on Monday on fears they may be next in line to
struggle with their debt.
 ""The benefits to Portugal and Ireland can be seen, but
they're marginal. On the other hand, there is concern about the
rest, with the spreads for Belgium, Italy and Spain all
widening,"" Monument Securities strategist Marc Ostwald said.
 ""It just goes to reinforce the point that the market says
'when is the next problem going to occur?' And that is not going
away,"" he added.
 Under pressure to arrest the threat to the euro and prevent
contagion engulfing Portugal and Spain, EU finance ministers on
Sunday agreed an 85 billion-euro ($115 billion) package to help
Dublin cover bad bank debts and bridge a huge budget deficit.
 They also approved the outlines of a long-term European
Stability Mechanism (ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal,
that will create a permanent bailout facility and make the
private sector gradually share the burden of any future default.
 
 ""ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION""
 ""This is a measure which is not simply a single shot taken
in response to an important crisis, it forms part of the
absolute determination of Europe -- of France and Germany -- to
save the euro zone,"" French government spokesman Francois Baroin
told Europe 1 radio.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said calm and
reality should return to financial markets and French Economy
Christine Lagarde said ""irrational"", ""sheep-like"" markets were
not pricing sovereign debt risk in Europe correctly.
 Markets were unmoved by their urgings.
 ""I think it is almost impossible now to stop the contagion,""
said Mark Grant, managing director of corporate syndicate and
structured debt products at Southwest Securities in Florida.
 
 ""PREVENTATIVE BAILOUT""
 Portugal is widely seen as the next euro zone ""domino"" at
risk and business confidence data for November added to the
gloom. It fell for the second straight month on poor prospects
for the economy due to austerity measures designed to calm
investor concerns about its creditworthiness.
 Portugal's Labour Minister Helena Andre said the government
was preparing to start talks with firms and unions on reforming
the labour market to increase competitiveness.
 Nouriel Roubini, the U.S. economist who warned of an
impending credit crisis before 2007, told the Diario Economico
business daily that Portugal would likely need a bailout.
 ""Like it or not, Portugal is reaching the critical point.
Perhaps it could be a good idea to ask for a bailout in a
preventative fashion,"" he said.
 Troubles in Portugal could spread quickly to Spain because
of their close economic ties, and the Spanish government is seen
as having to pay more to lure investors to Thursday's three-year
bond offering.
 Roubini said that while Spain had better budget and debt
positions than other euro periphery states, high unemployment
and the collapse of a property bubble meant that, like Ireland,
its banking sector could need emergency aid.
 ""The question is whether it could happen in Spain. The
official funds are not sufficient for also bailing out Spain,""
he said, and the fiscal cost of cleaning up its financial system
would be bigger than government estimates.
 
 NEW SAFETY NET
 Under its bailout, Ireland was given an extra year, until
2015, to get its budget deficit down below the EU limit of 3
percent of gross domestic product, an acknowledgment that
austerity measures will hit growth in the next four years.
 Greece has been given a six-year extension to 2021 on loan
repayments linked to its rescue, said Finance Minister George
Papaconstantinou, at the price of a higher rate of interest.
 The new European Stability Mechanism could make private
bondholders share the cost of restructuring a euro zone
country's debt issued after mid-2013 on a case-by-case basis.
 Germany's Schaeuble, in comments aimed at calming markets,
said it will take about five years from 2013 before a majority
of outstanding euro zone bonds carry clauses to include private
sector liability in future bailouts.
 The lack of detail in an earlier Franco-German deal on a
crisis mechanism, agreed last month, and talk of private
investors having to take losses, or ""haircuts"", on the value of
sovereign bonds, helped drive Ireland over the cliff.
 Debt fears have driven the crisis for the past year, denting
confidence in the 12-year-old euro currency and producing a
showdown between European politicians and financial markets.
 The proposed permanent crisis resolution mechanism, to be
finalised in the coming weeks, is intended to prevent Europe
having to rush like a fireman from one blaze to another.

 * Explains PBOC tightening including rate, bank reserve rises

(Adds PBOC Vice Governor Ma Delun in paragraphs 6-9, 17)
 By Lu Jianxin and Jason Subler
 SHANGHAI, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A set of data published by the
People's Bank of China shows capital inflows jumped in October,
reinforcing the government's rationale for a slew of recent
monetary tightening steps.
 The central bank and Chinese institutions spent 519 billion
yuan ($78 billion) to absorb foreign exchange flowing into China
last month, according to Reuters calculations based on the latest
""Position for Forex Purchases"" data published over the weekend.
 That was about double the totals of 290 billion yuan in
September and 243 billion yuan in August.
 October's ""Position for Forex Purchases"", a key measure
reflecting capital inflows into China, was the third largest
since the PBOC started to publish the data in the late 1990s,
 It was just shy of a record 654 billion yuan hit in January
2008 and 525 billion in April 2008, Reuters calculations showed.
 But deputy PBOC governor Ma Delun played down assumptions
that the data would translate into another surge in China's
official foreign exchange reserves.
 ""We cannot get the figure for foreign exchange reserves by
simply using the foreign exchange purchase position and dividing
it by the exchange rate,"" Ma told a media briefing on Monday,
according to the news portal Netease.
 That is because foreign exchange is bought at different times
at different exchange rates, Ma explained. The PBOC did not
invite foreign media to his briefing.
 Ma said the central bank had already sterilised the yuan
liquidity injected as a result of its foreign exchange purchases
by issuing central bank bills.
 YUAN EFFECT
 China has seen a steady increase of capital inflows in the
past decade as speculators have bet on rising share and property
prices as well as an appreciation of the yuan .
 The yuan rose 0.31 percent against the dollar in October
after gaining 1.74 percent in September, its biggest monthly gain
since its landmark revaluation in July 2005, as pressure mounted
for the currency to climb, particularly from the United States.
 Share prices jumped 14 percent in October, while property
prices remained stable despite a series of official cooling
measures as China's money market was flooded with liquidity.
 The ample liquidity was partly the result of Chinese
institutions dumping cash in anticipation of a fresh leg of
quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, traders said.
 While the market was still in the dark about how much money
was flowing into China around the time of the U.S. central bank's
announcement of a second round of asset purchases, the PBOC
sprang a surprise by raising interest rates on Oct. 19.
 Although the U.S. easing steps do not begin until next month,
traders said the inflows were from institutions anticipating more
liquidity becoming available after QE2 kicks in.
 The PBOC followed through with an official rate rise and on
several occasions raised the amounts banks must put in reserve
with the central bank, locking up about 1 trillion yuan.
 Ma said the tightening steps were aimed at braking
excessively fast money supply growth and rising prices. The moves
were ""conducive to guiding public and market expectations"",
Xinhua quoted him as saying.
 Funding costs in China have jumped since then, with the
PBOC's tightening steps making banks cautious about lending,
leading to a tentative squeeze in the money market.
Last week, the PBOC injected 54 billion yuan into the system
via its open market operations and is expected to do so again
this week as the liquidity situation worsens sharply.
 As such, traders said, a widely expected second rise in
official lending and deposit rates this year may now be unlikely,
and could be delayed until the first quarter of next year.

 * Schaeuble hopes Ireland aid will restore calm to markets
 * Says Portugal on track with consolidation plan

(Adds details, quotes)
 BERLIN, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Germany hopes the 85 billion euro
aid package agreed for Ireland will calm euro zone financial
markets and there is no need to increase the size of the euro
zone's rescue funds, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on
Monday.
 Schaeuble also said Portugal was on track to implement a
tough plan of fiscal austerity that should allow it to avoid a
bailout. 
 ""We are hopeful that a little more calm and a reality will
come back to the markets' valuations,"" told German radio station
Deutschlandfunk.
 Asked if consideration had been given to topping up a 750
billion safety net for the euro zone, Schaeuble said: ""No, there
is no reason for that.""
 He also said Germany had the unanimous support of EU members
in its push for creditors to participate in the cost of future
bailouts after 2013.
 On Sunday, the EU, anxious to prevent market contagion
engulfing Portugal and Spain, approved Ireland's rescue plan and
outlined a permanent system to resolve a debt crisis, in which
investors could gradually share the cost of any future default.
 ""Portugal is currently under pressure and therefore it is
necessary that Portugal implements the measures it has
announced,"" Schaeuble said. 
 ""We have talked to Portugal intensively on all levels and
that will be continued. There is close contact. Portugal has
taken a lot of measures and is on a good path.""
 European officials have been at pains to play down the links
between Ireland and Portugal, widely seen as the next euro zone
""domino"" at risk. Troubles in Portugal could spread quickly to
its larger neighbour Spain because of their close economic ties.
 Portugal and Spain's borrowing costs also rose to near
record highs last week but still remain much lower than those
which have forced Ireland to seek a rescue.
 As part of the permanent crisis-resolution mechanism, which
the 27 EU finance ministers approved in a broad outline, private
bondholders could be made to share the burden of restructuring
of a euro zone country's sovereign debt bought after 2013.
 That was based on a joint proposal by France and Germany and
would be subject to a case-by-case evaluation without any
automaticity. Some of its EU partners, however, have criticised
Germany for bringing the issue up at this point.
 ""We have said there must be a participation of creditors
because over the long-term ... we can't have taxpayers alone
carrying the risk,"" Schaeuble said.
 ""It was important that we reached a unanimous deal -- many
didn't think that was possible and yesterday we did it.""

 By Koh Gui Qing 
 SYDNEY, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Doubts over whether a rescue
deal for debt-soaked Ireland can plug Europe's debt crisis
drove the euro to two-month lows on Monday, though shares in
Europe and Asia managed to move higher.	
 Even though European authorities agreed to lend Ireland 85
billion euros ($115 billion) on Sunday in the hope it would
assure investors that all European nations can repay their
debts, markets were sceptical that the deal would stave off
further contagion. [ID:nLDE6AR0MC]	
 Asian stocks struggled most of the day but drew some
comfort from a firmer start in Europe, where leading European
shares rose 0.8 percent in early trade.	
 The euro fell as low as $1.3183 in Asia as
investors worried European authorities might not have the
means to rescue all fiscally-poor European nations including
Portugal and especially Spain, whose economy is much bigger
than Ireland's.	
 ""There are still lingering worries about the rest of the
countries, including Portugal and Spain,"" said Lorraine Tan,
the director of Asian equity research at Standard & Poor's. 
 ""It does raise risk worries and there are less people
willing to take risk at this stage.""	
 Indeed, many Asian investors said they wanted to wait
and see how U.S. and European markets take to the rescue deal
before making any big moves.
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A late 1.3 percent spurt in Hong Kong's share index
helped to lift the MSCI Asian stock index outside Japan
0.9 percent higher by late afternoon.	
 Japan's Nikkei also rose 0.9 percent to a
five-month high. But traders noted the Tokyo market was
thin, suggesting buyers were prudent nonetheless, especially
with tensions between the two Koreas still bubbling.
[ID:nTOE6AR029]	
 U.S. stock futures were buoyant, with S&P 500 futures
 up 0.9 percent, driven higher in part by a healthy
start to the Christmas shopping season. 
 
 EURO UNDER PRESSURE, FLIGHT TO DOLLARS	
 The euro recouped some losses by late trade in Asia to
stand at $1.3280, but was still some way below a high of
$1.3345 struck after the Irish aid was announced.
[ID:nLDE6AR03X] 
 The U.S. dollar, considered a safer asset because it is
widely traded, initially benefited from the shift from risk.	
 The dollar index hit a two-month high of 80.652
before pulling back in late trade to 80.101. On the yen
, the U.S. currency held near a two-month peak. 
 The reaction in the commodity markets were more mixed. 
 Oil  brushed aside the firmer dollar to rise past
$84 per barrel as some thought the Irish deal bode well for
energy demand. 
 Copper prices, an essential ingredient for industrial
work, were steady while iron ore prices hovered at
6-1/2-month peaks. Iron ore is needed to make steel
and is considered a barometer for the state of economic
activity. 
 Gold, on the other hand, which tends to be in demand when
investors shy away from risk, was a shade firmer at $1,363.19.

 By Charlotte Cooper and Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest in two
months against the dollar on Monday as the market looked past a
rescue package for Ireland to other euro zone economies and a
euro zone crisis resolution mechanism.
 EU finance ministers endorsed an 85 billion-euro ($115
billion) loan package to help Dublin cover bad bank debts and
bridge a huge budget deficit, and approved outlines of a
permanent crisis-resolution system which could make private bond
holders share the burden of restructuring sovereign debt bought
after 2013. [ID:nLDE6AR0MC]
 A key point for investors is whether the EU has done enough
to stem fears from spilling over to other euro zone members such
as Portugal, a problem not resolved after Greece was bailed out
earlier this year.
 ""There was an end of uncertainty at least about the timing
and the size of the (Irish) bailout and people bought the euro,
but it was temporary,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist Japan at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.
 ""The focus is moving on to Spain and Portugal.""
 Many traders think that the European Financial Stability
Facility, a joint EU-IMF fund created in May, may not have
enough funds to support Spain, whose economy is the world's
ninth-largest at nearly twice the size of Portugal, Ireland and
Greece combined. [ID:nLDE6AR09R]
 ""I don't think anything has changed over the weekend... The
problem is that if Spain does need a rescue, they cannot fund it
with the current facility,"" said a trader at a European bank.

 FROM IRELAND TO IBERIA
 The euro fell as far as $1.3182  before bouncing back
to $1.3235. It fell through its 100-day moving average on
Friday, a bearish signal, and the next target is its 200-day
moving average currently at $1.3131. A break of that level could
push the euro back to around $1.27, said the European bank
trader.
 Against the yen, the euro stood at 111.00 yen ,
down from 111.34 yen late on Friday.
 ""There's absolutely no indication that the agreed package
for Ireland is going to soothe those concerns stemming from the
Iberian peninsula,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at
Investec.
 Ireland said the emergency loans would run for an average of
7.5 years, and EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said
the final interest rate would likely be about 6 percent,
slightly lower than what some had feared. [ID:nWEA2085]
 Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, said
the euro could continue to fall until around Christmas but it
was likely to find support around $1.2988, a 76.2 percent
retracement of its rise from August to early November.
 ""The whole thing has a strong sense of deja vu after the
Greek debt crisis in May. People talked about the euro's demise
and so on at that time, too. But the truth is, Europe now has
some sort of safety net in place,"" he said.
 The dollar was up at its highest levels in two months
against a basket of major currencies, at 80.390 <.DXY> after
climbing as high as 80.652.
 The U.S. currency briefly ticked to a two-month high of 84.20 yen , holding firm after a gain on Friday, but quickly
retreated to 84.11 yen.
 It has breached its 100-day moving average at 84.09 yen but
needs a clean break there to push on to the next resistance
level around 84.40 yen, the highs of late September, and
psychological resistance at 85.00.
 The Australian dollar slipped to its lowest since early
October, dropping as far as $0.9600 .
 ""Some investors are cutting long positions in the Aussie,
which has been their core position in recent months, as they see
a yellow light flashing on the Asian growth engine after China's
tightening,"" said the European bank trader.
 China has been taking a raft of tightening steps in recent
weeks, including hiking banks' reserve requirements, to cope
with soaring inflation.
 Investors are keeping a close eye on developments on the
Korean peninsula, where China has called for emergency talks to
resolve the crisis between North and South Korea.

 * Data shows Oct inflows third largest in history
 * Explains PBOC tightening including rate, bank reserve hikes
 * New tightening steps may now be delayed to next year
 By Lu Jianxin and Jason Subler
 SHANGHAI, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A set of data published by the
People's Bank of China, called the ""Position for Forex
Purchases"", showed capital flowing into the country jumped in
October and approached its historical high, reinforcing the
government's rationale for a slew of monetary tightening steps
since October.
 The central bank and Chinese institutions spent 519 billion
yuan ($78 billion) to absorb foreign exchange flowing into China
in October, about double the 290 billion yuan in September and
243 billion yuan in August, according to Reuters calculation
based on the latest data published by the central bank over the
weekend.
 October's ""Position for Forex Purchases"", a key measure
reflecting capital inflows into China, was the third largest
since the PBOC started to publish the data in the late 1990s,
only shy of a record 654 billion yuan hit in January 2008 and 525
billion yuan in April 2008, Reuters calculations showed.
 China has seen a steady increase of capital inflows since the
end of the last century as speculators bet on the country's
rising prices of shares and property as well as the expected
appreciation of the yuan  against the dollar.
 The yuan appreciated 0.31 percent to the dollar in October
after rising 1.74 percent in September, its biggest monthly gain
since its landmark revaluation in July 2005, amid intensified
pressure for the currency to appreciate, particularly from the
United States.
 Share prices jumped 14 percent in October, while property
prices remained stable despite a series of official cooling
measures as China's money market was flooded with liquidity,
partly driven by Chinese institutions dumping of cash in
prospects of a fresh round of U.S. quantitative easing, traders
said.
 While the market was still in the dark about how much money
was flowing into China around the time of the U.S. announcement
of the second leg of quantitative easing, the PBOC surprised the
market by raising official deposit and lending rates on Oct. 19.
 Although the U.S. easing steps do not begin until next month,
traders said the inflows were from institutions anticipating more
liquidity becoming available after QE2 kicks in.
 The PBOC followed through with an official rate rise and on
several occasions raised the amounts banks must put in reserve
with the central bank, locking up about 1 trillion yuan.
 Funding costs in China have jumped since then, with the
accumulative impact of a series of central bank tightening steps
making banks cautious about lending, leading to a tentative
squeeze in the money market.
Last Friday, the barometer of short-term liquidity, the
seven-day government bond repurchase rate , rose 19
basis points, having rocketed 87 basis points in all since the
Oct. 19 interest rate hike.
Last week, the PBOC injected 54 billion yuan into the system
via its open market operations and is expected to do so again
this week as the liquidity situation worsens sharply.
 As such, traders said, a widely expected second rise in
official lending and deposit rates this year may now be unlikely,
and could be delayed until the first quarter of next year.

 * U.S. stock futures up; gold a shade firmer 
 * Currency, bond investors doubt deal can contain crisis 
 
 SYDNEY, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The embattled euro crept off
two-month lows on Monday after European authorities tried to
protect the region's financial stability by agreeing to lend
debt-soaked Ireland 85 billion euros. 
 Market reaction to the deal in early Asian trade was mixed.	
 Currency and bond traders doubted the deal was enough to
prevent fiscally pressured Portugal and Spain from being next
in line to suffer a debt crisis. 
 Stock investors, on the other hand, seemed to have warmed
to the Irish bailout, at least for now. The commodity market
also seemed sanguine about Europe's fiscal tensions. 
 S&P 500 futures  climbed 0.5 percent. The Australian
and New Zealand share markets, the first to
start trade in Asia, suffered only light losses of 0.2 percent
each.	
 Tensions on the Korean peninsula also remained in focus
after North Korea's shelling of a South Korean island last
week. Seoul shares opened up 0.2 percent, but the won
fell 0.3 percent against the dollar.	
 Gold , which tends to be in demand when investors
shy away from risk, was a shade softer at $1,358.56. 
 Crude oil prices  were flat at $83.94 a barrel. 
 But there were clear doubts in the currency market that
Europe's debt problems were over. 
 Already, the euro was giving up some of its gains
in early Asian trade. It was defensive at $1.3278, having shot
as high as $1.3345 in thin trade after the European Union aid
or Ireland was announced. [ID:nLDE6AR03X] 
 It had plumbed a two-month low of $1.3200 in late New York
trade on Friday. 
 Some analysts, predicting the euro was not out of the
woods, said its latest bounce was driven by speculators taking
profits in their bets against the common currency. 
 ""The package is pretty much what most would have
anticipated, so it's not a surprise to anyone,"" said Greg
Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney. 
 ""It doesn't really change the real fear the market has
that this could spread beyond Ireland to Portugal and Spain.""

 The U.S. dollar benefited the most from the euro's
struggle, in part driven by safe-haven demand, and as
investors continued to play the trend of a rebounding U.S.
currency. 
 The dollar index, which measures its performance against a
basket of currencies, was firm at 80.357, within spitting
distance of a two-month high of 80.399 hit in New York on
Friday.

 LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A bailout for Ireland agreed by
European Union finance ministers on Sunday may spark a short-
term relief rally in Irish debt and the euro but will not remove
the risk of the crisis spreading along the euro zone periphery.
 Analysts said the 85 billion euro rescue package for Ireland
and the approval of broad outlines of a permanent crisis-
resolution mechanism were unlikely to reduce pressure on yields
on government debt issued by Portugal and Spain, seen as the
next weakest links after Ireland among the 16-member euro zone.
 ""It hasn't really resolved anything. If anything, it has
just confirmed that the crisis is deepening,"" said Lena
Komileva, head of G7 economics at Tullett Prebon in London.
 ""The EU policy is just catching up with the reality of a
deepening market crisis.""
 The premium investors demand to hold peripheral euro zone
government debt rather than German benchmarks has been close to
euro-lifteime highs in recent days on concern the crisis could
engulf other highly-indebted euro zone states.
 Komileva said the terms of the bailout would reduce Irish
borrowing costs and this should see its spreads over Germany
  narrow.
 ""Markets are going to react fairly positively in the first
instance to the news of the lower cost of borrowing but the risk
over solvency will continue to undermine market sentiment,"" she
said.
 Lloyds TSB economist Kenneth Broux said Irish spreads should
come in, as would those of Portugal and Spain, ""but we are not
going back to the low levels prior to April or March this year.
 Under the crisis resolution mechanism, private bondholders
could be made to share the pain of a restructuring of euro zone
sovereign debt bought after 2013.
 ""The level playing for sovereign credit has undergone a
change this year. Sovereign credit will be trading not just
according to the fact that it is part of the euro.""
 Instead, investors would have to take into account the
different levels of risk attached to each sovereign issuer.
 
 LITMUS TEST
 However, Broux said short-term debt that did not expire
beyond 2013 could prove attractive.
 He said a key question for markets would be whether the
crisis resolution mechanism would affect the European Central
Bank's decision, due on Thursday, on how it will proceed with
its exit from extraordinary stimulus measures. 
 ""That for me is going to be the litmus test for the euro
this week and maybe for financial institution stocks,"" he said.
 A number of euro zone banks have struggled to raise funds in
money markets and have been dependent on ECB funds.
 The euro currency  has also come under pressure
because of the debt crsis. It hit a two-month low against the
dollar on Friday but rose in early Asian trade after the Irish
bailout was announced.
 Chris Huddleston, money market strategist at Investec, said
that the single currency could fall once European markets opened
as the Irish bailout was largely in line with expectations.
 ""I don't think by any means does it ring-fence Portugal or
Soain,"" he added.
 Analysts said, however, that the euro was likely to be more
affected by factors other than the debt crisis as the week wore
on -- among them Friday's release of U.S. employment data.
 They said the euro's weakness against the dollar had also
been driven by buying of the U.S. currency.
 The euro was last at $1.3275 against the dollar, having
risen as high as $1.3345, compared with levels around $1.32 in
late New York trade on Friday.

 * Timing and tone of euro comments criticised
 * Stance addresses political, legal problems at home
 
 By Stephen Brown
 BERLIN, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Angela Merkel did not make many
friends in Europe in the run-up to the Irish bailout, but her
severity and insistence on private investors sharing the risk
were well pitched to address political concerns in Germany.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble's first reaction to the
Irish deal was that it reassures taxpayers Europe has learnt the
lessons of the financial crisis and ""shows the European policy
of the German government led by Angela Merkel is a clever one"".
 Merkel roiled currency and bond markets ahead of the Irish
rescue package by stressing the ""exceptionally serious"" plight
of the euro and the need for investors to face losses in any
future sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.
 Her message itself -- including that dealers in government
bonds should not be ""the only business in the world economy that
involves no risk"" -- does strike a chord with many in Europe.
 But the tone and timing of the utterances by the leader of
the biggest economy in Europe -- which emerged from the global
downturn in much better shape than its peers -- has left many
European policymakers asking whose interests she has at heart.
 Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker told one German
paper this week he was worried that the German leadership was
""slowly losing sight of the European public good"".
 Editorials in papers across the region have wondered aloud
whether Germany's new-found assertiveness, belatedly matching
its economic leadership with geopolitical clout, was positive or
whether Germany would not become the ""executioner"" of the euro.
 ""Are you people still for Europe?"" is a question one German
minister of state, Werner Hoyer at the foreign ministry, says he
is frequently asked in Brussels these days.
 
 PR PROBLEM
 ""We have a communications problem,"" Hoyer told Der Spiegel
magazine, adding that Berlin needed to ""squash any doubts about
its enthusiasm for Europe quickly and decisively"".
 ""At the moment Merkel is being watched in Europe. People
expect a lot from her but are also unsparing in their critique,""
said Silvana Koch-Mehrin, a member of the European parliament
for Merkel's centre-right coalition.
 The Sueddeutsche Zeiting newspaper wrote in an editorial
that Germany's European partners appreciated that its economic
strength was essential for the survival of the euro, but still
had a tendency to resent its increasingly outspoken leadership.
 ""Germany's strength is at the same time a cause for
irritation and for hope,"" it wrote, adding that Merkel about the
need for ""punishment, discipline and severity"" in Europe for a
domestic German audience tired of being the euro's paymaster.
 German public support for solidarity with the likes of
Greece and Ireland is precarious: in an opinion poll for Focus
magazine, 48 percent were in favour and 47 percent against.
 Dramatic warnings from Merkel, such as ""if the euro fails,
then Europe fails"", clearly serve to remind this doubtful public
that Germany has no choice but to guarantee first the Greek,
then the Irish, and who knows what future eurozone bailouts.
 ""The euro is more than paper and coins, it is a currency for
peace,"" said Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on Saturday.
 Gerd Langguth, a political scientist and Merkel biographer,
said that more than worrying about her popularity in Europe, the
chancellor's first concern were potential concerns about euro
zone bailouts raised by Germany's constitutional court.
 It already has a ruling pending on the existing euro zone
rescue mechanism and a negative decision would block any German
participation and plunge the euro zone deeper into crisis.
 ""Merkel is thinking first of the German constitutional court
and secondly of German voters,"" said Langguth.
 He blames Merkel's loss of the state government in North
Rhine-Westphalia this year on the Greek crisis and sees her
tough euro stance on the euro as a political strategy ahead of
half a dozen state elections around Germany in the next year.
 In this challenging political context, Merkel is unlikely to
soften her tone on Europe any time soon.
 ""The more Europe discusses how stable the euro is or not,
the more the euro can be destabilised,"" said Langguth. ""On the
other hand, I think this discussion cannot be prohibited for
Germany, which knows it will end up paying this crisis money.""

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2010 03:16PM ET</span>",Q+A-Euro zone plans permanent crisis-resolution mechanism," By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
agreed on Sunday to create the European Stabilisation Mechanism
(ESM) -- a permanent mechanism for resolving sovereign debt
crises -- from mid-2013.
 Talks on the ESM, which ultimately envisages private
bondholders sharing the cost of a sovereign debt restructuring,
were initially due to take place in mid-December.
 But the discussions were pushed forward by concern that
Portugal and Spain might also be forced by financial markets to
follow Greece and Ireland in seeking financial support.
 Below are some details of the mechanism disclosed by
European Union officials on Sunday:
 
 WHAT IS IT?
 The ESM will be based on the current European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) which provides financing to euro zone
countries cut off from the markets, but under strict conditions.
 
 WHEN WILL IT BE OPERATIONAL?
 The mechanism would become operational only from July 1,
2013. The overall effectiveness of the mechanism would be
evaluated in 2016 by the European Commission and the European
Central Bank.
 
 HOW WILL IT WORK?
 All new bonds issued in the euro zone from July 1, 2013 will
carry collective action clauses (CACs) which allow a specified
majority of bond holders to overrule minority ones when seeking
a debt restructuring deal with the sovereign. 
 Paris said the required majority would be 75-80 percent of
bondholders to reach a deal. The CACs would be modelled on
existing ones in the United States and Great Britain.
 
 HOW WILL IT HANDLE DIFFERENT CRISES?
 The mechanism will differentiate between liquidity and
solvency crises. 
 LIQUIDITY CRUNCH: In a case where a euro zone government is
solvent, but experiencing temporary liquidity problems, the
European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF would
conduct a debt sustainability analysis. On the basis of that
analysis private investors would be encouraged to maintain their
exposure to the debt of the sovereign. The EU would provide
liquidity support to the government in trouble without any
obligation for private sector involvement. 
 SOLVENCY CRISIS: If the liquidity crisis turns into a
solvency crisis, each case would have to be negotiated
separately to reach an agreement with the creditors. There would
be no automatic solutions. The country in trouble would have to
negotiate a comprehensive restructuring plan with private
creditors and the ESM could provide liquidity assistance.
 
 WHAT FORM WILL PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT TAKE?
 This will be decided on a case-by-case basis, in line with
IMF policies. 
 Among the options available, private investors could be
asked for a moratorium on debt repayment, a delay in interest
payments and writedowns on the value of interest or even the
principal owed to them by the government.
 The principles of restructuring and support would be the
same as the International Monetary Fund's and all creditors
would be treated in the same way.
 
 HOW BIG WILL THE SUPPORT FUND BE?
 The size of the ESM in terms of billions of euros has not
been decided yet, but Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders
said the pool of money would have to be bigger than the current
440 billion euros of the EFSF.
 The ESM would function in the same way as the EFSF now -- it
would raise money on the market with euro zone government
guarantees. No taxpayers' money would be paid into it up front.
 
 WHAT WILL THE STATUS OF ESM LOANS BE?
 ESM loans will have preferred creditor status, junior only
to IMF loans.
 
 HOW WILL THE LEGAL GROUNDS BE PREPARED?
 Changes to the EU treaty, necessary to create the ESM, will
be discussed by EU leaders in mid-December.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Germany and France have reached
an agreement on how a future permanent mechanism for resolving
debt crises in the euro zone should work once it is introduced
in 2013, euro zone sources said on Sunday.
 The main points of the deal were expected to be announced
later on Sunday after a meeting of European Union finance
ministers on approving a financial rescue for Ireland to prevent
market contagion spreading to Portugal and Spain.
 Some of the ministers signalled they would also discuss
broader issues to stabilise the single currency, an apparent
reference to the permanent rescue mechanism to replace a
temporary structure that was created in May.
 ""France and Germany have pushed in the last hours for the
Ecofin (finance ministers) to send a clear message on the
participation of the private sector in the permanent mechanism.
A deal has been reached,"" said an EU source familiar with the
talks.
 Economists have said that to stop the euro zone's sovereign
debt crisis from spreading from Ireland, the 16 countries that
use the currency need to spell out the details of the permanent
mechanism for debt crisis resolution.
 Germany and France say the European Financial Stability
Facility, created to support euro zone countries with sovereign
debt problems after Greece sank into crisis, must be replaced by
a permanent structure in 2013.
 Germany and France say the permanent system should involve
private bondholders -- banks, pension funds and other investment
vehicles -- incurring losses if a country defaults or has to
restructure its debts.
 There is concern in financial markets over how big a
writedown bondholders could suffer.
 The EU sources said European Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner Olli Rehn, EU President Herman Van Rompuy and
Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker discussed the issue in
talks on Sunday before the finance ministers' meeting.
 ""They gave the go-ahead to the main line of this permanent
mechanism. It would be 90 percent inspired by the EFSF, with a
strong legal basis to please Germany, a clear role for the IMF
and a participation of the private sector"", one source said.
 A second source said the participation of the private sector
""should be on a case-by-case basis"".
 ""It is unlikely that this proposal will be made public
tonight ... but its main lines will be made public as well as
the question of the private sector's participation,"" one of the
sources said.

 * Relations with Russia and Romania also at stake
 
 By Richard Balmforth
 CHISINAU, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Moldovans voted on Sunday in
their third parliamentary election in just over 18 months,
facing a choice of staying with the pro-Europe course of their
liberal rulers or backing closer ties with Russia.
 Wrestling with three-feet (94 cm)-long ballot papers
reflecting a large field of 20 parties, voters cast their
ballots in an election called to break political stalemate that
has blocked reform in the small ex-Soviet republic.
 The ruling Alliance for European Integration, a four-party
coalition, has sought in the past 15 months to nudge Moldova,
one of the poorest corners of Europe, closer to the European
mainstream after eight years of communist rule.
 But a powerful communist opposition has consistently stymied
the Alliance's efforts to exert full control by blocking efforts
to elect a full-time president who is voted in by parliament.
 This in turn has kept Moldova, a European Union aspirant,
from reforms the EU says are needed to join the bloc. 
 These include ending corruption, bringing institutions such
as the judiciary and the police up to EU standards and
encouraging the growth of an independent mass media.
 Russia and EU member Romania have long vied for influence in
Moldova, a tiny state of 4.1 million people.
 Romania and other EU states largely back the Alliance's
reform path, but Russia may be counting on the emergence of a
left-centrist coalition, including the communists, to end a
gradual slide in relations since the Alliance came to power.
 On the eve of the vote, coalition leaders and communists
traded insults, each side predicting victory for itself.
 ""We democrats took over a pig's trough from you communists
but your chances of returning to power are zero. The people do
not believe your lies,"" acting president Mihai Ghimpu told
leading communist Iurii Munteanu in a television debate.
 Most commentators said the election is too close to call.
 The outcome could be a reaffirmation of the present impasse
between the parties but a surge by the communists that might
lead to a left-centrist government can not be ruled out.
 
 MOSCOW'S HOPES
 Support for the Alliance parties is strongest in the cities,
but a deep nostalgia for Soviet times works to the advantage of
the communists in rural areas.
 Though Moldova relies exclusively on Russia for its gas, it
fell foul of Moscow when Ghimpu, a strong critic of Russia,
fixed a ""Day of Soviet Occupation"" in the political calendar.
 Russia responded with restrictions on imports of Moldovan
food, including wines which are Moldova's main export earner.
 Communist leader Vladimir Voronin, a two-time president,
steered a middle course between Russia and the West when he was
in power and angered Moscow when he rejected Moscow's blueprint
for a settlement in Moldova's Transdniestria region in 2003.
 But commentators believe Moscow would prefer a coalition
between the Communists and possibly the party of Marian Lupu,
the one Alliance member who is closest to Russia.
 A communist victory in an election in April 2009 sparked big
street protests in Chisinau in which young people ransacked the
president's office and parliament building. The communists lost
the Alliance parties in a snap election in July.
 ""The only true chance is to pursue the reforms that have
begun and which are supported by the EU, the United States, the
IMF and the World Bank,"" Prime Minister Vlad Filat told Reuters.
""We can not allow the return of Moldova to the past,"" he said.
 Only four parties -- the Communists and three of the
Alliance parties -- are expected to pass the 4 percent barrier
for representation in parliament, but none seems likely to get
the 50 percent required to form a government.
 In July 2009 though the Communists confirmed their role as
the biggest single party by winning 48 seats, the Alliance
joined forces to take power with a combined 53 seats.
 But this did not hand the Alliance a big enough majority in
the 101-seat assembly for it to secure its choice as president.
 ""I voted for the Communists,"" said Ion Capmoale, a
67-year-old pensioner in Chisinau. ""When they were in power,
life was hard as well, but pensions were regularly raised.""
 Tatiana Untura, 32, said: ""I voted for Vlad Filat. There is
a lot he did not manage to do because you cannot in just one
year correct everything that the Communists destroyed in eight
years. But if today's rulers are given a chance they will sort
things out.""

(Adds Sheikh Ahmed comments, market reaction)
 By Tamara Walid
 DUBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Dubai may sell off stakes in
state-owned companies, top financial officials said on Sunday,
as the Gulf Arab emirate tries to dig itself out of a $100
billion-plus debt pile.
 The emirate, a regional financial and trade hub, suffered a
blow to its reputation a year ago when state-linked conglomerate
Dubai World announced it would ask creditors for a standstill
agreement on almost $25 billion in debt.
 ""Dubai World is now on a sound financial footing,"" Sheikh
Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal
Committee, told reporters.
 ""We are working on opening up the capital of leading
companies to our public,"" Sheikh Ahmed said, adding that the
emirate needs to ""regroup, review and reconsider"" some of its
investments.
 Dubai's market shrugged off the news, with Dubai's benchmark
index closing at a 10-week low with developer Aldar Properties
leading the decline. The cost of insuring Dubai sovereign debt
against default or restructuring was at 453 basis points, well
above pre-crisis levels of around 300 basis points.
 Sheikh Ahmed was joined at the news conference by Dubai's
other top financial officials and, apparently underscoring their
solidarity, by Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid
al-Maktoum. He did not speak, but was tapping on an iPad.
 Later, when asked by reporters whether he was hopeful over
Dubai's restructuring, the Dubai ruler said: ""I am optimistic.""
 Since the crisis, Dubai World has managed to reach a
restructuring deal with creditors, allowing the government to
tap into improved investor confidence to issue a $1.25 billion
bond in September.
 Sales of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and luxury cars
are up again, and tourists are returning, but many construction
plans are on hold and properties are still lying empty.
 Dubai's economy grew 2.3 percent in the first half of this
year, the government's statistics office said earlier this
month. The IMF says Dubai's economy likely contracted 0.9
percent in 2009, although no official figures for the full year
of 2009 have been released.
 ""Dubai's real economy seems to be on the mend,"" said Tristan
Cooper, head analyst for Middle East sovereign at Moody's.
 ""However, the main cloud on the horizon is still the
emirate's large debt overhang. Despite the recent restructuring
of Dubai World's debt, the emirate faces substantial annual debt
maturities.""
 
 CROWN JEWELS
 As Dubai's state-linked companies try to cope with more than
$100 billion in debt, they have been able to reassure investors
and creditors facing debt restructuring by reminding them that
Dubai's tightly-controlled companies could be sold for cash.
 Prized stakeholdings in assets such as DP World, Emirates
Airlines and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) are
attracting keen interest from potential investors.
 At the same time, Dubai has shown a clear reluctance to sell
off its crown jewels, even as some $30 billion worth of loans
and bonds at predominantly state-linked firms are due to mature
in 2011-2012.
 ""Asset sales are not on the cards... we are reluctant to
sell assets at this time,"" said Mohammed Ibrahim al-Shaibani,
deputy chief of Dubai's fiscal committee.
 ""A privatisation plan is a possibility... (it) may be used
as a possibility of raising funds in the future,"" Shaibani said
without naming any specific companies.
 Rami Sidani, Schroders Middle East head of investment, said
that investors had been waiting for more listings after Dubai
World unit DP World was floated in 2007.
 ""Investors would like to see Dubai's successful companies
like Emirates Airlines, Dubai Duty Free, Jumeirah Group in the
market,"" Sidani said.
 State officials also raised the possibility that Dubai could
raise more funds through debt issues.
 Dubai World's flagship property developer Nakheel plans to
issue a sukuk, or Islamic bond, to its trade creditors in the
first quarter of 2011, said a senior official at the Investment
Corporation of Dubai (ICD), which controls some of the state's
assets.
 ""We are making very good progress on the restructuring...
Nakheel's financial and operational restructuring is going
according to plan,"" said ICD executive vice president Faisal
Mikou.
 Under Nakheel's restructuring plan, trade creditors have
been offered 40 percent of what they are owed in cash and the
remaining 60 percent through a sukuk, or Islamic bond.
 Despite improving balance sheets among Dubai's state-linked
companies, significant challenges remain.
 In a reminder that the Gulf Arab emirate's debt troubles are
far from over, financial services firm Dubai Group recently
missed two payments on separate loans.

 ATHENS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The EU and the IMF could extend
the period in which Greece must repay its bailout loans by five
years, to make it easier for it to service its debt, a Greek
newspaper said on Saturday, citing an IMF official.
 ""We have the possibility to extend the repayment period ...
from about six years to around 11,"" the newspaper Realnews
quoted Poul Thomsen, the IMF official in charge of the Greek
bailout, as saying in an interview.
 Greek, EU and IMF officials have repeatedly mooted the
possibility of extending the period in which Greece must repay
its 110 billion euro ($145.9 billion) bailout loans.
[ID:nLDE6AM0WW]
 But the IMF official was more specific on how the repayment
period could be stretched after Greece receives its last
instalment in 2013.
 Most critical are the first two years, when the bulk of the
debt to the EU and IMF falls due. Under current repayment
schedules, Greece's gross borrowing needs will balloon above 70
billion euros a year in 2014-15 from around 55 billion euros a
year in 2011-2013.
 ""(As things stand now) Greece must repay the bulk of its 110
billion euro loans in the first two years after the programme
expires,"" Thomsen told Realnews.
 ""This (the extension) would give markets the signal: 'Don't
worry about the repayment of the 110 billion euros, this is not
going to affect your claims',"" he added.
 Greece in May became the first euro zone member to turn to
its partners and to the IMF for help to avoid bankruptcy,
signing up to a bailout agreement in exchange for draconian
austerity measures.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro should extend losses
against the dollar in the near term after its worst week in
over three months on fears Portugal and Spain will be next to
need bailouts after Ireland.
 Technical charts and option trading also suggest increasing
bearishness on the euro. The euro slid to a two-month low at
$1.32 on Friday and was down 3.5 percent this week, on pace for
its biggest weekly percentage drop since mid-August.
 Concerns over a deepening debt crisis in the euro zone and
escalating tensions in the Korean peninsula could lift the
safe-haven U.S. dollar. The greenback could get an added boost
if a key U.S. jobs report next Friday beats expectations.
 ""The bigger question is will Spain and Portugal remain
immune and I would look and say, 'no',"" said Greg Salvaggio,
vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""The situation in the euro zone will continue to
deteriorate,"" he said, adding the euro could drop ""below $1.30
and perhaps as low as $1.25 by year-end.""
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish and Spanish
government bonds rather than German benchmark Bunds hit new
euro lifetime highs on Friday. Portuguese bonds also
underperformed after a report said the majority of euro zone
states and the European Central Bank were urging Portugal to
apply for a bailout. For details, see [ID:nLDE6AP08Y]
 European officials said reports Portugal was under pressure
to seek a bailout were ""absolutely false"". Spain on Friday
ruled out that it needs help to manage its finances.
[ID:nLDE6AP08Y]
 Nomura currency strategists Jens Nordvig and Charles
St-Arnaud said the outlook on Spain, which accounts for 11.8
percent of euro zone economy, will be a primary driver of the
euro in the coming weeks.
 ""In a scenario where Spanish spreads widen to Portugal's
current levels, we see the risk premium on the euro increasing
from around 10 percent to above 20 percent, and this could see
the euro trade all the way to 1.23 against the U.S. dollar,""
they wrote to clients. ""The big question is whether this is the
central case.""
 BEARISH ON EURO, KOREAN CONFLICT
 On Friday, the euro last traded at $1.3239 , down
0.9 percent on the day, after falling as low as $1.3200 on
trading platform EBS. The euro hit a four-year low of $1.1876
in June in the wake of the Greek debt crisis.
 Bearish momentum in the euro will likely continue after the
currency breached several key support levels this week,
including its August high at $1.3334 and the 61.8 percent
retracement of its August to November rise at $1.3232.
 Next support comes in around the 200-day moving average at
$1.3131, followed by $1.3080, the 50 percent retracement of the
euro's June to November rally.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
London, said a close below the important $1.3250/60 trendline
support could see the euro/dollar slide towards $1.27.
 In the options market, risk reversals have showed
increasingly bearish sentiment on the euro, while analysts at
Credit Suisse noted ""significant buying of bearish euro
structures against the dollar, yen and the Swiss franc.""
 On Friday, one-month euro/dollar risk reversals traded at
-2.3 , with a bias toward euro puts, suggesting
more investors are betting the euro will fall than rise. That
was down from -1.6 on Monday. In mid-October, euro/dollar risk
reversals traded near neutral levels at -0.55.
 Investors will also closely watch developments in the
Korean peninsula, which will likely benefit the dollar as
safe-haven demand rises.
 Analysts said the dollar should also benefit if U.S.
housing and jobs data next week comes in stronger than
expected, which would reinforce expectations the U.S. economy
is outperforming that of Europe.

 NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - World stock markets and the
euro slumped on Friday on concern the European sovereign debt
crisis will spread within the continent.
 Also clouding markets, China warned against military acts
near its coastline before U.S.-South Korean naval exercises,
which North Korea said risked pushing that region toward war.
The North shelled a South Korean island on Tuesday. For
details, see [ID:nL3E6MQ058] [ID:nKOREA].
 Worry about the most deeply indebted European nations has
intensified, fueled on Friday as newspaper reports shifted
attention from Irish debt to Spain and Portugal. The crisis has
lingered amid questions whether indebted countries can meet
bond payments.
 ""Officials now seem to be pressing Portugal to take aid and
that's unsettling investors. Peripheral issues are unlikely to
go away in the short term, and the euro will remain under
pressure into the end of the year,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 The Financial Times Deutschland reported, without
identifying its sources, that a majority of euro zone members
and the European Central Bank were urging Portugal to apply for
a financial bailout. [ID:nLDE6AP08Y].
 European officials denied ""absolutely false"" reports
Portugal was under pressure to seek a bailout and Spain ruled
out needing help to manage its finances despite fears of a
spreading euro debt crisis. [ID:nLDE6AP1BO]
 The Irish Times, meanwhile, said officials at the
International Monetary Fund and in the European Union were
examining how senior bondholders could be compelled to pay some
of the cost of rescuing Ireland's banks. [ID:nLDE6AP0BY].
 Bond rating company Standard & Poor's cut its ratings on

 EURO WEAKENS
 Pressure on the euro has intensified as the debt crisis
threatens to ensnare Spain, Portugal and Italy.
 The euro fell around 1 percent against the dollar to fresh
two-month lows while the dollar got a lift from rising optimism
about the U.S. economy and tensions in the Korean peninsula.
 The euro  fell 0.85 percent to $1.3247, with bids
dropping below $1.3200.
 The dollar rose as high as 84.18 , the strongest
level since late September. It was last at 84.10 yen, up 0.63
percent, rising further from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit at
the beginning of this month.
 Government debt markets also took their cue from
speculation over the euro-zone debt outlook. U.S. Treasury debt
tracked German Bunds higher, with both kinds of securities seen
as safety plays by jittery investors.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to 2.87 percent from
2.91 percent before the U.S. holiday on Thursday.
 Ireland's 10-year bonds  were yielding 9.5
percent, Portuguese counterparts  7.1 percent and
Spanish 10-year debt  5.2 percent. By contrast,
German Bunds  yielded 2.7 percent.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  was
little changed at $83.83 per barrel.

 GORKI, Russia, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine may join a customs

on Kiev's hopes of a free trade pact with the European Union.
 ""This is possible but there are procedures we need to go

 Ukraine is in talks with the European Union on signing an
association agreement which includes a free trade deal, but
Brussels has not promised it EU membership or proposed that it
be given EU-candidate status.
 Joining the Russia-dominated trade bloc may hamper a deal
with the EU because the customs union has a common foreign trade

 Russia pushed through the customs union after losing

 Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan signed a macroeconomic policy

 By Wangui Kanina
 NAIROBI, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Kenya and South Africa signed
agreements on Friday aimed at improving commercial relations
between the two regional economic powerhouses before a planned
visit by President Jacob Zuma next year.
 The deals were sealed during a visit by South African Deputy
President Kgalema Motlanthe to east Africa's biggest economy. He
said his trip was to create a better environment for businessmen
to trade freely between the two countries.
 Kenyan businessmen say South African tariffs and other trade
barriers can make it difficult to invest or sell some exports in
the continent's biggest economy.
 Trade ministers from the two countries signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) on agricultural cooperation and a double
taxation treaty.
 ""The agreement will facilitate investment in particular by
removing the obligations which may exist at present of being
taxed in both jurisdictions,"" Motlanthe told Reuters.
 He said in an interview that the agriculture MOU would
address the opening of South African markets to Kenyan produce.
 Currently, tea exported from Kenya attracts an import tax of
four rand per kilogram and while soda ash attracts a 12 per cent
levy. Kenya, which is the world's biggest exporter of black tea,
wants both to be zero rated.
 Kenya also cannot export livestock and livestock products
due to strict health rules in South African, while there is a
ban on avocados from Kenya due to fruit flies there, Kenyan
Trade Minister Chirau Mwakwere told business delegates.
 He said Kenya had completed all the requirements for both
livestock and avocado exports and was waiting for South African
inspectors to come and check.
 Mwakwere said the balance of trade between the two African
nations was heavily in favour of South Africa and the steps take
on Friday would make the playing field more even.
 ""In 2009, the value of South African imports to Kenya was 70
billion shillings ($869 million) while imports from Kenya to
South Africa were valued at 3.5 billion shillings,"" he said. 
 Motlanthe also held talks with Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki
and Prime Minister Raila Odinga. He left Kenya on Friday.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied on
Friday while the euro slid to a new two-month low as growing
fears about the euro zone's debt crisis prompted investors to
embrace safety and shun risk.
 Mounting speculation that Portugal will need to follow
Ireland in seeking financial aid unsettled nervous investors.
 Investors rattled by Ireland's debt problems have pushed
the borrowing costs of Portugal and Spain, seen as the next
weakest euro zone peripheral states, to record highs.
 European officials denied ""absolutely false"" reports
Portugal was under pressure to seek a bailout and Spain ruled
out on Friday needing help to manage its finances, despite
fears of a spreading euro debt crisis.
 Nevertheless, with so much uncertainty, investors are
hesitant adding euros to their positions.
 The euro fell 0.85 percent to $1.3247, having dropped to as
low as $1.3200 on trading platform EBS, its lowest since late
September, and taking out option barriers at $1.3250 along the
way. Traders cited reports of major Asian sovereign demand
placed into $1.3200.
 The dollar rose as high as 84.18 on trading platform EBS,
the strongest level since late September. It was last at 84.10
yen, up 0.63 percent, rising further from a 15-year low of
80.21 yen hit at the beginning of this month.
 Against the yen, the euro was at 111.27, down 0.3 percent
on the day.
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, said the dollar is being buoyed by European
contagion fears rise and that Irish bond holders face risk.
 ""The escalation of problems in Europe is a crisis of
confidence, which is notably difficult to quantify and project
forward,"" she said in research note. ""The pieces are in place
for markets to settle yet it appears that fears are only
rising.""
 ""Risks for near-term USD trading are high, and though we
continue to expect the USD to weaken in 2011, we would not be
surprised to see further upward pressure on the dollar,"" she
said.
 Pressure on the euro has intensified as the spiraling
debt crisis threatens to ensnare bigger countries such as
Spain and Italy, while a small number of experts -- mostly not
market participants -- have even begun to speculate about the
euro zone's very existence.
 ""Peripheral issues are unlikely to go away in the short
term and the euro will remain under pressure into the end of
the year,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in
Zurich.
 ""Our data shows there are noticeable bond outflows from
Spain and Italy, which suggests investors are becoming more
unsettled,"" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at
Bank of New York Mellon.
 Technical analysts highlighted the break of support at
$1.3232, the 61.8 percent retracement of the euro's August to
November rally, adding the 200-day moving average at $1.3131
was the next key level to watch. The Australian dollar
tumbled after its central bank quashed of an imminent rise in
interest rates and the yen hit a seven-week low against the
dollar, with fresh sabre-rattling by North Korea helping the
U.S. currency.
 The Australian dollar fell sharply as Reserve Bank Governor
Glenn Stevens dampened any prospect of an imminent interest
rate hike, saying rates were just right and the bank might not
move on policy for some time.
 The Aussie was down 1.6 percent to $0.9663. For an analysis

 * France, China both keen to internationalise the yuan 
 * Latest U.S. quantitative easing strengthens France's case
 * Technical, political obstacles to expanded use of SDRs
 
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Weaning the global monetary system
off its reliance on the dollar has eluded policy makers for
decades, but the wind may now be blowing in France's favour as
it seeks to build a consensus for change.
 Finding ways to diversify countries' international reserves
away from the U.S. currency is a key part of French President
Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to sketch out a blueprint for a more
stable monetary system during France's year-long presidency of
the Group of 20 nations, which began this month.
 In the wake of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, France,
which has long argued dollar volatility damages European
economies, is finding common cause with emerging powers such as
China and Brazil.
 ""The time may have finally come because it's not just France
thinking about this: the dollar is becoming destabilising for a
lot of countries,"" said DeAnne Julius, chairman of London's
Chatham House institute of international affairs. ""France has a
good chance of making significant progress.""
 French officials say their agenda hinges on convincing the
Chinese, whom Sarkozy has assiduously courted, to agree to a
greater role for the yuan as a reserve currency. This would
initially be done by having the yuan enter the Special Drawing
Right, an International Monetary Fund accounting tool currently
based on the values of the dollar, euro, yen and sterling.
 China's central bank chief proposed last year that the SDR
be turned into an international currency based on John Maynard
Keynes' 1944 idea of a ""Bancor"". The idea won backing from
Brazil at a G20 summit meeting last month.
 No one expects a ""big bang"" move to a supranational
currency; the shift away from the dollar would take many years,
possibly decades. But France wants to revive the debate on the
role of the SDR as part of a gradual move toward a multipolar
currency system.
 ""There are some concrete things we can do,"" said a senior
French official. ""For example, what timeframe do we set for the
renminbi to enter the SDR? Next year? In 10 years? This is
something we can decide. The Chinese are ready to discuss this.""
 
 ANXIETY IN BEIJING
 The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision this month to conduct
more quantitative easing, effectively printing money to buy
government debt, was strongly criticised as destabilising by
many governments and may well have strengthened France's case.
 In particular, the U.S. decision fanned anxiety in Beijing
-- which has some two-thirds of its $2.65 trillion foreign
reserves in the U.S. currency -- that the dollar is no longer a
stable store of value.
 Wading into the debate on how to improve the global monetary
order, Chinese President Hu Jintao called at a Seoul G20 summit
this month for ""an international reserve currency system with
stable value, rule-based issuance and manageable supply"".
 Amid fears that tensions between Washington and Beijing
might provoke a ""currency war"", in which governments would
battle each other to influence exchange rates to their
advantage, the Seoul summit asked France's presidency to develop
""indicative guidelines"" to measure if countries had excessive
current account surpluses or deficits.
 ""This is more useful politically than economically, because
it helps take the pressure off the currency issue,"" Julius said.
 China, with its attention gripped by domestic inflation, has
allowed its currency to appreciate modestly in the last few
months while angrily rejecting pressure from Washington to
quicken the pace.
 Beijing has already taken steps to internationalise the
yuan, allowing trade to be settled in yuan and permitting this
money to be reinvested in its domestic bond market, as well as
establishing renmimbi swap lines with several central banks.
 It says it aims to build Shanghai into an international
financial centre by 2020, implying the yuan will be fully
convertible by then. But including the yuan in the SDR could
encourage Beijing to accelerate its capital account
liberalisation, as Washington demands.
 ""The smart thing for the IMF to do would be to put the yuan
in the SDR basket today,"" said Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management. ""Then the SDR would also have some
obvious appeal to the private sector: this could quite rapidly
open the door to less dependence on the dollar.""
 The SDR currently accounts for just 4 percent of global
reserves, or $308 billion. The four currencies which make up the
SDR account for only 46 percent of world trade, according to ING
bank. As the world's largest exporter, China wants to be
admitted.
 A five-year review of the SDR basket completed this month
excluded the yuan again because it is not freely usable as a
reserve currency and in trade, but the IMF said the issue would
be kept under review.
 ""I now feel more relaxed that the renminbi can be brought
into the SDR before full capital account convertibility,"" Julius
said, adding that a revision of the SDR over the next year might
decide initially to set the yuan's weight at around 5 percent.
 
 ""EXORBITANT PRIVILEGE""
 France, an architect of the euro, has a tradition of driving
monetary change. In the 1960s, Charles de Gaulle's government
slammed the dollar's ""exorbitant privilege"" as a reserve
currency and pressured Washington to drop the dollar's link to
gold by swapping dollars for tonnes of U.S. bullion.
 In Sarkozy and his charismatic Economy Minister Christine
Lagarde, France has a formidable negotiating team to press for
change. In a visit to Paris this month, Hu agreed to Sarkozy's
request for China to host a conference on monetary reform next
spring.
 ""China supports the reform agenda in principle,"" said Wang
Yong of Beijing University's Centre for International Political
Economy.
 ""But there's no sign China is willing to pay the price to
confront the U.S. on this if it strongly resists reform,"" he
added.
 A source close to French policy said it might be hard to get
Washington, which remains the largest IMF shareholder and has a
veto over key decisions, to let the yuan enter the SDR quickly
as Washington would then lose an important bargaining chip with
China.
 In the longer term, plans to increase the role of the SDR as
a reserve currency face other problems.
 Firstly, the system lacks liquidity and would need a massive
issuance of SDRs, which creditor nations have traditionally
resisted. However, the increased clout of emerging economies at
the IMF, after this year's deal to give them more voting power
in the body, might ease this process, which could be achieved
via regular allocations set by the Fund.
 Secondly, the private sector would need to be allowed to
hold SDRs. This could be achieved by permitting commercial banks
to open SDR accounts, by encouraging commodity producers to
quote prices in SDRs, which would lessen volatility, and by
mandating the IMF to set up a clearing system, Julius said.
 Thirdly, the reform would require the IMF to play a far
greater role as the world's ""central bank"" administering global
reserves. Supporters of change argue this could have the benefit
of encouraging emerging countries to lower their high levels of
reserves, which bring no economic benefit to their populations.
 It is not clear, however, whether events will permit France
to focus consistently enough on the SDR at G20 meetings to lay
the base for significant reform. If an international bailout of
Ireland fails to halt the contagion spreading through the
European debt market, France's G20 agenda could be hijacked.
 ""If the euro zone crisis doesn't calm down, everyone will be
in emergency mode. Questions of global imbalances and monetary
reform will be overtaken by more pressing issues,"" said Deutsche
Bank's senior European economist Gilles Moec.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2010 09:52AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-'Haircut' risk repricing euro debt," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Investors may be forced into a
bigger re-appraisal of risks attached to holding euro zone
government bonds, a process which could weigh on a wider group
of risky assets as the year draws to a close.
 Uncertainty over a new euro zone crisis mechanism and
whether newly issued bonds would include a clause that could
force creditors to take losses is fanning fresh risk aversion.
 The euro hit a fresh two-month low against the dollar while
the cost of insuring debt against a default by peripheral euro
zone countries and banks rose. World stocks are down about two
percent in the past week.
 A key European barometer of investor anxiety, VDAX-NEW
volatility index, leapt 15 percent at one point on Friday to a
seven-week high.
 An Irish Times report that the International Monetary Fund
and the European Union are examining how senior bondholders
could be compelled to pay some of the costs of rescuing
Ireland's banks also put focus on private sector burden sharing.
 ""If you change the basis on which you issue debt, there will
be an impact on debt. It is a signal that the private sector
needs to price risk appropriately,"" said Philip Poole, head of
macro and investment strategy at HSBC Global Asset Management.
 ""There was a perception that the euro zone umbrella
protected creditors. There was mispricing of (peripheral) debt
relative to Bund. And the mispricing led to more fiscal deficit
which led to more problems.""
 Practically, Germany wants private investors to face
""haircuts"" or other debt payment restructure measures. In order
to include them, newly issued euro zone bonds would include
collective action clauses (CACs).
 The CACs would allow for a country to restructure its debt
repayments should it be unable to meet them, either by extending
the maturity of bonds, by reducing interest payments or by a
so-called ""haircut"" -- or writedown.
 ""This proposal, if implemented, could have a potentially
negative impact on financial markets... As CACs would only be
applied to new debt, it would essentially split the bond market
into two and thus reduce liquidity,"" Barclays Capital said in a
note to clients.
 ""It could also make it more difficult for sovereigns such as
Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece to issue new debt.""
 According to JP Morgan, European bond managers increased
their underweights in peripheral bonds over the past two weeks
close to levels seen in June.
 For some bondholders of Irish banks the restructuring
process has already begun.
 Last Monday, a group of creditors holding subordinated debt
of nationalised lender Anglo Irish Bank agreed to take an 80
percent writedown on the value of their holdings.
 In one possible scheme, bank debt would be converted into
equity shares. In the second, investors would be given the
choice of injecting fresh capital into the banks or face a cut
in their investment.
 
 ECB EXIT RISKS
 The other risk for investors is a hawkish stance from some
European Central Bank policymakers. 
 The ECB, increasingly impatient with banks reliant on its
crisis loans, will say next Thursday how much of its support --
mostly ultra-easy loans for banks -- will remain in place beyond
mid-January. 
 A few ECB policymakers are also due to speak in the coming
week.
 Analysts expect the ECB will limit its three-month lending
but doubts have crept in given Ireland debt concerns and
contagion fears.
 BNP Paribas believes normalisation of repo operations is
unlikely to be enough and soon German officials will push for
interest rate hikes.
 Based on the Taylor rule on monetary policy, the bank
calculates that Ireland's boom was fuelled by interest rates 500
basis points below the level most suitable for the country.
 The bust is being intensified by rates 1,100 bps above the
level that is now consistent with the Taylor rule. For Germany,
the economy is in the boom phase of the cycle and credit
conditions are improving yet real rates are negative, it says.
 ""If some view the ECB's current stance as astonishing, they
are likely to fall over when some on the ECB start pushing for
higher rates next year, which they will long before the Fed even
dreams of that,"" the bank said in a note to clients.
 ""We expect to see German officials pushing for a rate hike
next year. It is not our forecast that the ECB will deliver, but
it is a clear risk. That cannot be good news for the peripheral
economies of the eurozone.""
 The ECB's in-house economists will also publish a new set of
growth and inflation forecasts in the coming week.

(Adds quote from Filat, details of poll)
 By Alexander Tanas
 CHISINAU, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Moldova holds its third
parliamentary election in little more than a year and a half on
Sunday, which could decide whether the ex-Soviet republic sticks
to a pro-Europe course or opts for closer ties with Russia.
 Its four million election-weary people will be trying yet
again to break a stalemate that has left it without a full-time
president since mid-2009.
 The election, in a country where former Soviet master Russia
and European Union neighbour Romania vie for influence, will be
a test of how well a four-party ruling coalition has sold a
pro-Europe message since taking power 15 months ago.
 The Alliance for European Integration has sought to move
Moldova, one of Europe's poorest states with an average monthly
salary of $230, closer to mainstream European institutions.
 It is trying to make itself eligible for EU membership one
day by improving crumbling infrastructure and government
services through funding and aid projects from abroad.
 ""The only true chance for Moldova is to continue with the
reforms that have begun and which are supported by its external
partners -- the EU, the United States, the IMF and the World
Bank,"" Prime Minister Vlad Filat told Reuters. ""Our main aim is
not to allow the return of Moldova to the past.""
 While Romania and other EU states hope the coalition will
remain in power, Russia may be counting on the emergence of a
left-centrist coalition, including the communists, to end a
gradual slide in relations since the Alliance came to power.
 Though Moldova relies exclusively on Russia for its gas, it
fell foul of Moscow when acting president Mihai Ghimpu fixed a
""Day of Soviet Occupation"" in the political calendar.
 Russia responded with restrictions on imports of Moldovan
food, including wines which are Moldova's main export earner.
 The unreliability of opinion polls in Moldova makes the
election difficult to call. Last September, surveys showed the
Alliance would coast through a referendum for direct elections
for president -- but the poll collapsed on low voter turnout.
 Many commentators say the election is unlikely to change the
balance of the parties and say neither side will get enough
seats to break the impasse. Polls open at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and
close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Sunday.
 
 PAST VIOLENCE
 Opinion polls show that the popularity of the opposition
communists, the biggest single party, is declining while the
ratings of two coalition parties -- Filat's and that of former
presidential candidate Marian Lupu -- are on the rise.
 When the communists declared victory in a April 2009
election, young people in Chisinau ransacked the president's
office and parliament building. The communists lost to the
coalition in a snap election in July that year.
 While support for the coalition parties is strong in the
cities, a deep nostalgia for Soviet times works to the advantage
of the communists in rural areas.
 The communists, led by former President Vladimir Voronin who
had called for a boycott of the referendum, hailed the outcome
as a sign that public sentiment is moving back in their favour.
Voronin, twice president, drew sneers from the coalition
when he turned down a challenge to a TV debate on the eve of the
vote. ""I did not think he was that much of a coward,"" Filat said
in a statement on Friday.
 The Alliance at present holds 53 seats to the communists' 48
-- and was twice unable to win over enough defectors to get the
required 61 votes in parliament to vote Lupu in as president.
 ""The future parliament will look a lot like today's and so
these elections are not likely to take Moldova out of crisis. In
general the balance between the Communist party and other
parties will remain,"" said analyst Bogdan Tirdea.
 Other commentators said the communists could form a
left-centre coalition with Lupu, who has close ties with Russia,
should he decide to quit the Alliance.

 * Move would push narrowbody production above 80 a month
 * Planemakers aim to meet new demand, head off competition
 * Planning complicates jigsaw for Airbus upgrade decision

(Adds quote, background)
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing have begun
sounding out suppliers on their ability to cope with further
production increases of their most popular jets, taking combined
output well above 80 a month within four to five years.
 Three senior industry sources told Reuters consultations had
started on a historic upswing which could see Airbus producing
as many as 44 A320 single-aisle planes by 2014 or 2015 and its
rival simultaneously rising to as many as 42 737s a month.
 Despite a sluggish U.S. economy and a debt crisis in Europe,
demand for narrowbody jets is increasing as lessors backed by
banks bet on aviation and Asian carriers expand to tap growth.
 ""Going to 42 or 44 is something people are being asked
about. It is a discussion we are having,"" said a top executive
at a supplier to both leading planemakers.
 Another said Airbus and Boeing were exploring whether to
create new production slots for such models, which are sold out
until 2015. The aim is to be ready for a stronger-than-expected
recovery and gain the flexibility to counter new competition.
 However, the increase in demand for existing models
complicates the jigsaw for Airbus as it ponders plans to upgrade
the A320 family with new engines. A decision to go ahead with
the carefully balanced market gamble is expected by end-year.
 Boeing and Airbus suffered a slump in orders in 2008 and
2009 amid the recession. Now, demand is reviving as air traffic
trends recover and funds flow back into the leasing market. 
 Airbus is about to increase output of A320-family jets to 36
and has targeted a record 40 planes a month in 2012.
 ""From this plateau we will study our options, market and
resources permitting,"" Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath said,
adding he would not comment on talks with suppliers.

 NEW CHALLENGERS
 Boeing said in September it would boost 737 production to 38
a month in the second quarter of 2013.
""We regularly review our production rates to gauge what
rates would best serve the needs of our customers, help us
respond to the continued high demand for the Next Generation
737, and also be sustainable by Boeing and non-Boeing
suppliers,"" said Jim Proulx at the U.S. planemaker.
 ""That said, we don't comment on any discussions we might
have with suppliers,"" he added.
 Supplier talks are at an early stage, the sources said, but
they give a glimpse of the weight placed by both builders on the
least publicised but most cash-generating part of their fleets.
 Narrowbody planes, which carry up to 200 passengers about
3,000 miles (5,700 km), are the workhorse of the air industry.
 Demand for such planes is seen as an economic bellwether in
emerging markets where transport expands early to fuel growth.
 Airbus and Boeing have a colossal backlog of some 4,400
narrowbody planes worth a total $350 billion at list prices.
 But new challengers are chipping away at the duopoly as
Canada's Bombardier expands from regional and business jets to
offer airlines its new 110-145-seat CSeries. 
 China last week announced initial orders for its first
viable passenger jet, the 150-seat C919, which it hopes to
deliver in 2016 but which most analysts expect nearer to 2020.
 An upswing would test supply chains as never before but
despite high-profile problems on large planes, Airbus and Boeing
have so far seen few problems on smaller, standardised jets.
 ""The producton chain for single-aisle is well established
and incredibly robust. Whatever they have said they wanted to do
they have just done,"" the head of another leading supplier said.
 A full single-aisle plane takes some 30 days to assemble,
with a lead time of six months for the biggest parts.
 Airbus last year began assembling some A320 aircraft in
Tianjin, China, in a bid to catch up with Boeing in the world's
fastest-growing plane market by serving local airlines. Most
production remains in Toulouse, France, or Hamburg, Germany.
 Airbus's Chinese plant would not likely add output if the
planemaker decided to take another leap forward in production.
 The European group's agreement with a local joint-venture
partner caps production for the Chinese market from the plant at
four planes a month, which it plans to reach in about a year. 
 Each jet currently takes three months to assemble there and
has an extra month's lead time due to the shipping of parts,
factory managers told Reuters on a recent site visit.
 The factory has reached output of three planes a month.
 The Boeing 737 is built in Renton, Washington.

 * Correlations between bond yields and stocks, euro weak
 * Concern about losses on individual instruments
 * But fears of catastrophe to euro system have eased
 * Markets show maximum risk about three years from now
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Listening to some -- primarily
Anglo-Saxon -- commentators, one gets the impression that the
euro zone risks collapsing under the weight of debt in its
weaker economies.
 Analysts are discussing the idea that economic differences
between countries may be too wide for the zone to survive, and
that it may have to break itself up.
 Markets themselves, however, are telling a different story.
Individual financial instruments, such as sovereign bonds and
bank debt in the weakest countries, have been hit hard by
default fears. But movements in most markets show most investors
do not think the euro zone faces the dangerous and expensive
prospect of a break-up.
 Indeed, correlations between markets suggest investors are
not nearly as afraid of a systemic crisis in the zone as they
were back in May and June, when the panic over Greece's debt
problems was as its height.
 Consider the euro itself. Although yields on Portuguese and
Spanish 10-year debt are at record highs near 7 percent and 5
percent, and Ireland is negotiating an international bailout,
the currency has not reacted strongly.
 The 30-day correlation between the euro/dollar exchange rate
and the spread of the 10-year Greek government bond yield over
German Bunds -- the risk premium which investors demand to hold
Greek bonds -- was minus 0.65 in June but is currently minus
0.19.
 Minus 0.65 is a fairly strong negative correlation --
heading towards the limit of minus 1.0 -- and shows investors
sold the euro heavily in June because of fears of a Greek debt
default. By contrast, there is now very little correlation
between the euro and expectations for Greek debt.
 For Ireland, the correlation has moved from minus 0.61 to
minus 0.29.
Also, the euro remains strong historically. At around $1.32
and despite a roughly 7 percent fall over the past three weeks,
it is still close to 13 percent stronger that it was at the
depth of the Greek crisis. It is far above its lifetime average
of $1.188, and above its average for the past 200 days, which is
a key level for currency traders and is now at $1.3131.
 Nor does market positioning imply fears of a currency zone
break-up. The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission
figures actually show a small net long position in the euro.
 These are figures for the week to Nov. 16, and the next set
of data, normally released on Fridays, may show a shift. But the
reaction in the currency options market to the Irish crisis has
been tame.
 According to IFR, implied volatility levels for the euro are
still well below those seen in May and June. Implied one-month
vol hit a high of 18.75 percent in late May and 12-month vol
reached a peak of 15.1 percent. The equivalent figures now are
near 14 percent, a level that suggests some concern but not a
huge amount.
 In the meantime, there has been demand for euro ""puts"" --
options which provide the right to sell the euro at a given
price. This suggests expectations for further euro weakness. But
the 1.65 percent premium currently demanded over ""calls"", the
right to buy, is much cheaper than the 3.0 percent seen in June.
 
 CORPORATE STRENGTH
 It is a similar story on European stock markets, where most
companies are being buoyed by signs of surprisingly robust
German growth and general improvement in the euro zone, as well
as healthy corporate cash balances.
 The EuroStoxx index, a broad gauge of euro zone equities, is
about 9 percent higher than it was in early June despite falls
in the past few weeks.
 Correlations between the index and bond spreads also show
that while they are not insignificant, the euro zone bond crises
are not overwhelming equities. The 30-day correlation with
changes in bond spreads is now minus 0.38 for Greece and minus
0.36 for Ireland. In May, the Greek correlation was minus 0.86.
 While the prices of bonds issued by Irish and some other
banks have tumbled, the euro zone corporate debt market remains
fairly healthy. The iTraxx Europe index for investment grade
euro zone debt is at 111 basis points compared with 141 bps in
June; a lower number implies more risk appetite. The iTraxx
Crossover index of more risky corporate ""junk"" bonds is at 494
bps, down from 633 bps in June.
 There are at least two major reasons for the easing of
markets' fears about the euro zone as a whole since June. One is
that the European Union has set up a formal mechanism to handle
debt crises, the 440 billion euro European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), and the Irish bailout now underway shows the EU
is willing and able to use it.
 Secondly, expectations for debt defaults in a few euro zone
states have grown in recent weeks as Germany has pushed a
proposal to create a mechanism for orderly sovereign debt
restructuring. But debt restructurings could actually reduce the
risk of a systemic euro zone crisis, by helping countries return
to health without a need for them to leave the zone in search of
currency depreciation and lower interest rates.

 THREE YEARS
 The markets see the time of maximum risk for debt defaults
as roughly three years from now, after the three-year terms of
Greece's bailout and the EFSF expire, at which point the EFSF
will be replaced by a crisis mechanism that may be less
protective of bond investors.
 The curves for prices of credit default swaps, used to
insure debt against the possibility of sovereign default, rise
to peak at about two years for Greece and three years for
Portugal and Ireland; Ireland's curve later resumes rising to
hit a fresh high five years out.
 But euro forwards, which are contracts to buy euros at
future times, do not suggest investors see a major rise in risk
for the single currency three years from now.
 The euro has dropped steeply in the forwards market this
month but the move in three-year forwards has been similar to
that for shorter tenors, when taking into account interest rate
expectations.

(Adds details, background on Russian investment barriers)
 By Gleb Bryanski
 BERLIN, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin lashed out on Friday at European Union laws aimed at
liberalising the continent's energy market, saying they hinder
investment and amount to uncivilised ""robbery"".
 Putin, in Germany for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel,
demanded that the EU consult Moscow when drafting such important
legislation which Russian state-controlled gas giant, Gazprom,
says devalues its assets in Europe.
 ""Our companies, together with German partners, legally
acquired distribution assets in Lithuania. Now they are being
thrown out there with reference to the Third Energy Package.
What is this? What is this robbery?"" Putin said.
 ""We often hear from our partners both in Europe and North
America: 'If you want to be members of a global family of
civilised nations, you should behave in a civilised way.' What
is this then? Have our colleagues forgotten the basic
principles?""
 In Lithuania, Gazprom and E.ON Ruhrgas -- two main
shareholders of Lithuanian gas utility Lietuvos Dujos -- have
warned of supply disruptions if Vilnius goes ahead with a plan
to separate gas supply and transport assets in line with EU
regulations.
 The EU agreed in March 2009 to liberalise energy markets by
splitting giant utilities, ensuring that small gas suppliers can
get unhindered access to European infrastructure and compete on
an equal footing with the dominant players.
 The plan included a so-called ""Gazprom Clause"" designed to
prevent companies from outside the bloc from buying up strategic
distribution networks without approval by governments.
 Criticism of the EU legislation has overshadowed Putin's
visit to Germany, where he was set to discuss a deal under which
E.ON would sell a $4.5 billion Gazprom stake to state-owned bank
VEB, whose board is chaired by Putin.
 In response to Putin's criticism of the legislation ahead of
the visit, Merkel on Thursday lambasted Russia's protectionist
trade measures which she said were hurting German exports.
 
 RUSSIAN FIREWOOD?
 During the Putin presidency, Russia imposed limits on
foreign investment in sectors its deemed ""strategic"" and gave
state-controlled companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft priority
in Russia's vast oil and gas sector.
 Gazprom, the world's biggest natural gas company, supplies
about a quarter of Europe's gas needs and Moscow has repeatedly
complained that European countries have blocked investment for
Russian energy companies.
 European leaders have persistently called for ways to reduce
reliance on energy supplies from Russia, the world's biggest
energy producer, though Gazprom forecasts that Russia's share in
supplying the European gas market will rise over coming decades.
 Putin quipped that if Europeans did not want gas or nuclear
energy, they would still have to rely on Russia for firewood to
heat their houses.
 ""I don't understand; how will you heat your houses? You do
not want gas, you do not want to develop nuclear energy. Where
will you get your heat from then? From firewood?"" 
 ""But even for firewood you will need to go to Siberia, you
do not even have wood,"" said Putin.
 Putin mixed his criticism of the energy legislation with a
proposal for what amounts to an alliance with the European
Union, a step he said was essential for the survival of both
Russian and European civilisation.
 Putin said that Russia and the EU could one day even have a
joint currency zone and that Russia was looking at ideas for
increasing the role of the euro in energy trading.
 The European Commission declined to comment directly on
Putin's speech, but energy spokeswoman Marlene Holzner said the
disputed legislation -- known as the Third Energy Package --
would lead to open and integrated markets.
 ""The European Commission...is convinced that the third
energy package will lead to open and integrated markets, which
is good for competition and good for security of supply,""
Holzner said.
 ""Ensuring a good investment climate is one key aspect of the
internal market legislation and of the infrastructure package
that we recently presented.""

 (Adds CEO quotes, background, detail)
 By Camilla Knudsen
 OSLO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Norway's government agreed on
Friday to a big injection of funds into Statkraft so the
state-owned electricity champion can invest some $13.4 billion
in renewable energy projects.
 The government said it planned to give Statkraft 14 billion
Norwegian crowns ($2.3 billion) in new equity that will allow
Europe's largest hydropower producer to invest more than five
times that in new hydro capability, wind power and district
heating projects.
 ""We've used a lot of time to make sure this (equity
expansion) is safe and profitable,"" Trond Giske, Norway's
minister of trade and industry, told a news conference.
 ""This is not spending -- it's an investment and we expect to
make money.""
 He added that he saw Statkraft, which is fully owned by the
Norwegian state, as an engine for promoting clean-energy
alternatives in today's petroleum-based economy.
 The capital expansion, which Statkraft will be able to
leverage through bond issuances or other borrowing, will be
subject to parliamentary approval in December.
 ""What Statkraft is doing by investing in renewable energy
will be a contribution toward solving climate challenges,"" said
Statkraft CEO Christian Rynning-Toennesen.
 He told Reuters that in addition to updating hydropower
infrastructure and embarking on wind projects in Norway,
Statkraft will spread the benefits internationally.
 ""We will go forward with other projects in Sweden, Germany,
England, Turkey and Albania,"" he said, ""and in South America we
have plans in Peru, Chile and possibly Brazil. In Asia we have
plans in India, Nepal, Indonesia.""
 ""This is financing for a focused strategy that includes all
these elements. We will go forward with all this in parallel,""
he added.
 Friday's decision concludes a process dating back to
February 2009, when Statkraft's board of directors requested a
strengthening of its equity.
 In its announcement of the subsidy, the government said
Statkraft has put aside previous ambitions to purchase
additional regional power companies in Norway.
 With more than 100 power plants in Norway, Sweden and
Finland, Statkraft and its subsidiaries deliver electricity and
heating to about 600,000 customers, generating sales of 26
billion Norwegian crowns ($4.24 billion) in 2009.

 * Ferrovial could also remove BAA debt from balance sheet
 * Pension, infra funds and SWFs likely to be contacted

(Adds HSBC declining to comment, Ferrovial shares)
 By Greg Roumeliotis and Quentin Webb
 AMSTERDAM/LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Spanish group Ferrovial
has hired Goldman Sachs and HSBC to sell a 10 percent stake in
BAA, Britain's largest airport operator, and the sale will begin
next week, people familiar with the matter said.
 The infrastructure group owns 55.9 percent of BAA, the
operator of airports including London's Heathrow and Stansted.
It announced the stake sale in October.
 Analysts estimated the stake could fetch up to 200 million
euros ($265 million). 
 By reducing its stake below a majority, Ferrovial will no
longer need to consolidate the subsidiary's debt on its own
balance sheet, which will more than halve its 24.5 billion euro
debt pile.
 BAA, Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs and HSBC declined to comment.
 BAA's current minority owners are Britannia Airport
Partners, managed by Canada's Caisse de depot et placement du
Quebec, which owns 26.5 percent, and Singapore's biggest
sovereign wealth fund, GIC, with 17.6 percent.
 The sale is likely to follow a standard auction format,
lasting a few months and with two rounds of bidding.
 
 BREAK-UP ORDER
 In the coming days Ferrovial's banks will start to contact a
wide range of potential buyers, some of the people said.
 These are likely to include pension and infrastructure funds
from Canada, Australia and Europe, and sovereign wealth funds --
the types of investor that have shown interest in owning airport
stakes.
 For example, Global Infrastructure Partners bought Gatwick
airport from BAA last year. GIP later sold stakes to the Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia), South Korea's National
Pension Service (NPS), and California Public Employees'
Retirement System (Calpers).
 Last year the Competition Commission ordered BAA to sell
Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airport, a decision BAA
is still appealing. The commission asked for fresh feedback last
week and said it could extend the break-up's timetable.
 A pick-up in business flights at Heathrow, London's busiest
airport, has helped stem losses at BAA. Pre-tax losses for the
first nine months of this year shrank by three-quarters to 193
million pounds ($303.3 million), as revenues rose 4.4 percent to
1.54 billion.
 Shares in Ferrovial stood 0.8 percent lower by 1450 GMT at
7.49 euros a share. The stock has shed almost 10 percent this
year -- beating a 20 percent fall in Spain's IBEX 35 index but
lagging the 5.2 percent drop in the Stoxx Europe 600
construction and materials index.

existing euro zone crisis mechanism.

keep it stable. ""We, as Germans, profit from the single European
currency in a way that we have to make clear every single day.
 ""We're not wasting our taxpayer money for someone else in
Europe who is allegedly not fiscally solid, but rather it's in

 * Portuguese govt spokesman denies bailout pressure report
 * Dollar rises broadly, Aussie tumbles on rate view

(Updates prices, details)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a fresh
two-month low against a resurgent dollar on Friday as mounting
speculation that Portugal will need to follow Ireland in seeking
financial aid further unsettled nervous investors.
 The Australian dollar tumbled after its central bank quashed
hopes of an imminent rise in interest rates and the yen hit a
seven-week low against the dollar, with fresh sabre-rattling by
North Korea helping the U.S. currency.
 Investors rattled by Ireland's debt problems have pushed the
borrowing costs of Portugal and Spain, seen as the next weakest
euro zone peripheral states, to record highs.
 European officials denied ""absolutely false"" reports
Portugal was under pressure to seek a bailout and Spain ruled
out on Friday needing help to manage its finances, despite fears
of a spreading euro debt crisis.
 Pressure on the euro has intensified as the spiralling debt
crisis threatens to ensnare bigger countries such as Spain and
Italy, while a small number of experts -- mostly not market
participants -- have even begun to speculate about the euro
zone's very existence.
 ""Peripheral issues are unlikely to go away in the short term
and the euro will remain under pressure into the end of the
year,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in
Zurich.
 The euro fell more than 1 percent on the day to $1.3217,
having dropped to as low as $1.3200, its lowest since late
September, and taking out option barriers at $1.3250 along the
way. Traders cited reports of major Asian sovereign demand
placed into $1.3200.
 ""Our data shows there are noticeable bond outflows from
Spain and Italy, which suggests investors are becoming more
unsettled,"" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at
Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""The case looks set for further euro weakness,"" he said.
 Technical analysts highlighted the break of support at
$1.3232, the 61.8 percent retracement of the euro's August to
November rally, adding the 200-day moving average at $1.3131 was
the next key level to watch.
 The euro also shed 0.7 percent against the yen and 0.8
percent to the Swiss franc as reports that senior bondholders
would share the cost of rescuing Ireland's banks weighed down on
financial markets.
 RISING OPTIMISM AND SAFETY BOOST DOLLAR
 In contrast, the safe-haven status of the dollar got a boost
after North Korea said impending military exercises by South
Korea and the United States were pushing the region towards war,
days after it launched its heaviest bombardment of the South
since the 1950-53 Korean War.
 The dollar rose 0.35 percent to 83.84 yen, having briefly
touched 83.97, a level last seen in early October, and rising
further from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit at the beginning of
this month.
 Rising optimism on the U.S. economy favoured the dollar,
with a fall in jobless claims published on Wednesday fuelling
speculation that next week's monthly non-farm payrolls data
could be strong as well, traders said.

 * Sowing in 2011 may be hit by lack of fertiliser, equipment
 * Govt grain stocks may be insufficient to cover demand
 
 (Adds feed grain import plans)
 By Aleksandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Russia said it would import some
3 million tonnes of feed grain, while an industry lobby warned
the situation in the once major exporter could be exacerbated by
a shortage of fertiliser and equipment to sow spring crops.
 Russia is in talks with Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the European
Union on feed grain imports, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman
told Reuters on Friday.
 A drought this summer, the worst in more than a century,
slashed Russia's grain harvest by 38 percent from last year's
level to just 60.3 million tonnes, forcing the country that had
been the world's third-largest wheat exporter to look abroad to
meet domestic needs.
 Moscow plans to buy around 2 million tonnes of grain in
Ukraine, about 0.5 million tonnes in Kazakhstan and another 0.5
million elsewhere, most likely in the European Union, the
spokesman said, adding that shipments of the grain may start
next year.
 The deficit of feed grain in Russia is around 5 million
tonnes, but the share of fourth-grade wheat in the 2010 grain
crop has risen, and part of it may be used for feed purposes,
the spokesman said.
 
 HAMPERED BY FERTILISER, MACHINERY
 The government, which imposed a ban on grain exports from
Aug. 15, 2010 to July 2011, has been counting on increasing the
area sown with spring grain to compensate for a loss of winter
crop area caused by the drought.
 But such plans could be overly optimistic, Russian Grain
Union lobby group president Arkady Zlochevsky said on Friday.
 ""There may be no increase in the (spring) sowing,""
Zlochevsky told an agricultural conference.
 ""Taking into account that we have less fertiliser than a
year ago and we have stopped buying new machinery ... this will
inevitably affect next year's crop.""
 Andrei Sizov Sr., president and chief executive of SovEcon
agricultural analysts, told Reuters Insider television that next
year's grain crop was likely to come in at 80 million tonnes,
which is below average but probably enough for Russia to be
self-sufficient.
 He forecast that domestic prices would surge in January.
""This will stimulate imports ... from neighbouring countries,
mainly Ukraine and to some extent Kazakhstan,"" he said.
 Given the high prices for feed grain, Russia may need less
of it than previously. Zlochevsky said farmers had started mass
slaughter of domestic animals.
 He estimated that Russia's demand for grain would fall to 70
million tonnes this year from Rosstat's downwardly revised
estimate of 72 million in 2009.
 
 FAST ACTION NEEDED
 Zlochevsky said farmers should have a profit margin of 40
percent to keep the crop volumes unchanged. ""If it is above 40
percent, output rises. If it is below, it falls,"" he said,
adding this year the average profit margin was below 40 percent.
 The south of Russia has a surplus of 14 million tonnes of
grain and Siberia 6 million, while regions along the Volga, in
the centre and the northwest of Russia have a deficit of 18-19
million tonnes after the drought, Zlochevsky said.
 ""We should understand that it is technically impossible to
ship the surplus from the south until the end of the season,"" he
said. ""Physically, 5 or even 6 million tonnes of southern grain
will not be shipped out.""
 He added that outbreaks of highly contagious African Swine
Fever disease in southern Russia posed another obstacle to
shipments. Equipment to disinfect grain there was scarce.
 ""This means that the regions hit by the drought will soon
eat their grain up,"" he said. ""The situation is such that even
the government intervention stocks, despite being huge, may
prove to be insufficient to cover the acute demand.""
 Zlochevsky said that the government should act fast if it
wants to implement its grain plans.
 He proposed setting floating export tariffs on fertilisers
to guarantee the necessary volumes for domestic consumption,
curbing prices of oil and lubricants and changing the
intervention purchases scheme.
 ""The government should guarantee minimum prices based on
production costs like in Europe and in the United States, where
the state guarantees it will buy any quantity of grain at these
minimal prices,"" he said.
 ""This will stimulate investments and (bring in)
technologies.""

 * Detailed work plans to be announced next week
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Ambassadors at the World Trade
Organization, heeding a call from leaders at the G20 and APEC
summits, have agreed to push for an outline deal in the
long-stalled Doha trade round by next summer.
 They face the challenge of translating their upbeat rhetoric
into negotiating reality if the new target is not simply to join
a long list of missed deadlines in the Doha talks.
 Leaders of the G20 rich and emerging economies in Seoul this
month called for a conclusion of the Doha round to bolster
economic recovery and resist protectionism, saying 2011 offered
a narrow window of opportunity for a deal. Leaders of the
Asia-Pacific group APEC issued a similar call a few days later.
 That followed several months in which ambassadors at the WTO
got together in small groups to brainstorm on the issues holding
up a deal in Doha, launched in November 2001 to open up global
commerce and help poor countries prosper through trade.
 ""The intention is to hit the ground running in January,""
said an ambassador from a major rich economy, referring to an
agreement this week by envoys from 23 key developed and
developing powers to push for an outline deal by mid-2011.
 ""People are talking of this by early summer,"" said the
ambassador, who asked not to be named.
 Whether that meant June or July, and a deal signed off by
ambassadors or ministers, is not yet settled.
 ""There is a marked change in atmosphere,"" said Hamid
Mamdouh, the WTO official in charge of services such as banking
and telecoms.
 
 GIVE AND TAKE
 An outline agreement, known in trade jargon as ""modalities"",
by summer would leave the rest of the year for the details to be
filled in, so that an overall deal could be signed at the WTO's
next ministerial conference in December 2011.
 Reaching agreement among 153 countries on fairer and more
up-to-date rules on trading everything from fish and cotton to
cars and banking services was never going to be easy.
 An overall deal is likely to see rich countries opening up
their protected farm sectors and cutting trade-distorting
agricultural subsidies, in return for emerging economies opening
up their markets for industrial goods.
 The United States -- where trade is increasingly seen as a
way of exporting jobs, not importing prosperity -- has said
emerging states like China, India and Brazil are not offering
enough to American businesses to sell a deal in Congress.
 The big emerging powers, on the other hand, say they have
already offered enough in a negotiation which after all is
supposed to help developing countries.
 Despite the current positive talk, trade diplomats concede
there has been no change in positions so far, but they are now
in a better position to start the give and take necessary to
reach a deal after working together in small groups.
 Ambassadors were holding a series of meetings on Friday to
finish briefing those among them who chair the different areas
of the negotiations on the outcome of the small-group meetings.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy will bring envoys from
major powers, the negotiating chairs and countries representing
various developing-country groupings together on Monday to
discuss how to proceed and then present a work plan to all 153
members at a special meeting on Tuesday.
 ""We are going all out and sparing no effort to reach that
target,"" said a senior envoy from a big emerging economy.
 The deal is far from being in the bag. Indeed, in a speech
in New Delhi last week, Lamy raised the possibility of the
negotiations collapsing, hurting the WTO and the global system
of trade rules it manages -- the first time he has publicly
countenanced failure, according to seasoned trade observers.
 Negotiators know that if they miss 2011, agreement would be
almost impossible in 2012 as the United States heads for a
presidential election, so a readiness to deal now is vital.
 ""If we don't, then by default it fails,"" said the rich
economy ambassador.

 * Strong PLN helps govt to improve debt indicator
 * Authorities want to avoid sharp zloty rise in 2011
 
 By Dagmara Leszkowicz
 WARSAW, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Polish authorities are using
state-owned BGK bank to sell euros to help keep the zloty strong
until the end of the year in order to avoid breaching key debt
levels, dealers and economists say.
 Almost one quarter of a total debt load estimated at 762
billion zlotys ($256 billion) in 2010 is kept in foreign
currencies, which makes the final fixing of the year important
as this determines recalculations into zlotys.
 Under Polish law, if public debt breaches 55 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP), the government is required to make
painful spending cuts, a scenario it especially wants to avert
before parliamentary elections due next autumn.
 The zloty weakened significantly on Friday on fears of
contagion from the euro zone's debt crisis, bringing the
prospect of more action by the authorities to stabilise it ever
closer.
 ""2010 will end with public debt very close to the 55 percent
precautionary public debt threshold, potentially forcing
politically disastrous tightening decisions in an election
year,"" said Rafal Benecki, senior economist at ING bank.
 ""Hence the finance ministry will want to keep the zloty
strong, thereby reducing the zloty value of its foreign debt.""
 Public debt stood at 49.8 percent of GDP in 2009, up from
44.8 percent in 2007.
 Dealers said BGK was actively buying zlotys for euros.
 ""I have seen the bank (in the market) more often recently,""
said one Warsaw-based dealer, who asked not to be named.
 
 ""KILLING TWO BIRDS""
 Echoing this, a second dealer said a recent weakening of the
zloty caused by the latest crisis engulfing the euro zone had
provided an opportunity for the government to exchange European
Union funds through the spot market at a good price.
 ""The finance ministry is just killing two birds with one
stone. On the one hand, they have to exchange those funds to get
money for infrastructure projects, on the other hand it's good
timing as the recent euro zone crisis is weighing on the
currency heavily,"" the dealer said.
 ""Of course, if London names enter the market, Polish
players are too small to alter a trend. But BGK's presence on
the spot market has a psychological effect as it raises the
question whether it is there on behalf of the finance ministry.""
 As of the end of October, the finance ministry had a total
of 6.66 billion euros at its disposal, including EU funds
earmarked for road building and other infrastructure projects.
 A firmer zloty would also suit Poland's central bank by
providing more leeway to defer an expected tightening of
monetary policy and thus reduce the risks of snuffing out the
country's nascent economic recovery, economists said.
 As the most liquid currency in emerging Europe, the zloty
-- in a free float since 2000 -- is most vulnerable to moves by
the euro, the region's main reference unit.
 Some central bank and government officials say the zloty's
fair level lies in a range of 3.9-4.0 to the euro and any
external factors pushing the euro down against the dollar pose a
potential threat to the zloty's 'fair levels', dealers say.
 BGK's zloty purchases, branded ""soft intervention"" by
traders, coincides with fresh selling pressure on the Polish
unit because of the ructions in the euro zone linked to
Ireland's debt crisis. The currency fell below the 4.04 level
per euro on Friday.
 
 VERBAL INTERVENTIONS
 Then, Prime Minister Donald Tusk's verbal intervention
helped to pull the zloty back. This week, in similar vein,
comments by central bank governor Marek Belka saying the zloty
had ""great potential"" to appreciate by more than 10 percent
provided support, though he gave no timeframe.
 Dealers last said the government was selling EU funds
through BGK to defend the zloty in May 2010, an operation that
managed to halt a 2 percent slide in the zloty and sparked a
slight rebound.
 In 2011, the Polish authorities want the zloty to remain
steady but not to appreciate too fast for fear of derailing an
economic recovery already potentially put at risk by the euro
zone crisis, economists said.
 The latest Reuters poll sees the zloty at around 3.80 to the
euro over the next 12 months, a view endorsed by Ernest
Pytlarczyk, chief economist at BRE bank in Warsaw.
 ""I think the zloty will appreciate, but in a very gentle,
almost 'flat' trend,"" he said. ""Inflation is likely to rise next
year, so they can't afford the zloty to be too weak.""
 Inflation stood at 2.8 percent in October, above the central
bank's 2.5 percent target, and is seen accelerating in coming
months as Poland's economic recovery gathers pace.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Financial markets were battered
on Friday by worries over peripheral euro zone debt, knocking
European stocks down 1 percent and the euro by the same amount
against the dollar.
 The cost of insuring against a default by peripheral euro
zone countries rose again.
 Wall Street also looked set to open lower following its
Thanksgiving break on Thursday and a large run up of stocks on
Wednesday.
 Two newspaper reports were helping set the tone. The
Financial Times Deutschland reported, without revealing its
sources, that a majority of euro zone members and the European
Central Bank were urging Portugal to apply for a financial
bailout. [ID:nLDE6AP08Y]
 EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, the Portuguese
and German governments denied the report was true.
 The Irish Times, meanwhile, said officials at the
International Monetary Fund and in the European Union were
examining how senior bondholders could be compelled to pay some
of the cost of rescuing Ireland's banks. [ID:nLDE6AP0BY]
 The reports fed into general market disquiet about how the
euro zone debt crisis -- created by questions about whether
indebted countries' can meet bond payments -- will play out.
 ""Officials now seem to be pressing Portugal to take aid and
that's unsettling investors. Peripheral issues are unlikely to
go away in the short-term and the euro will remain under
pressure into the end of the year,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 In the past month, there have been some hefty losses in
euro/dollar and on European bourses as a result of the crisis.
The reaction has not yet, however, matched those seen in May and
June around the time of the Greek crisis.
 This is in large part because of the creation of a bailout
mechanism involving the European Union and International
Monetary Fund.
 The EU is attempting to create a more permanent mechanism,
but the various proposals floated for what it might contain have
created highly volatile markets.
 The irony is that it is occurring just as the world economic
recovery is gaining traction.
 
 EURO SLIDED
 The euro fell around 1 percent against the dollar to fresh
two-month lows  while the dollar was boosted by various
factors, ranging from rising optimism about the U.S. economy to
tensions in the Korean peninsula.
 The euro  was at $1.3223, levels last seen in
September.
 European shares fell, with banks in particular in focus. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 1.4 percent, although it is still up around 67 percent
from its lifetime low in March 2009.
 ""It is amazing how resilient markets have been considering
the financial explosions we have had in Europe and the gunfire
in Korea,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven
Investment Management.
 ""The market is still trying to find where it goes next. A
lot of people may well be saying 'I will take my profits and
square the books'.""
 MSCI's all country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down 1
percent and its emerging market benchmark <.MSCIEF> lost 1.6
percent.
 Ireland's 10 year bonds  were yielding 8.9
percent, Portuguese counterparts  7.2 percent and
Spanish 10-year debt  5.3 percent.
 By contrast, German Bunds  yielded 2.6 percent.

 LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a fresh

 * Outcome difficult to read after September referendum flop
 * Relations with Russia and Romania also at stake
 By Alexander Tanas
 CHISINAU, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Moldova holds its third
parliamentary election in little more than a year and a half on
Sunday, which could decide whether the ex-Soviet republic sticks
to a pro-Europe course or opts for closer ties with Russia.
 Its four million election-weary people will be trying yet
again to break a stalemate that has left it without a full-time
president since mid-2009. 
 The election, in a country where former Soviet master Russia
and European Union neighbour Romania vie for influence, will be
a test of how well a four-party ruling coalition has sold a
pro-Europe message since taking power 15 months ago.
 The Alliance for European Integration has sought to move
Moldova, one of Europe's poorest states with an average monthly
salary of $230, closer to mainstream European institutions.
 It is trying to make itself eligible for EU membership one
day by improving crumbling infrastructure and government
services through funding and aid projects from abroad.
 ""The only true chance for Moldova is to continue with the
reforms that have begun and which are supported by its external
partners - the EU, the United States, the IMF and the World
Bank,"" Prime Minister Vlad Filat told Reuters. ""Our main aim is
not to allow the return of Moldova to the past,"" he said.
 While Romania and other EU states hope the coalition will
remain in power, Russia may be counting on the emergence of a
left-centrist coalition, including the communists, to end a
gradual slide in relations since the Alliance came to power.
 Though Moldova relies exclusively on Russia for its gas, it
fell foul of Moscow when acting president Mihai Ghimpu fixed a
""Day of Soviet Occupation"" in the political calendar.
 Russia responded with restrictions on imports of Moldovan
food, including wines which are Moldova's main export earner.
 
 PAST VIOLENCE
 Opinion polls show that the popularity of the opposition
communists, the biggest single party, is declining while the
ratings of two coalition parties -- Filat's and that of former
presidential candidate Marian Lupu -- are on the rise.
 When the communists declared victory in an election in April
2009, there were violent protests by young people in Chisinau
who ransacked the president's office and parliament. The
communists lost to the coalition in a snap election in July that
year.
 But while support for the coalition parties is strong in the
cities, a deep nostalgia for Soviet times works to the advantage
of the communists in rural areas.
 The unreliablity of opinion polls in Moldova makes Sunday's
election difficult to call.
 Last September, surveys showed the Alliance would easily win
a referendum for direct elections for president -- but the poll
collapsed because of a low voter turnout.
 The communists, led by former President Vladimir Voronin who
had called for a boycott of the referendum, hailed the outcome
as a sign that public sentiment is moving back in their favour.
Many commentators say Sunday's poll is unlikely to change
the balance of the parties and say neither side will get enough
seats to break the impasse.
 The Alliance at present holds 53 seats to the communists' 48
-- and was twice unable to win over enough defectors to get the
required 61 votes in parliament to vote Lupu in as president.
 ""The future parliament will look a lot like today's and so
these elections are not likely to take Moldova out of crisis. In
general the balance between the Communist party and other
parties will remain,"" analyst Bogdan Tirdea told Reuters.
 Other commentators, however, see a strong possibility the
communists could form a left-centre coalition with Lupu should
he decide to quit the Alliance.
 Of all the coalition's key figures, Lupu has the closest
ties with Russia.
 Breaking the stalemate is vital for a small country in dire
need of reform. Its roads are among the worst in Europe, many
people in rural areas have no water or sewage facilities, and
rampant corruption and heavy bureaucracy deter investment.
 Its economy relies heavily on remittances from the estimated
400,000 Moldovans who work abroad, and this income fluctuates
according to the external economic environment.
 The new government will also have to try to negotiate a
settlement in Transdniestria, a strip of separatist-ruled
Moldovan territory on its eastern border with Ukraine which
declared its independence 20 years ago. The problem has defied
international settlement despite efforts by the OSCE, Russia,
the EU and the United States.

(Adds detail)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Turkey is likely to issue Samurai
bonds worth around 150 billion yen ($1.80 billion) as early as
December, the head of the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation said on Friday.
 The amount would match the largest-ever issue with a
guarantee from JBIC, the international arm of state-owned bank
Japan Finance Corp.
 Hiroshi Watanabe, president and chief executive of JBIC, told
reporters that the Turkish plan to print yen-denominated bonds,
its first such issuance in a decade, would help the country
diversify its funding sources.
 ""I was told within this year it must be done,"" Watanabe said.
""The Turkish government is going for a similar size to that
(borrowed by Mexico).""
 Mexico has issued Samurai bonds worth 150 billion yen twice
in the past year.
 A JBIC official later said the amount and the timing of
issuance were not yet finalised.
 The Turkish Treasury said in April it was in talks with JBIC
on re-entering the Samurai market.
 JBIC has offered guarantees on yen-denominated debt issues
from Indonesia, Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines in the wake
of the global financial crisis to help them diversify their
funding sources and currency exposures.
 Turkey issued 19 yen bonds between 1992 and 2000, raising a
total of around $8 billion.
 Turkey has said in the past its foreign currency-denominated
debt as a proportion of total debt is falling, helping reduce its
forex risk.
 But it this month reopened a euro-denominated bond to raise
500 million euros at 4.25 percent, its lowest yield to date,
according to the country's Treasury, amid strong demand.

(Recasts, adds comments)
 By Fiona Ortiz and Martin Roberts
 MADRID, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Spain said it will publish
results of extra health checks on its banks next spring and give
monthly updates on its public debt, offering concessions to
markets focused firmly on fears Europe's debt crisis may spread.
 But despite investor unease continuing to push up its debt
costs, the country would resist pressures to accelerate fiscal
reforms, a source at the prime minister's office said.
 ""Those who are taking short positions against Spain are
going to be mistaken,"" Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero said in an interview with broadcaster RAC1 radio in
which he ""absolutely"" ruled out the need for a Greek- or
Irish-style bailout.
 Analysts say Spain could reassure investors if it speeded up
pension reforms or announced another round of mergers among its
troubled savings banks, but almost all agree further austerity
measures in an economy struggling to stave off a second
recession would do more harm that good.
 The source said Zapatero was convinced that any big new
measures from Spain would only spread panic on the market. ""The
markets can't always win. That's unsustainable,"" he said.
 The risk premium demanded by investors to hold Spanish debt
 compared with German benchmark bonds rose to a
euro-era high of 274 basis points on Friday while the euro
 fell to a fresh two-month low.
 Markets have continued to sell off Spain's sovereign bonds
on concerns it might eventually be fourth in line after Portugal
for a rescue, with worries about the stability of its weaker
banks pulled back into focus by the major role that Ireland's
lenders played in forcing Dublin into a bailout.
 Javier Ariztegui, deputy Bank of Spain governor, on Friday
urged the country's unlisted regional savings banks, hard hit by
a burst property bubble, to push ahead with mergers and said the
results of additional stress tests would be ready by late March.
 In the meantime, the banks needed to continue efforts to
clean up their balance sheets and show greater transparency,
particularly in detailing quarterly results.
 The extra stress tests -- which would be published ahead of
parallel checks due to be conducted in other parts of the EU --
would cover ""complementary information on promotion and
construction, on residential mortgages, detailing collateral and
corresponding loan-to-value ratios,"" he said.
 
 TO ISSUE LESS DEBT
 Economy Minister Elena Salgado said Spain's public finances
were healthier than expected and it would issue less debt than
originally planned by year end but without changing the number
of auctions.
 With a nominal gross domestic product larger than Greece,
Ireland and Portugal combined, Salgado told Reuters this week
she believed speculation against Spain was a bet against the
single currency. See [ID:nLDE6AN1EX]
 The prime ministerial source denied Spanish newspaper
reports other euro zone countries have put coordinated pressure
on Spain to announce more measures though said there were many
different views in the currency area.
 ""There are people who want gestures,"" he said.
 He also said Spain had at times been irritated with comments
from German policymakers that it saw as doing more harm than
good, but denied Germany and Spain differed over how to sustain
the euro.
 On Wednesday, Salgado urged Germany not to push its idea of
involving private sector investors in any future euro zone
rescue plan.
 Analysts and economists have said Spain may announce a
second round of mergers for its privately held savings banks,
many of which collapsed after a 10-year property boom went bust
in 2008.
 But Spanish officials say the savings banks have almost
completed restructuring and that foreign investors will come
into the sector soon.
 ""The government is really choosing between a lot of short
straws, but one which has less direct social impact is to put
more pressure on the savings banks to complete the
restructuring,"" an analyst with the Ortega y Gasset Institute,
Ismael Crespo, said.

 * Reiterates Sanofi bid has ""no chance"" at $69 per share
 * Sanofi shares down 1.4 percent

(Adds further quotes, Sanofi spokesman)
 PARIS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Genzyme, resisting a hostile bid
from Sanofi-Aventis, is open to a deal that links its value to
the success of key drug Campath, the U.S. biotech's chief
executive was quoted as saying.
 But it was not up to Genzyme to suggest that to the French
drugmaker, which has launched a $18.5 billion takeover offer for
Genzyme, Chief Executive Henri Termeer was quoted as saying in
French newspaper Le Figaro.
 ""This is one of the alternatives that could be explored. We
are thinking about it with regard to the Campath molecule. This
could be used by Sanofi or by other companies we talk to,""
Termeer told the newspaper in an interview.
 ""It is a means commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry
when companies cannot manage to agree on a price,"" he said.
 Termeer declined to give details of any talks with other
potential buyers, saying they were ""private conversations"".
Sanofi declined to comment.
 The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Genzyme was
considering a new deal structure that Sanofi has said it would
be open to. It said Genzyme was considering the use of so-called
contingent value rights giving shareholders more value if the
acquired company hit benchmarks.
 Genzyme has defended its peak sales forecast for Campath, an
experimental multiple sclerosis drug, of up to $3.5 billion
after Sanofi-Aventis SA called the estimate was ""unrealistic.""
 Termeer reiterated in Friday's Le Figaro interview that
price was his only reason for fending off Sanofi's takeover
attempt. He said Sanofi had ""no chance"" of success with its
current $69 per share bid.
 The stock closed at $71.81 before Thursday's U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday.
 ""The price of $69 per share is not acceptable for Genzyme's
board. Today we have no starting point, nothing that allows us
to begin discussions,"" Termeer said.
 Termeer added that he met Sanofi Chief Executive Officer
Chris Viehbacher regularly at industry events, where relations
were ""courteous"" and the two did not discuss the ongoing bid.
 By 1025 GMT Sanofi shares were 1.4 percent lower at 47.865
euros, in line with the CAC-40 index but lagging a marginally
easier STOXX European drugs sector index.

bonds worth around 150 billion yen ($1.80 billion) as early as
December, the head of the Japan Bank for International

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Shinichi Saoshiro	
 TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Japan's government wants to keep
its self-imposed cap on new bond sales in the 2011/2012 budget
draft it plans to complete in December as Europe's debt crisis
highlights the woes of heavily indebted nations.	
 The outlook for the budget process is clouded by Prime
Minister Naoto Kan's struggle with a divided parliament and
plunging popularity ratings.	
 Following are some questions and answers on Japan's budget
process and its implications for markets:	
 
 WHEN WILL THE BUDGET BE READY?	
 Likely by the end of December. The Ministry of Finance
usually prepares a draft late in December and sends it to a
cabinet meeting for approval. The government sends budget
bills to parliament in January so they can come into force by
the start of fiscal year on April 1.	
 The preparations could get sidetracked if Kan were to fire
his chief cabinet secretary who faces a non-binding but
embarrassing censure motion by the opposition. Kan is,
however, expected to keep his No. 2, which means that the
opposition could use its control of the upper house of
parliament to delay the budget's implementation.	
 
 CAN THE OPPOSITION STALL THE BUDGET'S IMPLEMENTATION?	
 Yes. The ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) can push
the budget through parliament thanks to its majority in the
more powerful lower house, and a rule that makes it become law
after 30 days even if the upper house votes it down. 
 But in order to implement the budget the government needs
so-called enabling bills, such as one on issuing
deficit-financing bonds, which need to be approved by both
houses of parliament.	
 That gives the opposition leverage to win concessions from
the government or, in an extreme case, force an early election.	
 
 HOW CAN A POSSIBLE DEADLOCK BE RESOLVED?	
 The prime minister may allow for more spending in the
budget in a concession to the opposition. Some analysts say
Kan might be forced to step down or call a snap election for
the lower house to break the deadlock even though no election
is mandated until late 2013. This is, however, considered
unlikely, given that an election would almost certainly cost
the ruling party some of its seats.	
 
 HOW MARKETS MIGHT REACT?	
 A mere delay could unnerve investors and drive up bond
yields temporarily. But none of the possible ways out of a
potential deadlock would please investors either. More
spending would be seen as backtracking on Kan's pledge to
improve fiscal discipline. An early poll could be even more
troubling. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
would have trouble winning a majority on its own, so a snap
vote could lead to much horse-trading to form a new coalition
or possibly even a realignment of party allegiances. 
 
 CAN THE GOVERNMENT KEEP TO ITS SPENDING, BORROWING LIMITS?	
 Maybe. The 2011/12 budget is the first to be compiled
under the government's long-term fiscal plan announced in June
and will be viewed as the first test of the government's
ability to reign in public debt, which is about twice the size
of the $5 trillion economy and the worst in the developed world.	
 The government has vowed to keep new bond issues at the
current fiscal year's level of about 44 trillion yen ($526
billion) and general spending excluding debt-servicing costs
at the current 71 trillion yen.	
 Some market players are sceptical if it can do that as the
government is struggling to cover social welfare costs,
including public pensions, and fund new schemes such as
expanded child support.	
 Others say a recovery in corporate profits should boost
tax revenues and help the government meet the targets.	
 Hidenori Suezawa, chief strategist at Nikko Cordial
Securities, estimates tax revenues will rise 4.4 trillion yen
to 41.8 trillion yen, and that the bond sales target can be
met if the government manages to scrape together non-tax
revenues worth 6.5 trillion yen while sticking to its spending
plans.	
 
 DO MARKETS WORRY ABOUT NEW BOND ISSUANCE?	
 Not at the moment. That's different from last year when
DPJ just came to power and investors doubted its ability to
manage state finances. Now markets are less jittery because of
expectations of higher tax revenues. Investors were also
encouraged by the fact that the government put together this
year's 4.4 trillion yen extra budget without issuing more
bonds. 
 Even if new bond sales moderately exceed the target,
investors say it would not affect much the direct sales of
bonds to institutions via monthly auctions, which is of chief
interest to bond investors.	
 Analysts say such issuance, which excludes the amount
underwritten by the Bank of Japan or sold to retail investors,
could be limited to a few trillion yen partly by raising the
amount of JGBs for the BOJ to underwrite.

 * ECB ""oxygen tank will end one day"" -analyst
 * Austerity plans set to squeeze economy in 2011
 
 By Sergio Goncalves and Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Portugal has denied it's under
pressure to get help now from its eurozone brethren but its
banks could sooner or later become a trigger for a mayday call
if national austerity measures continue to drain liquidity.
 Although its banks are not at the heart of Portugal's woes
as Ireland's are, they are already dependent on a lifeline from
abroad, namely European Central Bank funding, analysts said.
 And now a worsening economic situation is starting to gnaw
into deposits by households and the volume of bad loans is on
the rise at a time when bank funding remains tight.
 ""Banks do not represent a fundamental problem in Portugal,
but if you look at what could be a trigger for Portugal to seek
aid, the banking sector's liquidity is definitely there,"" said
London-based Citi economist Giada Giani.
 Analysts say Portugal has a few months until a major bond
repayment comes due in April to persuade markets it can avoid
becoming the next euro zone member to follow Ireland in seeking
a bailout, but its growth and fiscal outlook make it a daunting
task.
 Portuguese banks have not been exposed to toxic assets in
the global financial crisis and there has been no property
bubble in Portugal, unlike in countries like Ireland or Spain.
 But investor concerns about Portugal's creditworthiness have
squeezed the banks out of the interbank market for loans.
 And on Friday the European Union and International Monetary
Fund were said to be looking at ways to make senior bondholders
share some of the pain of rescuing Ireland's banks, a move which
is unlikely to make the banks' access to the bond market any
easier.
 ""The problem is that banks are highly reliant on ECB loans
as they have been shut off from the wholesale market. They may
just run out of liquidity,"" Giani said.
 And analysts say the ECB cannot be there forever for
Portuguese banks. The ECB has warned about the risk of creating
a long-term dependency on its non-standard liquidity measures
and said it will continue to scale down its support next year
despite the escalation of euro zone debt tensions.
 ""This oxygen tank will end one day. Banks are seeking
liquidity at 1 percent with the ECB, but in the market they'd
have to pay 6, 7 or 8 percent to be able to borrow, which would
put an end to profitability,"" Joao Pereira Leite, head of
investment at Banco Carregosa, said.
 Fitch Ratings this month cut the credit rating of four
leading Portuguese banks -- Millennium bcp, Banco Espirito
Santo, BPI and Banif -- citing their reliance on ECB loans, debt
coming due in 2011 and 2012 and deteriorating domestic
performance and asset quality.
 Borrowing by Portuguese banks from the ECB, which hit a
record of over 49.1 billion euros in August, dropped 20 percent
the following month. But last month it was practically unchanged
at just over 40 billion euros, disappointing analysts.
 Fernando Ulrich, head of BPI, said this week he expected his
and other Portuguese banks' dependence on ECB loans to diminish
towards the end of the year but next year they will have to pay
more for these financing lines than the current 1 percent.
 
 FALLING DEPOSITS
 Meanwhile recent Bank of Portugal data showed that deposits
by private individuals fell in September by 1.45 billion euros
($1.9 billion) to 116.86 billion euros, a second straight
monthly fall and the biggest drop in years. Total deposits still
rose in the month to 212.6 billion euros.
 An exodus of deposits heightened problems in Ireland and
Greece, forcing banks to turn to the ECB for funds.
 ""The dynamics of deposits is of key importance in a debt
crisis. In Greece this was what made the government throw in the
towel and ask for EU aid. So if we see deposits steadily falling
it may be a very bad sign,"" Giani said.
 Andre Rodrigues, an analyst at Caixa BI investment bank,
said the drop in deposits in Portugal showed the economic
difficulties that people are living through, having to withdraw
money from savings to pay their bills and he expects the
situation to worsen next year.
 ""Non-performing loans are also likely to keep rising in the
coming months as a result of new austerity measures in the 2011
budget ... which will translate into a significant deterioration
of macroeconomic data and can have a major impact on bank
earnings,"" he added.
 The 2011 budget includes painful measures such as a 5
percent cut in civil servants' wages, a rise in value-added tax
to 23 percent from 21 percent, as well as cuts in tax benefits.
 The government expects the economy to grow 1.3 percent this
year after last year's 2.6 percent contraction, but consumption
is already fizzling out and many economists anticipate a new
recession in 2011 when the new austerity programme kicks in.
 ""The road ahead is going to be very difficult for Portuguese
banks in the next few years, with margins narrowing, less credit
and bad loans rising, especially with the austerity measures,""
said Leite.
 ""There is already a war for deposits and it will continue as
it's the cheapest source of capital. The scenario is not good
for the Portuguese banking sector,"" he said.

(Adds analyst and cbank quotes, background)
 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank as expected
kept interest rates unchanged at 7.75 percent on Friday, but
there were the first signs in its policy statement of a drift
towards an eventual rise in official borrowing costs.
 Most analysts expect the bank will start raising interest
rates in the first quarter of 2011, and some said the removal
from the statement of a prediction that policy would remain on
hold in coming months pointed to a change in bias.
 ""Inflation risks, defined by monetary conditions, are
currently at an acceptable level,"" the bank said on Friday.
 ""Taking into account the risks for economic growth created
by the weakening in consumer demand and the uncertain
development of the external economic situation ... the Bank of
Russia thinks it possible to maintain a stimulatory monetary
policy to support internal growth factors.""
 In contrast to October, it left out any reference to such
conditions likely prevailing in coming months.
 ""This shows that the central bank may have started looking
at inflation more closely...and...is leaving itself some freedom
for future action,"" ING economist Dmitry Polevoy said. 
 ""It is the first step ... towards preparing the market. Our
forecast remains for the first hike in March, but it cannot be
ruled out that some tightening steps could be taken sooner
rather than later.""
 
 INFLATION IN FOCUS, ECONOMY IMPROVING
 The central bank knocked more than 5 percentage points off
interest rates between April 2009 and June of this year and has
kept them steady at a record low since then as Russia recovers
slowly from the global financial crisis.
 A drought this year and resulting poor harvest, however,
have driven consumer prices higher at a weekly pace of 0.2
percent for most of the past four months. They are now up 7.4
percent since the start of 2010.
 Central bank governor Sergei Ignatyev said this week that
inflation risks are broadly unchanged from a month ago, but full
year inflation could top the government's upper forecast
boundary of 8 percent. [ID:nLDE6AO15Q]
 ING's Polevoy said a traditional year-end spike in
government spending, coupled with the feed-through from a weaker
rouble could cause inflation to accelerate further in December.
 The central bank said it ""would continue to monitor the
influence of various factors on inflationary processes"" -- a
phrase used in September, but absent in the October statement.
 Arguing against monetary tightening, economic growth halved
to 2.7 percent in the third quarter, year-on-year, lagging other
emerging markets. [ID:nLDE6AB1FT] However, performance improved
in October [ID:nMOS007661].
 ""The (statement) may signal that the central bank is
preparing for a soft change in monetary policy, because the
current level of interest rates in Russia is very low at a time
of high inflation, while the situation in the economy is
starting to improve after a slump in the third quarter caused by
the drought,"" said Maxim Oreshkin, economist at Credit Agricole.
 The central bank made no mention of the rouble, which has
stabilised in recent weeks after erasing all of its 2010 gains
during a sharp sell off earlier in the autumn.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a fresh
two-month low against a resurgent dollar on Friday as mounting
speculation that Portugal will need to follow Ireland in seeking
financial aid further unsettled nervous investors.
 The Australian dollar tumbled after the Australian central
bank quashed chances of an imminent rate hike and the yen hit a
seven-week low against the dollar, with fresh sabre-rattling by
North Korea helping the U.S. currency.
 Investors stung by Ireland's debt problems have pushed the
borrowing costs of Portugal and Spain, seen as the next weakest
euro zone peripheral states, to record highs.
 The Financial Times Deutschland reported, without revealing
its sources, that a majority of euro zone members and the
European Central Bank were urging Portugal to apply for a
financial bailout.
 A Portuguese government spokesman denied the report, while
Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said
investors shorting Spain were mistaken.
 ""Officials now seem to be pressing Portugal to take aid and
that's unsettling investors. Peripheral issues are unlikely to
go away in the short-term and the euro will remain under
pressure into the end of the year,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 The euro fell to $1.3242 in early European trade, its lowest
since late September, taking out option barriers at $1.3250
along the way, down 0.8 percent on the day.
 Technical analysts highlighted support at $1.3232, the 61.8
percent retracement of the euro's August to November rally,
followed by the 200-day moving average at $1.3131.
 Further boosting the dollar, North Korea said impending
military exercises by South Korea and the United States were
pushing the region towards war, days after it launched its
heaviest bombardment of the South since the 1950-53 Korean War.

 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 83.83 yen, having briefly
touched 83.95 yen, a level last seen in early October, rising
further from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit at the beginning of
this month.
 
 RISING OPTIMISM
 Rising optimism on the U.S. economy favoured the dollar,
with a fall in U.S. jobless claims published on Wednesday
fuelling speculation that next week's monthly non-farm payroll
data could be strong as well, traders said.
 The dollar posted a bullish signal after it cleared major
resistance at the top of its Ichimoku cloud at 83.61, with
traders reporting option-related offers at 84.00 capping gains.
The next resistance was said to be the 100-day moving average at
84.10, an indicator which has not been breached since June.
 The Australian dollar fell sharply as Reserve Bank Governor
Glenn Stevens dampened any prospect of an imminent interest rate
hike, saying rates were just right and the bank might not move
on policy for some time.
 The Aussie fell 1.2 percent to $0.9686, dropping below its
55-day moving average of $0.9777 and hitting a one-month low of
$0.9670.
 ""There will likely be more position unwinding until early
December. But the Aussie will also enjoy persistent buying. At a
time when both the dollar and euro look fragile, money will flow
to commodity currencies like the Aussie,"" said Tsutomu Soma,
manager of foreign securities at Okasan Securities.

 MOSCOW, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble edged lower
on Friday ahead of a central bank meeting, where rates are
seen being left on hold, but the statement will be scrutinised
for clues on whether slow growth or high inflation is more of
a concern.	
 By 0705 GMT, the rouble had edged down to 35.97 versus the
euro-dollar basket , retreating from Thursday's two
week peak of 35.86.	
 The performance matched oil prices and Asian stocks
, where gains seen earlier this week had run out of
steam by Friday on profit taking, as well as concerns about
the debt crisis in Europe and surging inflation in China. 
 Reports of fresh military action in the Korean peninsula
also weighed on global markets, including the rouble. South
Korea's military said sounds of distant artillery fire were
heard from within North Korea on Friday. [ID:nTOE6AP04Q]	
 ""The basket will go a bit higher because of the
unfavourable external backdrop and the closing of short
positions ahead of the weekend,"" said Andrey Mishko, a dealer
at Nomos Bank.	
 The rouble eased to 31.33 per dollar and
41.65 per euro .	
 Ten of the 11 analysts polled by Reuters expect the
benchmark refinancing rate to be left on hold at a record low
of 7.75 percent. The decision is likely to be announced around
0800-0900 GMT. One saw a 50-50 chance of a hike. [ID:nLDE68Q194]	
 A repeat of last month's mantra that the central bank
""considers it possible to retain accommodative monetary policy
in coming months in order to support internal growth factors""
[ID:nLDE69S0DV] would confirm expectations that the rouble is
unlikely to get a boost from rate hikes any time soon.	
 One positive for the Russian currency, though, was EPFR
data showing revived investor interest in emerging market
funds -- including Russian ones -- in the past week.	
 ""The fact that Emerging Europe funds have started to
attract net new money flows - almost $250 mln over the past 6
weeks - is positive for Russia as Russian exposure accounts
for almost 50 percent of the weighting in these funds,"" Chris
Weafer, analyst at Uralsib, said in a research note.

 TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a fresh two-month
low against a broadly recovering dollar on Friday as a relentless
rise in euro zone countries' bond yields fanned worries over
their debt financing.
 The Australian dollar tumbled after the Australian central
bank quashed chances of an imminent rate hike while the yen hit a
seven-week low against the dollar, with fresh sabre-rattling by
North Korea helping the U.S. currency.
 ""We've been hearing one piece of bad news after another from
the euro zone lately. There's even talk of a breakup of the euro
zone,"" said Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign securities at Okasan

 A majority of euro zone nations and the European Central Bank
are urging Portugal to apply for a financial bailout from a
European rescue fund, Financial Times Deutschland reported on
Friday.
 ""I think Portugal has already crossed the point of no return.
Its bond yield has gone beyond a sustainable level. The market is
now watching whether Spain will need a rescue,"" said a Japanese
bank trader.
 The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3280, having fallen as low as
$1.3265, its lowest level since late September.
 Traders believe the euro will have more opportunities to test
the downside, with a break below the latest trough seen putting
the single currency's trendline support at $1.3230 as the next
target, followed by its 200-day moving average around $1.3135.
 A break below the 200-day moving average could be seen as
more evidence of medium-term weakness after its move below major
support, including a 38.2 percent retracement of its rally from
June to early November.
 The euro's rally earlier this year was helped by the fact
that the European Central Bank was seeking an exit strategy from
its loose policy, in contrast with the Federal Reserve and the
Bank of Japan, which have taken more easing steps in recent
months.
 But some market players said that may change soon.
 ""Because of the debt woes, euro zone countries will now have
to tighten their fiscal policies, which will dent growth and put
pressure on the ECB to give up its search for an exit sooner or
later,"" said Daisuke Karakama, a market economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank.
 ""The ECB may say it will extend its offer of unlimited
liquidity as early as its next policy meeting (next Thursday),""
Karakama said. The ECB extended the measure to early 2011 in
September.
 Further boosting the dollar, North Korea said impending
military exercises by South Korea and the United States were
pushing the region towards war, days after it launched its
heaviest bombardment of the South since the 1950-53 Korean War.
 The Korean won fell more than 1.5 percent and Korean shares
slipped 1.3 percent, losing much of the ground they had recovered
in the past two days.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 83.90 yen, having briefly
touched 83.95 yen, a level last seen in early October, rising
further from a 15-year low of 80.21 yen hit at the beginning of
this month.
 Rising optimism on the U.S. economy was favouring the dollar,
with a fall in U.S. jobless claims published on Wednesday
fuelling speculation that next week's payroll data could be
strong as well, traders said.
 The dollar has also risen well above major resistance at the
top end of its ichimoku cloud, which is considered a major
bullish sign.
 Many traders said the dollar could rise to 85 yen and some
even see a test of 85.94 yen, hit right after Japan's unilateral
yen-selling intervention in September.
 But selling by Japanese exporters is likely to keep the
dollar's advance in check. Japanese capital flows data showed
foreign investors have been scooping up Japanese shares in the
past three weeks.
 The Australian dollar fell sharply as Reserve Bank of
Australia Governor Glenn Stevens dampened any remaining prospect
of an imminent interest rate hike, saying rates were just right
and the bank might not move on policy for some time.
 The Aussie fell 1.2 percent to $0.9691, dropping below its
55-day moving average of $0.9777 and hitting a one-month low of
$0.9676.
 A critical support point is around $0.9650, a low hit in late
October, said Okasan Securities' Soma.
 ""There will likely be more position unwinding until early
December. But the Aussie will also enjoy persistent buying. At a
time when both the dollar and euro look fragile, money will flow
to commodity currencies like the Aussie,"" Soma said.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, rose to a two-month
high of 80.157, finally breaking above resistance at 80.05.

 TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a two-month

their debt financing.
 The Australian dollar tumbled after the Australian central

the single currency's trendline support at $1.3230 as the next
target, followed by its 200-day moving average around $1.3135.

(Adds detail)
 TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Japan's biggest shipping company
Nippon Yusen KK said on Friday it will take a 50 percent stake
in the world's second-biggest shuttle tanker operator, in a bid
to tap the deep-sea oil drilling market.
 Nippon Yusen gave no value for the planned purchase of new
shares in Norway's Knutsen Offshore Tankers, but the Nikkei
business daily said the investment would worth about 20 billion
yen ($239 million).
 Despite safety concerns after BP's Deepwater Horizon
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico which led to the worst oil spill
in U.S. history, developing deep-sea oil wells is a growth
business area, reflecting demand for oil from emerging
economies.
 The operator of shuttle tankers, which transport oil to
shore from deep-water fields, has 24 out of the total of 82
operating or under construction and will be known as Knutsen NYK
Offshore Tankers after the transaction, Nippon Yusen said in a
statement.
 Nippon Yusen, Japan's biggest shipping firm by sales, fell
into the red for the first time in two decades in the financial
year that ended in March, but it now expects to make a 76
billion yen net profit this business year on improving shipping
margins.
 TS Shipping Invest will hold the remaining 50 percent stake
in Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers.
 Shares of Nippon Yusen were down 0.8 percent at 354 yen,
while the Nikkei average was flat.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month
low on Friday, with Europe's fiscal problems looking more
likely to spread than be solved in the near term, while the
looming year-end kept many equity investors eager to take
profits, weighing on Asian stock markets.	
 Major European stock markets fell, with the FTSEurofirst
300 opening down 0.5 percent in early trade and
London's FTSE 100 down 0.7 percent . U.S. stock index
futures  were down 0.4 percent.	
 Caution ruled in financial markets, with thinning volumes
and pockets of risk, especially North Korea's sabre rattling
ahead of the South's military exercises with the United States
this weekend, driving more stock investors to take profits on
the year's winning sectors in Asia. [ID:nL3E6MQ058]	
 The Australian dollar slid after the head of the country's
central bank said interest rates were about right for the near
term, extinguishing speculation the currency's yield advantage
would get a policy boost in the next few months.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
1.4 percent , weighed down the most by a 2
percent decline in the consumer discretionary sector. 
 Powered by the view that the hunger of Asia's consumers
for big-ticket items such as cars and appliances will keep
growing, this sector is up 27 percent so far this year
, making it still by far the best performer.	
 The benchmark KOSPI index in South Korea fell 1.3 percent
ahead of a tense weekend, with the North threatening
war over joint U.S.-Korean military exercises. [ID:nL3E6MQ058]	
 Japan's Nikkei share average slipped 0.4 percent
on the day, with strength in larger exporter shares offset by
weakness in retailers and industrial stocks.	
 
 OUTPERFORMING JAPAN	
 The Nikkei's 9.1 percent rise in November, driven in part
by a weakening of the yen, is on course to be the biggest
monthly gain since March. 
 ""Recent purchases done by foreign investors are not simply
short covering but I think fresh funds are being poured into
Japanese shares. More follow-through buying could drive up
shares prices further,"" Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.	
 Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar's 4.5 percent rise
against the yen is also the steepest single-month advance
since March.	
 Japanese government bonds, in turn, sold off, with 10-year
futures down 2.6 points in November, the biggest monthly
decline since April 2008.	
 The December contract was down 0.5 point <2JGBv1> at its
lowest since June 23, ahead of new supply of 10-year debt next
week. The flows across the yield curve have been erratic, and
dealers are keeping watch of cash yields of mid-maturity bonds
to see if they follow the 10-years higher, which would trigger
more bullish bets to be folded.	
 The U.S. dollar nudged up, though mainly because of
weakness in other currencies.	
 
 UNDERPERFORMING EURO	
 The euro was down 0.7 percent at $1.3262 , as
traders grew tired of waiting for a possible squeeze of bets
against the currency and sold it ahead of the weekend.	
 ""We've been hearing one piece of bad news after another
from the euro zone lately. There's even talk of a breakup of
the euro zone,"" said Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign
securities at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. 
 Many traders were keeping a close watch of Portugal, which
could be next in the firing line among the euro zone's
fiscally vulnerable countries. A majority of euro zone nations
and the European Central Bank are urging Portugal to apply for
a financial bailout from a European rescue fund, Financial
Times Deutschland reported on Friday, without naming its
sources. [ID:nLDE6AP01C]	
 The Australian dollar was down 1.2 percent to US$0.9683
after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens
said policy was appropriate for now, suggesting the central
bank was in no hurry to tighten rates. 
 He later said it was not unreasonable for investors to
price in a rate hike in the middle of 2011, a comfort to
longer-term investors in the Australian dollar but no solace
for short-term bulls who had hoped for a near-term push to
parity. [ID:nSGE6AO0FL] [ID:nSGE6AP00D]

 TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The euro dangled near a two-month
low against the dollar on Friday on worries over euro zone
countries' debt financing, while the Australian dollar tumbled
after the central bank quashed chances of an imminent rate hike.
 A relentless rise in euro countries' bond yields kept
currency traders focused on euro zone malaise, and many traders
say the euro's technical outlook is bleak.
 ""We've been hearing one piece of bad news after another from

 Resistance is expected at around $1.3365-70, its 90-day
moving average as well as the bottom of the cloud in its daily
ichimoku chart.
 On the other hand a break below the latest low could put the
pair's trendline support at $1.3230 as the next target, followed
by its 200-day moving average at around $1.3135.
 A break below the 200-day moving average could be seen as
more evidence of its medium-term weakness after its break below

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank chief
signalled on Friday that interest rates will remain steady for
the next few months, leading markets to push out the timing of
any tightening to mid-2011 and knocking the Australian dollar
lower. 
 Still, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Glenn
Stevens warned inflation risks over the medium term were on
the high side, suggesting it was not done tightening policy. 
 The central bank lifted its official cash rate by 25 basis
points to 4.75 percent earlier this month , and noted
many commercial lenders had raised their loan rates by even
more, leaving the overall policy setting ""a little tighter
than average"". 
 ""For the period in which we're going to in the near term,
I think this is about the right level,"" Stevens told a
parliamentary committee. 
 ""At the moment most commentators and market pricing does
not anticipate any further near-term tightening by us for
quite some time. And I think that's probably a reasonable
position for them to have, based on the information we have
now.""	
 
 Interbank futures <0#YIB:> out to May rallied as the
market pushed out the chances of a rate hike, while the
Australian dollar shed about half a cent to $0.9743 ,
further away from its 28-year high of around $1.0182 set early
this month.	
 Stevens said it was reasonable not to expect a rate hike
imminently. 
 Markets are giving virtually no chance of a rate rise at
the next policy meeting on Dec. 7, and assume just 32 basis
points worth of tightening over the next 12 months
< CSRBA1Y=CSAU>. 
 ""We think they won't move till quarter one next year at
the earliest,"" said John Peters, senior economist at
Commonwealth Bank.	
 
 INFLATION 
 Stevens reiterated the central bank expected economic
growth to be a little over 3 percent in 2010 and then to
accelerate to 3.5 percent in 2011 and 2012.	
 Inflation was likely to stay within the central bank's 2-3
percent target range over the coming year, he said, but little
spare capacity in the economy and a likely record surge in
resource investment meant pressure was building.	
 ""It is pretty clear that the medium-term risks on
inflation lie in the direction of it being too high, rather
than too low,"" Stevens said.	
 Stevens said he was also seeing signs that the private
sector was picking up the economic slack as the effects of
government stimulus faded.	
 ""We may need some more (restraint) than we have at the
moment at some point,"" he said. ""But at this stage the
expectations are for only fairly gradual, and not very close
together, increases.""	
 Voracious Asian demand for Australia's resources has led
to huge price increases for iron ore and coal, causing a
once-in-a-lifetime surge in the country's terms of trade, or
the ratio of export to import prices.	
 In an effort to head off inflationary pressure, the RBA
has lifted rates seven times in the past year by a total of
175 basis points.	
 Stevens, however, said key commodity prices were likely to
ease off over the next few years.

again, saying the overall policy setting was appropriate for
the ""period ahead"".
 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised its official
cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent early this month,
with many commercial lenders raising their loan rates by even
more.
 ""These moves have left the overall setting of monetary
policy a little tighter than average, as judged by interest
rate criteria,"" Governor Glenn Stevens told a parliamentary
committee.
 ""Overall, and also taking account of the exchange rate,
which has risen substantially this year, we judge this to be
the appropriate setting for the period ahead,"" he added.
 But Stevens said it was pretty clear the medium-term risks
on inflation lay in the direction of it being too high rather

 BERLIN, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel accused each other of
hindering trade and investment on Thursday ahead of talks which
may result in the biggest German divestment from Russia to date.
 In an article published in Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung
newspaper Putin warned that European legislation aimed at
liberalising energy markets could hurt investment and eventually
lead to energy shortages in Europe. 
 The European Union agreed in March 2009 to liberalise energy
markets by splitting giant utilities, ensuring that small gas
suppliers can get unhindered access to European infrastructure
and compete on an equal footing with the dominant players. 
 The plan included a so-called ""Gazprom Clause"" designed to
prevent companies from outside the bloc -- such as Russia's
state-controlled gas giant Gazprom -- from buying up strategic
distribution networks without approval by governments.
 ""It creates serious risks in the European energy sector and
undermines investors' plans to put their money into new
projects,"" Putin said in the article, warning that the plan will
result in higher prices for energy. 
 Merkel responded by lambasting Russia's protectionist trade
measures which are hurting German exports and said that Putin's
policies contradicted his stated aim to create a free trade zone
stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok. 
 ""The steps that Russia has taken recently do not exactly
point in that direction,"" Merkel told reporters. ""I hear time
and again from Russia that import duties are being repeatedly
raised without warning."" 
 
 E.ON SALE
 Merkel also criticised Putin's pet project of a Customs
Union between ex-Soviet neighbours Russia, Belarus and
Kazakhstan, saying the union made a trade agreement with the EU
more difficult. 
 Putin wants to revive Russian industry through a policy that
will force foreign firms to invest in production. His government
raised or plans to raise a number of import duties on goods
ranging from cars to some handheld communication devices. 
 Russia also wants to diversify trade away from Europe, which
it sees as a stagnating market, to Asia through building new
pipelines and promoting corporate deals. China is on track to
overtake Germany in terms of Russian trade volumes. 
 Putin and Merkel will also discuss a deal under which
Germany's E.ON would sell a $4.5 billion stake in gas giant
Gazprom to state-owned Russian bank VEB, chaired by Putin. 
 E.ON, the world's largest utility, is currently the biggest
German investor in Russia but the company is struggling to cope
with high debts and falling revenues and has announced plans to
divest from non-strategic assets.
 The Russian government has put on a brave face over the
potential sale, saying it is bullish on Gazprom.
 However, the government's willingness to pay a premium over
the market price reflects concerns over Gazprom's falling share
price as more European clients turn to cheaper gas from other
sources. 
 The government may also use the 3.5 percent stake in Gazprom
currently owned by E.ON for asset swaps, which have emerged as a
new strategy for Russia to get a foothold in foreign energy
markets.

 * Sees no particular strains, only general jitters
 * Says debt servicing costs ""in line"" with govt forecasts
 
 (Adds details, background)
 ROME, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The Irish crisis is not putting
particular strains on Italy's debt, the head of the Italian
Treasury's debt department said on Thursday, following the
latest auction of short-term bills.
 ""The auctions today went very well,"" Maria Cannata told
reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
 Earlier Italy successfully auctioned 10.5 billion euros of
6-month BOT bills and zero-coupon CTZ bonds. Gross yields rose
in both cases, but the bid-to cover ratio was similar to that of
last month' auctions, an indication that investors' appetite for
Italian paper has not faded. [ID:nLDE6AN24W]
 ""There are no particular tensions on Italian debt, there is
only generalised nervousness,"" she said.
 Cannata said the costs of servicing Italy's debt, one of the
highest in the world, were ""perfectly in line"" with forecasts,
adding that the government's estimates already included higher
interest rates seen in recent days. 
 She said Italy will issue 240 billion euros ($320.9 billion)
worth of medium to long-term bonds next year, about 20 billion
euros less than this year. Total debt issuance will reach 480
billion euros.
 Her comments echoed a sanguine assessment of Italy's debt
prospects by ratings agency Moody's, which said Italy's credit
outlook was stable and there was no reason at present to believe
it could be hit by contagion from the market turmoil that has
affected Greece and Ireland [nLDE6AO1K2].
 Cannata said the Treasury accounts should close 2010 with a
surplus of 30 billion euros, similar to last year. She said
there would be no further buy-back operations until the end of
the year and added that conditions were not in place for a
50-year benchmark bond.

* Paper says proposal to double rescue fund
* Germany says rescue funding adequate

(Adds quotes, background and details)
 By Stephen Brown
 BERLIN, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The European Commission and
German government denied on Thursday a news report that Brussels
was considering doubling the size of a rescue fund to support
the euro, with Berlin saying the fund was adequately financed.
 An unsourced report in German daily Die Welt said that the
European Union's executive body had proposed doubling the size
of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 ""This is absolutely false,"" said a European Commission
spokesman.
 Established after the bailout of Greece in May to defend the
euro from further crises, the EFSF is designed to help a euro
zone country by issuing bonds backed by up to 440 billion euros
($585.9 billion) worth of guarantees from euro zone governments.
 ""We think the question does not arise because only one
country so far has applied for assistance from the EFSF and it
is not an amount that makes us worry that there would not be
capacity,"" said a German finance ministry spokesman.
 German Bundesbank chief Axel Weber, a powerful member of the
European Central Bank's governing council, said in Paris one day
earlier the EFSF and other EU rescue funds had enough money, if
needed, to cover the borrowing needs of stretched euro zone
members Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. 
 Together with separate EU and International Monetary Fund
backing, the funds totalling 750 billion euros ""should be more
than enough to see off an attack on the euro zone"", he said.
 Currency and credit markets have been unnerved by German
proposals to force bond holders to share the cost of any future
default by highly indebted euro zone countries, as well as by
the alarmist tone of recent comments by Chancellor Angela Merkel
and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy.
 Die Welt said unnamed experts were concerned that Spain
could need a financial bailout in future, and that the existing
fund might therefore not be big enough to cover this.
 Ireland is so far the only country to apply to the EFSF for
help coping with the impact of a banking crisis on its public
finances. Just before the creation of the EFSF, Greece received
a three-year, 110 billion-euro bailout from the EU and IMF.

 * Says euro governments will not let euro fail
 
 (Adds quotes, background)
 By Paul Carrel and Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The size of rescue fund to
support the euro currency is sufficient and euro zone members
will not let the euro fail, European Central Bank Governing
Council member Axel Weber said on Thursday.
 ""The governments of the euro zone have made completely clear
they are aware of their responsibility for the euro and they
will do everything to keep the currency alive in its current
form,"" Weber said during a podium discussion in Berlin.
 ""But that won't be necessary because already so much public
money has been made available to solve the current crisis that I
don't believe that what's on the table now is not enough.""
 He also said the safety net -- currently adding up to
roughly 925 billion euros -- could fall short only in the worst
case scenario if all of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain had
to be bailed out for all their outstanding sovereign debt.
 That would amount to about 1,070 billion euros but it was
highly unlikely to happen:
 ""I think that this pessimistic scenario can be ruled out,""
Weber said. ""If however it came to this worst of worst cases,
the euro will not fail because of a difference of 145 billion.""
 Weber's comments came just after an unsourced report in
German daily Die Welt that the European Commission had
considered doubling the size of the rescue of fund.
 Germany's Finance Ministry, reacting to the report, said
there was no question of increasing the size of the rescue fund.
The EU Commission denied the report.
 Ireland has become the second euro zone member after Greece
to succumb to a painful debt crisis and fears that its debt and
budget crisis could spread to other euro zone countries such as
Portugal and Spain have shaken faith in the currency's future
and prompted a sharp sell-off in the euro in recent days.
 Weber, who is also the head of Germany's Bundesbank, said
Europe needed a permanent crisis mechanism so it would not have
to improvise in case of future crises.
 Deciding on the details of such a mechanism soon would help
to calm markets. It should include private sector liability and
not just rely on taxpayers, Weber added.

 * EU wants better political, economic links in the region
 
 By Igor Ilic
 ZAGREB, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Businessmen and politicians in
Serbia and Croatia met on Thursday to discuss breaking down
political barriers and forging closer commercial links, as the
two nations eye integration into the European Union.
 Building on a fresh political detente, Presidents Boris
Tadic of Serbia and Croatia's Ivo Josipovic staged a major
economic forum in Zagreb, after the global crisis paved the way
for closer commerce between the two former Yugoslav republics.
 The catchphrase of the two-day official Serbian visit was
""complementary economies, common history and no language
barriers"", which should lead to more investments on both sides
and possibly a joint appearance on third markets.
 ""There is no successful economy without production. High
indebtedness, lack of production and low competitiveness have
been chronic weaknesses of the economies in both states,"" Tadic
told a joint meeting of Serbian and Croatian businessmen.
 The visit follows recent efforts to improve political ties
burdened by the legacy of the 1991-95 war that Croatia fought
against its rebel Serbs, backed and armed by Belgrade.
 Croatia aims to complete EU entry talks next year, when
Serbia hopes to get a candidate status, which largely depends on
its cooperation with the Hague war crimes tribunal.
 The EU would also like to see the countries in the region
normalise relations and boost economic cooperation -- a process
already under way.
 Economic growth in both countries has in recent years been
based on imports and domestic consumption, spurred by foreign
lending. Now they want a new growth model focused on industry
and export.
 Josipovic acknowledged Serbian investors may have been
unwelcome in Croatia but said this would change.
 ""All investments are welcome, including Serbian
investments,"" he said.
 Josipovic said the most promising areas for intensified
economic cooperation include agriculture, energy, chemical and
pharmaceutical industry, and construction.
 Trade between Serbia and Croatia has picked up in recent
years, but remains modest. In the nine months of 2010, trade
between the two amounted to some $520.9 million), according to
Croatia's Chamber of Commerce data.
 The attending businessmen welcomed the initiative.
 ""We are small markets, a few million people. We have to
unite in some form,"" said Milosav Sutanovac, director of
Serbian tractor-maker IMT-Fabrika.

President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday he will propose his
G20 partners launch an international agriculture organisation to
coordinate and anticipate world production.
 France has made the regulation of commodities markets,
mainly agricultural, one of the priorities of his presidency of
the Group of 20 leading economies.
 ""Maybe it could be useful to have an international
agriculture organisation that would take stock of output
forecasts,"" Sarkozy told a roundtable of farmers after visiting
a cattle farm in central France.
 ""It is not useful that from South America to Europe, from
Europe to the United States, from the United States to Asia,
from Asia to Russia, we all plant the same things at the same
time, which means we keep on going from oversupply periods that
knock prices to under-production periods that excite
speculation,"" he said.
 He referred to the surge in world grain prices that followed
Russia's decision to set a unilateral ban on grain exports after
a severe drought ravaged its crops.
 ""No international organisation was able to precisely assess
world stocks and this lack of transparency has led to
speculation, panicking, which meant that all at once prices have
exploded,"" he said.
 Sarkozy did not refer to the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organisation in Rome which, among other tasks,
collects and publishes data from its members states about grain
crops and stocks.
 The body released its latest Food Outlook last week,
pointing to a rise in wheat plantings for next year in response
to higher grain prices.
 French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire is due to meet
his G20 counterparts in the first half of next year to work on
the French proposals on commodities markets regulation.
 Sarkozy repeated he was in favour of the so-called European
""community preference"" and that he would make sure that products
that do not respect the same environmental and health standards
do not enter the European Union, citing meat from New Zealand
and Argentina.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2010 11:36AM ET</span>",China ready for dialogue on rare earths--diplomats," * China backs 'sustainable supply' of rare earths
 * China presents business opportunity, not threat
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - China may be willing to soften
the impact of its cuts in exports of rare earth elements on
firms around the world that depend on them to make high-tech and
defence products, EU-based diplomats said on Thursday.
 China controls more than 95 percent of global rare earth
supplies, giving it a stranglehold over a scarce resource used
in a range of products from mobile phones to hybrid batteries.
 It has decided to cut its exports on environmental grounds,
alarming global industry and prompting discussions among G20
leaders about the potential impact, but a Chinese diplomat
indicated China could be open to discussions on the issue.
 ""We are open to an amicable solution,"" the Brussels-based
diplomat told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 ""We are happy to continue a sustainable supply.""
 A European diplomat also said there were early indications
China was willing to soften its approach on rare earth export
quotas.
 The European Union has called on China to keep exporting the
vital commodity until new mines can produce alternative
supplies.
 The EU's top trade official, Karel De Gucht, has said the EU
will push for a gradual slowing of Chinese exports during
meetings in Beijing in December.
 
 STANDOFF OVER SUBSIDIES
 But China has indicated it will not ignore European Union
moves to penalise China's state subsidies and cheap loans to
manufacturers.
 EU trade policy plans unveiled in October threatened harsh
action against illegal Chinese trade practices, and scrutiny of
subsidies which EU firms say give their Chinese rivals an
illegal competitive advantage.
 ""We should be very careful and try and avoid large-scale
trade frictions,"" the Chinese diplomat said. ""Subsidies are a
very contentious issue.""
 Concern is rising in mature economies like the European
Union and the United States that China's competitive edge will
push traditional sectors out of business, worsening
unemployment.
 The EU trade deficit with China reached 133 billion euros
($177 billion) in 2009, according to EU figures. But EU exports
to China grew 4 percent between 2008 and 2009, as China's rising
middle class and relative resilience in face of the financial
crisis provided a booming market.
 According to Chinese statistics, two thirds of China's 2009
exports were generated by China-based foreign companies --
reason enough to quell European fears that China represents a
threat, the Chinese diplomat said.
 ""China is the general place for foreign business to make
profits. It has become a safe harbour for them.""

* Emerging debt inflows slow as capital curbs hinder
 * Commodity-plays, small-cap shares favoured
 
 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Emerging debt returns have nosed
out their equity counterpart so far this year but stocks may be
set for a strong finish due to a flood of cheap U.S. cash and
capital controls that have made foreign bond purchases costlier.
 In absolute terms, investment into emerging equities
continues to dwarf emerging debt inflows. 
 But for investors fleeing ultra-low interest rates in more
mature economies, fixed-income assets issued by emerging-market
borrowers in local currency became irresistible, offering richer
and more predictable returns than equities.
 JPMorgan's GBI-EM local-currency debt index saw total
returns of 15 percent year-to-date while its EMBI Global
Diversified index <11EML> which tracks emerging sovereign dollar
bonds <11EML> have generated 14 percent.
 Both of those outstrip the 13 percent total return seen on
emerging equities <.MSCIEF> over the same period.
 In 2009, emerging equities more than doubled the total
returns of emerging sovereign bonds with a 79 percent windfall.
Equities have born the brunt of market volatility this year,
however, and investors have responded to economic uncertainty by
committing funds to fixed-income assets more consistently.

 http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/F/11/EM_FNFF1110.gif
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Signs are that emerging stocks are rotating back into favour
despite the recent selloff on global markets.
 ""External emerging debt spreads have rallied so much this
year to such narrow levels that there's little left to go,"" said
RBC Capital Markets emerging markets strategist Nigel Rendell.
""From this standpoint, emerging equities look attractive."" 
 
 INFLATION BOOST
 Data from funds flow tracker EPFR show inflows into emerging
equity funds for the week ended Nov 17 slowing to a trickle of
$447 million in the face of renewed investor jitters over
sovereign debt in the euro zone.
 This compares poorly to a $2.7bn weekly average over the
previous 24 weeks but favourably to the net $1.38 billion that
was pulled out from hard currency funds over the same week.
 Flows into local-currency emerging bond funds are still
holding up, amounting to $462 million compared to $572 million
the previous week. 
 But global inflationary pressures are set to grow as the
U.S. Federal Reserve unleashes its second round of stimulus to
quicken the flagging pace of U.S. economic recovery.
 In anticipation, fund managers are paring back on global
debt holdings, according to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's
November fund manager survey.
 The poll also found a net 56 percent of global investors
overweight global emerging market equities, their second highest
reading ever. [ID:nLDE6AF17Y]
 ""Global liquidity is considered to be the most important
driver of global emerging market equities, ahead of emerging
market domestic demand,"" BofA-Merrill said.
 That liquidity will also push commodity prices up, boosting
resource-focused bourses in Indonesia, Russia and Brazil.
Standard & Poor's (S&P) analyst Alka Banerjee argues that
foreign investment into emerging markets has so far been largely
centred on blue-chip companies and value remains to be found in
small-cap shares.
 Small-cap shares tracked by S&P have generated annualised
returns of around 20 percent returns in the last 10 years --
outperforming mid- to large-cap share returns of about 15
percent and a reversal of the 11 percent fall between 1994-2000.
 ""(There's a) shift towards investing across a broad and
diverse set of emerging market equities as opposed to a few
blue-chip stocks,"" she said.
 No doubt, equity markets also look more welcoming to
investors who now face higher costs when buying emerging bonds.
 The raft of capital curbs adopted by some emerging economies
to cope with the flood of foreign capital has been focused on
bond markets.
 Brazil, for instance, has slapped a tax on flows to local
debt securities while South Korea is moving to remove a
withholding tax exemption for foreign bond buyers.
 ""Capital control measures adopted by emerging economies have
been mainly focused on foreign purchases of bonds. That makes it
all the easier for investors to want to switch to other assets,""
said Narain Manik, a UBS strategist.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2010 10:44AM ET</span>",Canada beef quota to EU may double by 2012," * Quota seen at 48,200 tonnes by 2012
 * EU concern about slaughter wash key issue
 By Rod Nickel
 WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Canada's new
duty-free quota for shipping beef to the European Union could
more than double if technical conditions are met, a Canadian
government official said.
 Canada said on Tuesday that it had gained access to Europe
for 20,000 tonnes of beef annually, with a further 3,200 tonnes
to be added as compensation for the EU's ban on beef from
cattle treated with growth hormones.
 That access begins to resolve a 21-year-old dispute between
the EU and North American beef exporters, but provisions are in
place for a bigger quota, Patrick Girard, a spokesman for
Canada's Agriculture Department, said on Thursday.
 The EU's most favored nation beef quota, which is available
to any World Trade Organization member that can meet the import
requirement -- but currently just Canada, the United States and
Australia -- will rise a further 25,000 tonnes to 48,200 tonnes
annually once all conditions are met, Girard said.
 The key issue that Canada and the EU must resolve before
the quota expands is the North American practice of washing
carcasses with an anti-microbial spray not used in Europe, said
John Masswohl, director of government and international
relations for the Canadian Cattlemen's Association.
 If the sides resolve outstanding issues, the expanded quota
could be in place by 2012, Masswohl said. Canadian and EU
negotiators are making progress on resolving the concern about
washes, he said.
 ""We've been working to get this approved for a year and a
half,"" Masswohl said. ""(Canadian farmers) have got the beef,
they've got the customers, now they've gotten rid of the
tariff.""
 The timing of when Canada will lift a retaliatory surtax on
European beef, pork and gherkins depends on when a memorandum
of understanding resolving the beef hormone dispute is signed,
Girard said.

(Adds quotes, details)
 PARIS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The head of Qatar Airways
criticised Boeing and Canada's Bombardier over problems with
plane developments on Thursday and threatened to shift extra
business to European group Airbus.
 Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said Boeing had ""failed"" in
development of its 787 Dreamliner, which is seen likely to
suffer a further delay following a fire on a test flight, and
Bombardier was suffering problems with its C-Series jetliner.
 ""I was really taken aback by the (787) programme. I never
expected a programme could be delayed so much with a company
like Boeing, which has pride in its quality. They have very
clearly failed,"" he told a news conference.
 Development of the carbon-composite 787 is running around
three years late and analysts expect a further delay as Boeing
addresses the cause of the fire which led to the test flight
being grounded.
 He said Qatar Airways had been notified of some delays to
787 deliveries but declined to say whether this before or after
the test flight incident two weeks ago.
 Boeing declined to comment and Bombardier was not
immediately available.
 Al Baker said he was considering increasing the airline's
order for five Airbus A380 superjumbo planes and might order a
re-engined version of the A320 single-aisle jetliner, which he
expected to be launched by the end of this year.
 ""Today we have only five A380s on order and most definitely
we will consider increasing this order,"" he said.
 Qatar Airways has not chosen engines for the 500-seat plane
and its decision will not be affected by the recent blowout of a
Rolls-Royce engine on a Qantas A380, he said.
 He said he doubted Airbus's next plane, the mid-sized A350,
for which Qatar is the biggest customer, would be delayed as
much as a year, as suggested by Emirates airline on Wednesday.
 The possible upgrade of the medium-haul A320 is designed to
compete with Bombardier's new C-Series. Al Baker later confirmed
that his concerns related to the aircraft's engines, produced by
United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney.
Qatar was expected to buy C-Series jets at the Farnborough
air show in July but plans were scrapped amid what Bombardier
described as disagreements between Qatar Airways and the engine
maker.
 Visiting France to mark the opening of flights to Nice, Al
Baker also hit back at European carriers in a growing trade war
between airlines over U.S. and European export credits and
rejected accusations that his airline was subsidized.

 PARIS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - It was like watching an elephant
trying to woo a gazelle.
 As Axel Weber lumbered through his seduction dance before
France's policy elite on Wednesday evening, there seemed a
constant risk that he might accidentally crush the object of his
desires.
 The head of Germany's Bundesbank and undeclared candidate to
succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as head of the European Central Bank
next year did his best to soften his hawkish image and cast
himself as the strongest supporter of European monetary union.
Addressing some 120 businessmen, bankers, policymakers and
opinion leaders at the German Embassy in Paris, Weber evaded
questions about his ambitions and focused on his commitment to
saving and strengthening the euro. [ID:nLDE6AN28M]
 ""Let's not fantasize about the future but let's stick to the
functions that people hold now and how they perform them,"" he
told a questioner. ""Please judge me by the function I hold now.
I am president of the Bundesbank.""
 Weber struck a similar line to defend his public criticism
of the ECB's decision to buy euro zone government bonds at the
height of this year's debt crisis, which two French questioners
depicted as disloyal and a breach of central bank discipline.
 The ECB always spoke with a single voice and its president
presented the agreed position of the governing council, he said,
before adding: ""It is right that there should be debate on the
way forward. In the end a collective body makes the decision.""
 Some analysts say Weber's outspoken dissent could cost him
his chance of the top job, for which Bank of Italy governor
Mario Draghi is the other prominent contender.
 Weber ascribed his behaviour to ""a different tradition of
open discussion in Germany"" and quoted U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke as saying that if two people always think
the same way, one of them is redundant.
 Playing to French sensibilities, he lauded Franco-German
cooperation in the financial, economic and debt crises of the
last three years, airbrushing over sharp divergences at key
moments over whether and how to save banks and rescue Greece.
 And he contrasted continental European financial solidity
with what he called the ""Anglo-Saxon"" model of finance that had
caused the global financial crisis and now brought down Ireland.
 Weber laboured under a double linguistic handicap. 
 Whereas Trichet has learned German while in Frankfurt and
can charm a German audience in a Gallic version of Goethe's
native tongue, the Bundesbank chief speaks no French.
 After a few words of introduction in American-accented
English, he switched to German. A French interpreter struggled
to keep up with his rapid-fire delivery and complex syntax.
 The central banker's description of himself as a ""modest
technocrat"", for example, never reached most of his audience.
 Weber praised President Nicolas Sarkozy's unpopular pension
reform and avoided explicit criticism of France's swollen public
deficit and debt, its high level of public spending or the
tendency of the French elite to assume that Germany should go on

 But he did note that Germany's deficit had only risen to 3.5
percent of gross domestic product at its height in 2009, when
Europe's biggest economy contracted by 5 percent, and he said
this should serve as an example to others.

 * Poverty increased even in booms
 * Continued dependence on commodities
 
 GENEVA, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The world's poorest countries are
trapped in boom-bust cycles and their medium-term prospects are
a cause for concern, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development said in a report issued on Thursday.
 The 49 states categorised as least developed countries
(LDCs) weathered the global downturn better than expected, but
they now need a new systematic international approach to
development rather than ad hoc emergency measures to reduce
their economies' reliance on raw materials, UNCTAD said.
 ""They have not been able to benefit from any global trends
to wean themselves away from increasing dependence on
commodities,"" UNCTAD Secretary-General Supachai Panitchpakdi
told a briefing.
 The U.N. agency said the number of people in extreme poverty
had increased by 3 million a year during the 2002-2007 boom,
reaching 421 million in 2007 -- twice as many as in 1980.
 As a result 53 percent of LDC populations were living in
poverty in 2007, it said.
 During the boom years LDCs as a whole averaged growth rates
of 7 percent a year but their dependence on commodities
increased, while the share of manufacturing in the value-added
of the economy actually declined in over half the 49 LDCs.
 UNCTAD, which has often taken a sceptical view of economic
deregulation and liberalisation, laid out a detailed blueprint
for the reform of international development, intended for
discussion at a U.N. conference on LDCs next year in Istanbul.
 The new system would involve reforms in finance, trade,
commodities, technology and climate change.
 These include measures to promote public-private
partnerships for funding, especially in infrastructure
investment, and debt relief, given that some 6-10 LDCs are now
facing debt distress, Supachai said.
 UNCTAD recommends shielding commodities-dependent states
from volatility by building up reserves to stabilise prices and
introducing a transaction tax on commodities derivatives to
prevent speculation from inflating prices.
 Supachai said this was particularly topical because excess
global liquidity was now flowing into commodities markets and
driving up the price of products such as wheat and maize.
 Economic growth has done little to close the productivity
gap in agriculture in LDCs, whose food import bill rose to $24
billion in 2008 from $9 billion in 2002, the report notes.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The euro stayed weak on Thursday,
dipping close to two-month lows against the dollar, as the euro
zone debt crisis showed little signs of abating and investors
remained nervous about the risk of contagion.
 Traders said Portugal and increasingly Spain were seen as
potentially in need of financial help while Ireland's
belt-tightening measures came under fire for sticking to
optimistic growth assumptions.
 Foreign exchange trading volumes were light, however, due to
the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

Spanish yields have triggered speculation about whether funds
available under a euro zone financial safety net would be

 The euro  edged up 0.1 percent on the day to $1.3340
after earlier hitting a low around $1.3287, just shy of the
previous day's two-month low of $1.3284. Traders said option
expiries at $1.3350 were likely to check any gains.
 The next support is pegged at $1.3232, a 61.8 percent
retracement of the August to November rally. A break of that
support could test the euro's 200-day moving average at $1.3133.
 ""Contagion doesn't look to be spreading at the moment and
the market is in a range for now, with no new news,"" said Lauren
Rosborough, currency strategist at Westpac.
 She said she expected the euro would fall towards $1.3080,
the 50 percent retracement of the rally from the May low below
$1.19 to the November high above $1.42, but said some
consolidation may be needed before the next push lower.

 The euro has fallen below support from the bottom of the
cloud on the daily ichimoku chart, which stood at $1.3371,
sending a major bearish signal. The last time it fell through

 * Noble's future in Nigeria's fuel market uncertain
 * Prominent gasoline trader left Noble in early November
 * Noble's fuels trade to Nigeria estimated near $1 bln
 
 By Emma Farge
 LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria will stop subsidising
marketers who buy gasoline from Noble Group, according to a
document seen by Reuters, in a move likely to prevent the trader
from dealing in the country's $6 billion fuel market.
 In a fax sent to all Nigerian fuel marketers on Nov. 8, the
country's Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)
said they can no longer claim for subsidies if the fuel comes
from Noble, citing discrepancies in the Singapore-listed
trader's shipping lists.
 While the regulator does not have the power to implement a
blanket ban, fuel importers in Nigeria may hesitate to work with
Noble if they have to forego access to multi-billion dollar fuel
subsidies from the government's Petroleum Support Fund (PSF).
 In a fax signed by manager O. Agbaje on behalf of the
executive secretary of the PPPRA, the regulator said: ""Any
vessel transaction or bill of lading emanating from Messrs Noble
Clean Fuels will not be accepted for subsidy claims under the
scheme.""
 Noble did not respond to phone calls and emails asking for
comment.
 A senior PPPRA executive told Reuters on Tuesday that in one
transaction involving Noble, the amount of fuel submitted for
subsidies did not match the actual quantity delivered.
 PPPRA said it requested clarification from Noble but has not
yet received a satisfactory response.
 Chief executive of Petrodel Michael Prest, whose company
also supplies the Nigerian market, said in an interview with
Reuters on Tuesday that he was familiar with the complaints
about Noble's operations in Nigeria, but questioned any decision
that would prevent it from supplying.
 ""Do you kill a company doing 30 percent of imports to the
private market? What you should do is try to perfect what was
clearly an imperfect system. What you don't want is to create a
brick wall that frightens away suppliers such as Noble,"" he
said.
 Major crude oil producer Nigeria subsidises imported
gasoline because it lacks adequate refining capacity of its own
yet needs to limit pump prices.
 
 TRADING PROBLEMS
 Oil traders have said that Noble was struggling to sell
gasoline to Nigeria but the document is the first official
confirmation the company is facing problems in the key export
market, after the surprise departure of its linchpin gasoline
trader James McNicol earlier this month.
 McNicol previously gained prominence as a gasoline trader at
commodities houses Vitol and Trafigura. He declined to comment.
 Since it started trading oil last year, Noble has
successfully vied with established rivals Total and Trafigura
for a stake of the downstream market in Africa's largest oil and
gas industry.
 A lack of other outlets for gasoline because of fuel
sanctions against Iran and weaker demand from the United States
since the financial crisis has stoked competition among European
suppliers.
 According to three trade source estimates, Noble has
delivered around 30 percent of gasoline requirements to
independent fuel marketers or about 15 percent of total
requirements for Africa's most populous nation this year.
 This amounts to over 1 million tonnes in transactions worth
around $1 billion, based on Europe's spot gasoline price of near
$750 a tonne on Thursday.
 Instead of participating in the official quarterly fuel
tender rounds organised by Nigerian state oil company NNPC,
Noble has shipped gasoline tankers to near Lagos Bay for
floating storage and unloaded them gradually, oil traders said.
 At its peak in May, there was around 7 million barrels of
gasoline or almost 1 million tonnes floating off the coast of
Nigeria, some of which was held by Noble, trade and shipping
sources said.
 About half of gasoline supplies are imported through the
NNPC tenders and the other half is organised independently
through deals with Nigeria-based distributors.
 Bypassing the NNPC tenders has raised concerns among
importers that it could make verifying gasoline import
quantities more difficult, one trade source said.
 ""Noble is the only one continuously selling gasoline off
mother vessels offshore. It's very, very difficult to police
that as you can't see what's going on,"" the trade source said.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Financial markets regained some
composure on Thursday after roller-coaster sessions prompted by
the euro zone's debt problems as recent upbeat economic data
encouraged investors to put on some risk.
 Risk appetite improved slightly on the back of solid
overnight gains on Wall Street, but there would be no follow
though from that quarter as U.S. markets were closed for the
Thanksgiving holiday.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
slightly, with Europe and Japan higher.
 ""The most important thing for the equity market is the
ability to believe that the economic cycle is staying intact,""
Philip Isherwood, European equities strategist at Evolution
Securities, said. ""That means not just U.S. data reassuring, but
also European.""
 German government bonds  fell, pressured by the
financial implications for core issuers of potential further
euro zone bailouts and by recent data highlighting the strength
of the region's largest economy.
 ""The next step could be that core Europe will take
significantly more responsibility for the rest of Europe,"" RBC
rate strategist Peter Schaffrik said.
 Investors have also begun considering whether German plans
to include Collective Action Clauses (CACs) in euro zone
sovereign debt issues will require more risk priced in generally
for such bonds.
 Yield spreads on Spanish and Portuguese bonds -- watched for
signs they will be the next dominoes to topple in Europe's
crisis -- widened by 10 basis points over German Bunds.
 In currency markets, the dollar briefly hit a two-month high
against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> before reversing
gains. The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.3367 .
 ""Things are a bit sidelined due to the U.S. holiday but
there is still a lot of nervousness about euro zone peripheral
debt problems. So the euro remains a sell into rallies and not a
buy on dips"", said Paul Mackel, HSBC's director of currency
strategy.
 
 MIXED STOCKS
 World stock markets were generally steady because of the
U.S. hiatus with MSCI's all country world index up 0.1 percent
and its emerging market counterpart gaining a quarter percent.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose about 0.6 percent.
Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 0.5 percent.
 Koen De Leus, strategist at KBC Securities, said the
European market was getting some support from recent strong
economic data, including on consumer spending, joblessness and
and consumer confidence.
 French consumer confidence was the latest sentiment
indicator to beat forecasts in Europe on Thursday, following a
strong reading from Germany's closely watched Ifo survey a day
earlier.
 ""Markets are on a rollercoaster. Despair on the ride down
due to the day-by-day increasing debt contagion in Europe is
occasionally relieved by better-than-expected macro data from
Europe and the U.S. It's a delicate balance,"" De Leus said.

 BERLIN, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle
said on Thursday the German economy was in excellent shape with
domestic demand fueling growth, long-term unemployment falling
and full employment possible.
 ""Germans are in an expansionary mood. We're investing again,

 Exporters' strength in emerging markets is also helping the
economy grow and detailed third quarter gross domestic product
(GDP) data released on Tuesday also showed a more balanced
recovery taking hold, with steady growth in private consumption.
 ""Domestic demand is now contributing more than half of the
current growth rates and the council of economic experts say
next year 90 percent of the growth will come from the domestic
economy,"" Bruederle added.
 ""Export demand ignited the upturn and now the domestic
demand is now strengthening the growth. It's a textbook example
of an upturn this year and next year.""
 Unemployment in Germany hit an 18-year low in October,
falling below the politically sensitive 3 million mark for the
first time since November 2008. It stood at 2.945 million in
unadjusted terms. 
 ""There are fewer than 3 million unemployed now, that's down
from 5 million,"" Bruederle said. ""Even the number of long-term
unemployed is now decreasing. That's never happened in the past.
 ""I'm convinced that full employment will be possible soon.
We already full near full employment in some areas of southern
Germany.""

(Adds details)
 GENEVA, Nov 25 (Reuters) - International air cargo traffic
picked up in October after falling since May to stand 14.4
percent higher than a year earlier, the airline industry body
IATA said on Thursday.
 October's year-on-year increase in air freight -- an
important indicator of trade and economic recovery -- was below
September's 15.5 percent rise but the monthly rise followed a 5
percent fall since May, the International Air Transport
Association said in its monthly analysis of air traffic.
 ""Freight appears to be at a turning point,"" IATA said.
 ""But a single month does not make a trend. And it remains to
be seen if this is the stabilisation in freight volumes or the
start of an upward trend,"" its director-general, Giovanni
Bisignani, added in a statement.
 Freight traffic, which accounts for 35 percent of the value
of goods traded internationally, is now 1 percent above
pre-crisis levels of early 2008, IATA said.
 Passenger demand -- a reflection of business and consumer
confidence -- was 10.1 percent higher in October than a year
earlier, slightly below September's 10.7 percent rise, and is
now 5 percent above pre-crisis levels.
 IATA said airlines were reacting to this year's rebound in
demand with cautious increases in capacity.
 In the first 10 months of this year an 8.5 percent increase
in passenger demand was matched by a 4.0 percent increase in
capacity, while a 24 percent increase in freight demand led to
only a 9.2 percent rise in cargo capacity.
 Airlines are planning a further 7.5 percent increase in
passenger capacity for the half-year scheduling period beginning
at the end of October, said IATA, which represents 230 airlines
including Aeroflot, Air China and Lan Airlines.
 Passenger growth in October was strongest among Middle
Eastern airlines and weakest in Latin America.

 LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The euro struggled near a

 By John Acher 
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The private equity owners of
Denmark's TDC set the price range on Thursday for the planned
sale of a quarter of the telecoms company, a deal which could
land them $2.4 billion plus a share buyback payout.
 The share sale is the latest example of private equity firms
making the most of stronger equity markets to cash in on bets
which are now several years old. It follows a successful debut
offering by Danish jeweler Pandora last month.
 And it will be Europe's third-biggest public stock offering
this year, following a $3.61 billion initial public offering by
Italy's Enel Green Power and a $2.74 billion IPO by Polish
insurer PZU.
 TDC's main owners -- private equity investment firms Apax
Partners, Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Permira
Advisers and Providence Equity Partners with some 88 percent of
the stock -- won control of TDC in a 2005 buyout which was
Europe's biggest at the time.
 They are now selling 210 million shares plus an
overallotment of 31.5 million shares, and set an indicative
price range of 47-56 crowns per share. That makes the offering
worth between 9.87 billion and 13.52 billion Danish crowns ($2.4
billion) if the so-called ""greenshoe"" option is exercised.
 The private equity owners are effectively cashing in twice
as they are also set to benefit from a 9 billion Danish crown
share buyback, part of a releveraging of TDC.
 ""It is a way for the owners to extract additional money from
the company,"" said a source close to the deal.
 The sellers will still own about 55 to 60 percent of TDC
after the sale, Chief Executive Henrik Poulsen said.
 ""In other words, that means that the (free) floated share
will come to between 40 and 45 percent,"" Poulsen said. That is
based on an assumption that minority owners would keep their
shares and not offer them to TDC in a buyback, he added.
 The precise amount will depend on how much of the greenshoe
is sold to new investors and on which existing shareholders
subscribe to a share buyback of up to 9 billion crowns by TDC.
 ""All existing shareholders can participate in the buyback
including current minority shareholders, so that is another
variable to take into account -- the extent to which minority
shareholders will take part in the buyback or not,"" he said.
 
 MIDDLE OF RANGE 
 TDC shares ended up 0.2 percent at 53.65 crowns, in the
middle of the indicated range, putting the market capitalisation
at about $9.5 billion. The stock slightly underperformed a 0.4
percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 telecoms index.
 ""In the middle of the price range, it is fairly priced in
comparison to the European telecom sector,"" Danske Capital chief
analyst Jesper Poll said. ""It is hard to say where in the price
range it will land -- it is very dynamic.""
 TDC says its most comparable European peers are Belgium's
Belgacom, KPN of the Netherlands and Swisscom of Switzerland.
But its main rivals in its home Nordic market are
Swedish-Finnish TeliaSonera and Norway's Telenor.
 While not a flotation, the planned sale has been handled
like an IPO. It gives the owners a partial exit and effectively
relaunches TDC on the Copenhagen bourse.
 TDC's stock has been largely illiquid since a leveraged
buyout five years ago.

 * Position adjustments before holiday hit Aussie vs US dollar
 * But Aussie hits record high vs euro
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The euro struggled near a two-month
low as the euro zone debt crisis showed signs of spilling over
from Ireland to other euro zone members even after Ireland
unveiled an ambitious austerity plan.
 Traders say Portugal and increasingly Spain are seen as
potentially in need of help while Dublin's belt-tightening plan
has come under fire for sticking to economic growth assumptions,
unveiled earlier this month, seen as too optimistic.
 Trade was thin, however, due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday
on Thursday. Some market players said the fall in the euro as
well as the Aussie reflected short-covering in the U.S. dollar
before the holiday.
 ""The market is being driven by position adjustments typical
in November plus the euro zone problems,"" said Minori Uchida, a
senior analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The euro shed 0.2 percent on the day to trade at $1.3312. It
pierced through major support around $1.3333 to hit a two-month
low of $1.3284 on Wednesday.
 Next support is pegged at $1.3232, a 61.8 percent retracement
of the August to November rally, a break of which could see the
single currency target $1.3000.
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro fell 0.2 percent to
111.15 yen after having fallen to 110.32 yen on Wednesday, a
level last seen in mid-September.
 ""With the U.S. on holiday, and CDS spreads across the PIGS
holding in below recent record highs, risk appetite may crawl
back in the days ahead to at least stabilise EUR/USD,"" said Peter
Frank, strategist at Societe Generale.
 ""But, with the Irish government also admitting that the
IMF/EU EFSF talks may last weeks, we find no viable reasons to
buy the EUR at this point."" HAIRCUTS
 Other traders said worries that private investors may have to
accept losses, or ""haircuts"", in any euro zone sovereign debt
restruturing from 2013 -- a proposal put forward by Germany --
could push up the premium investors will ask for holding euro
zone periphery debt, hurting the euro.
 ""If Europe adopts the debt haircut option, even Spain could
be forced to ask for help as soon as December,"" said a trader at
a Japanese bank.
 Some traders think the euro could be in for further downside,
though few see a return to the four-year low of $1.1876 hit in
June in the wake of debt crisis in Greece as yet.
 ""The low was hit when there was no safety net in Europe and
markets were expecting the Fed to exit from its loose policy. As
the dollar is also under pressure from the Fed's quantitative
easing, it's hard to think the euro will fall to around $1.2,""
said BOTM's Uchida.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, flirted with a a two-month
high just short of 80.000 overnight and was last at 79.83, almost
flat on the day.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 83.50 yen, though many traders
expect it to stay in its well-worn range around 82.80-83.80 in
the near term.
 The greenback was aided by U.S. data showing a fall in new
claims for jobless benefits to two-year lows and another rise in
consumer spending, raising hopes of a stronger U.S. recovery.
 Those figures helped spur a rally on Wall Street, though data
on U.S. housing and durable goods orders was weak, painting a
mixed picture on the economy.
 The Aussie dollar dropped 0.4 percent to $0.9771, failing to
maintain its initial rise sparked by Wall Street gains.
 Position adjustments ahead of the U.S. holiday, selling by
Japanese investors and North Korea's warning of possible new
attacks following its shelling of a South Korean island this week
were cited as hurting the Aussie, and more stop-losses are seen
below $0.9720.
 But traders said Australia's strong economic fundamentals and
the currency's hefty yield are likely to underpin the currency.
 In fact, the Aussie hit a record high against the euro
earlier in the session, with euro/Aussie falling to a record low
around A$1.3553 before climbing back to $1.3630, up 0.3 percent
on the day.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose from
1-1/2-month lows on Thursday, with buying focused in the tech
and retail sectors on hopes for a busy U.S. shopping season,
though the falling Australian dollar was an indication of
investors' reduced willingness to take risks.	
 Major European stock markets saw modest early gains, with
the FTSEurofirst 300 opening up 0.2 percent and
London's FTSE 100 up 0.1 percent . U.S. stock index
futures  were down 0.3 percent.	
 The euro was stuck near a two-month low on fears about the
next fiscal domino to fall in Europe, even after Ireland
hatched a plan to shore up its finances, with the single
currency poised for the largest monthly decline against the
dollar since May. 
 A rare bit of good news on the U.S. labour market
overnight sparked hopes the holiday season would result in big
sales for Asia's exporters, though other factors such as the
closing window on Hong Kong's once red-hot IPO market were
signals that equity markets may have topped out for the year.	
 More than $3 billion worth of proposed IPOs in Hong Kong
were deferred, while Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd
put off pricing its 10-year dollar bond until next week.
[ID:nTOE6AN01S]	
 ""Usually, if there is a lot of hot money coming to Hong
Kong, these IPOs should be doing well,"" said Belle Liang,
research head at Core Pacific-Yamaichi. ""IPOs are being
delayed or withdrawn because of lacklustre demand.""	
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed 0.5 percent
higher , extending what has been a surprising
outperformance this month compared with the rest of the region. 
 The Nikkei has risen 9.5 percent so far in November, and
with three more trading days to go in November is on track for
the best performing month since March. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
is down 0.7 percent in November.	
 The index was up 0.4 percent on the day, largely driven
higher by 1 percent gains in the technology and consumer
discretionary sectors. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.4 percent ,
supported by a 5.7 percent pop in shares of Li & Fung
, an exporter that supplies Western retailers such as
Wal-Mart and Target. 
 Li & Fung stock hit a record high and was trading at 1.7
times its average volume of the past 30 days, one of the
busiest stocks in the index.	
 For the most part, the near-term outlook for emerging
Asian stocks was to a large extent dependent on how
policymakers respond to inflationary pressures. 
 ""With growth above potential in many emerging markets,
particularly in Asia, the risk of broad-based inflation is
real and growing,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.	
 ""And, as policy responds to this in the form of rate hikes
or nominal currency appreciation, equities -- stuck between
the pull of growth and the push of tightening policy -- are
likely to have a bumpier ride.""	
 The Thanksgiving holiday in the United States will keep
trading activity limited on Thursday. Friday, the day after
Thanksgiving, is traditionally the busiest U.S. shopping day
of the year.	
 The need for liquidity has not necessarily benefited U.S.
Treasuries, though higher yields have been a draw to the dollar.	
 After poor auctions of mid-maturity debt, the U.S. 5-year
yield hit a two-month high of 1.59 percent
overnight, having now risen more than 50 basis points
since the most recent Federal Reserve meeting.	
 Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index , a
measure of its performance against six other major currencies,
was up 0.1 percent, heading back up to 80.00, a level that was
test overnight when the index hit the highest since Sept 24.	
 The high-yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars were
underperformers among G10 currencies on Thursday. Uncertainty
about what measures China may take to pull down inflation has
haunted these currencies.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Japan's annual export growth slowed
for an eighth straight month in October due to a stronger yen,
and a central banker said downside risks to the Japanese economy
outweigh upside risks due to uncertainties abroad.
 Slowing exports bode ill for an economy bracing for a
possible contraction in the final quarter of this year as a
temporary boost from stimulus-driven consumption tapers off.
 Overseas demand for Japanese goods is likely to pick up again
next year and help Japan avoid recession, economists say, but
China's monetary policy tightening, European sovereign debt woes
and developments in the U.S. economy pose risks to the outlook.
 Bank of Japan (BOJ) board member Seiji Nakamura said exports
could recover next year, but he warned of growing risks facing
the U.S. and European economies and said he remained on alert for
a possible spike in the yen stemming from problems in major
economies.
 Nakamura sounded less upbeat than Governor Masaaki Shirakawa,
who has described risks to Japan's economy as evenly balanced,
suggesting Nakamura would not dissent if the BOJ were to boost
its 5 trillion yen ($59.87 billion) asset-buying scheme in
response to a worsening in the economy.
 ""Overall, downside risks (to the Japanese economy) seem
somewhat stronger than upside risks,"" Nakamura told a news
conference, citing strong uncertainties about the outlook for the
U.S. economy.
 ""There are worries ... sovereign debt problems in peripheral
Europe could affect the European economy by triggering spikes in
bond yields and worsening sentiment,"" he said in a speech.
 BOJ FORECASTS
 ""We tend to think that the economy could rebound as early as
January-March, because leading indicators for Japanese exports,
such as U.S. new orders, are stabilising,"" said Satoru Ogasawara,
an economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.
 ""If Nakamura sees further downside risks, it could mean he's
worried new orders overseas will start falling, and that would be
a risk to our economic forecasts.""
 One of the BOJ's two deputy governors, Hirohide Yamaguchi,
also said this month that the central bank needs to be mindful of
downside risks to Japan's economy.
 Exports rose 7.8 percent in October from a year earlier, the
finance ministry said on Thursday, less than the median forecast
for a 10.7 percent rise.
 Financial markets shrugged off the data. The Nikkei average
edged toward a five-month high on demand from overseas investors.
 Shipments to the United States in October rose 4.7 percent
from a year earlier, slower than the previous month's 10.4
percent, while exports to Europe fell an annual 1.9 percent, the
first decline in almost a year as worries about Ireland's debt
burden pushed bond yields higher.
 In one positive sign, exports to China, the biggest
destination for Japanese goods, rose 17.5 percent from a year
earlier, faster than the 10.2 percent annual rise in September
due to higher shipments of metal-processing machines.
 Data on jobless benefit claims and consumer spending suggests
the U.S. economic recovery is gaining strength, but a high
unemployment rate, weakness in the housing market and a reduction
in household debt cloud the outlook.
 The BOJ eased monetary policy last month by pledging to keep
rates in a range from zero to 0.1 percent until the end of
deflation is in sight and announcing a plan to buy assets ranging
from government bonds to corporate debt.
 The size of the 5 trillion yen asset buying pool now
effectively serves as a gauge of the BOJ's monetary easing.
 Nakamura was cautious about setting the policy rate at zero,
saying it could reduce commercial banks' incentive to lend and
harm the money market.
 Shirakawa has said topping up the asset buying plan is a
clear option if the looming economic slowdown proves worse than
expected. But the yen's retreat from 15-year highs scaled early
this month makes any radical near-term action unlikely.
 Japan's economy grew a solid 0.9 percent in the third quarter
as expiring government incentives gave consumption a last-minute
boost before a long-anticipated slowdown.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Stocks rebounded on Wednesday
on stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs and consumer sentiment data
but lingering concerns about the European debt crisis weighed
on the euro.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries and gold dropped as investors
felt more comfortable taking on risk, one day after rising
tensions in the Korea peninsula jolted global markets.
 The relief came after data showed claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits last week dropped to their lowest level
in more than two years. Consumer sentiment also rose to its
highest since June. For details, see [ID:nN24211131].
 The data sent major U.S. stock indexes more than 1 percent
higher and Asia looked set to rise as well, with Japan's Nikkei
futures traded in Chicago  gaining 270 points to
10,145.00.
 ""Now you are getting good economic data, and you have a tug
of war going on here between an improving economy and
geopolitical events,"" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment
strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.
""The market is trying to determine how much weight to put on
each one of these events.""
 Fears that the Irish debt crisis could spread into weaker
members of the euro zone also inspired caution, with yield
spreads of Portuguese and Spanish debt widening to fresh
records even as Ireland unveiled a much-awaited austerity
plan.
 The 15 billion euro ($20 billion) plan for the next four
years includes deep spending cuts and tax increases but also
retains economic assumptions that many analysts deem
unrealistic. [ID:nLDE6AM25A]
 ""There are still a lot of questions surrounding the bailout
of Ireland and the budget; the government is in a limbo and we
do not know if it will go through,"" said Franz Wenzel,
strategist with AXA Investment Managers in Paris.
 Major U.S. stock indexes gained more than 1 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 150.91 points,
or 1.37 percent, to 11,187.28, while the Standard & Poor's 500

 The European stock market was also supported by data
showing German business sentiment rose in November to its
strongest since 1991.
 EURO UNDER PRESSURE
 The U.S. dollar seesawed against key currencies as trading
was thin on the eve of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, when U.S.
financial markets will be closed.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the
performance of the greenback against a basket of major
currencies, rose 0.1 percent after posting losses earlier on
the session.
 The euro  initially strengthened on the
better-than-expected U.S. data, but concerns about the euro
zone debt crisis weighed later, sending the European single
currency 0.28 percent lower to $1.3333.
 ""The driver is ""still Irish and euro-zone concerns, and we

chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New

 U.S. Treasury prices fell, however, as stocks took the
appeal off the government debt market. Prices of benchmark
10-year notes  were down more than one point,
sending yields up to 2.9157 percent.
 Gold prices  fell 0.18 percent to $1,374.20 an ounce.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Worries that Ireland's fiscal crisis
could spread to other euro-zone countries drove the euro down to a
two-month low beneath $1.33 on Wednesday, and traders said the
currency is probably in for more losses in the days ahead.
 Though it traded in a wide range and had recouped most of its
losses by midday in New York, traders attributed that to low volume
ahead of a U.S. market holiday for Thanksgiving on Thursday. The euro
was still down 2.7 percent against the dollar since Monday and is
down 4.4 percent so far in November.
 Investors worried that a euro-zone fiscal crisis centered for now
on Ireland could spread to other indebted countries, notably Portugal
and Spain. Ireland's four-year plan, announced Wednesday, to cut its
budget by 15 billion euros did little to cheer the market.
 The driver is ""still Irish and euro-zone concerns, and we will
be talking about this well into 2011,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""The
market will continue to expect Portugal to apply (for aid) and then
it will come down to Spain.""
 The euro was last down 0.2 percent at $1.3348, having hit a
two-month low of $1.3284 and bouncing off its 100-day moving average
-- currently around $1.3297 -- for the first time since early
September.
Analysts are still looking for the euro to test $1.3232, the 61.8
percent retracement of its August-November rally, before targeting
$1.3000.
 The euro also hit a two=month low of 110.33 yen, but recovered to
111.40 yen, up about 0.2 percent.
 Higher U.S. bond yields, which rose on data showing improved U.S.
labor market conditions, also kept demand for euros muted, as did the
move by Standard & Poor's to cut its sovereign rating on Ireland.
 ""The U.S. labor market has turned a corner, which should be very
positive for the U.S. economy in 2011,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
research at GFT in New York.
 KOREA TENSIONS, SPAIN IN FOCUS
 Analysts said euro-zone worries eclipsed concerns about tensions
between North and South Korea, which exchanged artillery fire a day

some of the 3.2 percent advance on Tuesday. But against the Japanese
yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 83.44 yen in mid-afternoon

have widened, while a poor response to Germany's sale of 10-year debt
also unnerved investors.
 Some traders said if investors were starting to also shun Bunds

would stabilize in the near term.
 The biggest concern for Europe watchers is Spain, the
fourth-biggest economy in the 16-country euro zone and one that has
struggled with a housing collapse and weak banks. Nomura strategist
Jens Nordvig said the outlook on Spain will be a primary driver of
the euro in the coming weeks.
 Should the gap between Spanish and German 10-year yields, now at
about 240 basis points, widen by another 200 basis points, the euro
could fall to around $1.23, Nordvig said in a note to clients.

problem
(Recasts, adds quotes, detail)
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing
Council member Axel Weber said on Wednesday he was convinced
the euro would survive and that a financial safety net created
by euro zone governments would be enough to withstandspeculators.
 Weber, also president of Germany's central bank, said he
believed euro zone states could come up with more money if the
existing 750-billion-euro safety net ever proved insufficient.
 Weber, who was speaking at a German Embassy dinner in
Paris, said reintroducing Germany's former Deutschemark
currency would not be an alternative to the euro, which was
launched in 1999.
 ""We can't afford for this quantum leap forward to be called
into question by the markets,"" Weber said, referring to the
European integration brought about by the single currency.
 ""We must do everything to ensure the sustainability of the
euro,"" he said. ""There's no way back. What has grown together
cannot and must not be split apart by a financial crisis.""
 Ireland, which has become the second euro zone member after
Greece to succumb to a painful debt crisis, announced plans on
Wednesday to slash welfare spending and hike taxes to help pay
for its banking crisis and meet the terms of an international
bailout.
 Fears that Ireland's debt and budget crisis could spread to
other euro zone countries such as Portugal and Spain have
shaken faith in the currency's future and prompted a sharp
sell-off in the euro in recent days.
 ""I am convinced euro zone states will do what is necessary
to protect the euro,"" Weber said, adding that ""750 billion
euros should be more than enough to see off an attack on the
euro zone. What we are seeing now is an opportunistic attack on
the euro.""
 FLARING TEMPERS
 Weber told the dinner that markets ought to be able to see
that other euro zone states do not have the same problems as
Ireland or Greece, whose budget crisis in early 2010 sent
shockwaves across euro zone debt markets.
 Tempers have flared across Europe over the financial and
social cost of rescuing Ireland, which had enjoyed an economic
boom in recent years driven in part by an ultra-low corporate
tax rate that attracted droves of businesses from abroad.
 Asked about Ireland's corporate tax rate, which several
euro zone partners see as unfair and want addressed, Weber
replied that it would be unwise to interfere in countries'
budgets.
 ""It would not be good to prescribe to Ireland in detail how
they manage their budget policy,"" he said.
 Weber also said in his speech that euro zone countries
should waste no time in cutting their budget deficits and
should not fear that this would endanger their recovery. For
more, see: [ID:nSLAOME6J2]
 ""First consolidation steps have already been introduced,""
Weber said. ""Now they must be continued: In countries whose
fiscal capacity has been questioned in the financial markets,
as well as in all other countries.""
 Weber said an EU agreement to cut deficits by at least 0.5
percent of gross domestic product should be the absolute
minimum requirement, and said this should not crimp growth.
 Weber is widely seen as a possible candidate to succeed
Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB head a year from now, but he dodged
questions on the matter, describing himself as a modest
technocrat.
 ""Let's not fantasise about the future. Let's stick to what
functions people have now,"" he said. ""Please judge me on the
function I have now. I'm president of the Bundesbank.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Worries that Ireland's fiscal
crisis could spread to other countries drove the euro down to a
two-month low beneath $1.33 on Wednesday, and traders said the
currency is probably in for more losses in the days ahead.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3284, its weakest since
September, and was last down 0.3 percent at $1.3325. It was
down 2.8 percent against the dollar since Monday and is down
4.4 percent so far in November.
 Investors worried that a euro-zone fiscal crisis centered
for now on Ireland could spread to other indebted countries,
notably Portugal and Spain. Ireland's four-year plan, announced
Wednesday, to cut its budget by 15 billion euros did little to
cheer the market.
 The driver is ""still Irish and euro-zone concerns, and we
will be talking about this well into 2011,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey. ""The market will continue to expect Portugal to apply
(for aid) and then it will come down to Spain.""
 Analysts are still looking for the euro to test $1.3232,
the 61.8 percent retracement of its August-to-November rally,
before targeting $1.3000.
 The euro also hit a two-month low of 110.33 yen but
recovered to 111.40 yen, up about 0.2 percent.
 Higher U.S. bond yields, which rose on data showing
improved U.S. labor market conditions, also kept demand for
euros muted, as did the move by Standard & Poor's to cut its
sovereign rating on Ireland.,
 ""The U.S. labor market has turned a corner, which should be
very positive for the U.S. economy in 2011,"" said Kathy Lien,
director of research at GFT in New York.
 KOREA TENSIONS, SPAIN IN FOCUS
 Analysts said euro-zone worries eclipsed concerns about
tensions between North and South Korea, which exchanged
artillery fire a day ago.
 Most believed the clash would not escalate, though a North
Korean statement on Wednesday said the South's action was
driving the peninsula to the brink of war.

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rallied on
Wednesday to a one-week high against the greenback and a
three-month high versus the euro, lifted by a slew of strong
U.S. economic data and fears of a spreading euro zone crisis.
 U.S. data showed new claims for unemployment benefits
dropped last week to their lowest level in more than two years,
while consumer spending rose in October and consumer sentiment
perked up this month to its highest level since June.
[ID:nN24211131]
 ""Employment is key to any sort of U.S. recovery being
sustainable. That was probably the highlight from a fundamental
data point of view,"" said Firas Askari, head of foreign
exchange trading at BMO Capital Markets.
 The improving economic picture boosted North American
equity markets as well as prices for oil and base metals, and
enhanced the bid for Canada's commodity-linked and risk-related
currency.
 Askari said the Canadian dollar was so far the day's
outperforming G10 currency, with most of the market's focus
back on Europe.
 Ireland's four-year plan to make 15 billion euros in
savings to bring down its record deficit left investors little
impressed. [ID:nLDE6AM25A]
 At 12:54 p.m. (1754 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0098 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.03 U.S. cents, up from
C$1.0231 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.74 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's
close. Earlier, it hit a high of C$1.0092 to the U.S. dollar,
or 99.09 U.S. cents, its best level since Nov. 16.
 Against the euro, the Canadian dollar reached C$1.3476, or
74.21 euro cents, its strongest level since Sept. 21.
 As well as the uncertainty over European debt levels, a
Bloomberg report that Russia's central bank has begun adding
small amounts of Canadian dollars to its international reserves
-- which has been expecting since last year -- was also
supportive. [ID:nN24236816]
 Askari said the next near-term support for the U.S. dollar
is the technical retracement level of C$1.0088.
 He noted liquidity was thin in a holiday-shortened week
ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving on Thursday, causing ""whippy
price action.""
 The Canadian dollar's strong performance however meant
corporate Canada was taking an opportunity to buy U.S. dollars
as it retests parity, which could stem some gains.
 But Askari said Canada's strong fundamentals, including
data on Tuesday that showed an unexpected jump in inflation and
healthy retail sales, pointed to more upside for the currency.
 ""I do think the Canadian dollar is going to continue to do
well ... and I wouldn't be surprised to see strong employment
numbers next week out of Canada.""
 Canadian government bond prices were lower across the
curve, tracking weak Treasury prices after the healthy U.S.
economic data undermined the safe-haven appeal of government
debt.
 The two-year government of Canada bond  was down
16 Canadian cents to yield 1.738 percent, while the 10-year
bond  shed 60 Canadian cents to yield 3.180
percent.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Stocks rebounded while the
euro cut losses on Wednesday after stronger-than-expected U.S.
jobs and consumer sentiment data eclipsed lingering concerns
about the European debt crisis.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries and gold dropped as investors
felt more comfortable taking on risk one day after rising
tensions in the Korea peninsula jolted global markets.
 The relief came after data showed claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits last week dropped to their lowest level
in more than two years. Consumer sentiment also rose to its
highest since June. For details, see [ID:nN24211131].
 ""Now you are getting good economic data, and you have a tug
of war going on here between an improving economy and
geopolitical events,"" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment
strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.
""The market is trying to determine how much weight to put on
each one of these events.""
 Fears that the Irish debt crisis could spread into weaker
members of the euro zone also inspired caution, with yield
spreads of Portuguese and Spanish debt widening to fresh
records even as Ireland unveiled a much-awaited austerity
plan.
 The 15 billion euro ($20 billion) plan for the next four
years includes deep spending cuts and tax increases while
retaining economic assumptions that many analysts deem
unrealistic. [ID:nLDE6AM25A]
 ""There are still a lot of questions surrounding the bailout
of Ireland and the budget; the government is in a limbo and we
do not know if it will go through,"" said Franz Wenzel,

 Major U.S. stock indexes gained more than 1 percent as
investors put Europe's worries on the back burner.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 135.32 points,

 The European stock market was also supported by data
showing German business sentiment rose in November to its
strongest since 1991.
 DOLLAR WEAKENS
 The U.S. dollar weakened along with other safe-haven
assets, but trading was thin on the eve of the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday when U.S. financial markets will be
closed.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the
performance of the greenback against a basket of major
currencies, was down 0.07 percent.
 The euro  was practically flat at $1.3361 as concerns
about the European debt crisis continued to weigh.
 U.S. Treasury prices fell as stocks took the appeal off the
government debt market. Prices of benchmark 10-year notes
 were down more than one point, sending the yield up
to 2.9047 percent.
 Gold prices  fell $3.15 to $1,373.60 an ounce. U.S.
crude oil prices  rose $2.42, or nearly 3 percent, to

(Removes superfluous word ""in"", 1st paragraph)
 BRASILIA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Brazil's President-elect
Dilma Rousseff on Wednesday confirmed Guido Mantega would stay
on as finance minister and Alexandre Tombini would take over as
central bank president, a sign the new government is unlikely
to stray far from current economic policy.
 Mantega's nomination could fuel fears of a moderate
expansion in fiscal spending next year, while the appointment
of a central bank veteran to its highest ranking job is likely
to reassure investors worried that monetary policy could become
looser under Rousseff.
 ""The president-elect determined that the new team assures
continuity of the successful economic policy of President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva's government -- based on the
inflation-targeting regime, floating currency and fiscal
responsibility,"" Rousseff's press office said in a statement.
 Miriam Belchior, who currently oversees the government's
flagship infrastructure investment program, will take over the
planning ministry, the press release said.
 The nomination of the three ministers had been expected but
Tombini's appointment still has to be approved by Congress. See
[ID:nN23137506].
 Mantega, who took over the finance ministry in 2006 after
Antonio Palocci resigned over a corruption scandal, has
presided over one of Brazil's most impressive economic booms in
recent years but has also overseen a huge increase in
spending.

 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 3
percent on Wednesday as data that suggested economic recovery
is improving and pre-Thanksgiving holiday short covering helped
oil post its biggest percentage gain in four months.
 U.S. initial jobless benefits claims fell to their lowest

 While U.S. crude inventories rose last week against

 U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose 1.03 million barrels to
358.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 19 as crude imports
jumped by more than a million barrels per day, the U.S. Energy
Information Administration said on Wednesday. [EIA/S]
 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected crude stocks to
fall 2.1 million barrels, but the jump reported by the EIA was
much less than the American Petroleum Institute's report late

 Gasoline stocks rose 1.91 million barrels, the EIA said,

 In the face of the less than bullish inventory data, U.S.
refined products futures also surged on Wednesday, getting a
boost from news of a Texas refinery fire also helping keep
crude oil's advance fueled.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Gold is unlikely to see a repeat
of its spring rally as Europe plunges once more into financial
crisis, because a stronger dollar is creating too great a
deterrent for investors seeking an alternative to the euro.
 The euro zone has just agreed to a second multi-billion euro
sovereign bailout as Ireland struggles to contain a sell-off of
its debt that threatens its ability to finance itself and repair
the damage to its banking system from an imploding property
market.
 Earlier this year in the weeks that followed the bailout of
Greece, gold hit successive record peaks as it attracted a wave
of demand that materialised in rising holdings of bullion in
physically backed exchange-traded funds and growing open
interest in gold futures.
 Now investors again are fretting that the latest bailout
will not stop a market exodus that could spread to other
indebted euro zone nations such as Portugal or Spain.
 But this time around, the metal has gained only 1.4 percent
so far this month versus 5.7 percent in April, when the extent
of Greece's problems became apparent. Its last record high of
$1,424.10 an ounce was in early November before the Ireland
crisis surfaced.
 ""If (gold) is the ultimate beneficiary of the sovereign debt
crisis, you'd have expected it to be much stronger than it
actually is. You'd have expected it to have spiked up by as much
as bond (yields) have spiked down,"" said Charles Morris, head of
absolute return at HSBC Global Asset Management.
 
 RELATIONSHIP CHANGE
 But the relationship between gold and the dollar is
different now from it was in April and May.
 In the current market, gold has maintained its traditional
inverse relationship to the dollar, although their negative
correlation has more than halved since October to reach its
lowest level in two months.
 Gold this month is up against a serious headwind in the
strength of the dollar.
 By contrast, the Greek crisis turned that relationship on
its head as investors scrambled out of the single European
currency and into any safe-haven assets they could find.
 It shifted in May to one of almost perfect symmetry, with
gold and the dollar moving in tandem.
 This is unlikely to be the case this time around, especially
after a nearly $1 trillion rescue fund was put in place in May
as a lifeline to struggling economies, which has removed some of
the uncertainty for euro investors.
 ""I'm not saying gold will directly come off in tandem with
the stronger dollar, but I just don't see the potential for it
to move much higher,"" said Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank senior manager.
 Even pressure coming from heightened tensions between North
and South Korea this week still might not be enough to unshackle
dollar-denominated gold from the U.S. currency.
 ""There are strong concerns over Europe, and it's really
those concerns that are pushing the dollar higher. You have two
offsetting factors: a stronger dollar, which is not positive,
but concerns over debt, which is positive,"" said Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Widmer.
 Gold is battling not just the dollar, which is at two-month
highs against a basket of currencies, but also rising U.S.
Treasury yields, which are raising the opportunity cost of
holding non-yielding gold. It also faces a
period of seasonally low liquidity and volatility as money
managers square their books ahead of the end of the year.
 The Federal Reserve's plan to pump over half a trillion
dollars into the U.S. economy over the coming six months or so
battered the dollar from late August until early November,
prompting speculators to take out their most bearish bet against
the U.S. currency in over two years, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
 With the euro back under the kybosh, there is a risk this
position could reverse completely, buoying the dollar and
similarly snuffing out any potential rally in gold on the back
of the euro zone debt crisis, Saxo Bank's Hansen said.
 ""The accumulated short in the dollar has started to decrease
... that will be reduced further. It's still in negative numbers
so there are still dollar (sellers) out there that are hurting,""
he said.

 * U.S. weekly jobless claims stoke some optimism
 * Euro hits two-month low vs dollar and yen
 * Focus on debt worries; Korea tensions
 * Dollar index touches two-month high
 (Recasts, updates prices, adds detail)
 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The euro climbed from a
two-month low against the dollar on Wednesday after losing over
2 percent in the last three sessions as investors considered
the move overdone in thin trade in a holiday shortened week.
 Part of the gain, which left the euro little changed
against the dollar, was attributed to a U.S. report signaling
improvement in the labor market. Investors took that as a
positive further sign of recovery in the world's biggest
economy, raising risk tolerance.
 Gains were muted by fears the euro zone fiscal crisis,
currently centered on Ireland, could spread to other peripheral
euro zone countries. Ireland's four-year plan to make 15
billion euros in savings to bring down its record deficit left
investors little impressed.
 Peripheral euro-zone government bond yield spreads over
Germany have widened.
 A North Korean statement after Tuesday's artillery clash
that the South's action was driving the peninsula to the brink
of war earlier prompted investors to seek relatively
safer-haven currencies.
 Adding to the euro's woes was a cut by Standard and Poor's
of its sovereign rating on Ireland., and a poor response to the
sale of new 10-year bonds by Germany..
 These factors earlier lifted the dollar to a two-month high
against a currency basket.
 The driver is ""still Irish and euro zone concerns and we
will be talking about this well into 2011,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey. ""The market will continue to expect Portugal to apply
(for aid) and then it will come down to Spain.""
 EURO ADVANCE
 Some traders said if investors were starting to also shun
Bunds -- considered a safe-haven asset -- it was hard to see
how the euro would stabilise in the near term despite
Wednesday's gains.
The euro was little changed at $1.3365, having hit a
two-month low of $1.3284 and bouncing off its 100-day moving
average -- currently around $1.3297 -- for the first time since
early September.
 ""We're going to see liquidity dry up and are already at 50
percent of normal volume which could explain some of the
jittery market conditions,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior
currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 The euro rally began in New York after the government
report showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits dipped
more than expected last week..
 ""The U.S. labor market has turned a corner which should be
very positive for the U.S. economy in 2011,"" said Kathy Lien,
director of research at GFT in New York.
 While the euro is down 6.6 percent against the dollar year
to date, the single currency is only down 1 percent since April
10, the day before euro zone finance ministers approved a 30
billion euro emergency aid mechanism for Greece, the nation
where the current bout of fiscal concerns began. 
 Analysts are still looking for the euro to test $1.3232,
the 61.8 percent retracement of its August-November rally,
before targeting $1.3000.
 KOREA TENSIONS
 The dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 79.662, having hit
a high of 79.995, its strongest in two monthstensions between
North and South Korea, which most believed would not escalate
into something more serious.
 The dollar fell 1.2 percent against the South Korean won,
erasing some of the 3.2 percent advance on Tuesday..

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro rebounded
on Wednesday after stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs and
consumer sentiment data eclipsed lingering concerns about the
European debt crisis.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries and gold dropped as investors
felt more comfortable taking on risk one day after rising
tensions in the Korea peninsula jolted global markets.
 The relief came after data showed claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits last week dropped to their lowest level
in more than two years. Consumer sentiment also rose to its
highest since June. For details, see [ID:nN24211131].
 ""Now you are getting good economic data, and you have a tug
of war going on here between an improving economy and
geopolitical events,"" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment
strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.
""The market is trying to determine how much weight to put on
each one of these events.""
 Fears that the Irish debt crisis could spread into weaker
members of the euro zone also inspired caution, with yield
spreads of Portuguese and Spanish debt widening to fresh
records even as Ireland unveiled a much-awaited austerity
plan.
 The 15 billion euro ($20 billion) plan for the next four
years includes deep spending cuts and tax increases while
retaining economic assumptions that many analysts deem
unrealistic. [ID:nLDE6AM25A]
 ""There are still a lot of questions surrounding the bailout
of Ireland and the budget; the government is in a limbo and we
do not know if it will go through,"" said Franz Wenzel,
strategist with AXA Investment Managers in Paris.
 Major U.S. stock indexes gained more than 1 percent as
investors put Europe's worries on the back burner.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 135.89 points,
or 1.23 percent, to 11,172.26, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> gained 15.36 points, or 1.30 percent, to 1,196.09.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 46.64 points, or 1.87

percent, while Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top

 DOLLAR WEAKENS
 The U.S. dollar weakened along with other safe-haven
assets. The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the
performance of the greenback against a basket of major
currencies, was down 0.19 percent.
 Still, the euro  edged up a modest 0.08 percent to
$1.3382 as concerns about the European debt crisis continued to
weigh.
 Trading was also thin on the eve of the U.S. Thanksgiving
holiday when U.S. financial markets will be closed.
 U.S. Treasury prices fell as stocks took the appeal off the
government debt market. Prices of benchmark 10-year notes
 were down 24/32, sending the yield up to 2.8679
percent.
 Gold prices  fell $2.25 to $1,374.50 an ounce. U.S.
crude oil prices  rose $1.83 to $83.08 per barrel as
larger-than-expected falls in U.S. stockpiles provided support

 * Still dragging feet on foreign debt payments, dividends
 By Marc Frank
 HAVANA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - With hurricane season almost
over and Cuba having passed its second year in a row without a
major storm, creditors are hoping the communist country will be
in better financial shape to pay its bills.
 Diplomatic and business sources said this week the Cuban
government may have a cash reserve that it set aside in case of
hurricanes and could now use at least part of it to cut debt or
reopen frozen bank accounts.
 ""We had been building up reserves since 2009. Hurricanes
could have cost us billions this year,"" a local economist said.
 This year, despite an unusually active Atlantic hurricane
season, Cuba was struck only glancing blows by three storms
that did little damage.
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs June through
November, and there are no late season storms in sight.
 ""President Raul Castro is a military man. I'm sure he has
been putting aside what he can and expecting the worst,"" a
Western diplomat said.
 ""So perhaps now they are breathing a little easier and will
pay some of our companies what they owe them. At least the
situation will not get worse,"" the diplomat said.
 Cuba's economy was battered when two devastating hurricanes
struck in 2008, causing what the government said was $10
billion in damage, and then the global financial crisis hit the
island hard.
 Those events combined with poor planning and inefficiency
within the Cuban system left the country without enough cash to
pay its bills and few places to turn for help.
 Cuba is under a strict U.S. trade embargo and excluded from
most international lending organizations that could help in a
pinch, while many creditors have tired of its repeated
rescheduling of debt.
 UNPAID DEBTS, FROZEN BANK ACCOUNTS
 Many debts to governments and business were restructured or
went unpaid, foreign company bank accounts frozen, dividends
owed joint venture partners postponed and imports drastically
reduced beginning in 2009.
 Western diplomats and businessmen said Cuba was gradually
unblocking the funds, but at the same time still dragging its
feet on foreign debt payments and dividends owed its foreign
partners operating in the country.
 Cuba last reported its foreign debt at $17.8 billion in
2007. Most analysts agree it is now well over $20 billion -- or
close to 50 percent of the gross domestic product and some 25
percent more than annual export revenues.
 Castro has pounded away at the need for Cuba to get its
economic house in order and pay its bills since taking over
from his brother Fidel Castro in 2008.
 The country's growing debt service payments are a key
reason for Castro's push to overhaul Cuba's Soviet-Style
economy, according to government insiders.
 The reforms, to be discussed at a Communist Party congress
in April, include drastic budget cuts and layoffs and ending
most state subsidies.
 They would also grant state-run companies more autonomy and
give an opening to small private businesses and foreign
investment, cooperatives and other ""non-state"" forms of running
enterprises.
 ""Work with the maximum rigor to increase the country's
credibility in international economic relations through
strictly fulfilling contracted obligations,"" a discussion
document for the congress states, while emphasizing the need to
increase exports and cut imports.
 Castro has reportedly established a blue-ribbon commission
to figure out Cuba's foreign debt troubles.
 ""Short, medium and long term debt should be reprogrammed as
quickly as possible,"" and this time around ""new payment
schedules met,"" the congress document states.
 For that, more than one diplomat said, the country should
start by returning to the negotiating table with the Paris Club
of creditor nations. Negotiations broken off in 2001.

in his five-month-old Toyota for a $100,000 Porsche Cayenne.
 ""Every couple of months you have to change your car,"" said
Atta, a general manager at a furniture trading company in Dubai.
 ""I want to buy this one because it's a new design and, of
course, I want to impress girls,"" he said, trying to get rid of
his Toyota <7203.T> FJ Cruiser sport utility vehicle (SUV).
 The global financial crisis hit the car market hard in
Dubai, whose expatriates were once famous for blowing their
tax-free pay on luxury cars, designer clothes and large villas.
 With multi-billion dollar real estate projects shelved, talk
spread that expatriates who had lost jobs and defaulted on loans
were abandoning their cars at the airport and flying home.
 As Dubai begins to recover, gas-guzzling four-wheel drives
once more choke its 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road. Ferraris and
Maseratis again line the entrance to the Mall of Emirates.
 ""People are buying expensive cars again because they want
new options and they want to stand out,"" said Abdallah Muftah,
26, who owns four luxury cars. ""I might buy another one this
year,"" he said, standing outside a showroom.
 Home to just five million people, the United Arab Emirates
is the world's fourth-largest market for Rolls-Royce .
The firm said sales more than doubled in the first nine months.
 UAE new car sales could climb to 210,000 units this year and
240,000 in 2011, according to IHS Global Insight, up from
estimated 180,000 last year but still short of 324,000 in 2008.
 While the growth is slower than it was in the oil boom
years, when the UAE elite was flush with petrodollars and access
to credit was easy, the upturn suggests confidence is returning
to the second-biggest Arab economy.
 ""In 2010, the customers' confidence started coming back,""
said Michel Ayat, general manager at Dubai-based Arabian
Automobiles, one of the UAE's biggest dealerships.
 Passenger car sales are estimated to have risen 7 percent in
the first nine months from a year ago, Ayat said. From January
to August, some 146,000 cars were sold, a 6.6 percent increase.
 That compares well to Europe, where car sales fell for a
sixth straight month in September as demand suffered from the
end of scrappage schemes and uneven recovery. [ID:nLDE69D2E7]
 ""People are starting to adjust their lifestyles again, and
believe the situation has bottomed out,"" said Anthony Silver,
who recently bought a used car in Dubai.
 
 PRICIER PETROL, TIGHTER CREDIT
 Plans to phase out fuel subsidies in the UAE, the world's
No. 3 oil exporter, may trim demand for powerful cars, but a 26
percent jump in petrol prices this year has yet to hit sales.
 ""Fuel price remains still way below EU and U.S, levels,""
said Stephanie Vigier, senior market analyst at IHS Global
Insight in Paris.
 But it is not just the market for luxury cars that is
recovering. Japanese cars account for over 70 percent of the UAE
car market and their sales are outpacing the overall growth
rate, dealers said. At a Nissan <7201.T> showroom in Dubai, 10
to 15 clients pick up new cars every day, a sales manager said.
 Back in 2008, when record oil prices helped fuel ambitious
projects such as palm-shaped residential islands in Dubai, UAE
car sales booked a 22 percent rise after a 37 percent jump in
the previous year, driven by easily accessible loans.
 Banks now ask that borrowers have a monthly salary of at
least 5,000 dirhams ($1,362), up from 3,000 dirhams before the
global crisis, Vigier said, a rule that is slowing car sales.
 Some UAE banks have eased loan criteria since March, but
often only when a large downpayment of the car value is made.
Some banks have even doubled the maximum car finance credit
limit, so borrowers can afford more expensive cars.
 ""Stricter banking rules and higher interest rates will curb
new car sales,"" Vigier said. ""We think that it will be difficult
to come back to the 2008 level as the government has learnt the
lesson and will not open widely credits and car loans.""

 * Dubai's new airport might provide cushion

(Amends attribution to Dubai in paragraph 23)
 By Martina Fuchs
 DUBAI, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Dhows laden with goods bound for
Iran line Dubai's creek. Workmen lift boxes of cheap wares, made
in China, onto the creaking wooden vessels ready to make the
short journey across the Gulf to the Islamic Republic.
 The buzz of activity belies growing evidence that this
traditional trade between Dubai and Iran is suffocating under
the ever-tightening grip of sanctions, and businesses fear it
could soon become a thing of the past.
 The United Arab Emirates has signalled it will rein back its
role as a trading and financial lifeline for Iran after the U.N.
Security Council imposed a fourth round of sanctions on Iran in
June, over accusations it is developing a nuclear bomb.
 The measures could spell disaster for many of the Iranian
banks and thousands of Iranian businesses who deal with Dubai,
which built its reputation on its role as the re-export hub for
the Gulf.
 ""There is a severe impact on trade between the UAE and Iran
due to the current sanctions, particularly on the banking
sector,"" said Morteza Masoumzadeh, vice president of the Iranian
Business Council and managing director of Jumbo Line shipping
agency.
 ""Due to the recent sanctions, the Iranian banks' operations
have come almost to a standstill. They have lost their
businesses,"" he told Reuters in his office on the 14th floor of
a building that overlooks Dubai's busy saltwater creek.
 In June, the UAE central bank told financial institutions to
freeze accounts belonging to dozens of firms targeted by U.N.
sanctions, also blacklisting 40 entities and one individual.
 In November, businessmen and traders met the deputy ruler of
Dubai to complain of obstacles they face doing business with
Iran due to the banking restrictions. [ID:nLDE6A72C7]
 Masoumzadeh said around 8,000 Iranian-owned businesses
remained in Dubai after some 400 were forced to close because of
the sanctions and the financial crisis.
 A sharp decline in Iranian trade could hit Dubai's economy,
still dusting itself off after last year's debt crisis hit
confidence in the emirate that is home to the world's tallest
tower and three man-made palm islands visible from space.
 ""The anecdotal evidence of a sharp decline in the Iran-bound
re-export business is accumulating, although the statistical
evidence is still lacking,"" said David Butter, Middle East and
North Africa director at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
 ""However, the new measures are likely to bite in the second
half of this year. The effects on Dubai's GDP will be
significant, but should not be overstated.""
 In July, Iran still ranked as the second largest re-export
destination for the UAE -- topped only by India -- with the
re-export trade worth a total 2.2 billion dirhams ($599 million)
in that month alone, UAE customs data showed.
 Butter said whatever the decline in trading relations with
Iran, Dubai's trade with other countries appears to be picking
up, potentially making up for any losses.
 
 LONG HISTORY
 Trade between Iran and Dubai is long established.
 The Strait of Hormuz, through which around 40 percent of the
world's oil supplies pass, separates the UAE from Iran by only
54 kilometres at its narrowest point.
 Persian traders migrated from towns in southern Iran in the
early 20th century and settled along Dubai's creek, where today
the wooden ships dock and boatmen unload spices, clothes and
other goods from India, East Africa and Iran.
 Wealthy Persian merchants built windtower houses along the
creek that still cluster in Dubai's Bastakia area.
 Dubai's business with Iran flourished as other countries
grew increasingly wary, in recent years, of flouting sanctions.
 Exchange traders in the UAE expect that sending money to and
from Iran will become increasingly difficult, even though there
is no official ban on dealing with Iran's rial currency.
 ""We expect a trade drop, so eventually it will affect all
other businesses related to the same circle, including money
transfers,"" Mohamed al-Ansari, chairman and managing director of
Abu Dhabi-based Al Ansari Exchange, said.
 ""The financial sector and banks take extra caution not to be
involved, especially when it's routed transactions which have to
go through Europe or the United States. They try to be away from
these type of transactions.""
 Ansari said money transactions with Iran accounted for less
than 5 percent of his business, but authorities had increased
inspections, although it was not always easy to determine the
nature of transactions in Dubai.
 Dubai-based security analyst Theodore Karasik said moves by
the UAE to implement sanctions would certainly affect trade.
 ""A lot of surveillance is done and the authorities are
watching very closely, money laundering has been reduced very
sharply. There is more supervision in terms of money,"" he said.
 ""Some people have already made a move to Turkey and
Malaysia, but not in a considerable number. But I'm sure if the
situation continues as such, in the very near future there will
be a major shift.""
 Dubai shocked global markets when Dubai World [DBWLD.UL], a
state-owned conglomerate, said last November it would delay its
repayment in $26 billion of debt.
 Since then, Dubai has been hammering out deals with
creditors and getting its projects back on track.
 Dubai's new $10.9 billion Maktoum International Airport --
part of Dubai World Central's so-called ""aerotropolis"" complex
-- could cushion the impact of losing Iranian trade, Butter said.
 ""India, Saudi Arabia and Iraq are all substantial other
destinations, and with the development of Maktoum International
Airport, Dubai can develop other alternatives further afield,""
he said.

 * Says politicians must prevail over markets
 * Govt official: will not impose demands on corporate tax

(Adds analyst, German official on Irish tax)
 By Stephen Brown
 BERLIN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said on Wednesday European politicians needed the courage to
make private investors share in the risk of future debt crises
in the euro zone and show financial markets who is in charge.
 ""Have politicians got the courage to make those who earn
money share in the risk as well? Or is dealing in government
debt the only business in the world economy that involves no
risk?"" Merkel said in a speech to the German parliament.
 ""This is about the primacy of politics, this is about the
limits of the markets,"" said the chancellor, acknowledging that
her insistence on this issue was making markets nervous.
 The centre-right German leader is blamed by some in Europe
for provoking the recent Irish debt sell-off by saying private
euro-zone bondholders must be made to share the risk of future
sovereign debt crises via a permanent euro crisis mechanism.
 She sparked fresh selling of the euro on Tuesday by saying
it was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation.
 This prompted one European Central Bank policymaker, Ewald
Nowotny, to voice irritation at Merkel for not ""differentiating
between the euro as a currency and the problems of individual
(eurozone) states"".
 The euro hit a two-month low against the dollar on Wednesday
on renewed concerns about Ireland's debt plans.
 An Irish downgrade by Standard and Poor's pushed the Irish
bond spread against safe-haven German debt even higher while the
premium which investors demand for holding debt in Portugal and
Spain debt hit new highs as contagion fears grew.
 
 INVESTORS TO FACE HAIRCUTS
 Merkel has repeatedly said private investors must be
involved in a new euro zone crisis mechanism for the euro zone
to take effect from mid-2013, when the current mechanism lapses.
 A German government paper seen by Reuters, which Berlin
wants to serve as the basis for discussion in Brussels, proposed
that private investors should face ""haircuts"" or other debt
payment restructuring measures.
 Berlin wants creditors like banks and financial investors to
be drawn in by attaching collective action clauses (CACs) to all
newly issued euro zone bonds from as early as 2011 in order to
ensure a smooth transition to 2013.
 The proposal will be discussed by EU leaders in mid-December
but some leaders may be concerned that introducing such clauses
so soon could unnerve bond markets even further.
 But Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING Financial
Markets, said he believed ""markets are getting used to the idea
that the private sector also has to pay part of the bill and
right now it's simply a matter of giving facts"".
 The new mechanism would succeed the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), a safety net created after Greece's
debt crisis rocked the euro zone earlier this year. Merkel said
she had a ""positive"" view on Ireland taking up this mechanism.
 She faced loud criticism for delaying an aid package for
Greece while insisting on deeper austerity measures, finally
agreeing to it days before signing up to the much bigger EFSF.
 Merkel has said repeatedly that ""the best European"" is not
necessary the one who helps other member countries first, but
who takes action to strengthen the euro longer-term.
 
 IRISH TAX LOBBY GROWS
 Support grew in Germany's ruling coalition for a possible
link between aid for Ireland and a cut in its low corporate tax
rate. The lowest in the European Union at 12.5 percent, it has
been a magnet for foreign investment in Ireland.
 Some Germany politicians -- now echoed by others in Europe
-- say Ireland should demonstrate that it is taking all possible
fiscal measures to cut its deficit and boost earnings, including
by scrapping a tax advantage over other EU member states.
 ""Ireland cannot remain a tax oasis,"" said the state finance
minister of Bavaria, Georg Fahrenschon from Merkel's Christian
Social Union allies.
 Peter Altmaier, senior parliamentarian in Merkel's Christian
Democratic Union, said taxes were a matter for individual states
but these ""should as far as possible avoid dumping measures"".
 One German government official, who asked not to be named,
said Berlin would not be giving a recommendation on the tax,
preferring that Dublin decide its own restructuring plans.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month low
against the dollar on Wednesday, extending its losses on
uncertainty over Ireland's plans to tackle its debt problems and
fears the crisis could spread to other peripheral euro zone
countries.
 Peripheral government bond yield spreads over Germany
widened, and a North Korean statement after Tuesday's artillery
clash that the South's action was driving the peninsula to the
brink of war prompted investors to seek safe-haven currencies.
 These factors lifted the dollar to a two-month high against
a currency basket, while the problems in the euro zone's
periphery meant the euro quickly shrugged off a record high
German Ifo business climate index for November.
 Uncertainties remained over whether the crisis in Ireland
would be resolved, as the teetering government prepared to
release a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros as a condition
of an EU/IMF bailout. Standard and Poor's cut
its sovereign rating on Ireland overnight.
 At the same time, worries intensified that the crisis could
spread to Portugal or even Spain. Not helping the euro's cause
was a poor response to the sale of new 10-year bonds by Germany.
. Some traders said if investors were starting to shun Bunds as
well--considered a safe-haven asset--it was hard to see how the
euro would stabilise in the near term.
 ""The Ifo survey was very strong but it did nothing to lift
the euro, and the trend is clearly bearish into year-end,"" said
Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""Ireland will publish a four-year plan, but we don't know
what will happen to the government afterwards with new elections
expected in January"".
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3343, having hit a
two-month low of $1.3284 and broken below its 100-day moving
average -- currently around $1.3297 -- for the first time since
early September. It fell nearly 2 percent on Tuesday.
 The euro may test $1.3232, the 61.8 percent retracement of
its August-November rally, before targeting $1.3000.
 
 DOLLAR GAINS
 The euro also fell to a two-month low against the yen and
lost ground against the Swiss franc, with both currencies
benefiting along with the dollar from investors seeking safe
haven-assets.
 ""The euro is very vulnerable due to the Irish crisis and
worries about whether Portugal will be next in line. These are
not things that will be solved today or tomorrow,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The dollar index was up 0.08 percent at 79.739, having hit a
high of 79.995, its strongest in two months.
 Analysts said the euro zone worries eclipsed concerns
about tensions between North and South Korea, which most
believed would not escalate into something more serious.
 The fact that other perceived higher-risk currencies such as
the Australian and New Zealand dollar rose on the day against
the U.S. dollar supported this view.
 ""The fact that the Australian dollar is still up means this
is predominantly a story of euro zone-specific worries weighing
on euro crosses,"" Unicredit's Maier said.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.5 percent from late U.S.
levels at $0.9770, rebounding from a four-week low of $0.9708 on
buying by sovereign names.

(Adds TPSA spokesman declining to comment; updates shares)
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - GN Store Nord has asked a
Dutch court to enforce a ruling against Polish telecoms group
TPSA, in a bid to collect 2.9 billion Danish crowns ($521
million) awarded to its DPTG unit.
 Danish hearing aid and headset maker GN Store Nord said on
Wednesday its DPTG unit had won a ""prejudgment attachment"" which
effectively froze the assets of TPSA Finance BV, TPSA's Dutch
unit. 
 The Dutch proceedings are a new episode in a nine-year legal
dispute between GN Store Nord and TPSA, controlled by France
Telecom, over income from a fibre-optic network built in Poland
by DPTG.
 ""We are looking into the matter and do not comment at this
stage,"" TPSA spokesman Wojciech Jabczynski said on Wednesday.
 GN Store Nord said the Dutch proceedings were one of several
steps its DPTG unit would take to collect the 2.9 billion crowns
awarded to it in September by arbitrators.
 The award covered income from the fibre-optic network from
1994 to mid-2004. GN Store Nord said its share of that award was
about 2.1 billion crowns. GN has said it will file a second
claim for more than 1 billion crowns against TPSA, covering the
period from mid-2004 to 2009.
 The company, which had said previously it would pursue
enforcement proceedings in a Polish court, said TPSA had still
not paid the money owed to DPTG under the Vienna arbitration
tribunal's award.
 Although GN Store Nord has not received any money from TPSA,
it booked a one-off gain of 2.1 billion crowns in its
third-quarter accounts from the lawsuit.
 In October, TPSA reported a third-quarter loss, hit by
provisions for GN Store Nord's claims, though TPSA has also
called the award ""disproportionate"" and said it would use all
possible legal means to reduce it.
GN Store Nord shares were up 3 percent and TPSA shares were
up 0.6 percent at 1157 GMT.

(Adds comment on regional coordination, 12th paragraph)	
 By Jason Szep and Orathai Sriring	
 BANGKOK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank is
prepared to use more capital control measures, including a
Tobin-style tax on international transactions, but sees no
need to impose them now, the central bank chief said on
Wednesday.	
 He said inflation was not a concern at the moment,
reinforcing expectations the central bank would keep its
trend-setting one-day repurchase rate unchanged at 1.75
percent at next Wednesday's policy-setting meeting.	
 In his first interview with foreign news organisations
since taking the helm of the central bank on Oct. 1, Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said the Thai economy faces ""lots of
uncertainties"" -- from global economic troubles to a national
Thai election expected next year.	
 ""The best way for us is to have a variety of policy tools
and then be able to use a mixture of them in a good
proportion, hopefully at good timing,"" said the 58-year-old
former president of Thailand's No. 3 bank, Kasikornbank
.	
 Asked whether the central bank was prepared to impose a
one-time inflow tax or a Tobin tax, he said: ""In our toolkit,
this is one component. To use it or not is another matter.""	
 Nobel prize-winning U.S. economist James Tobin first
proposed a small levy on currency trading in 1972 to penalise
short-term speculation after the United States abandoned the
gold standard.	
 The idea is gaining steam in Asia. South Korean Finance
Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun said on Oct. 19 his country was also
studying a Tobin-style tax as easy-money policies in the
developed world swamp emerging-market economies from Thailand
to Brazil with capital searching for higher returns.	
 That's driving up currencies and complicating economic
policy. The Thai baht is up more than 11 percent this
year at a 13-year high against the dollar, while Thailand's
stock market has surged more than 40 percent as
foreign investors pile into Southeast Asia.	
 
 
 TRIGGER FOR MORE CONTROLS?	
 Prasarn acknowledged Thailand's interest rates remained
low compared with the country's Asian neighbours, especially
given projections that growth will reach as much as 8 percent
this year.	
 But he said global capital flows presented a ""dilemma"".
This year alone has seen $30 billion in capital inflows into
the country, he said, including $18 billion of portfolio flows.
""The more you increase the rate the more you
attract this capital flow,"" he said. ""It is like giving our
benefits to these undeserved investors. Why do you want to do
that?""	
 He said the Bank of Thailand is in regular contact with
other regional central banks and ""there could be cooperation""
in monetary policies if conditions called for it.
He said imposing a Tobin-style tax would be
relatively easy, requiring just an emergency decree by the
Ministry of Finance with Cabinet approval, rather than
overhauling tax laws.	
 But Thailand is treading carefully after tough capital
controls in late 2006 triggered a record one-day selloff in
the stock market. Those have since been lifted.	
 He described as a ""problem"" the U.S. Federal Reserve's
decision this month to embark on another round of
""quantitative easing"", buying an extra $600 billion of
government bonds with freshly printed money. The U.S. measure
has deepened fears of heavy capital flows battering emerging
Asia.	
 In October, Thailand imposed a 15 percent withholding tax
on interest and capital gains earned by foreign investors on
Thai debt to try to stem inflows. More recently the central
bank imposed a borrowing limit of 90 percent of the purchase
price on new condominiums to prevent the market from
overheating.	
 Prasarn said a possible trigger for further controls could
be volatility in the baht on trade-weighted terms, but he said
its nominal effective exchange rate was ""still manageable"".	
 ""That's probably the working indicator for us,"" he said of
the nominal effective exchange rate, which measures the baht's
value against a basket of its trading partners' currencies
and, as Prasarn puts it, is better measure than the
baht/dollar rate.	
 Many exporters have expressed concern that the strong baht
would hurt revenues. But Prasarn said next year's projected
11-14 percent export growth was ""still healthy.""	
 He noted 70 percent of Thailand's exports go to countries
outside the United States, Japan and the euro zone that have
exchange rates that are also rising against the U.S. dollar.	
 Asked if inflation was a concern, he said: ""not
immediately. But down the road some time next year there will
be some.""	
 Even those pressures are unlikely to be strong enough to
push core inflation beyond a target range of 0.5-3.0 percent
next year, he said, unless the government fails to extend
subsidies on public transport and some utilities. That is
considered unlikely.	
 Still, the soft-spoken Prasarn, who has an engineering
degree from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok and a Master
of Business Administration as well as a doctorate in business
administration from Harvard University, sounded a note of
caution.	
 ""When you have low interest rates for a long time and you
also have a huge amount of capital available, it can lead to
problems of an asset price bubble,"" he said. ""We have sent
that signal. That's an indication of what we want to tell the
public.""

make private investors share in the risk of future debt crises
in the euro zone and show financial markets who is in charge.
 ""Have politicians got the courage to make those who earn
money share in the risk as well? Or is dealing in government
debt the only business in the world economy that involves no
risk?"" Merkel said in a speech to the German parliament.
 ""This is about the primacy of politics, this is about the
limits of the markets,"" said the chancellor, acknowledging that
her insistence on this issue was making markets ""nervous"".
 The centre-right German leader is blamed by some in Europe
for provoking the recent Irish debt sell-off by saying private
euro-zone bondholders must be made to share the risk of future
sovereign debt crises via a permanent euro crisis mechanism.
 She sparked fresh selling of the euro on Tuesday by saying
it was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation. [ID:nBAT005787]
 This prompted one European Central Bank policymaker, Ewald
Nowotny, to voice irritation at Merkel for not ""differentiating
between the euro as a currency and the problems of individual
(eurozone) states"". [ID:nVIE003584]
 Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble have repeated
in recent weeks that private investors must be involved in a new
crisis mechanism for the euro zone to take effect from mid-2013,
when the current mechanism lapses.
 A German government paper seen by Reuters, which Berlin
wants to serve as the basis for discussion in Brussels, said
private investors should face ""haircuts"" or other debt payment
restructuring measures.
 Private-sector creditors like banks and financial investors
should be drawn in by attaching collective action clauses (CACs)
to all newly-issued euro zone bonds, said the paper.
 The new mechanism would succeed the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), a safety net created after Greece's
debt crisis rocked the euro zone earlier this year. Merkel said
she had a ""positive"" view on Ireland taking up this mechanism.
 She faced loud criticism for delaying an aid package for
Greece while insisting on deeper austerity measures, finally
agreeing to it days before signing up to the much bigger EFSF.
 Merkel has said repeatedly that the ""the best European"" is
not necessary the one who helps other member countries first,
but who takes action to strengthen the euro longer-term.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2010 05:48AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-UK Q3 GDP unrevised; spending picture clouds outlook," (Adds comment, detail)
 LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew 0.8
percent in the third quarter, data confirmed on Wednesday,
boosted by net trade outflows, but weakness in household and
government spending highlighted risks ahead.
 The Office for National Statistics said its second estimate
of growth between July and September also confirmed the economy
expanded by 2.8 percent compared with a year ago, in line with
analysts' forecasts.
 Net trade contributed 0.4 percentage points to growth, the
most since the end of 2008, as exports grew faster than imports.
 While the figures may reassure policymakers that a period of
depreciation of the pound is helping to rebalance the economy,
the recovery still faces headwinds from deep government spending
cuts that will start to bite from next year.
 ""There's a bit of a disappointment with consumption, which
may be a worrying prelude of what is to come,"" said Brian
Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale.
 New figures on expenditure showed household spending growth
slowed to 0.3 percent from 0.7 percent in the second quarter,
while government spending grew by just 0.4 percent, less than
half the pace of the second quarter.
 But markets took the data in their stride as it did not
alter the view that the Bank of England will keep interest rates
at a record low of 0.5 percent for many months to come to shore
up the recovery.
 The government plans to slash spending by around 81 billion
pounds over the next four years, with the loss of almost half a
million public sector jobs. Welfare payments are also set to
fall, while a rise in value added tax from January will put
further pressure on household finances.
 Analysts said they doubted the private sector would be able
to make up the shortfall left by public spending cuts, after
separate figures on Wednesday showed business investment fell
0.2 percent -- the first decline in almost a year.
 It is also uncertain how well export demand will hold up,
given the financial turmoil in parts of Europe, which is
Britain's biggest trading partner.
 ""As the global economy slows, and the troubles in the euro
area continue, the UK's ability to export its way out of the
recession remains in doubt,"" said Hetal Mehta, economist at
Daiwa Capital Markets.

(Adds details, share reaction, analyst comment)
 By Una Galani
 LONDON, NOV 24 (Reuters) - United Utilities posted a 24
percent fall in profits after regulators ordered the UK's
largest listed water company to cut prices.
 The group said it is confident of outperforming its goals
for 2015 two days after naming a new chief executive.
 Industry regulator Ofwat forced the group in April to cut
prices as part of a sector review, hitting profit. United
Utilities also had to absorb increased costs related to its
inflation-linked bonds, the company said on Wednesday.
 ""I'm not against change but I am against radical change on a
model that makes sense,"" outgoing boss Philip Green told
journalists on a conference call when asked about the ongoing
government review of the heavily regulated industry.
 Green, who has led the group since 2006, added that he did
not anticipate any significant shift in strategy under his
successor, Steve Mogford, a former chief operating officer of
BAE Systems who will formally take the reins in March. 
 Under Green, United Utilities sold most of the non-regulated
assets it acquired after being privatised, leaving the business
focused on its core water and wastewater activities.
 It set an interim dividend of 10 pence per share despite a
fall in underlying profit before tax to 196.2 million pounds
($310.3 million) from a restated 258.2 million in the
year-earlier half. 
 This compared favourably to an estimate of 173 million
pounds from Deutsche Bank.
 ""The result was 14 percent above my consensus. The important
thing is that the financing charge of the coventional debt was
lower than previously disclosed. I am raising my price target by
12 pence,"" Evolution Securities analyst Lakis Athanasiou said.
 Following the disposals, the group looks the least expensive
of the UK water stocks, trading on a 9 percent premium to its
regulated asset base compared to the sector average of 12
percent, according to Deutsche Bank.
 United Utilities shares edged up 0.2 percent to 618.5 pence
at 1023 GMT, roughly in line with the STOXX Europe 600 Utilities
Index. Prior to the results, United Utilities' shares had risen
10 percent since April. 
 That compares to a 17 percent rise for rival Severn Trent
which on Tuesday cut its dividend as it reported a fall in
first-half profits.
 The utilities index has fallen 7 percent over the same
period.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month low
against the dollar on Wednesday as an earlier recovery fizzled
out due to worries the euro zone debt crisis will spread and on
renewed concerns about Korean tensions.
 Spreads between peripheral government bond yields and their
German counterparts widened while a North Korean statement in
the wake of Tuesday's artillery clash that the South's action
was driving the peninsula to the brink of war prompted investors
to seek safe-haven currencies.
 This pushed the dollar to a two-month high against a basket
of currencies, while the focus on troubles in the euro zone
periphery meant the euro quickly shrugged off a record high
German Ifo business climate index for November.
 Many uncertainties remained over whether the crisis in
Ireland would be resolved, particularly given political tensions
in the country, while worries intensified that the crisis could
spread to Portugal or even Spain.
 ""The risk is still to the downside and the euro is very
vulnerable due to the Irish crisis and worries about whether
Portugal will be next in line,"" said Niels Christensen, currency
strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 Standard and Poor's downgraded its sovereign rating on
Ireland, which will later unveil a budget plan explaining how it
plans to save 15 billion euros over the next four years.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.3305, having hit a
two-month low of $1.3284, according to Reuters data, and broken
below its 100-day moving average. It resumed losses after a fall
of nearly two percent on Tuesday.
 The euro may be set for a re-test of $1.3232, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its August-November rally, before $1.3000.
 The euro fell to a two-month low against the yen, which also
benefited, along with the dollar and the Swiss franc, from
investors seeking safe haven-assets.
 ""Portugal and Spain spreads are widening,"" a London-based
trader said. ""Real money are selling out stale longs built up
over summer. We are just accelerating as this crisis is going to
run for a while longer.""
 
 RISK AVERSION
 The dollar index rose 0.2 percent to a high of 79.995, its
strongest in two months.
 The dollar gave a muted reaction to minutes from the Federal
Reserve's last policy meeting that showed officials considered
even more drastic options to boost growth before it settled on
buying $600 billion in Treasuries., with its 55-day moving
average, now at 82.74, seen as a floor.
 Traders said market liquidity was lighter than usual ahead
of a U.S. market holiday on Thursday.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.4 percent from late U.S.
levels to $0.9771, recovering from Tuesday's fall to a four-week
low of $0.9708 though well off highs of $0.9818.
 ""The Australian dollar is one of the few currencies people
still like to hold, given strong economic fundamentals,""
Nordea's Christensen said.

 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - German business sentiment rose in
November to its strongest level since 1991, a survey showed on
Wednesday, highlighting a rift in the euro zone as the bloc's
largest economy leaves smaller states behind.
 The Munich-based Ifo think tank said its business climate
index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to
109.3 from an upwardly revised reading of 107.7 in October,
confounding expectations for a slight fall.
 ""The numbers confirm that the German economy is in very
healthy shape and that it will probably continue to grow solidly
and at a rate above the euro zone average in the coming
quarters,"" said Aline Schuiling from ABN Amro.
 The euro  rose after the release of the data -- which
beat even the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of 40
economists -- before giving up its gains and falling.
[ID:nLDE6AN0HE]
 With both the current conditions and the business
expectations indexes in the survey surpassing the consensus
view, the headline figure landed at its highest level since
survey data was first collected for a reunified Germany.
 The business expectations index, which measures the outlook
six months down the road, also hit its highest reading on
record, further reinforcing the impression Germany was in the
clear of problems affecting some of its euro zone partners.
 ""The German economy is returning much faster to its
pre-crisis level than many had expected,"" said Carsten Brzeski,
economist at ING Financial Markets.
 ""Amidst new financial market turmoil and sovereign debt woes
in the euro zone, the German economy seems to be an island of
happiness,"" he added.
 Germany's strong recovery has helped pull the euro zone to
improved growth in recent quarters, but there are also concerns
it may be leaving other struggling economies behind.
 A purchasing managers' survey on Tuesday showed a strong
resurgence in private sector growth in Germany and France,
offset continuing stagnation in countries like Portugal, Ireland
and Spain which are battling debt and banking troubles.
 
 EURO RISKS
 Despite concerns that budget cutbacks across Europe next
year will hamper growth, many German companies are upbeat.
 Earlier this month, engineering group Siemens 
signalled its confidence with a proposed sharp rise in dividends
and a promise of profit growth driven by emerging markets.
 ""We have seen for the first time a growth across our product
range, driven particularly by the strong growth we have seen in
emerging economies,"" Chief Executive Peter Loescher said of
Siemens' fourth quarter, which runs to September 2010.
 German exporters' strength in emerging markets is helping
the economy grow. Detailed third quarter gross domestic product
(GDP) data released on Tuesday also showed a more balanced
recovery taking hold, with steady growth in private consumption.
 The robust German recovery contrasts with the financial
crisis being endured in euro zone peer Ireland. The crisis is
frustrating policymakers in Germany, which has profited strongly
from the euro zone project.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday the euro was in an
""exceptionally serious"" situation, sending the euro lower.
 Ifo Economist Klaus Abberger said that German companies were
not being affected by Europe's debt woes because the countries
worst affected were not among Germany's main export markets.
 ""It hasn't affected business up till now,"" he said.

(Adds detail, quote, background)
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - GN Store Nord has asked a
Dutch court to enforce a ruling against Polish telecoms group
TPSA, in a bid to collect 2.9 billion Danish crowns ($521
million) awarded to its DPTG unit by arbitrators.
 Danish hearing aid and headset maker GN Store Nord said on
Wednesday its DPTG unit had won a ""prejudgment attachment"" which
effectively froze the assets of TPSA Finance BV, TPSA's Dutch
unit. TPSA was not available to comment.
 The Dutch proceedings were a new episode in a nine-year
legal dispute between GN Store Nord and TPSA, controlled by
France Telecom, over income from a fibre-optic network built in
Poland by DPTG.
 GN Store Nord said the Dutch proceedings were one of several
steps its DPTG unit would take to collect the 2.9 billion crowns
awarded to it in September by arbitrators in its TPSA lawsuit.
 The award covered income from the fibre-optic network from
1994 to mid-2004. GN Store Nord said its share of that award was
about 2.1 billion crowns. GN has said it will file a second
claim for more than 1 billion crowns against TPSA, covering the
period from mid-2004 to 2009.
 The company, which had said previously it would pursue
enforcement proceedings in a Polish court, said TPSA had still
not paid the money owed to DPTG under the Vienna arbitration
tribunal's award.
 Although GN Store Nord has not received any money from TPSA,
it booked a one-off gain of 2.1 billion crowns in its
third-quarter accounts from the lawsuit.
 In October, TPSA reported a third-quarter loss, hit by
provisions for GN Store Nord's claims, though TPSA has also
called the award ""disproportionate"" and said it would use all
possible legal means to reduce it.
 GN Store Nord shares were up 2.4 percent at 0940 GMT, while
TPSA shares were up 0.1 percent.

 EU partners are watching the Irish turmoil with concern as a
deepening political crisis threatens to derail plans for
financial rescue by international lenders, while the lengthy
bailout of Greece earlier this year are still fresh in mind.
 ""Unlike as in the Greek case initially, we now have an

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The euro edged up from a two-month
low on Wednesday, finding support after a massive sell-off
sparked by the euro zone debt crisis and heightened tensions in
the Korean Peninsula.
 The common currency ticked up on light buying after its fall
of 1.9 percent to as low as $1.3359 on electronic platform EBS
prompted short-covering.
 As the low represented a 38.2 percent retracement of the
euro's rally this year to $1.4283 in early November from $1.1876
in June, the euro may have found short-term support there, said
Sumino Kamei, a senior analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ.
 The euro climbed 0.2 percent to $1.3395 on the day, shrugging
off the news that Standard and Poor's had downgraded its
sovereign rating on Ireland.
 ""The fact that the euro didn't fall further on the downgrade
suggests that the euro's drop may be over at least for the short
term,"" Kamei said.
 Market players' risk aversion also eased as the Korean won
recovered from lows and regional shares fared better than some
investors had feared a day after North Korea fired scores of
artillery shells at a South Korean island.
 While few traders dare to predict what North Korea will do
next, many are leaning to the view that the incident will not
have a long-lasting impact on financial markets unless tensions
escalate sharply.
 ""I think this is already over as a market factor,"" said a
trader at a Japanese brokerage house, noting that sporadic
attacks from Pyongyang in the past have tended to only affect
markets for a day or two.
 Easing risk aversion also helped the Australian dollar gain
0.7 percent from late U.S. levels to $0.9795, a halfway recovery
from Tuesday's fall to a four-week low of $0.9708.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 83.20 yen,
with its 55-day moving average, now at 82.74, seen as a floor and
with the 90-day moving average, at 83.82, seen as a ceiling in
the near term.
 Traders said market liquidity was lighter than usual due to a
U.S. market holiday on Thursday, which means prices can be
exaggerated in either direction.
 Some traders said the euro still had a greater risk on the
downside given worries Spain and Portugal may have to follow
Ireland in seeking emergency aid to stave off debt crises.
 ""Perhaps the market may already be expecting Portugal to ask
for some sort of help. But if Spain also needs a rescue, that
would be a big blow to the euro,"" said Ayako Sera, market
strategist at Sumitomo Trust and Banking.
 TAKING AIM
 Investors took aim at Spanish government bonds on Tuesday,
driving the premium over German benchmarks to a euro lifetime
high after Madrid was forced to pay a high cost to sell
short-term bills.
 ""Contagion from the Irish situation during the last few
months was largely limited to Greece and Portugal. Not any more,""
wrote Matthew Strauss, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a
note.
 There is also fear that a deepening political crisis in
Ireland could derail the financial rescue to recapitalise the
country's banks and fund its public finances.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel also added fuel to fire by
saying the euro was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation.
 For now, the euro has key support in the $1.3333 area, its
August high. A break of that level could pave the way for a
retest of $1.3232, a 61.8 percent retracement of its
August-November rally, before $1.3000.
 On the flipside, the dollar index is tackling major
resistance at 79.55-80.05. It fell 0.2 percent to 79.51 on the
day, but was still not far from an eight-week high of 79.743
plumbed on Tuesday.
 A break of this area will put the index above its 200-day
moving average and could signal a medium-term rally in the
dollar, which had been pummelled until early this month by the
outlook of more money printing by the Federal Reserve.
 The dollar gave a muted reaction to minutes from the Federal
Reserve's last policy meeting that showed officials considered
even more drastic options to boost growth before it settled on
buying $600 billion in Treasuries.

 * State-backed projects still get lion's share of funding
 By Lucy Hornby and Deborah Kan
 BEIJING/HONG KONG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Energy deals took
centre stage during a southern African tour by China's
leader-in-waiting, but the growing ties between China and Africa
are quickly moving beyond the traditional sectors of energy and
infrastructure.
 Vice President Xi Jinping this week wrapped up a visit to
South Africa, Angola and Botswana. Xi, who is expected to succeed
Hu Jintao as head of the ruling Communist Party in 2012,
witnessed the signing of deals worth millions of dollars to build
a power plant and solar panel factory and to increase South
African exports to China. [ID:nLDE6AG1IO] [ID:nLDE6AK07D].
 Less visible during state visits but increasingly important
is trade in sectors besides resources. Chinese consumer goods are
making huge inroads in African markets, and more and more Chinese
firms are exploring manufacturing deals.
 ""The key trend going forward here is that we're seeing
hundreds of thousands, literally, of micro Chinese entrepreneurs,
procuring from China and selling at the grassroots to African
consumers,"" said Martyn Davies, chief executive of Frontier
Advisory in Johannesburg.
 ""At the higher end, in more formalised retail ... maybe three
quarters of their procurement, non-food, is from China,"" he said.

 While China sees Africa as a prime source for the oil and
minerals that its hungry economy needs, the continent is also a
promising market for everything from tiny hair decorations to
automobiles churned out by China's fiercely competitive
manufacturers.
 ""There are a lot of complementarities between the Chinese and
African economies,"" said Xue Lan, dean of public policy at
Tsinghua University in Beijing.
 Better infrastructure in Africa can help move ore and oil
out, and let more consumer goods in. Textiles already make up 16
percent of African purchases from China; footwear and clothing
account for another 14 percent.
 Craig Bond, China head for Standard Bank , South
Africa's biggest bank, said China's prime objective in Africa is
obviously to obtain access to natural resources, but there's
another objective in the longer-term.
 ""The second one is looking at the long game of those markets
becoming consumer markets for Chinese goods,"" Bond said.
 GROWTH TIES
 China has traditionally encouraged its state-owned companies
tendering for African contracts to team up with one of its policy
banks, such as ExIm Bank, whose remit is to support government
goals [ID:nLDE6AK0E8].
 But as China's engagement with Africa deepens, the financing
needs could be a stretch even for deep-pocketed policy lenders:
the World Bank has identified a $31 billion shortfall in the
continent's infrastructure funding requirements.
 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS>
<1398.HK>, the world's largest bank, is one of the banks that
Beijing is coaxing to broaden its footprint in Africa. It owns 20
percent of Standard.
 As living standards rise, other opportunities beckon. Africa
in 2008 had about 80 million households with income above $5,000
a year -- roughly the population of China's four largest cities.
 By 2020, that number could grow to about 130 million.
 ""There's a lot to be said: the telecoms sector is booming,
infrastructure is booming, services are booming,"" said Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala, the World Bank's managing director.

 By Jeremy Laurence
 SEOUL, Nov 24 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday came under
heavy pressure to tame its ally North Korea after the reclusive
state attacked South Korea, with the United States trying to
cool tension in the economically powerful region.
 Tuesday's artillery attack on a South Korean island killed
two soldiers, sent scores of civilians fleeing and sparked a
sell off in stock futures and the won in offshore trading.
Futures for stocks and bonds have since recovered.
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?
 Tuesday's barrage was the heaviest bombardment on the South
since the Korean War ended in 1953. Tensions are running high
in the region. But it is extremely unlikely that this marks the
start of an escalating conflict that could lead to a major
military confrontation between the two Koreas.
 For decades, North Korea has followed a strategy of trying
to wring concessions from the international community through
periodic provocations, carefully calibrated to raise
geopolitical tensions without sparking full scale war.
 Provocations over the past few years include two nuclear
tests, several missile tests, and the sinking of a South Korean
warship in March which killed 46 sailors.
 This latest attack is likely to be in line with this
strategy. Rather than heralding further aggressive gestures in
coming days that raise the geopolitical temperature, it is
likely to be followed by a period of relative calm, or even
overtures from Pyongyang for more peace talks.
 North Korea has no appetite for a major conflict. The South
Korean and U.S. militaries are far better equipped than the
North's decrepit army which barely has enough fuel to fly its
ageing fleet of fighter planes.
 South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has vowed a firm
response, but Seoul too has no desire for a serious conflict.
While North Korea would certainly lose any war, it would be
able to do enormous damage to the South with its vast
artillery.
 South Korea's reaction has been very restrained, just as it
was in the aftermath of the sinking of the Cheonan.
 WHY NOW?
 There are several possible reasons why North Korea's
military may have launched Tuesday's artillery barrage.
 South Korea was holding military drills in the area, and
has conceded that it was conducting test-firing exercises. This
might have led the North Korean military to genuinely believe
it was under attack, and to fire in retaliation.
 Pyongyang regards South Korean military exercises with
genuine unease, fearing the manoeuvres could be a smokescreen
for a real attack. In recent years it has reacted with fury to
South Korean drills, particularly when the U.S. military was
also involved.
 Events of the last week suggest North Korea is again trying
to provoke the international community into making concessions.
It has unveiled major advances with its uranium enrichment
programme, giving it a second route to make a nuclear bomb.
 Pyongyang's decision to show off its technological advances
to Western scientists, coupled with Tuesday's attack, may be a
strategy aimed at scaring the South and its allies into easing
sanctions or restarting peace and disarmament talks.
 A final factor that may have played a part in the timing of
the incident is that the North has entered a period of
leadership transition.
 At a major ruling party meeting in September, Kim Jong-il
appointed his youngest son to key posts, a move seen as
formally anointing him as North Korea's next leader. Kim is
widely thought to be in failing health after suffering a stroke
in 2008, and this may have led him to speed up succession
plans.
 But his son, Kim Jong-un, is young and has no real support
base, and there is always the risk that powerful figures in the
military or government decide this is an opportune moment for a
power grab.
 The North's economy is going from bad to worse, another
factor that may fuel internal instability and discontent.
 Tuesday's incident and the Cheonan attack in March may have
been attempts to bolster unity among North Korea's elites by
focusing attention on an external enemy, or a bid to bolster
Kim Jong-un's credentials in the military.
 Or they may have been launched by hawkish elements of the
military without the knowledge and support of Kim Jong-il.
 ""With the ongoing leadership transition in North Korea,
there have been rumors of discontent within the military, and
the current actions may reflect miscommunications or worse
within the North's command-and-control structure, or
disagreements within the North Korean leadership,"" geopolitical
risk analysis firm Stratfor said in a comment on Tuesday.
 HOW HAVE MARKETS REACTED?
 Asian shares fell on Wednesday and the euro hovered near a
two-month low to the U.S. dollar as regional stocks caught up
with a sharp sell-off after the shelling, and investors sought
safety in the U.S. currency.
 South Korean stock and bond futures, however, rose on
Wednesday as foreign investors looked for bargains in local
assets after the artillery attack on the South led to a
panicked sell off on Tuesday.
 The won was down around 0.7 percent and shares in both
South Korea and neighboring Japan, whose markets were closed on
Tuesday, were underperforming the region, reflecting the
seriousness of the attacks.
 The main KOSPI stock index, which closed right before the
brunt of Tuesday's selloff, was down 0.7 percent but off its
early lows. Food-related stocks and shares of companies that
make military equipment were outperforming.
 Turnover in the main market with more than three hours to
go before the close was 4.7 trillion won, nearly three quarters
of the daily average turnover for last month of 6.5 trillion
won.
 The cheapness of Korea's equities, tough and highly
competitive industries and the country's current account
surplus were draws for foreign and domestic institutional
investors, analysts said. Even the diminished threat of capital
controls, an unforeseen byproduct of the shelling, was cited by
analysts as a reason to buy back Korean assets.
 In credit markets, Korean bonds were trading higher, and
the 5-year sovereign credit default swaps, basically insurance
against default, were at 97/99 basis points compared with
Tuesday's widest levels of 107 reached during the New York
trading session.
 South Korean asset markets have grown used to Pyongyang's
provocations. They tend to suffer only a brief and modest dip
in response to North Korean sabre-rattling, as a few players
engage in knee-jerk selling, but prices tend to recover
quickly.
 Todd Martin, Asia equity strategist with Societe Generale
in Hong Kong, said Korea was his pick for second-best
performing market next year in Asia next to Japan.
 However, given heightened sensitivity to risk in global
markets, the potential for a sharper sell-off cannot be
discounted. In April, when Seoul formally blamed the North for
the Cheonan attack, panicky investors dumped South Korean
assets.
 Still, since Tuesday's attack is highly unlikely to
escalate into a more serious confrontation, market reaction in
coming days will probably be on the upside.
 WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THIS PICTURE?
 The biggest risk is that North Korea's leadership
transition and economic problems result in the leadership
making risky moves that go beyond the provocations of the past
and cause events to spiral out of control.
 With Kim's health uncertain, his son still an unknown
quantity, the delicate balance that has kept the peninsula
tense but peaceful for decades may be unravelling. While
neither side wants war, there is always the risk that
misunderstandings or miscalculations lead to unintended
conflict.
 The other main risk to South Korea is what happens when
North Korea's regime eventually collapses. That prospect is
regarded with dread by many regional policymakers because of
the enormous economic costs a sudden chaotic reunification of
the two Koreas would impose on the region.
 ""Any additional risk premium that the market imposes in KRW
assets is likely to be embedded more in longer-term yields,
which should support a steepening of the IRS curve in spot and
forward terms,"" Nomura said.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2010 11:24PM ET</span>","FOREX-Euro licks wounds, finds support for now"," * Key retracement level offers euro support
 * Market players turn back risk trades slightly
 * Euro shrugs off downgrades of Ireland
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The euro edged up from a two-month
low on Wednesday, finding support after a massive sell-off
sparked by the euro zone debt crisis and heightened tensions in
the Korean Peninsula.
 The common currency ticked up on light buying back after
Europe's inability to contain Ireland's debt woes had knocked it
down 1.9 percent to as low as $1.3359 on electronic platform EBS.
 As the low represented an almost 38.2 percent retracement of
the euro's rally this year to $1.4283 in early November from
$1.1876 in June, the euro may have found short-term support
there, said Sumino Kamei, a senior analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3405 on the day, shrugging
off the news that Standard and Poor's had downgraded its
sovereign rating on Ireland.
 ""The fact that the euro didn't fall further on the downgrade
suggests that the euro's drop may be over at least for the short
term,"" Kamei said.
 Market players' risk aversion also slightly eased as the
Korean won recovered from lows and regional shares fared better
than some investors had feared a day after North Korea fired
scores of artillery shells at a South Korean island.
 That also helped the Australian dollar gain 0.6 percent from
late U.S. levels to $0.9784, a halfway recovery from Tuesday's
fall to a four-week low of $0.9708.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 83.20 yen.
 Traders said market liquidity is lighter than usual due to a
U.S. market holiday on Thursday, which means prices can be
exaggerated in either direction.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the euro was in an
""exceptionally serious"" situation. Investors took aim at Spanish
government bonds on Tuesday, driving the premium over German
benchmarks to a euro lifetime high after Madrid was forced to pay
a high cost to sell short-term bills.
 ""Contagion from the Irish situation during the last few
months was largely limited to Greece and Portugal. Not any more,""
wrote Matthew Strauss, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a
note. 
 In addition, a deepening political crisis in Ireland could
derail the financial rescue to recapitalise the country's banks
and fund its public finances.
 Given these worries, some traders think a further fall in the
euro cannot be ruled out.
 They say another key support for the euro is in the $1.3333
area, its August high. A break of that level could pave the way
for a retest of $1.3232, a 61.8 percent retracement of its
August-November rally, before $1.3000.

 By Jungyoun Park and Yeonhee Kim 
 SEOUL, Nov 24 (Reuters) - South Korean stock and bond
futures rose on Wednesday after North Korea's deadly artillery
attack on the South sparked a panicked selloff that
longer-term investors viewed as an opportunity to snap up
bargains. 
 The won clawed back some of its early losses and
was down around 0.5 percent by afternoon, though major share
indexes in both South Korea and Japan were lower, reflecting
lingering unease in North Asian markets after the Tuesday
attacks, which were the fiercest since the Korean War ended in
1953.	
 Still, attractive valuations for Korean equities, its
highly competitive industries and the country's current
account surplus remained draws for foreign and domestic
investors, who recalled that past clashes with the North,
while less severe, have had only a temporary impact on South
Korea's markets.	
 The diminished threat of capital controls, an unforeseen
byproduct of the shelling, was also cited by analysts as a
reason to buy back Korean assets.	
 ""If you look back at the last five years when we've had
scares, they were all seen as buying opportunities. The rule
among hedge funds and long-only funds is that you let the
market sell off and watch for your entry point to get
involved,"" Todd Martin, Asia equity strategist with Societe
Generale in Hong Kong, said. 
 Martin said that Korea was his pick for second-best
performing market next year in Asia next to Japan. 
 
 December KOSPI stock index futures  were up 1.7
percent by afternoon after dropping 2.4 percent on Tuesday,
the biggest single-day decline since late May, as word of the
attacks spread from local media. 
 The main stock index closed 0.2 percent lower but
was off early lows, with food-related stocks and shares of
companies that make military equipment outperforming.	
 Turnover in the main KOSPI stock market was 8 trillion
won, higher than the daily average turnover last month of 6.5
trillion won.	
 December 3-year government bond futures climbed 0.27 point
to 112.32 , retracing most of the losses incurred
shortly after the attacks. 
 Foreign investors were net buyers of stocks on Seoul's
main exchange and Treasury bond futures, indicating a hunger
to add risk to portfolios. 
 ""Heightening geopolitical risks are pressuring the share
market, but overall, market reaction is fairly calm and we are
actually seeing foreign investors and pension funds picking up
shares, searching for bargains,"" said Kwak Joong-bo, a market
analyst at Samsung Securities in Seoul. 
 
 CHEAP KOREA 
 Even before the shelling, Korean equity valuations were
lower than other Asian markets partly because of the simmering
tension between the North, with its nuclear ambitions, and the
South. 
 South Korea is the only market in the MSCI's Asia Pacific
ex-Japan index to trade at a single digit multiple based on
forecast earnings 12 months forward. The MSCI Korea index was
as of Nov. 18 trading at 9.6 times forward earnings, compared
with 12.5 times for the regional index, Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S showed.	
 So, a sudden selloff in the stock market usually turns
many fund managers into keen value investors.	
 Foreign investors have been slowing their buying of Korean
stocks considerably throughout this year, shifting allocations
to other markets. Foreign inflows to Korea's equity market
year to date are up 27 percent from last year, smaller than
the growth in inflows to Japan, Indonesia, India and Thailand,
TrimTabs Investment Research said in a note. 
 The won fought back from early losses and was down around
0.4 percent at 1,142.30 per dollar . Dealers said it
may have difficulty advancing beyond 1,140 per dollar, the
highs of Oct. 20 and Nov. 17 on charts that will act as
obstacles.	
 One-month Korean won non-deliverable forwards opened at
1,170/75 before moving down to around 1,143.35.
Trading volume was thin compared to Tuesday, a trader at
broker Tullet Prebon said. 
 
 NO ARMAGEDDON 
 Strategists at Nomura in Singapore recommended going short
on 3-month dollar/won NDFs, saying the market had sold the won
off too quickly on geopolitical risks and that the Bank of
Korea has been intervening less persistently, letting the
currency strengthen some to fight inflation.	
 There were no reports of further attacks on Wednesday, and
markets in Asia at least appeared to be betting there would
not be an escalation in hostilities. Asian stock markets
outside of Japan and commodities prices showed signs of
steadying. 
 U.S. President Barack Obama expressed his outrage about
the attacks on and near the island of Yeonpyeong, but declined
to speculate on U.S. military action. 
 ""We think the provocations by the North are one-offs whose
financial market impact will be transitory, not stepping
stones to a financial armageddon,"" Prakash Sakpal, economist
with ING in Singapore. 
 In credit markets, Korean bonds were trading higher, and
the 5-year sovereign credit default swaps, basically insurance
against default, were at 97/99 basis points compared with
Tuesday's widest levels of 107 reached during the New York
trading session. 
 The longest period where North Korea tensions weighed on
South Korean markets was after Pyongyang's first nuclear test
in 2006. It took five days for the KOSPI to recover its
losses, 13 days for the won and 9 days for the 3-year
government bond yield, analysts said.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia and Europe
steadied on Wednesday from a sell-off following North Korea's
deadly shelling of a South Korean island, but tension on the
divided peninsula supported safe-haven assets such as gold and
Japanese government bonds.	
 The euro clawed away from a two-month low, but remained on
the back foot amid concerns that a rescue package for Ireland
would not be enough to stop a debt crisis from picking off
more of the euro zone's most heavily indebted nations.	
 European stock markets rose from a six-week closing low,
with the FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.4 percent in early
trade. London's FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent, Germany's
DAX 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 0.6
percent.	
 S&P 500 futures  rose 0.4 percent, pointing to a
possible bounce in U.S. markets later in the day.	
 While Tuesday's artillery attack was one of the most
serious incidents on the peninsula since the end of the Korean
War in 1953, market reactions to North Korean sabre-rattling
or outright aggression have tended to be short-lived.
[ID:nL3E6MO04H]	
 The Korean won recouped most of its early losses to
finish down around 0.5 percent on the day and South Korean
stock  and bond  futures rose, indicating longer
term investors saw a chance to snap up bargains.	
 Seoul's benchmark index finished down only 0.2
percent, off earlier lows, with foreign investors net buyers
of stocks.	
 ""Korea trades at a discount to the region on a valuation
basis ... If you look back at the last five years when we've
had scares they were all seen as buying opportunities,"" said
Todd Martin, Asia equity strategist with Societe Generale.	
 ""The rule among hedge funds and long-only funds is that
you let the market sell off and watch for your entry point.""	


 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.8 percent,
retreating from a five-month high and catching up with
regional markets after a break for a public holiday on
Tuesday. 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was flat, with gains in Hong Kong ,
Shanghai and Singapore offsetting falls in
Australia and South Korea.	
 U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday, rattled by the Korean
flare-up and debt woes in Europe, to which U.S. banks have
significant exposure. The S&P 500 index dropped 1.4
percent and the CBOE Volatility Index , Wall Street's
""fear gauge"", jumped 12.3 percent, its largest daily
percentage gain in more than three months. 
 Japanese government bond futures bounced from a two-month
low, with the 10-year benchmark <2JGBv1> up 0.14 point.	
 ""Tensions in Korea are debt-positive in the short-run,
spurring investors away from riskier assets,"" said Koichi Ono,
a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.	
 
 EYES ON IRISH	
 Currency markets remained more focused on Europe, where
Ireland's beleaguered coalition was due later in the day to
set out a four-year plan to save 15 billion euros through
spending cuts and tax increases. 
 The bursting of a property bubble has taken Ireland's
banks to the brink if collapse and shredded the finances of a
government that agreed to back the lenders' liabilities.	
 Now investors fear a debt crisis that had already swamped
Greece will spread further. The premium on Spanish government
bond yields over German benchmarks rose to a euro lifetime
high on Tuesday.	
 ""Perhaps the market may be already expecting Portugal to
ask for some sort of help. But if Spain also needs a rescue,
that would be a big blow to the euro,"" said Ayako Sera, market
strategist at Sumotomo Trust and Banking.	
 The euro slumped 1.9 percent on Tuesday to as low
as $1.3359 and was trading around $1.3390 on Wednesday. A
downgrade for Ireland from ratings agency Standard and Poor's
did not dent the euro further, indicating it may have found
support for now.	
 ""The fact the euro didn't fall further on the downgrade
suggests the euro's drop may be over, at least for the
short-term,"" said Sumino Kamei, a senior analyst at the Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. [ID:nSYU010701]	
 The dollar index , which measures its performance
against a basket of currency, eased 0.2 percent on the day,
but remained not far from an eight-week high hit on Tuesday.	
 Gold was steady around $1,377 an ounce after
reaching a 1-1/2 week high of $1,382 in the previous session.

 U.S. crude oil futures  rose 44 cents, around 0.5
percent, to $81.69 a barrel. 
 Copper rose more than 1 percent in London and
Shanghai SCFc3, recouping most of Tuesday's losses, but
sentiment remained brittle amid concerns over Korea, the
European debt crisis and the prospect of more Chinese monetary
policy tightening.	
 ""There is a lot of anxiety around, the inclination is to
run for cover at any hint of a problem,"" said one trader in
Hong Kong. ""Our strategy is to keep positions light and be
ready to get out quickly.""

(Updates with U.S. market close, comment, Nikkei futures)
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - North Korea's deadly shelling
of a South Korean island on Tuesday rattled global markets,
prompting investors to sell stocks and seek safe haven in the
U.S. dollar, gold and government bonds.
 The euro, already soured by Ireland's debt crisis,
accelerated its decline as investors feared a rescue package
for Dublin may not stop problems from spreading to other
indebted euro zone countries. The euro plunged to a two-month
low beneath $1.34 and traded below 111 yen for the first time
since mid-September.
 Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in
Boston, said the news reminded traders how easily markets can
be disturbed by geopolitics.
 ""As we move into 2011, (U.S. President Barack) Obama is
going to be a lot less focused on domestic policy -- where we
have gridlock -- and more focused on foreign policy and
confronting some of these regimes,"" Kleintop said.
 ""That might mean higher geopolitical risk premiums going
forward.""
 An upward revision of U.S. third-quarter gross domestic
product growth added to the greenback's allure while
weaker-than-forecast sales of previously owned U.S. homes did
little to diminish the dollar. For details, see [ID:nN2399302]
 Gold's safe-haven status overcame the stronger U.S. dollar,
but crude oil fell.
 Share prices in Tokyo are poised to drop on Wednesday from
their five-month closing high in the previous session as the
December futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock index
<0#NK:> trading in Chicago fell 230 points, or 2.28 percent to
9,875.
 North Korea's artillery barrage killed two South Korean
soldiers in one of the fiercest attacks on its neighbor since
the Korean War ended in 1953. South Korea fired back and sent
fighter jets to the area, close to a disputed maritime border
on the west of the divided peninsula. [ID:nL3E6MN0SQ]

European investors as concerns about the potential of contagion

 IRISH JITTERS
 The debt tensions in Ireland led to weak bank shares in
Europe in addition to pulling the euro down 1.91 percent at
$1.3365 , its weakest point since late September.
 Bank of Ireland shares  fell 24.94 percent. Other
banks to fall included Spain's Banco Santander , off
4.73 percent, and BBVA  off 3.90 percent.
 The U.S. dollar rose 1.30 percent against a basket of
currencies that make up its major trading partners. The dollar
however fell 0.16 percent to 83.15 against the yen .
 In Europe, Bund futures  rose more than one point
to 128.94 as political disarray in Ireland cast doubt over
whether the government could pass its austerity budget and pave
the way for a European Union/IMF aid deal to tackle its debt
problems.
 The premium investors demand to hold Spanish bonds over
German benchmarks rose to a euro-lifetime high of 237 basis
points after Madrid was forced to pay a high cost to sell
short-term bills, reflecting contagion risks from Ireland.
 Irish spreads rose back above 600 bps and other peripheral
government bond yield spreads widened. The cost of insuring
higher-yielding euro zone sovereign debt against default also
was rising, even though traders said the European Central Bank
had been buying bonds, mainly Portuguese.
 ""Europe is in self-implode mode. There is a huge
flight-to-quality bid developing,"" a trader said.
 Portugal and Spain are seen as the next weakest links and
an official from Portugal's main opposition party said it would
allow passage of the minority Socialist government's 2011
budget in the final vote on Nov. 26. [ID:nLSB001015]
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 6/32 of a point in
price, driving the yield down to 2.78 percent .
 Spot gold prices  rose $10.75 to $1,376.50, while
crude oil  fell 67 cents $81.07 per barrel.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The dollar rose for a second
straight day on Tuesday after North Korea's shelling of a South
Korean island enhanced the currency's safe-haven appeal, while
fear that an Irish debt crisis could spread punished the euro.
 The euro plunged to a two-month low beneath $1.34 and also
dropped below 111 yen for the first time since mid-September as
investors worried that Spain and Portugal may have to follow
Ireland in seeking emergency aid to stave off a debt crisis.
 That left the euro, in the words of German Chancellor
Angela Merkel, in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation.
Analysts said it could easily slip as far as $1.30.
 The euro fell 1.9 percent to $1.3371, its biggest daily
decline since August. It was down 2 percent at 111.18 yen.
 ""Things could get more troubling as the market is looking
beyond Ireland and turning to Spain and Portugal. Traders will
likely target $1.30 into year end,"" said Hidetoshi Yanagihara,
senior currency trader at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
 Spain frightens investors most as it is the euro zone's
fourth-largest economy and, unlike Ireland, still has to raise
money on capital markets this year. Spain's short-term cost of
borrowing almost doubled at a tender on Tuesday.
 This came as North Korea fired scores of artillery shells
at a South Korean island, killing two in one of the heaviest
attacks by North Korea on its neighbor since 1953. It sparked a
broader move away from risky trades and into U.S. Treasuries
and the dollar.
 The dollar rose 3.5 percent against the South Korean won to
its highest level since early September. Investors also cut
exposure to the high-yielding Australian dollar, which fell 1.6
percent against its U.S. counterpart.
 Against the yen, which also tends to attract safe-haven
buying when risk aversion spikes as it did on Tuesday, the
dollar edged down 0.2 percent to 83.16 yen. But an index of the
dollar against six other major currencies rose 1.3 percent, its
biggest daily gain since mid-October.
 EURO WOES, FED THINKING
 The euro's fall against the dollar extended after U.S. data
showed sales of previously owned homes fell more than expected
in October, increasing risk aversion. The euro fell below
$1.3438 against the dollar, a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement
of its August through November rally.
 Beyond that, the way is clear for a retest of $1.3333, the
August peak, according to Reuters data.
 Stephen Gallo, head of market analysis at Schneider Foreign
Exchange in London, said Europe's debt crisis could frustrate
efforts to rebalance global growth as China and others resist
pressure to allow more rapid currency appreciation.
 ""The greater the degree of financial market distress
emanating from the euro zone, the less it could be that
People's Bank of China allows for any more aggressive moves in
its currency,"" he said.
 The euro zone's debt crisis overshadowed the release of
minutes from the Federal Reserves's last policy meeting, which
showed officials considered even more drastic options to boost
growth before it settled on buying $600 billion in Treasuries.
 For months, anticipation of the Fed's bond-buying plan,
announced this month, pushed the dollar sharply lower against
major currencies, though its decline stalled this month as
Europe's problems emerged anew.

 * Brazil cites currency tensions in tax overhaul
 * Colombia lowers import tariffs, Chile cuts red tape
 By Pablo Garibian and Samantha Pearson
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The world's
so-called currency war could have a silver lining for Latin
America as it pushes countries to reform their economies by
overhauling tax codes, cutting tariffs and snipping red tape.
 Exporters from Brazil to Colombia and Chile have been stung
by U.S. policies that have devalued the dollar and made Latin
American exports more expensive to American consumers.
 Outmuscled by the U.S. Federal Reserve's ability to pump
dollars into financial markets and facing perhaps years of
strength in their currencies, Latin American governments are
scrambling to do what they can to dull the pain.
 Last week, a top Brazilian official said President-elect
Dilma Rousseff plans to cut payroll taxes to make the economy
more competitive, saying it was a good policy ""particularly
because of the currency war."" For more, see: [ID:nN15237853]
 Rousseff's reform agenda probably stems more from a growing
political consensus over reforms than from frustrations over
Brazil's inability to contain the real using capital controls,
but currency tensions do lend urgency to the matter.
 ""(This) is pushing the government to look at these more
structural measures because the government understands that
over the medium to long-term, the kind of capital controls that
were imposed are not very effective,"" said Tony Volpon, a
strategist at Nomura Securities in New York.
 The strong real , which has gained about 4 percent
since June, is already weighing on the country's steel sector,
and overall industrial output fell in August and September
.
 PART OF THE PROBLEM
 In Colombia, which is also feeling the pinch of a stronger
peso, currency concerns appear to be having the opposite effect
in global trade to that expected by many analysts as it became
clear this year that world leaders would not reach a grand
bargain regulating exchange rates.[ID:nN09105095]
 While some U.S. lawmakers advocate putting up barriers to
Chinese imports because the Asian giant keeps its yuan currency
artificially weak, Colombia has slashed its own import
tariffs.
 The government aims to lower the cost of materials imported
by Colombian factories while pushing companies to become more
competitive.
 Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos is also pushing
fiscal reforms. Last month he proposed eliminating a tax
deduction on investment by next year.
 The government hopes a lower deficit will reduce credit
costs and trim borrowing from abroad, which aids in driving up
the value of the Colombian peso when the government converts
its borrowed dollars into local currency.
 ""We ourselves almost are part of the problem and we have to
be part of the solution,"" Finance Minister Juan Carlos
Echeverry said in October.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 In Chile, where the economy grew at its quickest rate in
five years during the third quarter, a strong peso nevertheless
is creating headaches for exporters. Chile's trade surplus fell
in October to its lowest level since the country ran a trade
deficit in December 2008.
 Chile has responded by changing rules for pension fund
estimates and slowing the pace of interest rate hikes. But the
peso  has continued to appreciate and is up about 13
percent since June.
 Seeking alternatives to costly currency market
intervention, the government last month launched a program to
reduce red tape for exporters. Colombia has also stepped up
loans in dollars to exporters.
 None of these measures promises to make up for the damage
to exporters caused by strong currencies, and in some
countries, economic reforms will likely remain on ice. Mexico,
for one, looks unlikely to pass substantial economic reforms
until at least after its 2012 presidential election.
[ID:nN26226254]
 But with exporters across the region taking a hit, pressure
will only grow on governments to lend them a hand.
 ""They are going to have to look within themselves for other
means to help their economies,"" said Enrique Alvarez, an
economist at IDEAglobal in New York.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2010 02:20PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Turkey unlikely to sustain high growth rate-finmin," (Updates with details, background)
 By Sujata Rao and Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Turkey will find it hard to
sustain its current pace of economic growth in the near term,
Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Tuesday, adding the
government would stick to its 2010 growth forecast of 6.8
percent.
 The Turkish economy grew at a blistering pace of 11.7
percent year-on-year in the first quarter, followed by 10.3
percent in the second quarter but Simsek said the government is
not banking on a similar pace in the second half of 2010.
 ""Growth is likely to be sustained, of course not at current
pace ... (The) OECD sees growth at 8.7 percent, the IMF sees it
at 7.8 percent,"" Simsek said at a Bloomberg Newsweek forum.
 ""We don't think this is sustainable as the domestic savings
rates are very low and that brings about challenges. We remain
at the mercy of global risk appetite ... When we grow fast, we
tend to post large current account deficits,"" he said.
 The strong recovery has led to a widening of the country's
current account deficit, which jumped 300 percent year-on-year
to $4.08 billion in September.
 Simsek blamed high oil prices for the current account gap.
 ""It comes from a low base. As a percentage of GDP, it
represents 5.5 pct of GDP. We think the deficit is financeable
and in that sense manageable ... It reflects strong growth
relative to our peers,"" he later told reporters.
 Excluding energy imports, the current account balance would
be in surplus, he added.
 Turkey's red-hot economic growth has attracted strong
capital inflows, sending its lira currency to two-year highs
against the dollar  recently.
 Last week, the central bank slashed overnight borrowing
rates by 400 basis points to 1.75 percent in an attempt to
discourage short-term foreign money from parking their cash
overnight with the central bank.
 ""Despite some risks associated with short-term capital
inflows, we remain committed to the floating exchange rate
system and the monetary policy framework we've been conducting
for years,"" Simsek said.
 ""We are more focused (on) how to enhance our
competitiveness through more fundamental steps,"" he said,
adding that investment in infrastructure and education had been
increased.
 Simsek declined to comment on Turkey's immediate financing
plans, saying that the 2011 financing plans would be unveiled
by the debt management agency next month.
 But he said the government was keen to extend sovereign
debt maturities beyond the new 10-year limit it established
this year.

 Oil bounced off lows and briefly turned positive as many

 ""We are concluding that a portion of today's strong

 After weeks of whipsaw trading amid expectations over the
Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy, then fears of

 * Resolving hormone dispute could add 3,200 tonnes
 (Recasts, updates with comments from European Commission,
industry group)
 By Rod Nickel
 WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Canada has gained
duty-free access to the European Union for a 20,000-tonne
annual quota of beef, Canada's agriculture and trade ministers
said on Tuesday, in a move aimed at resolving a longstanding
dispute amid talks on a broad free trade agreement.
 The quota for beef from cattle not raised with growth
hormones is worth about C$10 million ($9.8 million) annually,
and matches access that Europe has already granted to the
United States.
 Hormone treatments are widely used in North America to
speed cattle growth and reduce feed costs, leading the EU over
20 years ago to restrict North American beef over health
concerns.
 Canada Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said only Canada,
the United States and Australia have this level of access to
the EU beef market.
 ""After two decades, our producers will again have
(tariff-free) access,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
 Ritz said the WTO ruled in Canada's favor on the beef
hormone dispute with the EU several years ago, and the quota is
the negotiated result of that ruling.
 He said Canada will make the case for further access in
ongoing talks with the EU.
 Canada and the European Commission have finalized a
memorandum of understanding aimed at a final resolution of the
long-standing WTO dispute that will ultimately add 3,200 tonnes
to the 20,000 tonne quota, Ritz said.
 A person familiar with the situation said the draft
memorandum is similar to that between the United States and EU
and would see Canada lift its sanctions against imports of
European beef, pork and cucumbers, which it had imposed as
retaliatory measures.
 The access is important for Canadian ranchers because
Europe is a high-income market willing to pay the higher cost
of beef from cattle raised without growth hormones, said Travis
Toews, president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association.
 ""Finally we can start to scratch the potential of this
market,"" he said.
 The draft memorandum looks to be finalized either just
before Christmas or in January, said Roger Waite, spokesman for
agriculture and rural development at the European Commission,
who declined to comment on the contents of the agreement.
 Expanding access is a good step, but the quota is small,
said Kevin Grier, senior market analyst at the Canadian
agriculture research organization George Morris Centre.
 Tariffs are only one barrier to meat exports to the
European Union, with protocols for processing plants and
production methods also restricting trade, Grier said.
 ""European tariffs are often the least of our problems.""
 Canada and European Union officials have held discussions
on a broad free trade agreement for about a year.

 NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The dollar rose for a second
straight day on Tuesday after a shelling exchange in the Korean
peninsula added to the greenback's safe-haven allure as did
growing concern about Europe's debt crisis.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Ireland's crisis was
different to Greece's but just as worrying and the euro was in
an ""exceptionally serious"" situation.
 Comments by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that
the future of the euro zone currency was at stake due to the
Irish debt crisis further pressured the euro.
 A shelling exchange in the Korean peninsula, after North
Korea fired artillery shells at a South Korean island,
exacerbated the risk aversion ruling financial markets and
added to pressure on the euro. The North Korean shelling killed
two soldiers and set dozens of houses ablaze, and the South
Koreans returned fire, military and South Korean media
reported.
 The dollar rose 3.5 percent against the South Korean won to
its highest since early September.
 ""We're seeing a knee-jerk reaction to Korea but the
underlying story is still the European debt crisis and
contagion fears,"" said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington. ""That will drive trading for the rest
of the month. Korea is a sideshow.""
 The euro was down 1.8 percent on the day at $1.3376, after
shedding around half a cent when the Korean clash was reported.
The session low was $1.3370 on electronic trading platform EBS
data, and the percentage decline the largest since August at
current prices.
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.5 percent at 82.84
yen, having risen as high as 83.85 yen.
 The dollar index was up 1.2 percent at 79.625, close to its
intraday high of 79.642.
 The euro's fall against the dollar extended after U.S. data
showed sales of previously owned homes fell more than expected
in October, increasing risk aversion. The euro fell below
$1.3438 against the dollar, a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement
of its August through November rally, according to EBS data.
 EURO WOES
 Many investors are not convinced that an EU/IMF rescue
package for Ireland will prevent other heavily indebted members
of the 16-country bloc from seeking aid, and Portugal and Spain
are seen as the next weakest links.
 An official from Portugal's main opposition party said it
would allow passage of the minority Socialist government's 2011
budget in the final vote on Nov. 26.
 However, Spain's short-term cost of borrowing almost
doubled at a tender on Tuesday.retest of $1.3333, the August
peak, according to Reuters data.
 The dollar index meanwhile is approaching the 200-week
simple moving average of 79.734 after breaking below that
measure in September.
 Focus now shifts to the 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) release of the
U.S. Federal Reserve's minutes of its Federal Open Market
Committee's last policy-setting meeting on Nov. 2-3.
 ""The main thing from the FOMC minutes will be how much
support for QE2 was there at the meeting,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS in London.
 Yu was referring to the Fed's latest $600 billion program
of 'quantitative easing,' dubbed QE2, to try to stimulate a
sluggish recovery by buying U.S. government debt.

 NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - North Korea's deadly shelling
of a South Korean island on Tuesday rattled global financial
markets, leading investors to buy safe-haven assets, such as
the U.S. dollar and Treasuries, and sell stocks.
 The euro, already soured by Ireland's debt crisis,
accelerated its decline as investors feared a rescue package
for Dublin may not stop problems from spreading to other
indebted euro zone countries. The currency was near a two-month
low with little relief in sight.
 An upward revision of U.S. third-quarter gross domestic
product growth added to the greenback's allure while
weaker-than-forecast sales of previously owned U.S. homes did
little to diminish the dollar. For details, see [ID:nN2399302]
 Gold's safe-haven status overcame the stronger U.S. dollar,
but crude oil fell.
 ""Obviously there is a big flight-to-safety trade going on.
We've seen Treasury yields fall in tandem with some pretty big
declines in equity prices,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director
of global fixed income analysis at Action Economics in San
Francisco.

 In Korea, December KOSPI 200 index futures  fell 2.4
percent in a late sell-off as the news broke at the end of the
trading day while the dollar rose more than 4 percent against
the won in offshore trade before trimming gains .
 The iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund  traded down
5.1 percent during New York hours. Shares of Korea Electric

 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
fell 0.86 percent to 1084.05, recouping some of the losses that
earlier pushed the index to its lowest point in over a month.
 IRISH JITTERS
 The debt tensions in Ireland led to weak bank shares in
Europe in addition to pulling the euro down 1.51 percent at
$1.3419 , its weakest point since Sept. 28.
 Bank of Ireland  fell 20.3 percent. Other banks to
fall included Spain's Banco Santander , off 2.52
percent, and BBVA  off 2.04 percent.
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.91 percent against a basket of
currencies that make up its major trading partners. The dollar
however fell 0.35 percent to 82.99 against the yen .
 In Europe, Bund futures rallied a full point and yields of
peripheral issuers' bonds rose on fears about their ability to
manage their debt loads.
 The Irish Prime Minister on Monday defied pressure to quit
ahead of the unveiling of an austerity plan later this week and
a 2011 budget on Dec. 7, but said he would then call an early

 Bund futures  rallied to a session high of 128.94,
up a full point on the day, while 10-year cash yields
 fell back towards the key psychological level of
2.5 percent.
 The 10-year Spanish/German yield spread hit a new euro
lifetime high of 237 bps and the equivalent Irish spread was 44
basis points wider and back above 600 basis points.
 Portugal and Spain are seen as the next weakest links and
an official from Portugal's main opposition party said it would
allow passage of the minority Socialist government's 2011
budget in the final vote on Nov. 26. [ID:nLSB001015]

(Adds details, quotes, share price)
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine
manufacturer Vestas said on Tuesday it had been chosen as
preferred supplier for wind projects with total capacity of
1,655 megawatts, to be installed in Spain in 2012-14.
 An order of that size would be significant for Vestas, the
world's largest wind turbine maker, which has forecast its 2010
order intake will reach 8,000-9,000 MW, falling to 7,000-8,000
MW the year after.
 As a rule of thumb, turbine orders are considered to be
worth about 1 million euros per MW, so landing all the projects
for which it is preferred supplier could be worth 1.6 billion to
1.7 billion euros ($2.17-$2.31 billion) to Vestas.
 Vestas Wind Systems A/S said in a statement its position as
""preferred technology partner"" was confirmed by the regional
government of Galicia following a public tender.
 More than 70 percent of tender capacity of 2,325 MW has been
awarded to 20 bidding companies that submitted proposals based
exclusively on its technology, Vestas said.
 ""Vestas will continue negotiations with the companies and
orders will be announced as they become firm and unconditional
and, moreover, comply with Vestas' rules of disclosure,"" said
Vestas, which on Monday forecast no growth in profit and revenue
next year. 
 Normally Vestas only announces firm and unconditional
orders, but investor relations chief Peter Kruse said it made an
exception this time because the potential orders were so large.
 Kruse said the remaining 30 percent of the 2,325 MW would be
delivered by a number of Vestas rivals, but did not name them.
 Vestas shares, which dropped 5.3 percent on Monday when its
revised 2011 guidance and restatement of historical revenue
disappointed analysts, rose 0.4 percent to 169.80 crowns by 1538
GMT, outperforming a soft Copenhagen bourse.
 ""The Spanish market is one where Vestas is making very big
efforts,"" Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen told Reuters.
 ""They are preferred supplier for a large part of approved
projects, and that is a big sign of strength in a market where
(Spanish rival) Gamesa is,"" Pedersen said.
 ""That supports my view the company is technologically and
geographically very well positioned.""

 By Marcel Michelson
 AMSTERDAM, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Throwing Ireland out of the
euro zone or splitting the single currency area into a weak and
a strong bloc should be ruled out as potential responses to
Dublin's debt crisis, the Dutch Finance Minister said on
Tuesday.
 ""Throwing Ireland out of the euro is not a good idea, it
would provoke a chain of unwanted effects,"" Jan Kees de Jager
told the RTL 7 television broadcaster.
 ""If you ... (allowed) southern countries to devalue, then
this would hurt our exports and our economy.""
 Investors in Irish banks will have to take haircuts as part
of a restructuring of Ireland's banking system, just like the
country itself will have to pay dearly for outside help, he
added.
 The amount of public funds needed to clean up Irish bank was
not yet known, but there would be no free ride for private
investors.
 ""Shareholders and holders of subordinated bonds in Irish
banks will have to bleed in a restructuring,"" he said.
 Dublin has already said it will intensify reforms of its
banks and surplus businesses will have to be discarded..
Analysts said there was limited scope to sell assets.
 De Jager said Ireland would need to cut spending but had to
be careful about raising taxes. ""It could be better to raise the
VAT rate than the corporate tax rate,"" he said.

 By Luciana Lopez
 SAO PAULO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Disappointing data on
Brazil's inflation rate on Tuesday fueled fears that the
central bank might need to hike interest rates and added to
nervousness about the economic team still to be appointed by
President-elect Dilma Rousseff.
 Brazil also reported its current account deficit worsened
in October from a year earlier, and investors priced in steeper
borrowing costs.
 Consumer prices jumped more than expected in the month to
mid-November, pushing inflation farther from the center of a
government target. For more see [ID:nN23291561].
 Markets are keenly awaiting Rousseff's appointment of her
economic team, with investors worried about the willingness to
make tough policy choices.
 ""You have to have confidence that the economic team coming
in realizes the risk and rewards of each policy instrument, and
quite frankly what the market would want to see is a strong
central bank and a fiscal adjustment, given the excesses of the
last years,"" said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a strategist at RBS
Securities.
 A spokeswoman for Rousseff said the president-elect could
announce her choices for the Finance Ministry and central bank
by Thursday.
 The worsening of the current account deficit in October was
partly a reflection of an increasingly stronger -- and
worrisome -- currency. [ID:nN23101977]
 Despite the short-term worries, few economists see Brazil
abandoning the policies -- such as inflation targeting and a
floating exchange rate -- that have helped turn Latin America's
largest economy into an emerging market powerhouse,
 Nevertheless, speculation has swirled around Rousseff's
possible picks. With Guido Mantega set to remain finance
minister, focus has shifted to the next central bank head.
 A source on Monday told Reuters that current chief Henrique
Meirelles would leave, fanning market concerns that the next
administration could chip away at the bank's de facto autonomy.
[ID:nSAQ002535].
 ""There's all this context of doubt and uncertainty about
the next government and the pressure from the inflation indices
that's giving the market more room to demand a greater
premium,"" said Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist for CM
Capital Markets in Sao Paulo.
 Local media reported on Tuesday that Rousseff is
considering tapping Alexandre Tombini, head of financial
regulation at the central bank and a market favorite, to take
over his boss's seat.
 The central bank declined to comment.
 Yields on interest rate futures contracts <0#DIJ:> rose
after data showed the 12-month inflation rate rose to 5.47
percent to mid-November from 5.03 percent to mid-October. The
yield on the contract due January 2012 , among the most
highly traded of the early session, rose as high as 11.9
percent from 11.77 percent on Monday -- its highest since
mid-July, implying more than 2 percentage points of hikes by
the end of 2011.
 The benchmark Selic lending rate is currently at 10.75
percent, one of the highest among major economies.
 CENTRAL BANK POSSIBILITIES
 Tombini was one of the architects of Brazil's inflation
targeting regime, which was adopted in 1999 and helped usher in
the price stability and economic boom of recent years. His
appointment -- or the appointment of a handful of other
relatively hawkish figures -- could help the markets recover
confidence in the bank's independence.
 One of those possibilities, Octavio de Barros of Banco
Bradesco , appeared to take himself out of the
running in an interview online with newsmagazine Exame.
 ""It's very kind to see my name mentioned, but people who
know me understand very well that I don't have this ambition.
This is not merely rhetorical. I absolutely do not,"" he said.
 Rousseff has stressed that she wants to see lower real
interest rates, or nominal rates minus inflation.
 The government's inflation target for this year and next is
4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.
 Brazilian interest rates remain among the world's highest,
a legacy of years of runaway prices and the country's history
as an underperforming economic basketcase.
 But the country has become a bright spot in recent years,
with economic expansion this year seen at 7 percent or more --
a stark contrast to still-struggling developed economies such
as the United States and Japan.

 * Agricultural subsidies still open
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russia has entered the final
stage of its 17-year-bid to join the World Trade Organization
and outstanding issues should be resolved in the coming months,
Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina said on Tuesday.
 The comments indicate that the largest economy still outside
the 153-member WTO could join the body that regulates world
trade in the course of 2011.
 ""This is the final stage of our accession negotiations,""
Nabiullina told reporters.
 Nabiullina said she would be in Brussels on Wednesday to
discuss differences with the European Union, mainly the question
of export duties levied by Russia on raw materials, with a view
to settling them within a short time.
 Talks with the United States in recent months had largely
settled differences between the two powers that had been
impossible to solve for years, she said.
 U.S. backing for Russian membership, as part of a broader
improvement in relations between Moscow and Washington, injected
new momentum into Russia's bid in September. [ID:nLDE68K25C]
 
 EXPORT DUTIES
 But EU trade chief Karel De Gucht has said Russian export
duties -- which drive up the cost of inputs for European
manufacturers such as the Nordic timber and paper industries --
are so important that Brussels will not be hurried into a deal
just to keep up the momentum for Russian membership.
 Under WTO rules, candidate countries must reach bilateral
agreements with any existing member that wants one, as well as
with a working party representing the entire membership.
 Nabiullina said Russia still had to tackle several of these
multilateral issues.
 ""We still have some outstanding multilateral issues, but we
believe that we would be able to conclude negotiations on these
issues within the next few months,"" Nabiullina said, speaking
through an interpreter.
 Russia is due to hold negotiations with the working party in
early December, and again in early 2011.
 The outstanding multilateral issues, of interest to about a
dozen countries, include the level of subsidy that Russia will
pay its farmers -- a sensitive topic as other WTO members try to
cap agricultural support among themselves under the long-running
Doha round.
 Another topic is the tariff rate quota for beef -- the
amount of beef that Russia will allow in under a special low
tariff.
 At some point Russia and other WTO members will also have to
address Georgia's objections to Russian membership of the WTO.
 Georgia says Russia cannot join the WTO because its support
of two breakaway regions of Georgia, following a brief war
between the two former Soviet neighbours in summer 2008,
deprives Tbilisi of control of customs points on its
internationally recognised frontier.
 Under the WTO's system of decision by consensus, Georgia has
an effective veto over Russian membership. It is allowing
negotiations to proceed informally but is blocking formal steps.
 Nabiullina was speaking after Russia, Kazakhstan and
Belarus, which formed a customs union this year, launched
free-trade talks with the four-member European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) comprising Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and
Liechtenstein.
 The three ex-Soviet republics will negotiate with EFTA as a
single bloc but are pursuing membership of the WTO individually
after abandoning efforts to join the WTO as one customs union.
Nabiullina said she expected Russia to conclude its WTO
negotiations slightly ahead of Kazakhstan, which has been in
talks for almost 16 years, but said all three candidate
countries are coordinating their negotiating position.

(Adds fall in savings rate, GfK report)
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Germany's growth rate slowed in
the third quarter as a construction boom ran out of steam, but
the outlook stayed upbeat as a more balanced recovery took hold
and a survey showed business activity accelerated in November.
 Quarterly gross domestic product growth in Europe's largest
economy eased to 0.7 percent from 2.3 percent in the second
quarter, seasonally adjusted figures from the Federal Statistics
Office showed on Tuesday, confirming preliminary data.
 But a detailed breakdown pointed to an increasingly balanced
recovery, with export expansion easing and foreign trade playing
a smaller role in an overall positive growth picture that stands
in increasingly stark contrast to the economic gloom enveloping
many other parts of the euro zone.
 A separate report surveying purchasing managers suggested
the economy is performing better than expected going into 2011,
as growth in the services sector help to add jobs and reduce
unemployment.
 The GDP data showed that spending on the seasonally volatile
construction sector contributed nothing to growth, having added
0.7 points in the second quarter. The new growth mix was
welcomed by economists and ministers.
 ""Germany will remain the growth engine of the euro zone in
2011 -- we're expecting a self-sustaining upturn that will be
increasingly supported by domestic demand,"" said Ulrike Kastens
from Sal. Oppenheim.
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said the figures showed
the economy was experiencing a ""golden autumn"", while the head
of Germany's employers' association, Dieter Hundt, forecast 2010
growth would beat the government's forecast and post a 3.5
percent rise.
 The overall slowdown was partly offset by steady growth in
private consumption, which expanded for the third quarter in a
row and lent the same contribution to growth as in the previous
quarter.
 Domestic demand added 0.4 percentage points to GDP in the
July-September period -- making a larger contribution to growth
than foreign trade, which lent only 0.3 percentage points after
0.5 percentage points in the previous quarter.
 ""The growth impulses came both domestically and from
abroad,"" said Klaus Schruefer from SEB. ""The economic recovery
is broadening out increasingly.""
 Separate data from the statistics office suggested Germans
were spending more -- in the third quarter they put aside only
9.6 percent of their income, as compared to 11 percent in the
second quarter and 15.2 percent in the first.
 
 'GOLDEN DECADE' BECKONS?
 German investors have turned unexpectedly upbeat about the
economy's prospects for the coming months, a key survey showed
last week, fuelled by growing optimism about the domestic labour
market and the U.S. outlook. The country suffered its biggest
postwar recession in 2009 when its economy contracted 4.7
percent. Driven by exports and helped by stronger-than-usual
consumer sentiment, it has emerged quickly from the slump and
left most of its euro zone peers trailing.
 Austerity measures to reduce public sector deficits are
squeezing activity in a number of European states. But Germany's
economy is proving more resilient than others so far to budget
cutbacks, a subdued global trade environment and a strong euro.
 It also looks well positioned to weather debt woes hitting
weaker members of the euro currency bloc, leaving economists
increasingly upbeat about its future prospects.
 ""Looking ahead, the German economy is not only heading
towards the best growth year since reunification but is also at
the beginning of what could become a golden decade,"" said
Carsten Brzeski from ING Financial Markets.
 ""It's hard to find reasons for a sudden stop of the current
momentum,"" he added. ""Even the new sovereign debt woes and the
Irish bailout should leave the German economy rather unharmed.""
 Official forecasts released last month show the government
expects the economy to expand by 3.4 percent this year and by
1.8 percent in 2011.
 Uplifted consumers may now be set to play an even greater
role in the recovery -- consumer morale as measured by market
researchers GfK rose more than expected going into December,
data released later on Tuesday showed.
 The rise put GfK's headline indicator at its highest level
since October 2007, painting a rosy picture for the coming
Christmas shopping season and possibly giving a sign consumers
may up their demand for imports from other EU countries.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2010 08:24AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-EU facing crisis over debt and communication," * Poor message management exacerbating EU debt crisis
 * Risk of problems spreading to Portugal, Spain remains
 * EU's permanent crisis plan causing more uncertainty
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The European Union has deployed
billions of euros and endless words to try to contain its
sovereign debt crisis this year, but poor communication and bad
timing have left financial markets unconvinced.
 The communications problems haven't caused the crisis --
excessive government borrowing, inflated bank lending and poor
macroeconomic management have done that. But they have
exacerbated it, making it harder to stop the rot spreading from
Greece to Ireland and maybe Portugal.
 EU leaders and euro zone officials unaccustomed to speaking
publicly on sensitive finance issues have at times misspoken or
been contradictory, and new ideas have been proposed when they
were less than fully formed, increasing market uncertainty.
 ""Sometimes the solutions put forward and the communications
are just too short-sighted,"" said Carsten Brzeski, an economist
at ING in Brussels who works closely with trading desks.
 ""It's not the cause of the problem, but several times it has
accentuated it. Euro zone officials are simply not used to how
to handle the financial markets.""
 One example last week came from Herman Van Rompuy, the
president of the European Council, who as a former Belgian prime
minister and senior budget official might have known better.
 Speaking on the day euro zone finance ministers were meeting
to discuss a possible bailout of Ireland, with markets on edge,
he described the EU as being in a ""survival crisis"".
 ""We all have to work together in order to survive with the
euro zone because if we don't survive with the euro zone, we
will not survive with the European Union,"" he said, sending the
euro weaker and bond yields soaring on Irish and Greek debt.
 On Tuesday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
warned the euro was at stake, denting its value.
 After Van Rompuy spoke, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner
for economic and monetary affairs and one of the most prominent
figures handling the crisis, was quick to dismiss talk of
""existential alarmism"". But the damage had been done.
 Addressing the European Parliament on Monday, Rehn
acknowledged the delivery of the message had to improve.
 ""We need to explain better why we are doing what we are
doing, and we have to reassure our citizens. These are tough and
confusing times. They have brought forward nervousness and
misinformation and therefore we all need to do our share in
communicating properly on the challenges,"" he said.
 
 PERMANENT CRISIS PLANNING
 Communication is only part of trying to calm financial
markets and overcome the crisis. Most of the work clearly needs
to be done by Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain to get their
budget deficits and debt levels down and shore up banks.
 But that is going to take years and is often only measurable
in data released by the month or quarter. In the meantime, EU
officials are being urged constantly to comment on the rapidly
changing situation, providing more grist to the mill.
 ""We're asking people to provide leadership as politicians
and sometimes you want them to say things clearly, but that gets
broken down by financial markets,"" said Janis Emmanouilidis, a
senior analyst at the European Policy Centre, a think tank.
 ""You have to be very careful these days and it's not just
the financial markets. In the EU, if someone says something, it
gets examined and broken down by the capitals in every member
state. The situation is so tense among 27 states and the
markets. It's a difficult balance to maintain.""
 One of the most unsettling issues for markets has been
Germany's push to create a permanent system for handling euro
zone crises. Chancellor Angela Merkel wants it because the
current system is taxpayer funded and may violate a clause in
the EU's fundamental treaty against bailouts.
 The system, to be introduced from mid-2013 if EU member
states agree on how it would work, would involve private
bondholders -- banks and investment funds -- taking a hit on
sovereign debt holdings if a country defaults.
 The idea is sound in principle -- there's no reason why
private sovereign bondholders should have a one-way bet with
taxpayers effectively bailing them out in a crisis -- and many
in the financial markets acknowledge that.
 But because the mechanism is still being worked on, there's
no clarity on how much of a hit bondholders would have to take,
or how defaults or debt restructurings would be handled.
 As a result, markets have begun pricing those concerns into
riskier debt, marking down the price of Greek, Irish and
Portuguese bonds further, aggravating the crisis.
 ""When it comes to the permanent crisis mechanism, the
Germans totally underestimated the market impact,"" said Brzeski.
 ""We are now in a situation where markets are hanging on the
lips of politicians... but they are not always up to the
communication skills and not always very well advised.""
 The solution, some analysts suggest, is for a single
official with long experience of handling markets, such as the
European Central Bank Governor Jean-Claude Trichet, to take the
lead. But the European Union does not work like that.
 The alternative, others suggest, would be for EU officials
to keep quiet until they have a clear and precise plan worked
out to stop the debt contagion spreading any further.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2010 08:20AM ET</span>",Canada bond yields seen rising in year ahead-poll," * Two-year yield seen rising to 2.6 pct in 12 months
 * 10-year yield forecast at 3.6 pct in a year
 * Most consensus forecasts higher than Sept poll
 
 By Jeffrey Hodgson and Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Canadian T-bill and bond yields
are expected to climb in the coming year and consensus forecasts
are mostly higher than they were two months ago, a Reuters poll
showed on Tuesday.
 The move reflects an improved outlook for the Canadian
economy, which has been boosted by rising commodity prices and
aggressive action by the U.S. Federal Reserve to jump-start
growth there, analysts said.
 ""You've had the Fed saying they'll do whatever is required.
That's chopped off a bit of the distribution for forecasts away
from the worst possible scenarios for growth,"" said Mark
Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at
RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""That affects (Canada) certainly because of the potential
for U.S. domestic demand growing.""
 Chandler noted that an improving growth outlook for many
emerging countries has also helped boost commodity prices.
Canada is a major commodity exporter.
 The poll of 15 strategists comes after the U.S. Federal
Reserve this month launched a fresh effort to support a
struggling U.S. economy, committing to buy $600 billion in
government bonds with newly created money.
 The Reuters poll found the median forecast for the
rate-sensitive two-year bond yield, currently around 1.61
percent, trading a percentage point higher a year from now, at
2.6 percent. In September, the 12-month forecast was 2.25
percent.
 The two-year yield is seen trading around where it is now in
three months and at 1.85 percent in six months.
 The 10-year bond yield, at 3.08 percent, is expected to
climb to 3.20 percent in six months and 3.59 percent a year from
now. In September, the consensus was 3.18 percent and 3.48
percent respectively.
 In terms of domestic rate policy, many believe any further
Bank of Canada rate hikes may have been pushed further into 2011
as a result of the Fed's decision.
 Central bank Governor Mark Carney warned in recent months
that while Canada sets its own monetary policy, there are limits
to how much it can diverge from the United States.
 ""We have a better sense of how the Fed will position
themselves. They will carry out purchases through the first half
of the year. As a result, we've pushed back our Bank of Canada

strategist at TD Securities.
 ""We're still keeping (the 2011) year-end overnight rate at 2
percent, so what we've basically done is just consolidate all
the hikes into the second half of the year.""
 The Bank of Canada has hiked rates three times this year,
bringing its key policy rate to 1 percent. Most of Canada's
primary securities dealers forecast last month that the Bank of
Canada will keep interest rates unchanged until sometime after
the first quarter of 2011.
 The latest Reuters poll predicted three-month T-bill yields,
now at 0.97 percent, will rise to 1.1 percent in six months and
2 percent in 12 months.

(Adds detail, updates prices)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Tuesday after
North Korea shelled a South Korean island, adding geopolitical
tension to concerns over Europe's debt crisis and driving
investors to the relative safety of the U.S. currency.
 The euro also took a knock after German finance minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said the single currency was at stake due to
the Irish debt crisis.
 The South Koreans returned fire after the shelling by North
Korea, military and South Korean media reported, exacerbating
the risk aversion gripping global financial markets heading into
the end of the year.
 ""Tension in the region has led to a knee-jerk reaction in
currencies and stocks, but they tend not to have an everlasting
impact,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global
Banking.
 ""Focus will shift back to the euro, and we believe euro zone
peripheral issues have some more time to run. Investors will go
after Portugal and then Spain after Ireland is done.""
 The dollar index was up 0.4 percent at 79.016, but off its
intra-day high of 79.116. The euro was down 0.6 percent on the
day at $1.3535, after shedding around half a U.S. cent when the
Korean clash was reported.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 83.40 yen,
having risen as high as 83.85 yen. Traders said macro funds
buying the dollar after the shelling ran into robust offers from
Japanese exporters. 
 The move took the pair briefly above its Ichimoku cloud, a
closely watched Japanese technical indicator, for the first time
in five months at 83.63.
 In the United States, the minutes from the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee's last board meeting on Nov 2 and 3 will
be released.
 ""The main thing from the FOMC minutes will be how much
support for QE2 was there at the meeting,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS.
 
 CONFIDENCE IN EURO BRITTLE
 Many investors are not convinced that aid to Ireland will
prevent other heavily indebted members of the 16-country bloc
from seeking aid.
 Portugal and Spain are seen as the next weakest links.
 An official from Portugal's main opposition party said it
would allow passage of the minority Socialist government's 2011
budget in the final vote on Nov. 26. 
 But Spain's short-term cost of borrowing almost doubled at a
tender on Tuesday.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen defied pressure to quit,
saying on Monday he would stay in office until parliament passed
a budget on Dec. 7, then call an election.
 Irish and other peripheral government bond yield spreads
widened and the cost of insuring higher-yielding euro zone
sovereign debt against default rose as markets fretted over
whether Ireland's embattled government will get its budget
passed.
 The euro has already lost 5 percent against the greenback
this month, retreating from a nine-month high hit on Nov. 4.
 Support for the euro is seen at $1.3446, the Nov. 16 trough,
a break of which could pave the way for a retest of $1.3333, the
August high, which some analysts said would confirm a developing
downtrend for the single currency.
 Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars shed ground as
the tension on the Korean peninsula prompted investors to unwind
some long positions built in those high-yielding currencies.
 The Australian dollar was down 0.8 percent at $0.9806 while
the kiwi fell to $0.7652, its lowest since Nov. 17.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday
while the dollar rose across the board after tensions in the
Korean peninsula prompted investors to trim risky assets, and
the euro stayed under pressure as Ireland's debt crisis raged
on.
 North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells at a South
Korean island, killing two soldiers and setting houses ablaze in
one of the heaviest attacks on its neighbour since the Korean
War ended in 1953. 
 The incident soured sentiment in global financial markets
already rattled by concerns that a rescue package for Ireland
may not stop problems from spreading to other indebted euro zone
countries.
 In Korea, stock futures and the won tumbled in a late
selloff and more downside was expected on Wednesday.
 ""Tension in the region has led to a knee-jerk reaction in
currencies and stocks,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at
RBS Global Banking.
 ""Focus will shift back to the euro and we believe euro zone
peripheral issues have some more time to run. Investors will go

The MSCI world equity index and the Thomson Reuters global
stock index both fell 0.6 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index lost more than half a percent
while U.S. stock futures fell around 0.7 percent, pointing to a
weaker open on Wall Street.
 In Korea, December KOSPI 200 index futures fell 2.4 percent
while the dollar rose more than 4 percent against the won in
offshore trade before trimming gains.
 Emerging stocks dropped 1.7 percent.
 U.S. crude oil fell 0.5 percent to $81.27 a barrel.
 
 IRISH JITTERS
 Bund futures attracted in safe-haven demand to rise 40
ticks.
 Irish and other peripheral government bond yield spreads
widened and the cost of insuring higher-yielding euro zone
sovereign debt against default rose as markets fretted over
whether Ireland's embattled government would be able to pass a
budget.
 The Irish Prime Minister on Monday defied pressure to quit
ahead of the unveiling of an austerity plan later this week and
a 2011 budget on Dec. 7, but said he would then call an early
election. 
 ""Given that this political uncertainty puts at risk the
four-year budget plan, this is definitely not helping the market

 * Dep PM Sechin sees no gas price deal until mid-2011
 * China, Russia trade is booming
 * Putin, Wen did not discuss North Korean strike
 
 (Updates with Putin, Wen quotes, details)
 By Alissa de Carbonnel
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Moscow and Beijing
are unlikely to agree the price of Russian gas supplies to China
before mid-2011, Russia's top energy official said, but the two
countries' prime ministers noted on Tuesday bilateral trade was
booming.
 Russia, the world's biggest energy producer, is eager to
increase sales of gas to the fastest growing major economy but
price proved a sticking point in the talks between Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao. 
 ""I think by next summer we will be able to discuss concrete
parameters for a commercial contract (on gas supplies),"" Igor
Sechin, who holds sway over Russia's energy sector, told
reporters after meeting Chinese officials. 
 Russia says China should pay prices similar to those Gazprom
charges European customers, but Beijing wants a discount. The
sides were about $100 per 1,000 cubic metres apart, according to
Chinese officials last week. 
 Under a deal signed between Gazprom and China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC) on Sept. 27, Gazprom will sell 30 billion
cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year to China from 2015. Putin
said the gas talks were ""successfully moving forward"". 
 
 IMPORTANT MARKET
 Putin, Russia's paramount leader, will have to grapple with
China's drive to secure gas supplies from Central Asian
producers such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and the
implications of growing production of shale gas for expensive
pipeline projects.
 ""China is an extremely important market for us, which we
must imperatively work in,"" Sechin said, adding that China has
the capacity to meet only 7 percent of its gas needs internally.
 Under the deal the two countries will have to build the
Altai gas pipeline -- stretching from Siberia to China's Western
border with Russia. 
 After the meeting, which took place in Russia's northern
city of St.Petersburg, Putin and Wen said bilateral trade rose
by 57 percent to $41 billion this year and praised an agreement
to boost the use of the yuan and rouble. 
 ""So far we have been paying each other in foreign
currencies, first of all in dollars. Now, and this is only the
first step, trade in the rouble has started in China. In
December the yuan will be traded in Moscow,"" Putin said. 
 China accounts for 8.3 percent of Russia's total trade. It
is on track to overtake Germany as Russia's biggest trade
partner after discounting the Netherlands, formally the biggest
partner because its liberal corporate legislation encourages
many Russian firms to register there.
 Putin said Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, had negotiated a
$2 billion loan from China's Eximbank to finance joint projects.
 Russian firm Atomstroyexport and China's Jiangsu Nuclear
Power Corporation (JNPC) signed a deal to build two more
reactors at the Tianwan nuclear power station, the first Chinese
nuclear power plant using Russian technology. 
 The two leaders did not discuss North Korea's attack on a
South Korean island and focused on the economy, Putin's
spokesman said, although Wen mentioned political cooperation
between the two emerging powers in his statement. 
 ""We plan on continuing our cooperation ... toward the
formation of a fair world,"" Wen said, pointing to formats such
as Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a regional security
group whose prime ministers are set to meet later this week.

 * Germany has become role model for Europe - Fin Min

(Updates with quotes, details)
 By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble warned on Tuesday that the euro itself was at stake in
the currency bloc's sovereign debt crisis, knocking around a
third of a cent off the common currency's value.
 ""We're surrounded by a difficult environment in Europe,""
Schaeuble told parliament, referring to a debt crisis that has
now engulfed Ireland as well as Greece and threatens to spread
further.
 ""I'd like to make clear that our joint currency is at stake
and we have to take over responsibility.
 ""If we can't lastingly defend it jointly as a stable
currency, the economic and social consequences would be
incalculable,"" he said. ""That's our responsibility that we have
to face in this difficult situation.""
 Schaeuble told parliament that Germany itself is not
swimming in money but rather drowning in debt even though its
fiscal situation has improved slightly this year thanks to
strong economic growth.
 He said Germany's austerity drive was a model for Europe and
said budget consolidation efforts must continue despite the
slightly improved budget deficit situation due to strong
economic growth and higher tax revenues. 
 ""Some believe we're swimming in money,"" Schaeuble said in a
debate about the 2011 budget. ""We're not swimming in money but
rather drowning in debt and we're trying to defend ourselves.""
 News earlier this month that tax revenues were better than
expected led to calls for tax cuts from within Chancellor Angela
Merkel's centre-right coalition [ID:nBAT005745] -- especially
from the Free Democrat coalition partners [ID:nLDE6A32L2]
 
 MOTOR
 Schaeuble said that earlier this year there were doubts
about the German push to reduce deficits was the right remedy
for the debt crisis. But he said Germany, where the recovery was
strong, had been vindicated with its drive to consolidate.
 ""In the meantime Germany has become a growth motor for
Europe and beyond,"" he said.
 ""And that's why we have a responsibility to show we're on
the right track with solid fiscal policies -- reducing deficits
and securing a basis for employment.""
 Schaeuble added Germany's strong recovery had helped give
the country's ""social-market economy"" a better name around the
world. ""The social market economy is now seen in a more positive
light around the world than a year ago,"" he said.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Tuesday after
North Korea shelled a South Korean island, adding geopolitical
tension to Europe's debt crisis and driving investors to the
relative safety of the U.S. currency.
 The shelling by North Korea triggered return fire by the
South, military and South Korean media reported, exacerbating

year end..
 ""Tension in the region has led to knee-jerk reaction in
currencies and stocks but they tend not to have an everlasting

 ""Focus will shift back to the euro and we believe euro zone
peripheral issues have some more time to run. Investors will go

 Trading was choppy in Asia with a holiday in Japan reducing
liquidity. These conditions were seen prevailing this week with
the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday looming.
 The dollar index was up 0.3 percent at 78.90, but off its
intra-day high of 79.116. The euro was down 0.4 percent on the
day at $1.3561, dropping from around $1.3600 when the Korean
clash was reported. Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the euro
was down 0.4 percent at 1.3431 francs.
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent against the yen at 83.65 yen,
from 83.40 yen before the shelling began. Traders said macro
funds buying the dollar after the shelling began ran into offers
from Japanese exporters. More exporter offers were seen at
83.80-84.00 yen level.
 ""Military skirmishes on the Korean peninsula are not helping
investors in local equity markets,"" said Chris Turner, chief
currency strategist at ING. ""Dollar/yen is trending higher and
some better U.S. activity data and higher U.S. yields could take
dollar/yen above 84.""
 
 CONFIDENCE IN EURO BRITTLE
 The skirmishes are likely to heighten anxiety amongst
investors already on edge over the euro zone debt crisis. Many
are not convinced aid to Ireland will prevent other heavily-
indebted members of the 16-country bloc from seeking aid.
 Indeed, Canada's finance minister said on Monday he was
pressing the European Union to address the Portuguese debt
crisis quickly, although he fell short of saying the country
would need a bailout like Ireland.
 Portugal and Spain are seen as the next weakest links.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen defied pressure to quit,
saying on Monday he would stay in office until parliament passed
a budget on Dec. 7, then call an election.
 The euro was already down 5 percent against the
greenback this month, retreating from a nine-month high hit on
Nov. 4.

a break of which could pave the way for a retest of $1.3333, the

downtrend for the single currency.
 The euro was flat at 113.48 yen, well below Monday's highs
of 114.98 yen.
 Both the Australian and the New Zealand dollar shed more
than 1 percent as the tensions on the Korean peninsula prompted
investors to unwind some long positions built in those
high-yielding currencies.
 The Australian dollar was down nearly 0.9 percent at $0.9805
while the kiwi lost more than 1 percent to fall to $0.7652, its
lowest since Nov. 17.

 LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Economic recovery in the
struggling euro zone accelerated this month as a resurgence in
private sector activity in Germany and France offset stagnation
in periphery members, surveys showed on Tuesday.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from banks
to hotels, bounced to 55.2 in November from a final reading of
53.3 in October.
 The index comfortably exceeded expectations it would fall to
53.1 and has now been above the 50.0 mark that divides growth
from contraction since August 2009.
 ""It's very much a Franco-Germany growth performance story.
Outside of France and Germany the indications are that we may
have stopped contracting but at best we are stagnating there,""
said Chris Williamson at Markit.
 Earlier data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed
activity in both its services and manufacturing sectors smashed
expectations, with the service sector expanding at its fastest
pace since August 2007.
 In neighbouring France the manufacturing sector had its best
month in 10 years, while its services sector came in much better
than expected but smaller bloc members continue to struggle.
 The European Union and International Monetary Fund agreed on
Sunday to help bail out Ireland with loans to tackle its banking
and budget crisis in a bid to protect Europe's financial
stability.
 That will be the second euro zone bailout in six months,
after Greece accepted help in May and there are concerns that
this may not be the last rescue package in the region.
 The euro zone as a whole escaped from its deepest recession
in post-war history in the third quarter of last year, having
pumped billions of euros into recovery measures, and relatively
strong second-quarter growth of 1.0 percent surprised markets.
 But growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the third quarter and
analysts in a Reuters poll expect the economy to expand by
between 0.2 and 0.4 percent per quarter through to the end of
next year.
 The manufacturing sector, the main driver of the economic
recovery last year, also beat expectations in November.
 The euro zone flash manufacturing index rose to 55.5 in
November from a final reading of 54.6 in October, beating
forecasts for a dip to 54.4, while the output index jumped to
55.9 this month, from 54.7 in October.
 The composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
leapt to 55.4 this month from 53.8 in October, confounding
expectations for 53.6.
 ""We are consistent with (fourth-quarter economic) growth of
about 0.5 percent,"" Williamson said.
 
 BACKLOGS BREAK EVEN
 The service sector backlogs of work index jumped to 49.9
this month from October's 48.8 -- the first time it had been
below break even since the start of the year -- suggesting the
upturn was being driven by new business rather than working down
existing orders.
 Manufacturing firms were able to pass on rising input costs
to customers while still increasing business as the output price
index climbed to 54.9 this month from October's 53.8, its
highest reading since September 2008. 
 Prices in the 16-nation bloc rose 1.9 percent in October,
nudging closer to the European Central Bank's 2.0 percent target
ceiling.
 The composite employment index will provide some cheer to
policymakers as it climbed to 53.0 from October's 51.1, its
highest reading since February 2008.
 Official figures showed euro zone unemployment rose to 10.1
percent in September and economists in a Reuters poll see it
rising higher next year.

 By Yoo Choonsik	
 SEOUL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - South Korean stock futures and
the won tumbled on Tuesday and are set to fall further on
Wednesday after North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells
at a South Korea island in the heaviest bombardment by the
reclusive state in decades.	
 South Korea and the United States condemned Pyongyang
after the clash, which Seoul said killed two soldiers and
wounded 17 other soldiers and three civilians.	
 The bombardments on the island, just about 10 km (6 miles)
from the maritime border with the North, lasted for more than
an hour and the news broke at the end of trading for Seoul's
spot markets.	
 ""The news came at a time when market sentiment was already
weakened by European debt and Chinese tightening concerns. And
combined, the stock market will do poorly tomorrow,"" said
Chung Seung-jae, market analyst at Mirae Asset Securities.	
 ""Artillery firing on a residential area was unlike its
other acts of aggression. And this is alarming.""	
 December KOSPI 200 index futures  fell 2.4 percent
in a late selloff as the news broke at the end of the trading
day just as the cash market was closing.	
 The benchmark KOSPI lost just 0.8 percent,
suggesting the index will suffer a knock-on drop early
Wednesday. Korean government bond futures  also took a
hit on worries about foreign selling.	
 The dollar soared more than 4 percent against the won in
offshore trade before trimming gains. Dollar/won one-month
offshore forwards jumped as high as 1,180 before
pulling back to near 1,160, up about 2.5 percent.	
 The dollar had gained about 1 percent in local spot trade
to 1,137.5 .	
 South Korea benchmark sovereign CDS spreads widened about
15 basis points to 102 basis points after the news. They had
been near 74 basis points earlier this month, the tightest
levels since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.	
 The Korean news comes at a time when investors are already
nervous about Ireland's debt crisis and whether it will spread
to other peripheral countries in the euro zone.
One concern for policymakers in Seoul will be
the potential for capital flight by foreign investors, who
have flooded fast-growing emerging markets with cash in the
absence of strong returns in developed economies.
The central bank said it would cooperate with
the government to stabilise markets if necessary following the
exchange of artillery fire. [ID:nSEV000234]	
 South Korea has been one of the biggest recipients of
foreign inflows in Asia outside of Japan this year, with the
stock market taking in $15.5 billion of funds -- nearly 30
percent of all coming into the region -- and the bond market
also a big favourite.	
 Military clashes in the past had a limited impact on
financial markets in South Korea. But investors have become
more sensitive to flare-ups on the Korean peninsula in the
past few years.	
 Residents from the island were fleeing on fishing boats,
Seoul media reported, and witnesses said several houses were
still burning hours after the attacks. 
 President Lee Myung-bak convened an emergency meeting of
security ministers, while other financial authorities
including the central bank held meetings of senior officials.	
 Financial authorities will hold another meeting before
markets open on Wednesday to check the markets situation
overnight and to discuss possible measures. 
 There was no indication if the government would impose any
measures in financial markets, such as shortening trading
hours or banning specific types of trading.	
 South and North Korea have been technically at war for
more than half a century because their 1950-53 conflict ended
in a truce.

 HONG KONG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose broadly
after North Korea fired artillery at a South Korean island,
sending investors in search of safety and putting geopolitical
risk alongside Europe's debt crisis as reasons to play it safe
to the year end. 
 The shelling by North Korea prompted return fire by the
South, military and domestic South Korean media reported, and
brought tensions on the peninsula to a recent high, at a time
when risk reduction was already gripping global financial
markets. [ID:nL3E6MN09Z] 
 ""The market was already quite nervous given the failure of
the Irish bailout package to calm sentiment towards other
peripheral countries. Bad news on geopolitics may add fuel to
this trend towards position-squaring,"" said Mirza Baig, senior
currency strategist with Deutsche Bank in Singapore. 
 The euro was down 0.4 percent on the day at $1.3561 ,
down from around $1.3600 when the news on Korea broke. 
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent against the yen at 83.65 yen
, up from 83.40 yen before the shelling began. 
 ""We're seeing higher geopolitical risk and significant
market reaction given the scale of the incident,"" said Dariusz
Kowalczyk, strategist with Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.	
 Trading has been choppy with a holiday in Japan taking a
toll on liquidity, a condition that is likely to continue this
week with the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday looming. 
 The market is not convinced that aid to Ireland would
prevent other heavily indebted members of the 16-nation bloc
from also seeking help, analysts said. 
 Indeed, Canada's finance minister said on Monday he is
pressing the European Union to address the Portuguese debt
crisis quickly, although he fell short of saying the country
would need a bailout like Ireland. [ID:nN22292493]

 SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly,
U.S. Treasuries gained and European and Asian shares and U.S.
stock futures fell on Tuesday after a major exchange of
artillery fire on the Korean peninsula.	
 The euro and commodities also dropped as a bailout for
debt-soaked Ireland failed to allay fears of a wider euro zone
crisis.	
 North Korean artillery fired dozens of shells onto a South
Korean island near their disputed sea border, killing one
marine, setting fire to buildings and prompting a return of
fire by the South, Seoul's military and media reported.

 Seoul's financial markets closed as news was still
filtering through but international markets reacted, with the
dollar up 0.4 percent on the day against a basket of currency.
The dollar index rose from 78.77 before the
reports to a session high of 79.12.	
 U.S. 10-year Treasury futures, a traditional safe haven,
were up 0.4 percent  on the day and U.S. S&P
500 stock index futures were down 0.9 percent
 . Gold , another safe haven, reversed
earlier losses to jump to a one-week high.	
 The Korean won tumbled in offshore markets
and the yen eased.	
 European markets, which financial bookmakers had been
calling flat before the Korean news broke, opened down, with
the FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.4 percent, Britain's FTSE
100 down 0.6 percent and France's CAC down 0.7
percent. 
 
 As Beijing tightens monetary policy to rein in inflation,
worries of faltering Chinese demand for raw materials -- in
the short term at least -- knocked metals prices and were
another factor hammering shares, particular in
resource-focused Australia.	
 ""Investors seem unable to move beyond European debt
contagion fears and concerns of further China policy
tightening,"" said IG Markets strategist Ben Potter.	
 The euro had initially spiked on Monday on news of a
European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout for
Ireland, where a property bust has pushed the nation's banks
to the brink of collapse and blown a hole in the public
finances.	
 But it swiftly reversed course as the coalition government
in Dublin, deeply unpopular after presiding over the implosion
of an economy dubbed the ""Celtic Tiger"" for its double-digit
growth in the late 1990s, looked to be facing a struggle to
pass an austerity budget that is a condition of the aid.
[ID:nLDE6AL2AG] 
 The single currency was driven back below $1.36 on
Tuesday as the Irish turmoil stoked fears that a crisis that
has already engulfed Greece will spread to other indebted euro
zone nations, with Portugal and Spain in nervous bond
investors' sights.	
 ""They've addressed the Greek problem, they're addressing
the Irish problem, people are now questioning where is the
next one ... the political turmoil in Ireland also doesn't
help,"" said Grant Turley, strategist at ANZ in Sydney.	
 
 SHARES DIVE	
 Asian stock markets that were still trading when the
Korean news broke extended the day's losses, pushing MSCI's
index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
down 2.2 percent. Tokyo markets were
closed for a holiday.	
 Shares in Hong Kong and Mumbai fell more
then 2 percent.	
 Australian shares , which closed earlier, lost 1.2
percent to hit a seven-week low. Banks and miners led the
retreat, with National Australia Bank down
1.8 percent and BHP Billiton off 1.7 percent.	
 On Monday U.S. financial stocks had slid on fears of
exposure to Europe's debt woes and concerns about a broad
insider trading probe. The KBW bank index
fell 1.5 percent and JPMorgan Chase & Co
fell 2.3 percent. 
 The euro traded around $1.3565, below
Monday's session trough of $1.3574. The single currency had
risen as high as $1.3786 on Monday. 
 ""The fact that sentiment turned so quickly, that the Irish
government is heading towards an election and that Moody's
talked about downgrading Ireland are all not helping,"" said
Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS.	
 ""It reveals a lack of underlying demand for European
sovereign and financial assets and point to the downside risk
for the euro.""	
 Against the yen, the euro slipped to around 113.50
from two-week highs near 115.0 yen.	
 A stronger dollar often weighs on commodity markets,
making assets priced in the U.S. currency more expensive for
holders of other currencies.	
 U.S. crude oil futures lost 62 cents, or nearly 0.8
percent, to trade at $81.12 a barrel, gold
fell around 0.5 percent and copper and zinc were also
weaker.

 * Gas price deal key to gas pipeline project to China
 
 By Alissa de Carbonnel
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart Wen
Jiabao on Tuesday for talks that are likely to focus on a
long-running disagreement over gas pricing.
 Russia, the world's biggest energy producer, is eager to
increase sales of oil, gas and metals to the world's fastest
growing major economy but wrangling over gas prices has delayed
the construction of a key gas pipeline to China.
 Russia says China should pay prices similar to those Gazprom
charges European customers, but Beijing wants a discount. The
sides were about $100 per 1,000 cubic metres apart, according to
Chinese officials last week.
 ""This topic will figure in the negotiations but it is too
early to speak of any possible results,"" Putin's spokesman
Dmitry Peskov said.
 Peskov said that a total of 11 agreements, ranging from oil
supplies and refining to intellectual property and border issues
would be signed during Wen's visit to Russia.
 Putin, Russia's paramount leader, has called for boosting
sales of natural resources -- Russia's main exports -- to China,
whose gas consumption is forecast to soar over the next decade.
 But at the talks, Putin will have to grapple with China's
drive to secure gas supplies from Central Asian producers such
as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and the implications of shale gas
for expensive pipeline projects.
 At stake is access for Russian companies including Gazprom
and Rosneft to China's booming economy, which the International
Energy Agency says is the world's biggest single consumer of
energy.
 Russia is due to start exporting crude oil to China next
year via the new East Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline, but there
is still no Russian gas pipeline to China.
 Gazprom signed a preliminary agreement to build a major gas
pipeline -- known as the Altai gas pipeline -- from Siberia to
China's Western border with Russia in 2006, but the price has
been under discussion ever since.
 Under a deal signed between Gazprom and China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC) on Sept 27, Gazprom will sell 30 billion
cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year to China from 2015 via this
route, though the price has still not been agreed.
 Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who holds sway over
Russia's energy sector, said in September that commercial
contracts could be signed by the middle of 2011.

 * No need for more austerity measures to reduce deficit

(Adds quote, details)
 MADRID, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Spain does not need further
austerity measures to cut its budget deficit, Economy Minister
Elena Salgado said on Monday, rejecting any comparison with
Ireland's appeal for a rescue from its debt crisis.
 Spain has ""absolutely no"" need for a bailout like Ireland's,
Salgado said in a radio interview radio on Monday morning. In
the evening she told CNN+ television the government was taking
sufficient measures to avert a debt crisis.
 Spain's borrowing costs have soared this year as investors
worry that its high deficit and its banks' exposure to bad loans
from a property boom and bust could eventually push it into a
Greek or Irish-style debt crisis.
 The risk premium of Spanish benchmark 10-year bonds over
German bunds rose on Tuesday to about 210 basis points on
concerns over contagion from Ireland.
 ""The main thing when comparing with Ireland is that our
financial sector is strong. Not only have the stress tests shown
that, but we designed a fund to help merge savings banks, of
which only 11 billion euros has been drawn,"" Salgado told RNE
radio.
 Many of Spain's unlisted savings banks have merged as part
of government measures to overhaul the sector, deeply wounded by
the housing bust.
 Salgado said that the euro zone had to coordinate economic
policy better and reduce imbalances in competitiveness.
 She said Spain's spending cuts -- the government passed the
most austere budget in decades for 2011 -- were sufficient to
reach its goals.
 The government has vowed to cut the deficit to 6 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011 from more than 11 percent of GDP
in 2009.
 But some economists have cast doubt on the 6 percent target
since the budget is based on a forecast of 1.3 percent economic
growth next year, well above consensus expectations.
 ""We don't need more measures, all that's needed is the ones
that we've put in place to take effect,"" she told CNN+.

 * Euro also falls on worries of debt problem contagion
 * US debt prices rise on risk-aversion, Fed purchases
(Update with U.S. markets' close, Nikkei futures)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Stocks fell while the dollar
rose against the euro on Monday as initial optimism over
Ireland's debt bailout gave way to concerns about the
government's future and problems elsewhere in the euro zone.
 Developments in the Irish sovereign debt crisis underpinned
a rise in prices of safe-haven U.S. government bond prices.
Gold also rose on safe-haven buying, but oil and other
commodities were pressured by a stronger dollar.
 The euro reversed initial gains on Ireland's rescue by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which was
aimed at tackling its banking and budget crisis.
 But the unpopular Irish government coalition began to
unravel, a day after agreeing on the EU/IMF plan, casting doubt
on its ability to push through an austerity budget needed for
receiving the aid. For details, see [ID:nLDE6AL00M].
 ""That just adds to the uncertainty, creating political
turmoil at the time you have financial turmoil,"" said Scott
Marcouiller, chief technical market strategist at Wells Fargo
Advisors in St. Louis.
 In addition, investors worried the rescue might not be

(Updates prices, adds detail)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro slumped on Monday as
worries about how a financial bailout for Ireland will be
implemented doused investor optimism and failed to ease fears
about other indebted euro zone countries.
 The euro, which hit a one-week high near $1.38 overnight
after the European Union and International Monetary Fund agreed
to a rescue for Ireland, swiftly surrendered gains.
 The currency at one point fell below $1.36 as the Irish
government began to unravel, though it regained ground after
Prime Minister Brian Cowen vowed to stay in office long enough
to pass an austerity budget.
 The euro was last down 0.4 percent at $1.3622.
 Investors also feared the aid, which an EU source said
could total 80 billion to 90 billion euros, may not be enough
to backstop Irish banks or stop similar runs on assets in
heavily indebted Portugal or Spain.
 ""The question is, 'What's next?',"" said Matthew Strauss, an
RBC Capital Markets strategist in Toronto. ""It's hard to see
how Ireland will get the economic growth needed to repay its
debts, especially given the political uncertainty it faces. And
given Portugal's finances, people wonder, 'Will it be next?'.""
 Portugal's debt burden is rooted in slow growth and an
increasingly uncompetitive economy.
 Overnight the euro rose as high as $1.3786 but analysts
said a cluster of important technical levels between $1.3100
and $1.3350 could pull it into that range in the coming weeks.
 The Aug. 6 intraday high of $1.3334 is the first
significant support level, Strauss said, followed by $1.3211
and the 200-day moving average around $1.3139.
 A solid break below those levels will probably be a tougher
nut to crack, at least in the remaining weeks of 2010. ""We
would need new developments about Europe or a strong new
reasons to buy the U.S. dollar,"" Strauss said.
 The EU/IMF rescue will shore up a banking sector devastated
by a housing collapse without Ireland having to borrow at
extremely high rates on capital markets. Still, ratings agency
Moody's said Monday a ""multi-notch downgrade"" on Ireland was
now likely.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen resisted calls for his
resignation on Monday and vowed to stay in power long enough to
pass an austerity budget.
 EURO LONGS REDUCED
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Friday highlighted uncertainty as speculators more than halved
net euro/dollar long positions to 8,606 contracts last week
from 23,283 the week before.and take profits for the year may
also lift the dollar.
 ""Investors have been undecided on the euro for a while now
and I can see that uncertainty lasting into year-end,"" said
Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
 The euro also fell 0.6 percent at 113.45 yen. The dollar
fell 0.2 percent to 83.26 yen. Its surprise rebound this month
from a 15-year low of 80.21 has kept many traders positive in
the near term.
 Dealers said a Japanese holiday on Tuesday and a U.S. one
on Thursday kept trading volume thinner than usual.

 * Fosun CEO rejects EU allegations of state subsidies
 * Company considers new European investment platform
 * Seeks access for generic liver, diabetes drugs in EU
 
 LUXEMBOURG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Shrinking European demand and
rising protectionism are leading Chinese firms to turn to
domestic markets, the head of Fosun International, China's
largest private conglomerate, said on Monday.
 While others look to home, Fosun is planning to tackle the
issues faced by Chinese firms in Europe by establishing a new
investment platform in the European Union -- which, with 500
million people, is the world's largest trading bloc.
 Fosun has interests in pharmaceuticals, mining and real
estate and recently announced plans to spend up to $2 billion to
buy financial services companies as it bets on China's domestic
consumption booming in the coming years.
 Fosun's Chief Executive Liang Xinjun said Europe's generally
lacklustre growth and increasing urge to raise levies on certain
imports from China had made it all the more pressing to develop
markets among China's 1.3 billion people.
 ""The challenge is in the weakening of demand coupled with
protectionism in Europe,"" he told Reuters on Monday.
 ""Most Chinese companies have noticed these problems so the
first thing to cope with is to sell products on the domestic
market,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter at a
conference on EU-China relations.
 As the European Union began to rebound from recession this
year, China has seen booming exports of car wheels, electronics
and construction materials. At more or less the same time, the
EU began imposing import tariffs on a range of Chinese goods.
 
 NO STEEL SUBSIDIES
 The EU denies it is being protectionist, saying it is taxing
Chinese imports that are illegally priced and subsidised.
 Liang rejected moves by European policymakers to challenge
the legality of Chinese state subsidies, including cheap bank
loans and preferential property leases.
 ""This is nonsense. We Chinese companies don't receive
anything. There are no subsidies for the steel sector,"" he said.
 Fosun, founded in 1992 by Liang and three other graduates of
Shanghai's Fudan University with initial capital of $4,000, is
now worth $5 billion with five main businesses: pharmaceuticals,
real estate, steel making, mining and consumer services.
 Besides focusing on China's domestic market, Fosun aimed to
set up operations in Europe in the hope of avoiding high EU
duties, Liang said.
 ""We want to establish an investment platform in Europe, to
better access the market,"" he said, adding Fosun was in talks
with an EU private equity firm ""with great knowledge of the
local market"" to find acquisition opportunities in the leisure,
luxury goods and pharmaceuticals sector.
 Fosun aimed to buy pharmaceuticals companies in the EU to
co-develop generic drugs and sell Fosun's own diabetes drugs,
liver treatment and other medicines directly in the EU, he said.
 Liang has in the past predicted China will become the
second- or third-largest drugs market globally within five
years, following similar strides in luxury goods, automobiles
and financial services.

 WASHINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The White House on Monday
said Ireland's acceptance of outside help to tackle its banking
crisis was ""good news,"" highlighting relief in Washington that
Europe was confronting a problem that could sap U.S. recovery.
 ""We welcome Ireland's intention to seek that assistance and

countries,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters.
 Other European nations and the International Monetary Fund
agreed in principle on Sunday to rescue Ireland with an
expected 80 to 90 billion euros in loans to tackle a banking
and budget crisis.
 Some fear that failure to act decisively could see debt
funding problems spread to other smaller members of the euro
common currency zone like Portugal.
 The crisis in euro zone confidence has been simmering ever
since investors began shunning Greek debt earlier this year,
raising anxiety in global financial markets that U.S. officials
have since blamed for obstructing the U.S. economy.

(Adds background on bank's role, comments on impact of
currency gains in paragraphs 3, 8-15)
 By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Aluisio Alves
 SAO PAULO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run
development bank BNDES is working with the government on a
series of measures to stimulate more private-sector lending and
bolster local capital markets, the bank's president said on
Monday.
 Speaking at the Reuters Brazil Investment Summit in Sao
Paulo, Luciano Coutinho said the BNDES is currently Brazil's
""only long-term lender,"" but that changes to taxes and bank
reserve requirements would help create conditions for the
private sector to increase corporate lending.
 The BNDES' expanding portfolio of subsidized loans helped
many Brazilian companies survive the global financial crisis.
BNDES credit is also critical to funding the government's $1
trillion infrastructure investment program, which is gaining
steam ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.
 However, some critics worry that the flood of relatively
cheap credit has crowded out private lending after a four-year
stretch during which the BNDES' portfolio more than doubled.
 Coutinho said he expects the BNDES will remain the primary
lender for infrastructure projects, though loan disbursements
will start leveling off in 2011 if private lending expands,
 ""We need to ... evaluate how the private banking sector
could increase its participation in lending and how the BNDES
can scale down its operations in a gradual way,"" Coutinho
said.

 BNDES lending growth: http://r.reuters.com/mam26q
 Brazil's economic growth: http://link.reuters.com/huf64p
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Coutinho did not elaborate on the possible measures, but
noted that some actions would be focused on enhancing liquidity
for the domestic corporate debt market.
 Coutinho said investment in infrastructure will be a top
priority of President-elect Dilma Rousseff, who takes office on
New Year's day. As evidence, he cited Rousseff's actions as
energy minister between 2003 and 2005, when she pushed for an
overhaul of the sector that helped ease concerns over future
bottlenecks.
 The government's infrastructure plan, known as PAC,
involves the construction of large dams, ports, roads and
venues for the World Cup and Olympics. Low-income housing
projects, sanitation programs in some of Brazil's most
depressed urban areas and railways to help transport grain and
mineral exports also form part of the plan.
 Coutinho, a former economics professor at Campinas
University who once taught Rousseff, has been widely tipped for
a key post in her administration. He said he had not discussed
a potential role in the next government with Rousseff.
 ""HOLLOWING OUT"" RISKS
 Often described by business leaders as the lifeblood of
Brazil's $1.9 trillion economy, BNDES in recent years also
fostered the creation of home-grown corporate giants in areas
such as pulp, food and sugar that are now global leaders.
 Coutinho said disbursements should remain ""stable"" during
2011, compared with an estimate of around 146 billion reais
($85 billion) total lending for 2010.
 He also voiced concerns that a recent rally in the
Brazilian real  could ""hollow out"" some sectors of the
local manufacturing industry.
 Recent measures to contain currency gains have met their
goal, but the only way to fight the problem is making Brazil
more competitive through investing in infrastructure and
overhauling the tax code, Coutinho added.
 ""To permit that such currency gains continue could be
detrimental to the good performance of the economy,"" he said.
 The situation for more emblematic names in Brazil, like
jetmaker Embraer , which is struggling with
weak plane orders and steep local currency-linked costs, could
have been worse without prompt government controls on hot-money
inflows, Coutinho said.
 The strong real also poses trouble for sectors with broader
""production chains"" like steelmakers, which are battling
soaring imports and weak global demand, and exporters of
semi-manufactured goods, he added.
 The solution to a chronic appreciation of the real is
ultimately investing in logistics and infrastructure to make
Brazilian goods more competitive in overseas markets and
lowering the tax burden for corporations, he said.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Stocks fell while the dollar
rose against the euro on Monday as initial optimism over
Ireland's debt bailout gave way to concerns about the
government's future and problems elsewhere in the euro zone.
 Safe-haven U.S. government bond prices rose with help from
another round of debt purchases by the Federal Reserve under
its latest plan to aid the U.S. economy. Gold, oil and other
commodities fell.
 The euro reversed gains earlier on Ireland's rescue by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which was
aimed at tackling its banking and budget crisis.
 But the unpopular Irish government began to unravel after a
call by Ireland's junior party for an early election in
January, with the budget in doubt. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6AL00M].
 ""That just adds to the uncertainty, creating political
turmoil at the time you have financial turmoil,"" said Scott
Marcouiller, chief technical market strategist at Wells Fargo
Advisors in St. Louis.
 In addition, investors worried the rescue might not be
effective in the long term and wouldn't stop markets from
targeting Portugal, also facing severe debt problems.

 JERUSALEM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel as expected
kept its main interest rate on hold for a second month on
Monday, but widened its rate corridor as another small step in
efforts to ""normalise"" monetary policy.
 The bank, which has raised its key short-term lending rate
 by 150 basis points this year, cited signs of weaker
growth and stable price pressures as behind Monday's decision to
keep rates at 2 percent.
 Most analysts expect it will hold fire next month too, but
several have forecast a rise and the main rate is expected to
reach 3.75 percent by the end of 2011, removing stimulus given
to the economy during the height of the financial crisis.
 ""I am still looking for fairly agressive tightening going

policy rates when the economy ... has been out of recession for
some time.""
 The Bank of Israel did, however, widen its interest rate
corridor in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit
window to +/- 0.5 percent from +/- 0.25 percent. That undoes a
change made in February 2009 and was ""part of the normalising of
monetary policy"", the bank said.
 The windows were opened in 2005 and enable banks which need
more liquidity to receive loans from the Bank of Israel at
higher rates than the benchmark rate. Typically, banks receive
their liquidity at daily, weekly and monthly auctions where
interest is similar to the Bank of Israel's key rate.
 ""They are taking back some of the punchbowl but it doesn't
mean much,"" said Vered Dar, chief economist at the Psagot
brokerage.
 
 GLOBAL ECONOMY A RISK
 While the economy continues to expand, exports -- which grew
sharply in the first half of 2010 -- have declined to reflect
weakness in global trade, the central bank said.
 ""The lack of certainty regarding the sustainability of
domestic growth deriving from uncertainty about global demand
still constitutes a significant risk factor,"" it said, adding
that monetary policy remains expansionary.
 Israel's economy grew an annualised 3.8 percent in the third
quarter after 4.5 percent growth in the prior three months.
Exports, which comprise more than 40 percent of Israel's
economic activity, fell nearly 10 percent. 
 The bank projects growth of 4 percent in 2010 and 3.8
percent in 2011.
 Inflation edged up to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in
October from 2.4 percent in September and the bank said it would
rise slightly above an annual government target rate of 1-3
percent in the first half of 2011 and then return to the target
range.
 It said it would continue to monitor housing prices, which
have jumped in the past year and prompted concerns of a real
estate bubble.
 The shekel  weakened to 3.634 per dollar from 3.62
prior to the announcement. 
 Dan Ron, vice president of investment at the Tachlit
brokerage said markets had priced in a no change decision due to
comments from Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer last week.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2010 12:48PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-How Britain might contribute to Irish help," Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain has said it is willing to lend
Ireland billions of pounds as part of European and IMF efforts
to bail out the once thriving euro zone economy.
 Below is a guide to how such assistance could be made:
 
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HELP
 The exact contribution Britain would make to any IMF
assistance depends on which type of loan facility the
multilateral organisation deploys, but the UK would be liable
for something in the region of five percent of that help.
 
 EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILISATION MECHANISM
 Britain would contribute 13.6 percent of any offering made
from this EU-wide fund which has a limit of 60 billion euros
($82.37 billion) for the financial period ending in 2013.
 That would translate into a maximum UK contribution of 8.16
billion euros.
 
 EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY
 Britain would not take part in any tranche lent to Ireland
from this euro zone crisis fund of 440 billion euros.
 
 BILATERAL AID
 British finance minister George Osborne says it is sensible
to give bilateral aid to Ireland, on top of any multilateral
assistance, because of the close ties between the British and
Irish economies.
 However, bilateral aid is also a way for Britain to satisfy
its European neighbours that it is playing a big enough part in
the bail out without signing up to the euro zone initiatives
that it wants to avoid.
 
 IMPACT ON UK PUBLIC FINANCES
 Britain will only take a public finance hit on its
contributions to the IMF and EU bailouts if Ireland defaults on
those loans. In that event, Britain would have to repay its
chunk of any remaining loan -- i.e. 13.6 percent of any EU loan
and about 5 percent of any IMF help.
 Otherwise, any involvement in multilateral assistance is
regarded as a contingent liability and would not have an impact
on government borrowing figures. Such liabilities are not
recorded in the national accounts unless they are called upon.
 Bilateral assistance would also have no impact on headline
UK borrowing figures as it would merely mean changing one asset
-- cash -- into another asset -- loans.
 With a bilateral loan, the government's net cash requirement
would rise, however, meaning more gilts would need to be issued.
 It would also increase public sector net debt, or the
government's total stock of debt, much in the same way as the
UK's own financial bailouts were classified as liabilities for
overall debt purposes.

subsidise Apple's iPad in Britain and France, hoping to tie more
customers into service contracts by making the expensive gadgets
seem more affordable.
 France Telecom's Orange and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile --
who have put their British operations into a joint venture --
said on Monday new purchase options in Britain would mean ""more
affordable prices when purchased with a data service plan"".
 In France, a spokeswoman for Orange said the carrier would
subsidise the iPad when it starts selling in Orange stores next
month at prices starting from 279 euros ($383). To get a
discount, a customer might, for example, have to sign up for 24
months at 35 euros per month, she said.
 The iPad has sold more than 7.5 million since it went sale
in April. Prices range from $499 for the cheapest model in the
United States to 699 pounds ($1,119) for the most expensive
version in Britain.
 Apple has disrupted the way device makers do deals with
telecoms operators since entering the market in 2007, picking
exclusive carrier partners to sell its iPhone and holding back
the speedy price erosion that afflicts most other handsets.
 The company was reported to have considered selling iPhones
with its own SIM cards to bypass operators, but to have recently
abandoned that plan under pressure from carriers like Vodafone
who currently subsidise the iPhone.

 * Pan-African Ecobank enters cooperation with Bank of China
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 LUXEMBOURG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Export-Import Bank of
China sees plenty of opportunity to extend loans in Africa,
focussing on raw materials and oil, while commercial banks are
steering clear of the risk, its chief executive said on Monday.
 ""There are a lot of areas to operate - particularly in the
raw materials and oil sector. Certainly this is the area we will
focus on,"" Exim Bank Chairman Li Ruogu told European and Chinese
executives, bankers and officials meeting in Luxembourg.
 This month European Union trade chief Karel De Gucht
rejected what he called China's ""cheque book"" approach to doing
business with Africa, saying the EU would continue demanding
good governance and transparent use of funds from its trading
partners.
 ""China does not interfere in the internal affairs of Africa.
What we want to do is foster their own development capacity,"" Li
told the conference.
 ""Democracy and human rights, these are fantastical terms.
Without economic governance they are nothing,"" he added.
 Exim Bank is one of China's three policy banks that extend
credit in line with government initiatives.
 ""Very few foreign commercial banks are considering providing
finance in Africa. They may see the risk aspects more than they
see the benefits,"" Li told Reuters.
 ""We take a long-term view. We don't expect profits this year
or next year; we see things in decades,"" he said.
 ""If the Europeans follow the Chinese example they may have
an opportunity in Africa,"" Li added.
 
 EU IN ITS WAKE
 He said Exim Bank would also focus on Africa's agriculture
sector, where it sees a potential for recovery and future
exports, potentially supplying China's booming demand for basic
commodities.
 ""Africa has very good agricultural land and yet they've been
importing food from other countries. We are going to develop
agriculture cooperation so that the Africans can rely on
themselves for food and even export, maybe to China.""
 An EU-Africa summit scheduled for next week in Tripoli is is
expected to include European attempts to improve commercial and
diplomatic relations with Africa, which were damaged by a
long-standing row over regional trade accords.
 China's presence in Africa has revived European interest in
a continent with 1.4 billion inhabitants and an average GDP
growth rate of 8 percent, said Kolapo Lawson, chairman of
pan-African banking group Ecobank Transnational.
 ""The Chinese have taken advantage of Africa's growing middle
class by supplying the needs of consumers,"" Lawson said.
 Europe's growing interest, following on the heels of China,
is allowing African governments to demand better terms in
negotiations, Lawson said.
 Ecobank, west and central Africa's leading regional banking
group, has entered a cooperation agreement with the Bank of
China to deepen trade relations, he said.
 ""One would say it's a very happy relationship, and it's a
relationship that one has a great deal of optimism in
contemplating.""

(Update with U.S. markets' open)
 By Manuela Badawy and Naomi Tajitsu
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell while
the dollar rose against the euro on Monday as initial optimism
over Ireland's debt bailout gave way to concerns about the
government's future and problems elsewhere in the euro zone.
 Safe-haven U.S. government bond prices rose with help from
another round of debt purchases by the Federal Reserve under
its latest plan to aid the U.S. economy.
 Gold, oil and other commodities slipped. The euro was off
after it had earlier benefited from Ireland's rescue by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund aimed at
shoring up its banking and budget crisis.
 But the unpopular Irish government began to unravel after a
call by Ireland's junior party for an early election in
January, with the budget in doubt. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6AL00M].
 In addition, investors worried the rescue might not be
effective in the long term and wouldn't stop markets from
targeting Portugal, also facing severe debt problems.
[ID:nLDE6AL04W].
 ""The risk of Ireland is somewhat off the table, but it puts
the risk onto Portugal and possibly Spain, which represents a
much bigger risk for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Market participants say Portugal may be the next country
forced to seek a bailout, which could reignite concerns about
the stability of the euro zone.
 The dollar was up against a basket of currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.06 percent at 78.552.
The euro  was down 0.25 percent at $1.365. Against the
Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.01 percent at
83.44.

 STOCKS SLIP
 World stocks fell slightly on uncertainty about the outcome
of Ireland's debt bailout and possible contagion of debt
problems to Portugal and Spain.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was off 0.5
percent while U.S. stocks fell, with the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> easing 83 points, or 0.7 percent, at 11,119.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 8 points, or
0.6 percent, at 1,192 while the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
was off 2 points at 2,516.
 Bucking the trend, Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc
 rose.
 Trading volume is expected to be down this week in light of
the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.7 percent while the Nikkei average <.N225> ended the
day up almost 1 percent, to a fresh five-month closing high as
receding worries about the yen's strength encouraged a shift
back to Japanese shares by foreign investors.
 The cost of insuring Irish sovereign debt against default
rose on political uncertainty, and other peripheral euro zone
credit default swaps were also higher.
 The loan package for Ireland is expected to total 80
billion to 90 billion euros while the government puts the
finishing touches to a 15 billion euro ($20.5 billion)
austerity plan.
 ""Once we have the detail, we will see how well it works.
But I am a little bit afraid that attention will shift towards
Portugal and Spain,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at
BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.
 U.S. Treasuries rose as investors turned to safe-haven
government debt before another round of government debt
purchases by the Fed.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
11/32, with the yield at 2.835 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was unchanged with the yield at 0.518
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up
26/32, with the yield at 4.197 percent.
 The Fed on Monday will buy $7 billion to $9 billion of
Treasuries in the 10-year maturity range as part of its
quantitative easing program.
 While the Fed will be buying again, the Treasury will be
selling, offering $35 billion of 2-year notes as part of $99
billion of securities sales during the holiday-shortened week.
 In energy and commodities prices, crude oil  fell 71
cents, or 0.87 percent, to $81.27 per barrel.
 Spot gold prices  fell $2.00, or 0.15 percent, to
$1351.00 an ounce, as the pick-up in the dollar undermined
demand from investors for perceived safe-haven assets such as
gold, which tends to weaken when the U.S. currency rises.

(Recasts, adds comments, details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro slumped against the
dollar on Monday as worries about how a bailout of Ireland will
be implemented and fears of contagion to other highly indebted
euro zone states overtook earlier optimism on the deal.
 The euro's fall accelerated after an Irish independent
government lawmaker said he was unlikely to support the
country's 2011 budget.
 As support from within the government's own ranks crumbled.
the leader of Ireland's main opposition party, Fine Gael,
called for an immediate election.
 Many simply worried the EU/IMF rescue package might not be
effective in the long term and would not stop markets from
targeting fellow straggler Portugal.
 ""News of a package for Ireland has ultimately been shrugged
off by the markets today after initial gains in the euro and
peripheral bond prices,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging
markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""It seems that the honeymoon for the periphery may end up
even shorter than it was after the Greece package back in May,
as markets are already turning their focus elsewhere,
especially Portugal and Spain.""
 Rating agency Moody's said a ""multi-notch downgrade"" on
Ireland was now likely.
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish government bonds
rather than benchmark German debt rose on Monday, reversing an
earlier fall, after the call for elections..
 The euro was down 0.6 percent against the dollar at
$1.3608, far off an earlier one-week high of $1.3786, when it
pierced the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its Nov. 4-18
fall at $1.3765.
 At the session low on Monday of 1.3593, according to
Reuters data, the euro/dollar was back below the 23.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement support level.
 ""The market is skeptical as there are still fiscal issues
with Portugal and Spain. Investors have been undecided on the
euro for a while now and I can see that uncertainty lasting
into year-end,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank in London.
 EURO LONGS REDUCED
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Friday highlighted uncertainty as speculators more than halved
net euro/dollar long positions to 8,606 contracts last week
from 23,283 the week before.
 The size of European Union and International Monetary Fund
aid for Ireland has yet to be decided, but is likely to be
smaller than Greece's 110 billion euro bailout last May. A
senior EU source said aid could total 80 billion to 90 billion
euros.
 The euro also cut gains against the yen to trade down 0.5
percent at 113.55 yen, while the U.S. dollar index rose 0.4
percent to 78.788.
 Dealers said trade was thin partly due to a Japanese market
holiday on Tuesday and a U.S. market holiday on Thursday. 
 The greenback was little changed against the yen at 83.47
yen, with its surprise rebound this month from a 15-year low of
80.21 keeping many traders positive in the near term.

 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies struggled to make gains on Monday as optimism faded
over plans to bail out Ireland, making investors reluctant to
buy higher-risk assets.
 The European Union and the International Monetary Fund
agreed on Sunday to offer loans for Ireland to tackle a banking
and budget crisis. [ID:nLDE6AL00M]
 But analysts said the move had already been priced into the
market and fears remained over other highly indebted euro zone
states.
 As well as deterring investors from emerging markets, a
full-blown crisis in Europe would impact global growth,
reducing demand for Latin America's exports.
 ""The confirmation of Ireland's financial aid package brings
temporary relief but I think investors will go back to
speculating and putting pressure on Portugal. Portugal could be

 The Brazilian real  was bid 0.12 percent firmer at
1.715 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market and 0.28
percent weaker according to the international reference rate
 -- a discrepancy resulting from different closing

 LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Dusting off the 1960s analogy of
countries falling into communism like tipping dominoes,
investors are bracing for the next round in a country-by-country
crisis over euro zone debt.
 After the Greek bailout earlier this year and the one agreed
in principle for Ireland, Portugal is widely cited as the next
domino, followed by Spain -- a far larger economy than those yet
dealt with and one, that if it did topple, could potentially
exhaust the European Union's aid funds.
 It is not inevitable, but the chances of the dominoes
continuing to tumble are being exacerbated by the large amount
of time it will take for countries concerned to get their
finances in order and by the fact that investors can make safer
yield plays elsewhere.
 Because markets are not giving peripheral euro zone
governments time to prove their various austerity packages, the
mainstream investors whose money is needed are avoiding the
sector and looking elsewhere.
 Without eager buyers of their debt, the borrowing costs
high-debt euro zone countries face will climb yet higher,
exacerbating their problems and maybe hastening the point at
which they need outside help.
 ""We would not touch it (peripheral debt) either long or
short. It is a very specialised game,"" said Emiel van den
Heligenberg, chief investment officer for global balanced
investing at BNP Paribas Investment Partners.
 ""We feel more comfortable taking credit risk in high yeild
corporate bonds via index (credit default swaps) or index
funds.""
 One result is that the European Union's potential 80-90
billion euro financial aid package for Ireland agreed on Sunday
has had only a modest impact on peripheral euro zone debt.
 The yield spread between German  and Irish
 10-year bonds briefly narrowed by some 20-30 basis
points on Monday before becoming flat at 565 basis points.
 Some of this may reflect last week's expectations of a deal
-- Monday's narrowest spreads were some 100 basis points
narrower than a high hit on Nov. 11.
 But the run up to the deal and its confirmation have still
left Irish-German bond spreads wider than they were at the
beginning of November and well above their Greek crisis levels.
 Portuguese spreads  were some 83 basis points
off their recent high, but actually higher than they were at
times last week.
 The clear implication is that investors do not believe the
currency bloc's debt crisis is over, multi-billion euro zone
bailouts or not.

 SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY
 Investors say what will end the rolling euro zone crisis is
a clear sense that the indebted countries are taking the steps
needed to bring their finances under control.
 The problem is that even when such plans are introduced,
markets get jittery at the first sign of trouble. It was not
that long ago, for example, that Ireland was getting kudos for
the speed and depth with which it was addressing its deficit.
 ""It is very hard to think that we are out of the woods yet.
Results will take time. Markets aren't always the most patient
judges,"" said John Stopford, head of fixed income at Investec
Asset Management.
 His firm holds no peripheral European debt, even in funds
which suggest them as part of a benchmark. Again, Stopford says
he can get better, safer deals elsewhere.
 So there seems little to stop the crisis now rolling on to
Portugal, where figures on Monday showed nearly 14 billion in
net portfolio outflows in the first three quarters of this year.
 That compared with 6.2 billion euros of net inflows in the
same period a year earlier.
 Lack of confidence from investors such as this has a way of
becoming self-fulfilling. Bond traders at Matrix Securities
summed this up in a note on Monday:
 ""Our concern for Portugal, Spain and Italy is that the
market will continue to be wary of refinancing maturing
peripheral sovereign debt in 2011, which can result in higher
CDS spreads, lower bid-cover ratios, increased refinancing
costs, and most importantly, an inability by the sovereign to
reduce public debt as a percentage of GDP.""
 
 CONTAGION
 To date, the European Union and International Monetary Fund
have managed with their aid packages to keep the crisis from
spreading too quickly and from causing wider global disruption.
 The euro, for example, has remained at far higher levels
against the dollar  than it was before the Greek bailout
and correlations between the euro and peripheral debt spread
moves remain slight.
 There also seems little doubt that if a new crisis arose
around Portugal that some kind of deal would be done.
 But where investors start to get very wary is when it comes
to Spain, whose size makes it entirely different from Greece,
Ireland and Portugal.
 Andrew Bosomworth, an executive vice president with PIMCO
Europe in Germany, reckons there may not be enough triple
A-rated money in the EU financial aid pot to cover it.

 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Monday as brief optimism after Ireland sought a
bailout gave way to concerns about possible contagion to other
highly indebted euro zone states.
 The euro's fall coincided with a rise in the premium
investors demand to hold Irish government bonds rather than
benchmark German debt, reversing an earlier fall, after the
country's junior coalition party called for fresh elections.
 The call by Ireland's Green Party for a January election
raised fresh political uncertainty over the country's outlook..
The euro's fall accelerated after an Irish independent
government lawmaker said he was unlikely to support the
country's 2011 budget.
 But many just worried the European/IMF rescue package might
not be effective in the long term and would not stop markets
from targeting fellow straggler Portugal.
 ""The risk of Ireland is somewhat off the table, but it puts
the risk onto Portugal and possibly Spain, which represents
much bigger risk for the euro,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 The call for an Irish election also ""raises the risk for
straight austerity measures being implemented with the risk the
government is unable to implement the fiscal tightening
measures necessary for the budget deficit,"" Esiner said.
 Rating agency Moody's said a ""multi-notch downgrade"" on
Ireland was now likely.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent against the dollar at
$1.3638, more than a cent off an earlier one-week high of
$1.3786, when it pierced the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of its Nov. 4-18 fall at $1.3765.
 The move lower on Monday breached the 23.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement support level.
 ""The market is skeptical as there are still fiscal issues
with Portugal and Spain. Investors have been undecided on the
euro for a while now and I can see that uncertainty lasting
into year-end,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at

 EURO LONGS REDUCED
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Friday highlighted uncertainty as speculators more than halved
net euro/dollar long positions to 8,606 contracts last week
from 23,283 the week before.

 LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro erased gains on Monday
as a brief flurry of optimism after Ireland sought a bailout
faded, with concerns about possible contagion to other highly
indebted euro zone states keeping investors wary.
 Many were worried the European/IMF rescue package might not
be effective in the long term and that it would not stop markets
from targeting fellow straggler Portugal. [ID:nLDE6AL00M]
[ID:nLDE6AL04W]
 ""The market is split between those who think the deal
reduces the risks going into the year-end and those who think
the fact that Ireland followed Greece (in requesting a bailout)
in relatively short succession is a euro negative,"" said Paul
Robson, currency strategist at RBS.
 Rating agency Moody's said a ""multi-notch downgrade"" on
Ireland was now likely [ID:nLDE6AL0ZA].
 Political instability was also a concern as Ireland's Green
party, the junior coalition partner in the government, said a
general election should be held in January. [ID:nWLA8721]
 The euro was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.3661
, more than a cent off an earlier one-week high of
$1.3786, when it pierced the 38.2 percent retracement of its Nov
4-18 fall at $1.3765.
 Analysts said a sustained break of $1.3765 would be needed
for a further correction towards resistance at $1.3864, a 50
percent retracement of that November sell-off.
 ""The market is sceptical as there are still fiscal issues
with Portugal and Spain. Investors have been undecided on the
euro for a while now and I can see that uncertainty lasting into
year-end,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro pared early gains while
European shares slipped on Monday as initial euphoria over
Ireland's request for a debt bailout fizzled.
 Riskier assets gave up gains and reversed course on concerns
that other euro zone countries may need similar help, and after
Ireland's junior party called for an election, prompting
concerns about political instability in the country.
 Ireland's news initially whetted investor appetite for
higher-risk currencies, stocks and commodities, while boosting
Irish government debt prices on the view that the latest episode
in the euro zone debt saga has been contained.
 World shares pulled back from an early rise, while U.S.
shares were poised to open slightly lower.
 ""The deal was inevitable ... but there are still hurdles
ahead for other countries, particularly next year,"" said Nick
Stamenkovic, rate strategist at RIA Capital Markets. 
 The cost of insuring against an Irish sovereign default
tumbled in early trade and its two-year government bond yield
dropped as Dublin outlined austerity measures to the European
Union and the IMF in return for loans to shore up its crippled
banking sector.
 Market participants say Portugal may be the next country
forced to seek a bailout, which could reignite concerns about
the stability of the euro zone.
 Some analysts say that in the unlikely situation that no
more bailouts are needed, concerns about the region will remain
elevated due to pressure on euro zone economic growth resulting
from the rescue packages laid out for Greece and Ireland.
 ""Even assuming the best case scenario of no further
bailouts, the necessary adjustments required to rectify internal
imbalances in the euro zone are deeply deflationary and will
quickly become evident by the under-performance of the euro zone
economy,"" BTM UFJ analysts wrote in a note.
 By 1216 GMT, the euro was flat on the day at $1.3689,
pulling back from the day's high of $1.3786. The safe-haven
dollar slipped 0.1 percent versus a currency basket.
 Last week, markets had been awash with expectation that
Ireland would be able to secure debt assistance, which had
triggered a recovery in the euro after it was sold off earlier
this month.
 
 LINGERING EURO ZONE, US ISSUES
 World share prices rose, nudging the MSCI world equity index
up 0.1 percent, although the index pared gains after Ireland's
Green Party called for a January election.
 European shares fell 0.5 percent following the announcement,
relinquishing early gains. U.S. stock futures slipped 0.1
percent.
 The two-year Irish government bond yield fell as much as
around 50 basis points, while benchmark 10-year yields fell more
than 20 basis points. Five-year Irish CDS prices fell 35 basis
points to 470 basis points.
 Irish debt yields continued their retreat after rocketing to
the highest in the history of the euro zone earlier this month
when concerns about Ireland's debt problems resurfaced, sowing
doubts about the stability of the euro zone.
 Gains in periphery bonds put selling pressure on German
debt, widely considered to be the most stable in the euro zone.
A rise in benchmark 10-year German bonds helped to further
narrow the spread against its Irish counterpart.
 Commodities gained, but pulled back from an early rise. Ooil
prices were up 0.2 percent at $82.14 per barrel, after climbing
1 percent.
 Investors were hesitant to get too excited about the risk
rally as euro zone fiscal problems were expected to continue,
while questions remain about whether the U.S. Federal Reserve's
latest round of quantitative easing will work.
 The Fed earlier this month said it would buy more U.S.
Treasuries in an effort to boost market liquidity, but this has
not yet led to significant dollar weakness and lower Treasury
yields, as some in the market had been expecting.
 Market participants said they would be wary of taking big
positions in either direction on risky assets until they get a
clearer picture of whether the second round of QE will be
successful, and whether more euro zone bailouts will be needed.
 ""Both the U.S. and European situation will remain until the
year end and so volatility will remain elevated,"" said Thanos
Papasavvas, head of FX management at Investec.
 ""We don't expect any significant rally in risk from here nor
a significant shock to the downside. We'll probably remain in
range for now,"" he said, adding that he expected the euro to be
hemmed in a $1.30-$1.40 range for now.
 Others in the market say that China's ongoing moves to
tighten monetary policy -- the latest of which was a rise in
banking reserve requirements late last week -- will also cool
expectations of how much the global economy will grow.

 * Nordea says recommendation amounts to a 10 pct increase
 * TSA forecasts 6-9 percent Asia-U.S. market growth in 2011
 
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Shipping companies in the
Transpacific Stabilisation Agreement (TSA) have backed a May 1
increase in container cargo rates to the United States, which it
said are lagging other Asian container markets.
 Calling it a ""voluntary guideline contract programme"" for
2011-12, the TSA recommended rate increases of $400 per 40-foot
container (FEU) for cargo moving to the U.S. West Coast and $600
per FEU for all other cargo.
 Swedish bank Nordea said in a note to clients that the
recommended increases were about 10 percent, but it added that
it expected actual rate increases in 2011 to be lower than that.
 TSA members include the world's biggest container shipping
groups, Denmark's Maersk Line, privately owned Switzerland-based
Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), French privately held
CMA-CGM, China's COSCO, Korea's Hanjin Shipping and others.
 Shipping has been recovering in 2010 from a deep plunge in
2009 in the wake of the global crisis hitting world trade.
 ""TSA carriers noted a dramatic tradewide improvement in the
supply-demand situation for freight shippers during 2010,""
Oakland, California-based TSA said in a statement late on
Friday. 
 ""Asia-U.S. cargo growth for the year has been surprisingly
strong, and is forecast to settle near 12 percent by year-end,""
it said.
 TSA lines forecast 2011 cargo growth from Asia to the United
States in the 6-9 percent range, the organisation said.
 Nordea said the 2011 growth forecast was in line with its
own estimate of 7 percent, but it added that it expected limited
rate increases owing to the delicate balance in the market. 
 ""Moreover, we argue that the market will settle for rate
increase of less than 10 percent and we estimate a 1 percent
rate increase for Maersk Line in 2011,"" Nordea said. 
 ""We expect rates to be under pressure until the end of (the
first quarter of) 2011, which will create investment
opportunities in the stock,"" Nordea said.
 Founded in 1989, the TSA calls itself ""a research and
discussion forum"" of major container shipping lines serving the
trade from Asia to the United States.
 Liner shipping was earlier organised in similar groups
called ""liner conferences"", which met to discuss market
conditions, freight rates and other common concerns.
 But the European Union decided in 2006 to ban the practice
as against competition rules and the ban took effect in 2008.

(Adds Malaysia GDP data, 6th paragraph) 
 By Orathai Sriring 
 BANGKOK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Thailand's economy slipped
into a technical recession in the third quarter, reinforcing
signs of an Asia-wide slowdown as export growth cools,
manufacturing ebbs and the impact of massive government
stimulus spending fades.	
 Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy shrank 0.2 percent
in the third quarter after a revised 0.6 percent contraction
in the second, data showed on Monday, reducing chances of
another interest rate rise next month.	
 The data reinforce signs of a slowdown across much of the
region, from North Asian export powerhouses China, South Korea
and Taiwan to Southeast Asian ""tigers"" Thailand, Singapore and
Indonesia. Strong growth in Asia has been one of the few
bright spots for the struggling global economy. 
 Figures last week showed Taiwan's economic growth slowing
in the third quarter, while Singapore's trade-reliant economy
shrank 18.7 percent and Indonesia reported this month its
first slowdown in annual growth in five quarters. 
 From a year earlier, Thailand grew 6.7 percent in the
quarter, largely in line with economists' forecasts and
slowing from growth of 9.2 percent in the second quarter, the
data from the state planning agency showed. 
 ""Looking forward, we expect weaker global demand to bring
Thailand's economic growth to below trend in the fourth
quarter of 2010, and in the first half of 2011,"" said Usara
Wilaipich, a Bangkok-based economist at Standard Chartered
Bank. 
 Malaysia's economic growth slowed more than expected to
5.3 percent in the third quarter from 8.9 percent in the
second, its central bank said on Monday, noting growth in the
second half of the year and in early next year was
moderating."" [ID:nKLA002364]	
 OCBC economist Gundy Cahyadi said growth almost stalled in
the third quarter from the previous three months, though few
analysts give quarter-on-quarter figures.	


 
 The Asian slowdown has been exacerbated by the U.S.
dollar's slide, which has driven up regional currencies and
started to erode export revenue. It is complicating efforts by
Asia's central banks to return interest rates to normal levels
after drastic cuts in the wake of the 2008 global financial
crisis.	
 The Bank of Thailand is likely to keep its trend-setting
one-day repurchase rate unchanged at 1.75 percent at its next
policy-setting meeting on Dec. 1, said Arkhom
Termpittayapaisith, secretary-general of the National Economic
and Social Development Board, Thailand's state economic
planning agency. 
 Private economists echoed that view after the data, which
was marginally better than a deeper 0.4 percent contraction
expected by most economists in a Reuters survey. 
 ""We expect less aggressive monetary policy by the Bank of
Thailand and possible delays on interest rate hikes next
year,"" said Isara Ordeedolchest, an economist at KT Zeamico
Securities, a stock brokerage in Bangkok. 
 Pimonwan Mahujchariyawong, economist at Kasikorn Research
Centre, expects the economy to contract again in the fourth
quarter, hurt by a nearly 12 percent rise in the baht
this year against the dollar to a 13-year high and floods that
have killed more than 200 people since October. 
 
 RATES SEEN ON HOLD	
 Thailand's debt market has largely priced in a rate pause
next month, with one-year swap rates down by 22
basis points in the past two weeks. Government bond yields
<0#THBMK=> were barely changed after Monday's economic data.	
 Indonesia's central bank is also seen pausing to keep its
policy rate on hold at a record low 6.5 percent well into 2011
as it tries to avoid encouraging an even bigger flow of
investment capital to its markets. [ID:nSGE6A10FA] 
 Despite the slowdown, Thailand's state planning agency
raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 7.9
percent from 7.0-7.5 percent projected in August, and tipped
growth of between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2011. 
 Agency chief Arkhom said the quarterly contraction was due
to lower state spending and a slowdown in private investment.	
 ""It's cyclical that Q3 is usually weaker than other
quarters,"" he told reporters, adding that the flooding across
much of Thailand over October and November shaved economic
growth by 0.3 percentage points.	
 He said the fourth-quarter performance depended on
strength in exports which his agency expected to rise 25.1
percent this year before slowing to about half that rate of
growth next year.	
 The data puts Thailand technically in recession after two
straight quarters of economic contraction.	
 Earlier data had indicated the economy grew 0.2 percent in
the second quarter from the first, but that was revised down
to show it had contracted, due largely to political unrest
over April and May in which more than 90 people were killed.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday after
Ireland sought an international bailout to tackle its debt
crisis, but analysts said budgetary worries in other euro zone
countries would keep investors wary about the single currency.
 The euro climbed to a one-week high at $1.3786, piercing the
38.2 percent retracement of its Nov 4-18 fall at $1.3765, with
analysts saying a sustained break would be needed for a further
correction towards resistance at $1.3864, a 50 percent
retracement of that November sell-off.
 Gains proved difficult to sustain, as the euro soon dropped
back to trade at $1.3745, up around 0.4 percent on the day.
 ""The market is sceptical as there are still fiscal issues
with Portugal and Spain. Investors have been undecided on the
euro for a while now and I can see that uncertainty lasting into
year-end,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 Foley said the reaction of peripheral bond yields would be
crucial to near-term euro direction. Irish yield spreads over
German benchmarks narrowed in early trade.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Friday highlighted uncertainty as speculators more
than halved their euro/dollar long positions to 8,606 contracts
last week from 23,283 contracts the week before.
 The amount of European Union and the International Monetary
Fund aid for Ireland has yet to be decided but is likely to be
smaller than Greece's 110 billion euro bailout last May. A
senior EU source said it could total 80 to 90 billion euros.
 ""Despite a shared currency, euro zone countries have various
institutional differences, which investors may come to view as
the fundamental problem of the currency,"" said Kimihiko Tomita,
head of FX at State Street Global Markets.
 Against the yen, the single currency rose 0.4 percent to
114.55 yen. Some Japanese exporters sold into the rally, but a
sustained break above 115 yen and its Oct. 7 high around 115.68
could bring the euro out of its 112-115 range of the past two
months.
 The euro's rally helped drive the U.S. dollar index to
78.66, down 0.4 percent on the day.
 Dealers said trade was thin partly due to a Japanese market
holiday on Tuesday and a U.S. market holiday on Thursday.
 The greenback was a touch lower at 83.40 yen, though its
surprise rebound this month from a 15-year low of 80.21 has kept
many traders positive about it for the near term.
 Considerable attention is on whether the dollar can rise
sustainably above its daily Ichimoku cloud, now at 83.64.
 
 AUSSIE OUTPERFORMS
 The Australian dollar was a standout performer, rising 0.8
percent to $0.9942, extending gains after having triggered
stop-loss orders above $0.99.
 The Aussie shrugged off further Chinese tightening measures
announced on Friday and Asian and European stocks made steady
gains.
 Last Friday, China ordered lenders to lock up more of their
money at the central bank for a second time in two weeks in a
fresh attempt to keep a lid on inflation.
 In contrast, the New Zealand dollar slipped after Standard &
Poor's downgraded the outlook for its rating on the country's
foreign currency debt, citing its widening trade deficit and
credit risks in its banking sector.
 The kiwi fell 0.9 percent against the U.S. dollar to $0.7719
at one stage but recovered to stand around $0.7765 in European
trade.

 STOCKHOLM, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Sweden could offer a bilateral
loan to Ireland of up to $1.5 billion as part of a planned
bigger bailout and other countries should think about joining
in, the country's finance minister said on Monday.
 Ireland is seeking a deal from the International Monetary
Fund and European Union expected to total 80-90 billion euros.
Britain is to lend about 7 billion pounds ($11.2 billion).
[ID:nLDE6AL00M]
 Sweden said it aimed to lend to Ireland to further economic
stability in Europe, and Finance Minister Anders Borg said the
amount would be similar to rescue loans for Iceland and Latvia.
 ""So we are dealing with something between 5 and 10 billion
crowns ($728 million-$1.46 billion),"" Borg told Swedish radio.
He said the interest rate on the loan would be about 3 percent.
 Borg said other states might consider stepping in.
 ""I'm thinking of Denmark, Norway and perhaps Switzerland. It
could be natural for these countries to ask themselves the
question if they could contribute to a bilateral programme,"" he
told a news conference.
 But Borg played down the prospects of Sweden joining other
rescue efforts.
 ""We have made the assessment that it is important for the
(financial) system that Ireland is not blown over. In the case
of Spain and Portugal the bar would be higher,"" he said.

his country would consider lending to Ireland.

 Sweden made loans to Iceland after its top three banks

Latvia as Nordic banks were heavily exposed to the Latvian
economy and those of the other Baltic states.

 * Markets pricing in about 75 bps of hikes over 12 months	
 * 7-day repo rate rebounds sharply	
 
 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - China swap rates rose to a
two year high on Monday after the central bank on Friday
increased banks' reserve requirements for the second time in
as many weeks, reflecting views a rate hike may still be in
the offing.	
 Beijing's actions to check inflation have been gaining
pace and swap traders interpreted climbing reserve
requirements to mean a lending rate increase is not too far
ahead.	
 One year forward starting swaps -- a rough gauge for
calculating forward interest rate expectations by subtracting
them from one year swaps -- indicate markets reflect 75 bps of
rate hikes over the coming year.	
 
 Forward swaps, especially in the one year tenor, are up by
90 bps this month alone -- far outpacing the rise in outright
swaps -- mainly due to aggressive paying from offshore hedge
funds who are positioning themselves for higher interest
rates, a rates strategist at a Singapore-based European Bank
said.	
 Speculative players prefer the forward swaps market
because these contracts do not require cash upfront since bets
only start at a future date, the strategist said.	
 The heavy paying in forward swaps has spilled over into
the offshore swaps market with one year rates 
up by 58 bps so far this month to a two-year high of 2.88
percent.	
 One year swaps extended a five-week run of gains
on Monday, climbing to 2.90 percent -- the highest level since
October 2008 and up 15 basis points from Friday.	
 ""The jump in China swap rates may well prove more lasting
as it appears increasingly clear that the country's policy
makers are shifting policy emphasis from growth to inflation,""
Credit Agricole CIB analysts said.	
 Real interest rates - the difference between nominal rates
and inflation -- are negative by nearly 200 basis points
despite a 25 basis point increase in deposit and lending rates
last month, and there are no signs that inflation is letting up.	
 Headline consumer Â inflation is running at a 25-month high
in October, indicating a need to increase policy rates further.	
 China lifted reserve requirements for big banks to 18.5
percent of total deposits -- a record -- aggravating fears
that cash surpluses in the money market would drop sharply.	
 The benchmark seven-day government bond repurchase rate
, a barometer for money market cash, has risen by
more than 40 bps in the past two weeks to a six-week high of
2.09 percent.	
 In New Zealand, bond yields spiked after Standard & Poor's
revised the country's foreign currency rating outlook to
negative from stable, but short-dated swaps fell as traders
believed that rising bond yields would forestall the need for
the central bank to tighten policy. [ID:nSGE6AL05L]	
 Two-year swap rates fell by 3 bps to 3.96
percent, deepening a fall from earlier this month, indicating
expectations for policy tightening have been steadily scaled
back this month in the backdrop of economic uncertainty. 
 Analysts said the yield curve may steepen in the coming
months as investors price in a less-hawkish stance on rates
while the longer end is seen up due to the increased perceived
risk premium resulting from the higher possibility of a

 Yields should rise more as offshore investors own 60
percent of outstanding debt and ten year swap rates should too
rise to some extent, reflecting a higher risk premium, Imre
Speizer, a strategist at Westpac Global Markets in Wellington
said.

 * Market assessing whether rescue will halt contagion
 * Aussie dollar little affected after China tightening
 * Dollar/yen eyes key ichimoku cloud resistance
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro jumped broadly on Monday
after Ireland sought an international bailout to tackle its
banking and budget crisis, helping remove a major stumbling block
that had plagued the single currency for weeks.
 Most Asia-Pacific shares rose despite China announcing
further credit tightening late on Friday, giving impetus to
growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The euro climbed about 0.6 percent to $1.3761, tackling a
cluster of resistance in the $1.3750/70 area, including $1.3766,
a 38.2% retracement of its Nov 4-18 fall.
 A sustained break should open a test of the major 1.3825-35
region and ultimately $1.3864, a 50 percent retracement of its
earlier fall.
 ""There is no doubt you'll see a relief rally in the euro. We
could see it back up to $1.3860 over the next 24-48 hours,"" said
Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank in
Sydney.
 The size of Ireland's aid from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund has yet to be decided, but is likely
to be smaller than Greece's 110 billion euro bailout last May.
One source said it could total 80 to 90 billion euros.
 Some market players said uncertainty on the size and
conditions of the aid package mean the euro's recovery could be
short-lived.
 ""We'll have to see more details. Germany has been demanding
the Irish corporate tax be raised. It's not clear where they
stand on this now,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of FX at State
Street Global Markets.
 ""Despite a shared currency, euro zone countries have various
institutional differences, which investors may come to view as
the fundamental problem of the currency,"" Tomita added.
 MORE BAILOUTS?
 Traders also said remaining worries over fiscal problems at
other euro zone countries, such as Portugal and possibly Spain,
will keep niggling at the euro.
 ""Worries over euro zone economies will keep cropping up in
the market from time to time, denting the euro,"" said Seiya
Nakajima, chief economist at Itochu Corp.
 The risk for the euro is seen high whenever market players
have big euro long positions that need to be unwound.
 At the moment, speculator positioning is fairly light as many
of them have reduced positions before trade thins down towards
the year-end holiday seasons.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Friday that speculators more than halved their
euro/dollar long positions to 8,606 contracts last week from
23,283 contracts the week before.
 On the other hand, longer-term market players still have
positions in favour of the euro, suggesting they have little
appetite to increase the euro now, said State Street's Tomita.
 ""I think the Irish news will lead to a short-term rally in
the euro but I doubt real money investors will increase euro long
positions just because of this news.""
 Against the yen, the single currency rose 0.5 percent to
114.75 yen. Some Japanese exporters sold into the rally, but a
sustained break above 115 yen, and its Oct. 7 high around 115.68,
could bring the euro out of its 112-115 range from the past two
months.
 The euro's rally swept the dollar aside, driving the U.S.
dollar index below major support around 78.27-37 to 78.14, down
0.5 percent on the day.
 Dealers said trade was thin partly due to a Japanese market
holiday on Tuesday and a U.S. market holiday on Thursday.
 The greenback was a touch lower at 83.40 yen, though its
surprise rebound this month from a 15-year low of 80.21 has kept
many traders positive about the greenback in the near term.
 Considerable attention is on whether the dollar can rise
sustainably above the cloud on the daily ichimoku chart, now at
83.64. A break there will send a strong bullish signal.
 The Australian dollar tracked the euro higher, rising 0.6
percent to $0.9925, extending gains after having triggered
stop-loss orders above $0.99.
 The Aussie gained 0.5 percent against the Japanese yen at
82.80 yen, having hit a six-month high of 83.00 yen at one point.
 The Aussie shrugged off further tightening measures in China,
Australia's largest export market as most regional shares rose.
 Last Friday, China ordered lenders to lock up more of their
money at the central bank for a second time in two weeks in a
fresh attempt to keep a lid on inflation. ""People have come
to recognise that this is fine-tuning or necessary policy
adjustment by China. It's not necessarily negative for the
outlook for Australian exports,"" Commonwealth Bank's Grace added.
 In contrast, the New Zealand dollar dived after Standard &
Poor's downgraded the outlook for its rating on the country's
foreign currency debt, citing its widening trade deficit and
credit risks in its banking sector.
 The kiwi fell 0.8 percent against the U.S. dollar to $0.7730.

(Adds Malaysia GDP data, 6th paragraph) 
 By Orathai Sriring 
 BANGKOK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Thailand's economy slipped
into a technical recession in the third quarter, reinforcing
signs of an Asia-wide slowdown as export growth cools,
manufacturing ebbs and the impact of massive government
stimulus spending fades.	
 Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy shrank 0.2 percent
in the third quarter after a revised 0.6 percent contraction
in the second, data showed on Monday, reducing chances of
another interest rate rise next month.	
 The data reinforce signs of a slowdown across much of the
region, from North Asian export powerhouses China, South Korea
and Taiwan to Southeast Asian ""tigers"" Thailand, Singapore and
Indonesia. Strong growth in Asia has been one of the few
bright spots for the struggling global economy. 
 Figures last week showed Taiwan's economic growth slowing
in the third quarter, while Singapore's trade-reliant economy
shrank 18.7 percent and Indonesia reported this month its
first slowdown in annual growth in five quarters. 
 From a year earlier, Thailand grew 6.7 percent in the
quarter, largely in line with economists' forecasts and
slowing from growth of 9.2 percent in the second quarter, the
data from the state planning agency showed. 
 ""Looking forward, we expect weaker global demand to bring
Thailand's economic growth to below trend in the fourth
quarter of 2010, and in the first half of 2011,"" said Usara
Wilaipich, a Bangkok-based economist at Standard Chartered
Bank. 
 Malaysia's economic growth slowed more than expected to
5.3 percent in the third quarter from 8.9 percent in the
second, its central bank said on Monday, noting growth in the
second half of the year and in early next year was
moderating."" [ID:nKLA002364]	
 OCBC economist Gundy Cahyadi said growth almost stalled in
the third quarter from the previous three months, though few
analysts give quarter-on-quarter figures.	


 
 The Asian slowdown has been exacerbated by the U.S.
dollar's slide, which has driven up regional currencies and
started to erode export revenue. It is complicating efforts by
Asia's central banks to return interest rates to normal levels
after drastic cuts in the wake of the 2008 global financial
crisis.	
 The Bank of Thailand is likely to keep its trend-setting
one-day repurchase rate unchanged at 1.75 percent at its next
policy-setting meeting on Dec. 1, said Arkhom
Termpittayapaisith, secretary-general of the National Economic
and Social Development Board, Thailand's state economic
planning agency. 
 Private economists echoed that view after the data, which
was marginally better than a deeper 0.4 percent contraction
expected by most economists in a Reuters survey. 
 ""We expect less aggressive monetary policy by the Bank of
Thailand and possible delays on interest rate hikes next
year,"" said Isara Ordeedolchest, an economist at KT Zeamico
Securities, a stock brokerage in Bangkok. 
 Pimonwan Mahujchariyawong, economist at Kasikorn Research
Centre, expects the economy to contract again in the fourth
quarter, hurt by a nearly 12 percent rise in the baht
this year against the dollar to a 13-year high and floods that
have killed more than 200 people since October. 
 
 RATES SEEN ON HOLD	
 Thailand's debt market has largely priced in a rate pause
next month, with one-year swap rates down by 22
basis points in the past two weeks. Government bond yields
<0#THBMK=> were barely changed after Monday's economic data.	
 Indonesia's central bank is also seen pausing to keep its
policy rate on hold at a record low 6.5 percent well into 2011
as it tries to avoid encouraging an even bigger flow of
investment capital to its markets. [ID:nSGE6A10FA] 
 Despite the slowdown, Thailand's state planning agency
raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 7.9
percent from 7.0-7.5 percent projected in August, and tipped
growth of between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2011. 
 Agency chief Arkhom said the quarterly contraction was due
to lower state spending and a slowdown in private investment.	
 ""It's cyclical that Q3 is usually weaker than other
quarters,"" he told reporters, adding that the flooding across
much of Thailand over October and November shaved economic
growth by 0.3 percentage points.	
 He said the fourth-quarter performance depended on
strength in exports which his agency expected to rise 25.1
percent this year before slowing to about half that rate of
growth next year.	
 The data puts Thailand technically in recession after two
straight quarters of economic contraction.	
 Earlier data had indicated the economy grew 0.2 percent in
the second quarter from the first, but that was revised down
to show it had contracted, due largely to political unrest
over April and May in which more than 90 people were killed.

 * S&P revises down New Zealand outlook to negative 
 * May cut rating if country's external finances worsen 
 * NZ$ slides in reaction, yields shoved higher 
 
 (Adds finance minister's reaction) 
 WELLINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's warned on
Monday that New Zealand's foreign currency rating could be
downgraded if the country continues to pile up more foreign
debt, sending its currency reeling by a full U.S. cent.	
 The ratings agency said it was revising New Zealand's
foreign currency outlook to negative from stable, citing a
widening current account deficit and credit risks in its
banking sector. An actual cut in the AA+/A-1+ rating could
well lead to an increase in borrowing costs for the country
and its banks.	
 ""The outlook revision on the foreign currency ratings
reflects our recognition of the risks stemming from New
Zealand's projected widening external imbalances in the
context of the country's weakened fiscal flexibility,"" said
S&P sovereign ratings credit analyst Kyran Curry. 
 Curry said the negative outlook meant there was around a
one-in-three chance of the rating actually being downgraded.
He also emphasised that there would be no change anytime soon
and this was a change in the medium-term view which covered
the next two to three years. 
 The agency said increased fiscal savings by the
National-led government would be crucial in avoiding a
downgrade. 
 That was a point acknowledged by New Zealand Finance
Minister Bill English, who said it underlined the importance
of cutting back on foreign debt. The country has net foreign
liabilities of more than NZ$160 billion. 
 ""This is a long-standing problem for New Zealand and has
left us vulnerable as a country,"" English said, adding that
the government was taking steps to reduce this external
vulnerability and was committed to returning the budget to
surplus by 2016. 
 Indeed, English was confident that action already under
way on the budget and debt would be enough to avoid a downgrade.	
 
 THE SOONER THE BETTER 
 Investors, however, were not so optimistic and knocked the
New Zealand dollar down over a cent to $0.7733 , while
pushing government bond yields higher. 
 ""At this stage it's still early days, but the onus is now
on the government to ensure the fiscal position is turned
around not only quicker but the return to surplus occurs
sooner,"" said Khoon Goh, a senior economist at ANZ-National
Bank. 
 ""The focus will surely be on the December half-year
update, to ensure the credit rating is not downgraded."" 
 The government is due to release its semi annual economic
and fiscal on Dec. 14, and has been warning that its growth
outlook could be lowered [ID:nWEL004221].	
 New Zealand's economic recovery has struggled to gain
traction, with unemployment stubbornly high and households and
companies cautious about spending. A surge in the local dollar
since September also threatens to make exports less competitive.	
 While the country's current account deficit has narrowed
in the past couple of years to just under 3 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), this was mainly due to sluggish
domestic demand.	
 As the economy recovers, the deficit was likely to expand
again toward 6 or 7 percent of GDP, said S&P. 
 Just a month ago, English said New Zealand's credit
ratings appeared safe, with the three main ratings agencies
approving of the government's fiscal strategy. [ID:nWLF004857]

 In October, Fitch reaffirmed New Zealand at AA+ with a
negative outlook, while in September Moody's maintained New
Zealand at AAA with a stable outlook.	
 S&P itself had maintained New Zealand's AA+/A-1+ rating
with a stable outlook back in September, when an earthquake
which devastated the South Island city of Christchurch put a
fresh strain on government finances.

 (Adds details, quote, background) 
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine
manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems announced on Monday
a change in accounting policy that defers historic revenues
and issued new revenue and earnings guidance for 2010-2011. 
 The company had said in its third-quarter report in late
October that it was considering changing the way it books
certain projects, which could have a significant effect on
previous and future financial statements. 
 As a consequence of the accounting change, Vestas defers
2.9 billion euros ($3.97 billion) in revenues from so-called
supply-and-installation contracts up to Sept. 30, 2010, the
company said in a statement. 
 That revenue will be recognised in coming periods, and the
production and shipments related to that revenue have already
taken place and the company has received 2.2 billion euros in
related down payments and prepayments, Vestas said. 
 ""The deferral of revenue and related earnings has the
effect that equity as per September 30, 2010, has been reduced
by 739 million euros,"" Vestas said. 
 The policy change does not affect cash flow, and, in the
future, the company's order backlog will be bigger than
before, it said. 
 Vestas said it now expects full-year 2010 revenue of 6.8
billlion euros and a margin on earnings before interest and
tax (EBIT) of around 7 percent before one-off costs of 140-160
million euros related to announced plant closures. 
 In its third-quarter report in October, Vestas had stuck
to its previous 2010 guidance which had been for revenue of 6
billion euros and an EBIT margin of 5-6 percent. 
 The company expects 2011 revenue and earnings to be at
same level as 2010 before the one-off costs, it said. 
 Vestas left its forecast for order intake in 2010
unchanged at 8,000-9,000 megawatts and for 2011 order intake
at 7,000-8,000 MW.

 ""I think the Irish news will lead to a short-term rally in

 Against the yen, the single currency rose 0.5 percent to
114.75 yen, from 114.19. Some Japanese exporters are selling into
the rally, but a sustained break above 115 yen could bring the
euro out of its 112-115 range from the past two months.

 By Lu Jianxin and Jason Subler
 SHANGHAI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - China's yuan  started
trading against the Russian rouble  in the Chinese onshore
forex market on Monday, the latest currency pair to be introduced
as part of Beijing's efforts to promote the use of its currency.
 The step is part of Beijing's efforts to expand the use of
the yuan for trade and even investment purposes, as a way of
reducing reliance on the dollar and thereby simplifying the
settlement of trade in everything from energy to manufactured
goods.
 The rouble is the seventh currency traded against the yuan in
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS).
 China launched trading between the yuan and the Malaysian
ringgit  in August, joining the U.S. dollar, Hong
Kong dollar, yen, euro and sterling.
 Russia is also trying to raise the profile of the rouble
after the crises of the 1990s and has called for a reduction in
reliance on the dollar as a global reserve currency.
 A Russian exchange official said last week that Russia would
also start yuan/rouble trading in December, after plans for the
launch of such trade were unveiled in September. [ID:nLDE68711E]
 ""China is now vigorously promoting the yuan's use in the
region and in the world partly because it is unhappy with the
dollar's performance since the latest global financial crisis,""
said a dealer at a major European bank in Shanghai.
 ""To achieve that goal, it needs to allow more currencies to
trade against the yuan at the CFETS, with the won  likely
to be the next to be introduced.""
 SNUBBING THE DOLLAR
 The rouble  traded at 4.6711 versus the yuan in
early trade, traders said, the same level as the mid-point set by
the People's Bank of China (PBOC), reflecting a cautious approach
at the launch of the new currency pair.
 The yuan will be permitted to rise or fall 5 percent against
the rouble each day from the mid-point, CFETS, a unit of the
central bank, said in a statement. The Chinese currency is still
not freely convertible under the capital account.
 The yuan-rouble trading range is the same as that for
yuan/ringgit, but is wider than the 0.5 percent the yuan may move
against the dollar in either direction each day and the 3 percent
leeway allowed against most other currencies.
 The wider band for yuan/rouble reflects the greater
volatility of currencies of emerging economies, CFETS said.
 China, the biggest holder of U.S. Treasuries, has complained
about the dollar's volatility since the financial crisis, urging
stability of global reserve currencies.
 Increasing the number of currencies traded against the yuan
will gradually help reduce the dollar's weight in the yuan's
nominal real exchange rate (NEER), or the currency's value
against a trade-weighted basket, traders said.
 Most China-based traders believe that the dollar accounts for
about 70 percent in the Chinese NEER system. Many Western
analysts believe such a NEER system is still highly correlated to
the dollar, although Beijing has persistently said it is using a
basket system to price the yuan.
 Among other steps to regionalise and internationalise the
yuan, China has launched a programme to use the yuan for
settlement in exports and imports, and allowed the development of
a nascent offshore yuan  market in Hong Kong.
 Beijing last month also started a pilot programme for
allowing some inbound and outbound foreign direct investment in
the far western region of Xinjiang to be settled in yuan.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2010 10:08PM ET</span>","RPT-FACTBOX-Trade, energy ties between China and Russia"," (Repeats item that originally moved on Nov. 19)
 Nov 22 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao heads to Russia
on Monday as he seeks to nail down a pricing agreement for gas
supplies to China and expand trade cooperation. [ID:nTOE6AH01I].
 Wen's visit underscores the increasingly close relationship
between two of the world's biggest emerging economies -- a marked
shift from the decades of distrust because of disputes over
Communist ideology.
 Wen will also go to Tajikistan for a meeting of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation (SCO) -- a Central Asian regional group
comprising Russia, China and four ex-Soviet Central Asian states.
 Here are some facts about energy and trade ties between
Russia and China:
 ENERGY
 -- Russia wants to diversify more of its energy exports away
from Europe, its traditional market, and into fast-growing China,
while China, the world's largest oil consumer, wants to boost its
energy security by looking for new sources of fuel.
 -- Russia has begun test-pumping about 600,000 tonnes of oil
along a new East Siberian-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline that is
set to start bringing 300,000 barrels per day to China in January
next year.
 -- China's oil imports from Russia could double if the
pipeline is used to capacity and the volume now exported by rail
and sea continues.
 -- Russia has been eager for more Chinese cash to fuel
growth. China agreed in October to lend Russia $6 billion for the
development of coal deposits. It also agreed in 2009 to lend $10
billion to Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and another
$15 billion to state-controlled oil giant Rosneft in exchange for
the 300,000 bpd of Russian oil to be transported through the
pipeline over 20 years. [ID:nLDE6941XP].
 -- China and Russia in September laid a cornerstone of a 13
million-tonne/year (260,000 bpd) joint refinery in Tianjin city
for which Russia pledged to supply 70 percent of crude oil needs.
 -- Russia, which has built a nuclear reactor in China, has
agreed to expand nuclear power cooperation in seven areas with
China, including building floating nuclear power plants,
exploring uranium mines, eliminating old plants and developing
markets abroad. [ID:nTOE68103W]
 -- But their close energy ties have been clouded by a dispute
about pricing for gas, which have dragged on for years, and that
Chinese officials say they hope to resolve during Wen's visit.
 -- Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom , said in 2006 it
would build two major pipelines to China but the projects have
been delayed because of wrangling over pricing.
 ECONOMIC TIES AND BILATERAL TRADE
 -- Russia has been pushing for a greater role for the rouble
 in global financial markets and, eventually, as some form
of reserve currency. China is also seeking a greater
international role for its still tightly controlled yuan .

 * Asian stocks, commodities firm in Asian trade 
 * Muted reaction so far to China's Friday policy tightening	
 
 By Koh Gui Qing 
 SYDNEY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The euro, Asian stocks and
commodities jumped in a relief rally on Monday after global
financial authorities agreed to save debt-swamped Ireland and
protect Europe's wider financial stability. 
 An agreement from the EU and the IMF to lend Ireland cash
to tackle its banking and budget crisis gave investors a
reason to buy back some of the assets sold off earlier this
month. [ID:nLDE6AK039] 
 But gains were moderate suggesting investors remained
cautious, in part because they did not want to risk
year-to-date profits, with Europe still saddled with fiscal
troublespots such as Portugal and Spain. 
 ""There are still a lot of issues in Europe,"" said Alex
Boggis, who heads fund manager Aberdeen's business in Hong
Kong. Aberdeen manages around $15 billion in Hong Kong and
China. 
 ""The focus of attention will move around Europe until
there are no problems left but that might be some time, so
there's going to be volatility for sure."" 
 At the heart of the euro zone's debt woes is investor
anxiety about whether the bloc will continue to rescue its
fiscally troubled members. 
 It has already spent 110 euros saving Greece, and
Ireland's bail-out is expected to cost about 80-90 billion
euros. 
 Still, the Irish bail-out brought some cheer and helped
the euro to climb as far as $1.3766, from $1.3683 late
in New York on Friday. It now faces resistance at $1.3770. 
 The softer U.S. dollar benefitted commodity and
metal prices. Copper was firm and oil  rose to
above $82 a barrel . Spot gold added $6.60 to
$1,360.75 an ounce, up from $1,353.50 in New York on Friday. 
 Other riskier assets also got a boost at the margins. 
 The Asia-Pacific MSCI index of shares outside Japan
added 0.7 percent. But it appeared stock
investors were more keen to buy laggards rather than pile into
the year's star performers. 
 Between sectors, the information technology sector
led gains with a 2 percent rise. But on the
year, it has fared the worse with just a 3.4 percent gain, way
behind a 31 percent jump in consumer discretionary stocks
. 
 It was the same between countries. Japan's Nikkei ,
which has straggled other Asian stock markets this year, hit
five-month highs and was up the most on the day with a 1.2
percent climb. 
 China's Shanghai stock index , another laggard
within Asia, managed to reverse an initial 0.9 percent loss to
be up 0.5 percent by mid-day. 
 The excitement around Ireland seemed to have overshadowed
for now China's policy tightening on Friday when it raised
banks' required reserves ratio to a record high. [ID:nL3E6MJ0N8]

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2010 06:20PM ET</span>",Q+A-How will Ireland's bailout work?," BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Ireland requested an
international bailout on Sunday to tackle its banking and budget
crisis. Following are some details of how it will work.
[ID:nLDE6AK039]
 
 WHAT IS AVAILABLE?
 The European Union safety net consists of the European
Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), which can lend up to 60
billion euros, and the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF), which is backed by 440 billion euros worth of euro zone
government guarantees. EU finance ministers said in a statement
that Ireland would receive aid from both facilities.
 The head of the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday
the IMF was also ready to help Ireland with a multi-year loan.
The IMF has indicated previously that it would be ready to
provide up to 50 percent of what Europe was providing.
 Ireland could also benefit from bilateral contributions. The
ministers said Britain and Sweden, which are not in the euro
zone, had indicated on Sunday they were ready to consider
offering bilateral loans. 
 
 WHO LENDS FIRST?
 Money from the EFSM would be paid out first, but EFSF cash
and IMF involvement help the EU avoid a situation where one
country uses up all the funds available under the EFSM.
 The EFSM is available to all 27 EU members while the EFSF
will lend only to the 16 countries of the euro zone.
 
 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
 The mechanism has never been used before, but EU officials
have estimated it would take three to five weeks from the
application for assistance and the first disbursement of money.
 The bailout will build on a four-year fiscal plan which the
Irish government is about to unveil. Dublin was also planning to
return to bond markets in January so having a bailout in place
before the end of the year would remove that deadline.
 
 HOW DOES IT START?
 The first steps have already been taken but others will
follow under the procedures below.
 1. The first step involves a request for help to the
European Commission and a draft reform programme being sent to
the Commission and to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC)
of junior finance ministers and central bankers.
 2. The European Commission, in liaison with the European
Central Bank, assesses the request and recommends to EU finance
ministers to accept or reject it.
 3. EU ministers vote on the Commission proposal with a
qualified majority.
 4. If they say 'yes', the ministers also say how much money
Ireland will get, in what tranches, and when, and set conditions
for the help. The conditions are drawn up by the Commission in
consultation with the European Central Bank.
 5. Ireland and the Commission sign a memorandum of
understanding containing the conditions for help.
 6. The Commission raises the money on the market by issuing
bonds, using the EU budget as collateral. The EU executive pays
out the tranches to Ireland.
 7. Seeking funds from the IMF, apart from the EU help,
involves first telling the Commission about it. The Commission
determines what financing options are still available under EU
schemes and informs the EFC as well.
 8. The aid money is paid out in instalments after regular
checks by the Commission that Ireland is on track with its
reform programme.

 CONDITIONS
 The EU/IMF will seek strict conditions on its loans and may
require Dublin to consider tax increases and spending cuts
previously thought unpalatable.
 Ireland is currently aiming for fiscal adjustments totalling
15 billion euros between now and 2014, a doubling of its
previous target. Under a bailout scenario, the adjustments may
be even harsher.
 The EU could tell Dublin to renege on an agreement with
public sector unions not to cut jobs or push through further
wage cuts. Brussels could also demand Ireland raises its
corporation tax rate, viewed as sacrosanct by Dublin, from its
low level of 12.5 percent. 
 Greece had to raise its rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) to 23
percent from 19 percent as part of its bailout package and
Ireland may have to increase its VAT level from 21 percent
currently.

 WHAT WILL THE COST BE FOR IRELAND?
 The blueprint for EU support - although not binding - is the
financial aid package to Greece where, for variable-rate loans,
the basis is three-month Euribor, while fixed rate loans are
based upon the rates corresponding to swap rates for the
relevant maturities.
 In addition there is a charge of 300 basis points for
maturities up to three years and an extra 100 basis points per
year for loans longer than three years. A onetime service fee of
50 basis points is charged to cover operational costs.
 The cost of borrowing is roughly around five percent.
 While there are no limits on the maturities of the loans to
the country in need, the Greek case has set a precedent of 3-5
year loans.

 HOW MUCH DOES IRELAND NEED?
 A senior EU source said on Sunday Ireland was likely to
receive 80 to 90 billion euros in the planned financial support
programme, including money to support the Irish banking sector.
 Greece's rescue package was 110 billion euros.
 Any bailout needs to be big enough to end uncertainty over
whether future Irish bank loan losses could rattle the sovereign
and destabilise the euro zone.
 Ireland has pegged its worst-case scenario for its banks'
bailout at 50 billion euros but investors do not believe the
government's assessment after previous forecasts were raised.
 A bailout for the banks would not necessarily have to equal
or exceed 50 billion euros because Ireland has already pledged
33 billion euros for its banking sector but it would probably
have to be considerably more than 17 billion euros to reflect
investor concerns about losses breaching the latest worst-case
scenario.
 Ireland's banks are dependent on ECB support -- 130 billion
euros in funding at the end of October -- and presumably this
support would continue until markets had calmed down enough for
lenders to start accessing wholesale funding markets again.
 
 CAN IRELAND USE THE MONEY TO SUPPORT ITS BANKS?
 Yes. While the EU funds cannot be accessed by Irish banks
directly, the Irish government can borrow from the EFSM or EFSF
and use the cash to support its banking sector. The EU finance
ministers said on Sunday the programme would include a fund for
potential future capital needs of the banking sector.

cents
 * Sale to be completed in late 2011
(Adds comments from CPPIB)
 SYDNEY/TORONTO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Australian shopping-mall
owner Westfield Group  is selling a stake in its
London's Stratford City development to Dutch and Canadian
pension funds for 871.5 million pounds ($1.39 billion),
Westfield said on Monday.
 Westfield has agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in the
retail arm of the development, which is being built next to the
site of the 2012 Olympic Games, to Dutch pension fund APG and
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
 ""It will be one of the largest and best shopping centers in
England and probably Europe, so we see it as a very good asset
with very good management, and we're getting in at the front
end,"" said Graeme Eadie, senior vice-president for real estate
investments at CPPIB, which manages the national pension fund.
 ""I think the returns are going to be quite strong and we'll
see lots of growth over time,"" he told Reuters.
 Global pension funds, with their deep pockets and long-term
investment horizons, have became important players in the
private equity market in the wake of the global financial
crisis.
 Canadian funds have taken an especially active role. CPPIB,
with some C$138.6 billion ($135.88 billion) under management as
of Sept 30, has led the charge, participating in some of the
largest global private equity deals of the past two years.
 The Stratford City deal, due to be completed in late 2011,
follows Westfield's move to spin off half of its Australian and
New Zealand property assets to create a new $12 billion fund
that will not have offshore and development risks.
 The main benefits of the Stratford deal are a 150 million
pound profit on the development, which Westfield plans to
reinvest in other projects, and an increase in the expected
return on its stake to more than 9 percent from 7-7.5 percent.
 The deal will also cut Westfield's gearing by 2 percent.
 The sale will have little impact on its operating earnings
per share forecast of 74.6 cents in 2011.
 The Stratford sale and Westfield's spin-off are all
designed to help perk up the group's shares which have dropped
5.7 percent to A$11.82 so far this year, down slightly more
than the broader market.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2010 03:56PM ET</span>",TEXT-EU finance minister's statement on Ireland," BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers issued the following statement on the Irish request
for financial aid from the EU on Sunday:
 
 ""Statement by the Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers on Ireland
 
 Ministers welcome the request of the Irish Government for
financial assistance from the European Union and euro-area
Member States. Ministers concur with the Commission and the ECB
that providing assistance to Ireland is warranted to safeguard
financial stability in the EU and in the euro area.
 In the context of a joint EU-IMF programme, the financial
assistance package to the Irish state should be financed from
the European financial stabilisation mechanism (EFSM) and the
European financial stability facility (EFSF), possibly
supplemented by bilateral loans to be negotiated by EU Member
States. The United Kingdom and Sweden have already indicated
today that they stand ready to consider a bilateral loan.
 EU and euro-area financial support will be provided under a
strong policy programme which will be negotiated with the Irish
authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the
ECB. 
 The programme will address the fiscal challenges of the
Irish economy in a decisive manner. It will build on the fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms that will be put forward by
the Irish authorities in their Four Year Budgetary Strategy next
week. This strategy will provide the details of the government's
commitment to achieve fiscal consolidation of 6 billion euros in
2011 as part of a strategy leading to a 3 percent of GDP deficit
by 2014, implying an overall consolidation of 15 billion (euros)
in the four-year strategy, which contains an annual review.
Given the strong fundamentals of the Irish economy, decisive
implementation of the programme should allow a return to a
robust and sustainable growth, safeguarding the economic and
social cohesion.
 The programme will also include a fund for potential future
capital needs of the banking sector. By building on the measures
already taken by Ireland to address stress in its banking
sector, a comprehensive range of measures -- including
deleveraging and restructuring of the banking sector -- will
contribute to ensuring that the banking system performs its role
in the functioning of the economy.
 After approval by the Irish Government, the programme will
be endorsed by the ECOFIN Council and the Eurogroup, in line
with national procedures, on the basis of a Commission and ECB
assessment.""

 GABORONE, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Chinese Vice President Xi
Jinping on Sunday signed several economic deals with Botswana,
the world's biggest diamond producer, including one offering the
southern African country $6 million for development.
 Xi, touted as China's next president, arrived in Botswana on
Saturday, the last stop on his Africa tour, after visiting oil
producer Angola, China's biggest African trading partner, and
South Africa --Africa's biggest economy.
 Vice President Mompati Merafhe and Xi signed three
cooperation deals, including an Economic and Technical
Cooperation agreement, under which China is to provide Botswana
with aid worth 40 million RMB ($6 million), China's Xinhua news
agency reported.
 The two also signed an infrastructure and energy deal
between the national utility Botswana Power Corporation and
China Development Bank and Golden Concord Group, it said.
 The other agreement was on financial projects between the
Botswana government and the Export-Import Bank of China.
 No monetary details were provided on the other two deals.
 Xi on Wednesday signed an energy deal with South Africa in a
visit aimed at obtaining minerals the Asian giant needs to fuel
its blistering growth.
 During his two-day visit, Xi is expected on Monday to tour
Diamond Trading Company Botswana, which is jointly owned by the
diamond-mining giant De Beers and the government of Botswana.
 China's mineral diplomacy has been criticised for its
secrecy and for bolstering governments that Western states
accuse of human rights violations.
 A senior World Bank executive said Chinese companies eyeing
African mineral resources must stop making closed-door deals and
become more transparent in their investments.

on Sunday urged the central bank to raise interest rates further,
and called on officials to seek additional capital measures to
mitigate any fallout from rapid cross-border capital flows.
 The Korea Development Institute (KDI) said it was necessary
to secure policy tools against possible risks such as a slowing
global economy by normalising macro-economic policy in the short
run, and to prevent inflation and the formation of asset bubbles.
 ""Taking into consideration that our economy has been
sustaining solid growth after recovering from the global
financial crisis, the current interest rate is judged as too
low,"" the state-run research body said in a statement.
 Kim Hyeon-wook, a fellow with KDI's macroeconomic and
financial policy department, told reporters the ""appropriate""
interest rates for the country would be above 3 percent.
 On Tuesday, the central bank lifted the 7-day repurchase rate
 by a quarter point to 2.50 percent, reinforcing
views that more would come during the months ahead, although its
cautious language made investors scale back expectations on how
far rates would go up in the long run. [ID:nTOE6AF01X]
 The KDI is the most influential economic institute in South
Korea, and the government takes its forecasts into account when
setting policy.
 The economic institute raised its forecast for this year's
growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy to 6.2 percent, which
would be the fastest pace in nearly a decade, while lowering next
year's growth forecast to 4.2 percent from the previous 4.4
percent.
 The strong economic fundamental is expected to keep luring
foreign funds amid more policy easing by developed countries, and
South Korea needs to prepare measures to reduce sharp swings in
capital flows, the KDI said.
 Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong-yong said the country planned
to prepare additional measures to reduce such flows by the end of
this year, following legislative steps to re-impose a tax on
foreign bond holders. [ID:nTOE6AI00G]
 ""The taxation is not enough to deal with a surge in
short-term foreign currency debts, although it may resolve
disturbing factors in bond markets,"" Kim said.

 * Regulator said Indian licences were awarded too cheaply
 
 By Gwladys Fouche
 OSLO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Norway's Telenor denied on Saturday
that its Indian subsidiary Uninor had won mobile phone licences
in an irregular manner, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
 India's telecoms regulator has called for 38 mobile
licences, including some held by Uninor, to be cancelled amid a
political scandal that is shaking the government of Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh.
 The regulator said on Thursday that the licences were
awarded too cheaply, and may have cost India a potential $31
billion. The accusations have led to the sacking of Telecoms
Minister Andimuthu Raja.
 ""We have now investigated how our licences were awarded and
have not found any irregularities,"" Telenor spokesman Glenn
Mandelid told NTB.
 Telenor had not yet established itself on the Indian mobile
market when the licences were awarded in 2008. Later that year
it bought stakes in local firm Unitech, which was awarded the
permits. That firm is today called Uninor.
 Mandelid said the award system in 2008 was not the same as
today's. ""Indian authorities feared the telecoms market would
turn into a monopoly so they operated under a 'first come first
served' principle,"" he said. 
 ""The award system was the same from 2000 to 2008 when
Unitech got its licence. Since then they have gone over to an
auction system.""
 Telenor has about 13.5 million customers in the country's
highly competitive mobile market. 
 It has praised its strong market development in the third
quarter but said its Indian operations would post and EBITDA

 * Allied Irish Banks sees big deposit outflow
 * Euro eases, bond spreads edge higher after early gains
 * Experts worry Irish rescue won't stem contagion

(Adds Geithner comment)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Padraic Halpin
 BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A financial aid plan to
help Ireland cope with its battered banks will be unveiled next
week, EU sources said on Friday, but experts warned a rescue may
not be enough to prevent contagion to other euro zone members.
 Europe's single currency fell back late in the day and the
risk premium investors demand to buy Irish debt instead of
benchmark German bonds remained high as optimism about an aid
deal was tempered by a sense the crisis is far from over.
 A poll of participants at a high-level banking congress in
Frankfurt showed nearly three quarters believe the turmoil that
has shaken Europe's currency bloc for much of the past year
would rage on even after an Irish rescue, ensnaring other
financially weak countries like Portugal.
 ""As long as the fundamentals don't improve, the pressure
will continue on other countries too,"" said Daniel Gros, head of
the Centre of European Policy Studies in Brussels. ""Many believe
the euro zone is just moving from one crisis to the next.""
 In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
disagreed. Asked in an interview on Bloomberg Television whether
an aid package for Ireland from the EU and IMF could be the last
bailout needed, he said: ""I think that is absolutely possible.""
 ""It is within the capacity of the Irish Government and the
European authorities to achieve, and I believe they will achieve
that because this government, Ireland, has demonstrated that
they are willing to do some very, very difficult, very, very
hard things to dig their way out of this mess,"" he said.
 
 DEPENDENCY
 Ireland's central bank chief has acknowledged the country
needs a loan running into the tens of billions of euros to shore
up a fragile banking sector that has grown dependent on ECB
funds and seen an exodus of deposits over the past six months.
 Allied Irish, once the country's largest listed lender,
announced that customer accounts had plunged by 13 billion euros
so far this year and that mortgage book arrears had continued to
rise in the third quarter.
 AIB is relying on the Irish government to bail it out after
years of loose lending to property developers left it with a
gaping capital hole in excess of 10 billion euros.
 ""General funding market conditions in recent months have
become increasingly challenging,"" the bank said in a statement.
 Last week, larger rival Bank of Ireland signalled a 10
billion euro outflow of corporate deposits in the third quarter
while bancassurer Irish Life & Permanent said it had suffered a
600 million outflow in the same period.
 Unlike Bank of Ireland and Irish Life & Permanent, AIB did
not indicate if the deposit withdrawal had tailed off.
 The cost of supporting its ailing banks is forecast to push
Ireland's deficit up to 32 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) this year, over ten times EU limits and by far the highest
in the 16-nation currency zone.
 Concerns about swelling bank liabilities and a German-led
drive to create a system for restructuring stricken euro zone
state debts has pushed Dublin's borrowing costs sharply higher
since late October, forcing the government into rescue talks
with European and IMF officials.
 
 UNCLEAR ON AID AMOUNT
 Irish community minister Pat Carey said the government would
publish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15
billion euros early next week. EU sources said the financial aid
plan for Ireland would be presented at roughly the same time.
 Sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 The head of the euro zone's temporary fiscal safety net,
from which funds could come, said aid could be raised in five to
eight days if needed, notably from investors in Asia.
 ""We are confident that we can raise the necessary funds from
institutional investors, central banks and sovereign funds, in
Asia in particular,"" Klaus Regling, head of the European
Financial Stability Facility, told French daily Le Monde.
 Carey said it was impossible to say how much aid Ireland
would need until a joint mission of the European Commission,
European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, which
arrived in Dublin on Thursday, had a good look at the banks.
 Banks in Ireland have been largely shut out of market
lending due to concerns about their solvency. They are almost
entirely reliant on funding from the ECB, which reached 130
billion euros by end-October.
 Markets calmed in recent days after it became clear Ireland
was on track to receive aid, but remained jittery on Friday.
 The euro briefly pushed up above $1.3720, only to fall back
to $1.3660 in late European trading. The spreads of Irish
10-year bonds above German benchmarks drifted down towards 5.4
percentage points before pushing back up to 5.6 points, dragging
Greek, Portuguese and Spanish debt alongside.
 Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital
Economics, spoke of a ""creeping concern"" that problems on the
European periphery would spread, possibly engulfing big
economies like that of Spain.
 
 BONE OF CONTENTION
 There still remains a risk that aid talks could drag out if
Dublin and the EU are unable to agree on the conditions attached
to financial assistance.
 Ireland's rock-bottom 12.5 percent corporation tax is
shaping up as a major bone of contention, with euro zone
neighbours pressing Ireland to raise it as part of any deal and
Dublin resisting, arguing it is crucial for foreign investment.
 The government, under severe pressure from the media and an
emboldened opposition, faces a by-election next week which
threatens to cut its razor-thin parliamentary majority.
 Speaking at the opening of a new airport terminal on Friday,
embattled Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen vowed to get the
""best possible outcome"" for the Irish people in the talks.

 NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Hopes Ireland's debt crisis
will soon be resolved lifted investor sentiment and the euro on
Friday even as U.S. oil prices slid after China sought to curb
inflation for the second time in two weeks.
 Wall Street rebounded late in the session, pulling along
global stocks, on a rally in semiconductors. But the broad U.S.
market finished just below a key psychological level, a sign
shares could trade in a tight range through year's end.
 The euro rose for a third straight day against the dollar
and gold prices were little changed just above $1,350 an ounce
on growing confidence a financial aid plan for Ireland will be
unveiled next week, according to European Union sources. For
details see [ID:nN19115574]
 Hopes that Ireland was near a deal to get tens of billions
of euros from its European partners and the International
Monetary Fund helped push the euro above $1.37 overnight. But
momentum stalled as traders awaited further details.
 The euro  was up 0.25 percent at $1.378.
 Experts warned an Irish bailout may not be enough to
prevent contagion to other euro zone members. [ID:nLDE6AI1OC]
 ""The sense of calm that has returned today and yesterday is
taking away any safe-haven bid that may have emanated from the
potential crisis,"" said Tom Pawlicki, a precious metals and
energy analyst of MF Global.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
about 0.1 percent, while its emerging markets index <.MSCIEF>
gained almost the same.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 22.32 points, or 0.20 percent, at 11,203.55. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.04 points, or 0.25 percent, at
1,199.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.72
points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,518.12.
 Analysts said if the benchmark S&P 500 fails to break above
the 1,200 mark, stocks could struggle to move much higher until
the beginning of next year.
 Sentiment indicators on Wall Street have grown too bullish,
and stocks could be in a pullback or trading range ""until we
get the optimism worked off and some pessimism built up,"" said
William Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird &
Co in Nashville, Tennessee.
 The raising of banking reserve requirements in China to
tighten the economy kept bullion under pressure and led crude
prices to fall on concerns it will reduce demand in the world's
second-largest consumer of oil.
 The move by the People's Bank of China raised speculation a
hike in interest rates was in the works. U.S. oil prices fell,
logging their biggest weekly decline in two months.
 U.S. crude for December delivery  settled down 34
cents at $81.51 on the contract's last day. U.S. January crude
 settled down 44 cents to $81.98 a barrel.
 In London, Brent crude  for January delivery settled
down 71 cents to $84.34 a barrel.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down

 U.S. Treasuries were steady to higher, ending a volatile
week, as the market consolidated at higher yields reached in
recent weeks ahead of new supply. [ID:nN19223664]
 Thirty-year bonds, meanwhile, rose as the Federal Reserve
purchased long-dated debt as part its $600 billion program,
known as QE2. The market also benefited from a bid as hedges
relating to municipal bond sales were removed.
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up 23/32 in
price to yield 4.24 percent. The benchmark 10-year U.S.

 By Samantha Pearson and Caroline Stauffer
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Nov 19 (Reuters) -The Brazilian real
weakened slightly on Friday after China tightened its money
supply to slow heady growth, threatening to crimp demand for
Latin American exports.
 China's central bank ordered lenders to lock up more of
their money at the central bank for the second time in two
weeks, leading to speculation a hike in interest rates was in
the works. For more, see: [ID:nL3E6MJ0N8]
 ""If China raised its interest rates that would hurt
commodity prices and directly affect emerging market
currencies,"" said Mario Copca, an analyst at Vanguardia
brokerage in Mexico City. ""Restricting liquidity has a similar
impact, but it is less pronounced.""
 China is Brazil's top trading partner and is a major source
of demand for the region's commodity exports. The Brazilian
real finished 0.17 percent weaker at 1.718 on the local spot
market. The Colombian peso  weakened 0.37 percent
to 1876.65 per dollar.
 The Chilean peso  closed 0.04 percent stronger at 480
per dollar. The Mexican currency  was flat at 12.27 per
dollar.
 In Brazil, investors were also wary about news that
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega will stay in his post
in the next government, said Roberto Padovani, chief Brazil
economist with WestLB bank in Sao Paulo. [ID:nN18268556]
 ""Mantega is a name associated with an expansionary fiscal
policy and from a macroeconomic point of view, this is bad,"" he
said.
 Investors are looking for reassurances that when
President-elect Dilma Rousseff takes office on New Year's day,
she will work to cut public spending and keep a lid on
inflation.
 BUMPY RIDE FOR BRAZILIAN YIELDS
 Fresh Brazilian inflation data, released by the Getulio
Vargas Foundation research group on Friday, added to recent
signs that prices are creeping up in Latin America's biggest
economy. That gave traders a fresh reason to bet that the
central bank would have to keep interest rates high to combat
inflation.
 Yields then spiked higher after a media report said that
Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles recommended tighter
monetary policy. That report proved to be incorrect, causing a
rapid shift in positions and a frenzy of revised trading
recommendations.
 The yield on the contract due January 2012 , one of
the most heavily traded contracts of the session, rose to 11.68
percent from 11.64 percent.
 Brazil's currency could be the subject of a price bubble,
Meirelles said on Friday, adding that he would meet with
Rousseff next week to discuss extending his term.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Friday, gaining for a third straight day versus the dollar, as
investors grew more confident that Ireland's debt crisis would
be resolved.
 Gains in the euro, however, may prove temporary, with
investors generally fearful Ireland's problems could spread to
other peripheral economies in the euro zone.
 Hopes that Ireland was near a deal to get tens of billions
of euros from its European partners and the IMF helped push the
euro above $1.37 overnight, although momentum stalled ahead of
resistance around $1.3750. Traders said this level is likely to
hold until markets get more details on the Irish rescue plan.
 In the currency options market, euro sentiment stabilized
for now. The one-month euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometer
of currency sentiment, started to creep higher, suggesting
investors near-term are starting to get less euro-bearish.
 The euro's risk reversal still showed a ""put"" bias, but it
has risen from extremely low levels. On Friday, puts traded
higher -- a mid-market of -1.175 vols , with bids
at -1.55 vols. On Thursday, bids on euro puts were at -1.60,
falling from -2.025 vols early this week, a roughly 2-1/2-month
low.
 ""The fall-out from the banking crisis will play out in
Irish politics and in the economy for years to come. From a
global perspective, however, the tension in Ireland appears to
have come off the boil and this is lending support to the
euro,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank
in London.
 A deal to help Ireland cope with its battered banks will be
unveiled next week, EU sources said on Friday. Ireland will
publish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15
billion euros at roughly the same time. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6AI0QG]
 TECHNICAL CORRECTION IN EURO
 In early afternoon trading, the euro  was up 0.3
percent at $1.3678, after rising as high as $1.3733 on trading
platform EBS. It has recovered from a slide to a seven-week low
of $1.3446 earlier in the week and is poised to end the week
slightly lower against the dollar.
 ""This abrupt calming in the markets coincides with an
expected technical correction in the euro,"" said John Ross
Crooks III, director of research at Black Swan Capital
Management in Florida.
 Right now, Crooks said the euro is likely to pull back
toward its 72-hour moving average at about $1.3600. From there,
the euro should go higher to $1.3820 and $1.3975.
 Some analysts said even if Ireland does get a rescue, the
euro is unlikely to see a big rally. ""If there's a bailout for
Ireland, that's been largely priced in,"" said Aroop Chatterjee,
currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.
 He added that funding concerns and fiscal consolidation
will remain negative for the euro next year. He expects the
euro to rise to $1.38 in one month, before sliding to around
$1.30 over 12 months.
 News overnight that China tightened monetary policy by
raising banks' reserve requirements somewhat dented risk
appetite. [ID:nL3E6MJ0N8]
 The impact was felt by higher-yielding commodity-linked
currencies such as the Australian dollar. Australia is
a large exporter of commodities to China and tends to weaken on
worries of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The Aussie dollar
last traded at down 0.3 percent against the greenback at
US$0.9858.
 A speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in
Frankfurt helped push down U.S. Treasury yields, leading to a
fall in the dollar versus the yen. Bernanke hit back at critics
of the Fed's latest bond-buying program. He also issued a
thinly veiled attack on China's policy of keeping its currency
weak. [ID:nN18107490]
 The dollar last traded at 83.48 yen , flat on the
day. The euro, meanwhile, rose 0.1 percent agaisnt the yen to

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro steadied versus the
dollar on Friday on growing confidence that Ireland's banking
and debt crisis will be resolved, with key resistance capping
upside in the near term.
 Hopes that Ireland was near a deal to get tens of billions
of euros from its European partners and the IMF helped push the
euro above $1.37 overnight, but momentum stalled ahead of
resistance around $1.3750. Traders said this level is likely to

would publish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15

 ""Even if the way to stability is not exactly clear, the
market seems to be getting more comfortable with the idea that
ultimately the situation will be stabilized one way or the
other,"" said Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in New York. ""The tail risks for the euro are not as
severe as they were in April and May.""
 The euro was last little changed at $1.3643, after rising
as high as $1.3733 on trading platform EBS. It has recovered
from a slide to a seven-week low of $1.3446 earlier in the week
and is poised to end the week slightly lower against the
dollar.
 The euro zone single currency remained resilient after news
that China tightened monetary policy by raising banks' reserve
requirements, which dented some risk appetite.
 Support come in at the 55-day moving average at $1.3607.
Traders said the euro still needs to get above resistance at
$1.3750 to put an end to the downward correction of the last
couple of weeks.
 ""That's the level from which the euro broke earlier to run
to the $1.42 level. Now we're having a hard time clearing it,""
said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in
New York.
 BERNANKE DEFENDS QE
 Some analysts said even if Ireland does get a rescue, the
euro is unlikely to see a big rally. ""If there's a bailout for

 He added that funding concerns and fiscal consolidation
will remain negative for the euro next year. He expects the
euro to rise to $1.38 in one month, before sliding to around
$1.30 over 12 months.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.1 percent to 114.06, up
from the week's low around 112.20 yen.
 Despite the worries about Ireland and the risk of contagion
to Portugal and Spain, Stephen Gallo, head of markets analysis
at Schneider FX, said the markets are ""not seeing the vicious,
speculative selling of the euro as we did during Greece's
problems.
 ""You're also not seeing real money moving out of their
longer-term euro long positions,"" he said, adding that selling
in the euro under $1.3500 had offered a good chance for
long-term investors to pick up euro assets, albeit
cautiously.""
 In prepared remarks for delivery at a conference in
Frankfurt, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hit back at
critics of the U.S. central bank's latest bond-buying program.
He also issued a thinly veiled attack on China's policy of
keeping its currency weak.
 His remarks helped push down U.S. Treasury yields, leading
to a fall in the dollar versus the yen. The pair last traded at
83.48 yen, flat on the day.
 Higher-yielding commodity-linked currencies such as the
Australian dollar fell after China's tightening move. Australia
is a large exporter of commodities to China and tends to weaken
on worries of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The Aussie
dollar last traded at US$0.9844, down 0.5 percent.

 * Sources say ISS has chosen 10 banks for IPO in early 2011

(Adds details, quotes, background, byline)
 By Peter Levring 
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The head of Danish cleaning
group ISS said on Friday the company aims to carry out an
initial public offering (IPO) of stock, despite a report that
private equity firms are preparing buyout bids.
 On Thursday, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters
several private equity funds were readying bids for the $7
billion company before a deadline next week.
 The owners of ISS -- Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and
Sweden's EQT -- have been exploring an IPO or a sale.
 ""What the strategic review aims at is an IPO,"" ISS Chief
Executive Jeff Gravenhorst told Reuters. ""That's what we remain
focused on and what our efforts go into.""
 Gravenhorst also said ISS, one of the world's largest
facilities management companies, expects to deliver more volume
growth to its future owners and better margins in emerging and
mature markets.
 Separately, sources close to the deal told Reuters that ISS
has appointed a syndicate of 10 banks to handle a possible
listing on the Copenhagen stock exchange early next year.
 ""They've appointed Citibank, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Nordea
as joint bookrunners, while SEB, Danske Bank, Carnegie and UBS
have been picked as co-leads on an initial public offering,"" a
source close to the matter said.
 Other sources confirmed that banks had been picked after a
""beauty contest"" during the summer, but added that no firm
decision had been made about whether to opt for an IPO or a
secondary buyout.
 Gravenhorst declined to comment on the list of banks.
 
 GROWTH IN OUTSOURCING
 ISS has a workforce of more than 500,000, making it one of
the world's biggest private sector employers, cleaning offices,
cooking school meals and guarding buildings in more than 50
countries.
 It sees a growing business as Europeans and Americans in
particular face tough choices slashing budgets and trying to
save by outsourcing services.
 ""We can offer public services 10-20 percent below current
costs (in public sectors) if contracts have never been
outsourced before,"" Gravenhorst said.
 Jyske Bank said a peer group valuation would put a market
value of 45 billion Danish crowns ($8.43 billion) on ISS, but
that its ability to handle large facilities and global contracts
should price the company at 47 to 49 billion.
 ""Following recent succesful IPOs, no doubt investor interest
for an ISS IPO will be very big and push pricing higher,"" Jyske
Bank analyst Martin Hansen said.
 In 2005, ISS was taken off the Copenhagen bourse in a
surprise move orchestrated by EQT after the Swedish fund lost a
bidding war for Danish telecom TDC to a British-American
consortium of funds Apax Partners, Blackstone Group, Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, Permira Advisers and Providence Equity Partners.
 TDC is being readied for a December off-load of shares that
could raise $3 billion for the five funds, following a recent
wave of private funds seeking to exit their investments by
flotations on the Copenhagen bourse.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2010 11:52AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-INTERVIEW-Estonian finmin sees more euro zone austerity," By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Ireland and other debt-laden
euro zone states will need another dose of austerity before
investor confidence returns, Estonia's finance minister said,
pledging to run tight budgets when his country joins the single
currency.
 Jurgen Ligi said the prospect of Estonia adopting the euro
next year had boosted confidence in the whole Baltic region and
expected this to lead to an upsurge in lending by Nordic banks,
which he said was vital for growth following a brutal recession.
 ""A big part of the confidence in all these (euro zone)
countries is fiscal policy -- their loan burden and deficit,"" he
told Reuters in an interview on Friday, citing Ireland, Spain
and Portugal.
 ""They have to have more austerity measures to (regain)
confidence from the markets.""
 Estonia cut its budget deficit by 9 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) to make sure it met the euro entry
criteria, while budget reserves equal to about 10 percent of GDP
were also vital.
 ""Ireland is talking about its specific situation and
Portugal is saying it is not Ireland and Spain is saying it is
not Portugal or Ireland,"" he added.
 ""The situations are all different, and what is really common
is that they need more austerity measures, that is for sure.""
 A financial aid plan to help Ireland cope with its battered
banks will be unveiled next week, EU sources said on Friday, but
experts warned a rescue may not be enough to prevent contagion
to other euro zone members.
 Ligi saw little chance Estonia's budget policy would become
looser once it was safely inside the single currency bloc.
 ""Estonia has learnt a lot and we do not need radical policy
changes. We have been keeping a conservative line since the very
beginning. We are just much more conservative now in general.""
 
 BALTIC COMEBACK
 Estonia's southern neighbour Latvia sparked widespread
concerns about the Baltic economies in 2008, when it was forced
into taking a 7.5 billion euro IMF-led bailout.
 Ligi said confidence had been returning to the region,
helped by Estonia's qualification for euro zone entry. The three
countries' economies have also started to recover from
double-digit slumps, the EU's steepest, in 2009.
 ""We started to get the message through that Estonian
finances are in order and we are joining the euro zone and are
meeting the Maastricht (entry) criteria,"" he said.
 ""This helped the other Baltic states to impose austerity
measures, especially in the case of Latvia.""
 Latvia and the third Baltic state Lithuania are eyeing euro
entry in 2014, but both need to chop their budgets further
before then.
 All three also need the Nordic banks that dominate their
financial markets -- led by Swedbank, SEB, Nordea and DnB NOR
-- to start lending again after credit levels fell during the
crisis as losses on loans granted during an earlier boom
mounted.
 ""It is quite natural that banks become very cautious and the
reason for that was that they probably showed too little caution
during the boom,"" he said.
 ""At the moment, the situation is... more or less balanced.
The growth in lending will happen, we are sure.""

(Adds AIB statement, economist quote, details)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Padraic Halpin
 BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A financial aid plan to
help Ireland cope with its battered banks will be unveiled next
week, EU sources said on Friday, but experts warned a rescue may
not be enough to prevent contagion to other euro zone members.
 Europe's single currency fell back late in the day and the
risk premium investors demand to buy Irish debt instead of
benchmark German bonds remained high as optimism about an aid
deal was tempered by a sense the crisis is far from over.
 A poll of participants at a high-level banking congress in
Frankfurt showed nearly three quarters believe the turmoil that
has shaken Europe's currency bloc for much of the past year
would rage on even after an Irish rescue, ensnaring other
financially weak countries like Portugal.
 ""As long as the fundamentals don't improve, the pressure
will continue on other countries too,"" said Daniel Gros, head of
the Centre of European Policy Studies in Brussels. ""Many believe
the euro zone is just moving from one crisis to the next.""
 Ireland's central bank chief has acknowledged the country
needs a loan running into the tens of billions of euros to shore
up a fragile banking sector that has grown dependent on ECB
funds and seen an exodus of deposits over the past six months.
 Allied Irish, once the country's largest listed lender,
announced that customer accounts had plunged by 13 billion euros
so far this year and that mortgage book arrears had continued to
rise in the third quarter.
 AIB is relying on the Irish government to bail it out after
years of loose lending to property developers left it with a
gaping capital hole in excess of 10 billion euros.
 ""General funding market conditions in recent months have
become increasingly challenging,"" the bank said in a statement.
 Last week, larger rival Bank of Ireland signalled a 10
billion euro outflow of corporate deposits in the third quarter
while bancassurer Irish Life & Permanent said it had suffered a
600 million outflow in the same period.
 Unlike Bank of Ireland and Irish Life & Permanent, AIB did
not indicate if the deposit withdrawal had tailed off.
 The cost of supporting its ailing banks is forecast to push
Ireland's deficit up to 32 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) this year, over ten times EU limits and by far the highest
in the 16-nation currency zone.
 Concerns about swelling bank liabilities and a German-led
drive to create a system for restructuring stricken euro zone
state debts has pushed Dublin's borrowing costs sharply higher
since late October, forcing the government into rescue talks
with European and IMF officials.
 
 UNCLEAR ON AID AMOUNT
 Irish community minister Pat Carey said the government would
publish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15
billion euros early next week. EU sources said the financial aid
plan for Ireland would be presented at roughly the same time.
 Sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 The head of the euro zone's temporary fiscal safety net,
from which funds could come, said aid could be raised in five to
eight days if needed, notably from investors in Asia.
 ""We are confident that we can raise the necessary funds from
institutional investors, central banks and sovereign funds, in
Asia in particular,"" Klaus Regling, head of the European
Financial Stability Facility, told French daily Le Monde.
 Carey said it was impossible to say how much aid Ireland
would need until a joint mission of the European Commission,
European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, which
arrived in Dublin on Thursday, had a good look at the banks.
 Banks in Ireland have been largely shut out of market
lending due to concerns about their solvency. They are almost
entirely reliant on funding from the ECB, which reached 130
billion euros by end-October.
 Markets calmed in recent days after it became clear Ireland
was on track to receive aid, but remained jittery on Friday.
 The euro briefly pushed up above $1.3720, only to fall back
to $1.3660 in late European trading. The spreads of Irish
10-year bonds above German benchmarks drifted down towards 5.4
percentage points before pushing back up to 5.6 points, dragging
Greek, Portuguese and Spanish debt alongside.
 Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital
Economics, spoke of a ""creeping concern"" that problems on the
European periphery would spread, possibly engulfing big
economies like that of Spain.
 
 BONE OF CONTENTION
 There still remains a risk that aid talks could drag out if
Dublin and the EU are unable to agree on the conditions attached
to financial assistance.
 Ireland's rock-bottom 12.5 percent corporation tax is
shaping up as a major bone of contention, with euro zone
neighbours pressing Ireland to raise it as part of any deal and
Dublin resisting, arguing it is crucial for foreign investment.
 The government, under severe pressure from the media and an
emboldened opposition, faces a by-election next week which
threatens to cut its razor-thin parliamentary majority.
 Speaking at the opening of a new airport terminal on Friday,
embattled Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen vowed to get the
""best possible outcome"" for the Irish people in the talks.

 By Herbert Lash and Michel Rose
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - World stocks and
commodity prices fell on Friday after China moved to slow its
economy but anxious investors held out hope for an Irish
bailout that would bolster the appeal of risky assets.
 Wall Street opened lower and major European stock indexes
were off more than 1 percent on the prospect that China's order
for lenders to lock up more money with the central bank would
cut demand from the world's growth engine. For details see:
[ID:nL3E6MJ0N8]
 Concerns about Chinese inflation after the People's Bank of
China said it will raise bank reserve requirements for the
second time in two weeks, along with still unresolved debt woes
in Europe, have pressured equities in recent weeks.
 But a possible resolution to Ireland's banking and debt
crisis sparked a big equity rally on Thursday and lifted the
euro on Friday. A financial aid deal to help Ireland cope with
its battered banks will be unveiled next week, EU sources said.

 The euro  was last up 0.1 percent at $1.3649,
recovering some from a slide to a seven-week low of $1.3446
earlier in the week.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.1 percent at 78.625.
 Oil prices eased toward $81 a barrel and copper fell,
reversing earlier gains, after China's move to raise banks'
required reserves fueled worries over its demand appetite.
 ""Commodities are seeing some increased pressure on China's
news, because any attempt to tighten their policy is going to
dampen their ability to grow,"" said Michael McGervey, president
of McGervey Wealth Management in North Canton, Ohio.
 ""Since China obviously uses a lot of resources, if their
growth is tempered it will have a negative impact on demand for
commodities and materials.""
 Crude oil futures  fell 84 cents to $81.01, while the
S&P energy sector <.GSPE> lost 0.7 percent.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index fell about 0.3
percent.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 49.23 points, or 0.44 percent, at 11,132.00. The Standard

percent, at 1,190.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was

 Under a financial aid deal, Ireland's government would
publish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15
billion euros at roughly the same time.
 ""Even if the way to stability is not exactly clear, the
market seems to be getting more comfortable with the idea that
ultimately the situation will be stabilized one way or the
other,"" said Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in New York.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.02
percent at 83.48.
 German government bonds paused on Friday after selling off
heavily the previous day, while euro zone peripheral debt was
becalmed as investors waited to see if Ireland would seal a
deal to shore up its banking sector. [ID:nLDE6AI0PP]

 NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on
Friday on growing confidence that Ireland's banking and debt
crisis will be resolved, but key resistance should cap gains in
the near term.
 Hopes that Ireland was near a deal to get tens of billions
of euros from its European partners and the IMF helped push the
euro above $1.37 overnight, but momentum stalled ahead of
resistance around $1.3750. Traders said this level is likely to
hold until markets get more details on the Irish rescue plan.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2010 09:52AM ET</span>",Fishing nations wrangle in Paris over saving tuna," * Fishing nations under pressure to cut tuna quotas
 * Mediterranean EU fishing nations oppose more cuts
 
 By Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Fishing nations came under fresh
pressure on Friday to cut Atlantic bluefin tuna quotas as
negotiators got into the thick of annual wrangling over limits
at talks in Paris.
 With widespread uncertainty over how many fish are left to
be caught, the United States urged a lower quota than last year
and Japan called for a crackdown on unreported fishing which
environmental groups say is rampant.
 ""When there is uncertainty in science we believe that it is
important to err on the side of caution,"" U.S. Under Secretary
of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere Jane Lubchenco told
Reuters at the meeting of the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in Paris.
 ""We believe that it is appropriate therefore to seek lower
TACs (total allowable catches) for bluefin tuna for both sides
of the Atlantic,"" she said.
 The 48-member ICCAT, based in Madrid, meets every year to
fix annual quotas for the giant fish popular with sushi-lovers.
Talks started on Wednesday but were focused mainly on technical
issues.
 The European Union's position on quotas this year is unclear
after EU ambassadors for Mediterranean fishing nations
successfully pushed at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to
shoot down an EU proposal on measures to protect the fish.
 Prized by fishermen, Atlantic bluefin can grow to the size
of a horse and fetch as much as $100,000 in markets like Japan,
but their stocks have plunged by more than 80 percent since
1970s, according to western scientists. 
 ICCAT set an overall quota for 2010 of 13,500 tonnes of
fish, which its scientific advisors said offered at least a 60
percent probability of rebuilding stocks by 2022.
 
 PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH
 ICCAT chairman Fabio Hazin said on Friday that in light of
uncertainty over the size of stocks, due in part to illegal
fishing, members should ""apply the precautionary approach by
setting a TAC that would take these factors into full account.""
 The warm-blooded bluefin tuna can weigh up to 650 kg (1,433
lb) and is found in the north Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and
the Mediterranean, where captured fish are fattened in
enclosures.
 France, Italy and Spain catch most of the Atlantic bluefin
consumed in the world and 80 percent of the haul goes to Japan.
 Before EU members rejected its conservation plan, the
European Commission had said a limit of 6,000 tonnes was needed
for 2011 to give the fish a real chance of recovery, but it
acknowledged that would be tough for fishermen.
 ""The decisions we have to take can sometimes be very hard
for the fishing industry to accept,"" the head of the EU
delegation, Pierre Amilhat, told the ICCAT conference.
 Japan's delegation proposed that fishermen be forced to come
up with plans for respecting quotas and that that they would
have to get ICCAT's backing before they could fish.
 Conservation groups are out in force at the talks, which end
on Nov. 27. Greenpeace parked a car with a giant fake tuna on
its roof near the venue where the talks are being held with
""Save me"" written along the side of the vehicle.

 * Angola is China's biggest African trading partner
 
 LUANDA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping
began a visit to oil-rich Angola on Friday, saying he believed
relations with his country's biggest African trading partner
would be stepped up.
 On the second leg of a four-nation tour, Xi will hold talks
with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and said his visit was
aimed at improving bilateral cooperation between the two
countries, Xinhua news agency reported.
 ""I believe, thanks to the efforts from both sides, the Sino-
Angola relations will continuously march into a higher level,""
Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.
 Xi, touted as China's next president, arrived in Angola from
South Africa after a three-day visit to Africa's biggest economy
aimed at securing minerals China needs to fuel its rapid growth.

 Angola is Africa's biggest oil producer after Nigeria and
has had strong ties to China for decades.
 China has given it $4.5 billion in loans since the end of a
devastating 30-year civil war in 2002, China's ambassador to
Angola, Zhang Bolun, said on Thursday.
 Zhang said bilateral trade between China and Angola was
expected to reach $20 billion this year, a big increase on 2009.
 Angola's plans to reduce its dependence on oil could create
further scope to improve relations, with China seeing potential
in agriculture, service industries, infrastructure and renewable
energy, he added.
 Xi will visit Botswana, the world's biggest diamond
producer, as the last stop on his African tour.
 China's mineral diplomacy has been criticised for its
secrecy and bolstering governments Western states accuse of
human rights violations.
 A senior World Bank executive said Chinese companies eyeing
African mineral resources must stop making closed-door deals and
become more transparent in their investments.

 * Market pricing may be too ambitious on rates outlook
 * Hungary, Czech rates to follow in first half 2011
 * Divergence in policy favours zloty vs CEE peers
 
 By Jason Hovet
 PRAGUE, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Poland will be the first country
in the European Union's eastern wing to start to reverse two
years of record loose monetary policy, but investors have begun
to think twice about the pace of tightening currently expected.
 Above-forecast growth and a pickup in consumer activity will
also lead to tightening in Hungary and the Czech Republic by the
middle of next year, analysts say, although the pace of rate
hikes will not be quick.
 Poland is the region's only country with much inflationary
pressure and there had been signs of a swing among policymakers
needed to force through at least a small 25 basis point rise
after August's 6-4 vote against a larger 50 bps move.
 But two of the central bank's perceived policy hawks have
since signalled more doubts, and forward rates -- showing where
investors think official borrowing costs will be in future --
have reined in bets of immediate tightening. [ID:nLDE6AF0SR]
 With December traditionally a shortened working month in
which the Polish central bank does not change policy and the
euro zone economy expected to slow in the new year, the picture
by January could be less bullish.
 Analysts still expect some tightening. The question is
whether it will be as much as the at least 100 basis points
factored in by forward rate markets in the next year.
 ""The pace that is currently expected by the markets is too
much,"" Warsaw-based BNP Paribas economist Michal Dybula said.
 ""(Markets) are going to be disappointed because of external
factors. The ECB is probably unlikely to deliver anything real
soon (on euro rates); on the local side, the zloty will stay
strong and there will be no inflationary pressure on the core
readings.""
 The contradictory MPC comments, however, have left some
still in doubt over next Wednesday's decision. A Reuters poll on
Friday showed 10 of 18 analysts forecast no change in the bank's
main rate -- now at a record low of 3.5 percent -- while the
rest expected a 25 basis point rate rise. [ID:nLDE6AI0KV]
 
 REGIONAL ADVANTAGE
 Poland's stronger growth outlook means the flood of cheap
money flowing from the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative
easing has tended to favour the zloty over its peers. A rise in
local rates, after 16 months unchanged, would only reinforce
that, particularly denting appetite for Czech crowns.
 On the flip side, any pull back in the scale of tightening
expected could harm the Polish currency  and the zloty
has handed back around 3 percent of this year's gains since
peaking in April. 
 Most analysts have forecast Polish rates to rise 50-100
basis points by the end of 2011. The 6x9 forward rate agreement
(FRA) , indicating 3-month interest rates in six
months time, was quoted at 4.50 percent on Friday, down 5 basis
points from Tuesday but signalling a series of hikes.
 RBC strategist Nigel Rendell said pricing in the markets was
steep. ""We would probably be receivers in Poland just because so
much is priced into the curve already,"" he said.
 RBC took profit last week on a long zloty versus the Czech
crown trade after a selloff connected to U.S. dollar firming,
although it said the zloty would continue to firm against the
crown due to the divergence in monetary policy outlooks.
 
 FLOWS, DIVERGENCE
 The Czech central bank's new forecasts this month put the
prospects of rate tightening from a region-low 0.75 percent off
until later in the second half of 2011 year due to the expected
economic slowdown caused by government budget cuts next year. 
 Analysts expect the bank to move as early as mid-2011 --
faster than forecasts imply due to firmer manufacturing and
domestic demand. Markets are pricing a rise in six months time.
 In Hungary, where rates are at a record low 5.25 percent,
the central bank's new forecasts this month will factor in the
government's budget-saving tax and pension changes, which the
bank has said signalled a rise in domestic inflation.
Nomura economist Peter Attard Montalto said that in Hungary,
a country trying to climb out of a steep 2009 contraction and
tackle one of the highest debt loads in the region, a hike could
make for a better recovery by helping households with foreign
currency debt.
 As the government tries to rebuild market confidence after
shocking investors with a string of measures including ""crisis
taxes"" on banks and other industries and rolling back pension
reforms, higher rates could help strengthen the forint currency.
 The forint is 16 percent weaker to the euro since a record
high in mid-2008 and 30 percent down against the Swiss franc,
which has hammered mortgage holders since a majority of housing
loans are taken out in the Swiss currency.
 ""They can normalise policy even under a weak growth outlook
pretty soon in the first quarter next year,"" Montalto said.

pressure and there had been signs of a swing among policymakers
needed to force through at least a small 25 basis point rise
after August's 6-4 vote against a larger 50 bps move.
 But two of the central bank's perceived policy hawks have
since signalled more doubts, and forward rates -- showing where
investors think official borrowing costs will be in future --
have reined in bets of immediate tightening.
 With December traditionally a shortened working month in
which the Polish central bank does not change policy and the
euro zone economy expected to slow in the new year, the picture
by January could be less bullish.
 Analysts still expect some tightening. The question is
whether it will be as much as the at least 100 basis points
factored in by forward rate markets in the next year.
 ""The pace that is currently expected by the markets is too
much,"" Warsaw-based BNP Paribas economist Michal Dybula said.
 ""(Markets) are going to be disappointed because of external
factors. The ECB is probably unlikely to deliver anything real
soon (on euro rates); on the local side, the zloty will stay
strong and there will be no inflationary pressure on the core
readings.""
 The contradictory MPC comments, however, have left some
still in doubt over next Wednesday's decision. A Reuters poll on
Friday showed 10 of 18 analysts forecast no change in the bank's
main rate -- now at a record low of 3.5 percent -- while the
rest expected a 25 basis point rate rise.
 
 REGIONAL ADVANTAGE
 Poland's stronger growth outlook means the flood of cheap
money flowing from the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative
easing has tended to favour the zloty over its peers. A rise in
local rates, after 16 months unchanged, would only reinforce
that, particularly denting appetite for Czech crowns.
 On the flip side, any pull back in the scale of tightening
expected could harm the Polish currency and the zloty has handed
back around 3 percent of this year's gains since peaking in
April. 
 Most analysts have forecast Polish rates to rise 50-100
basis points by the end of 2011. The 6x9 forward rate agreement
(FRA), indicating 3-month interest rates in six months time, was
quoted at 4.50 percent on Friday, down 5 basis points from
Tuesday but signalling a series of hikes.
 RBC strategist Nigel Rendell said pricing in the markets was
steep. ""We would probably be receivers in Poland just because so
much is priced into the curve already,"" he said.
 RBC took profit last week on a long zloty versus the Czech
crown trade after a selloff connected to U.S. dollar firming,
although it said the zloty would continue to firm against the
crown due to the divergence in monetary policy outlooks.
 
 FLOWS, DIVERGENCE
 The Czech central bank's new forecasts this month put the
prospects of rate tightening from a region-low 0.75 percent off
until later in the second half of 2011 year due to the expected
economic slowdown caused by government budget cuts next year. 
 Analysts expect the bank to move as early as mid-2011 --
faster than forecasts imply due to firmer manufacturing and
domestic demand. Markets are pricing a rise in six months time.
 In Hungary, where rates are at a record low 5.25 percent,
the central bank's new forecasts this month will factor in the
government's budget-saving tax and pension changes, which the
bank has said signalled a rise in domestic inflation.
Nomura economist Peter Attard Montalto said that in Hungary,
a country trying to climb out of a steep 2009 contraction and
tackle one of the highest debt loads in the region, a hike could
make for a better recovery by helping households with foreign
currency debt.
 As the government tries to rebuild market confidence after
shocking investors with a string of measures including ""crisis
taxes"" on banks and other industries and rolling back pension
reforms, higher rates could help strengthen the forint currency.
 The forint is 16 percent weaker to the euro since a record
high in mid-2008 and 30 percent down against the Swiss franc,
which has hammered mortgage holders since a majority of housing
loans are taken out in the Swiss currency.
 ""They can normalise policy even under a weak growth outlook
pretty soon in the first quarter next year,"" Montalto said.

 LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Three issues are putting
investors on edge as they head into a new week -- debt in tiny
Ireland, tightening in giant China and the ever-moving saga of
whether U.S. policy stimulus will work.
 With end-of-year book balancing also looming, it is little
wonder that these uncertainties have combined to knock some of
the stuffing out of what was a solid risk rally.
 How they are resolved -- and Ireland, at least, may be close
to denouement -- will dictate the coming week's progress on
markets and, possibly, the year as a whole.
 ""Markets have been in a phase of taking profits after a good
run,"" said Philip Poole, head of global strategy at HSBC Global
Asset Management. ""Since August, a lot of good news got into the
prices ... What we are seeing subsequent to that is reflection
over the residual concerns which are still there, such as China
and the euro zone.
 Since hitting a 26-month high on November 4, the MSCI
all-country world stock index has fallen as much as 4.8 percent,
although it was showing signs of recovering on Thursday and
Friday.
 The impact on emerging market stocks -- this year's star
performer -- has been both greater and faster. The MSCI EM
benchmark lost more than 5 percent between November 9 and
November 17 before recovering slightly.
 Previously high-performing commodities have fallen as much
as 8 percent over the period, again before firming a bit.
 Ireland, despite its minuscule role in the global economy,
has been one of the factors behind the swing in sentiment,
although how much on a global scale remains uncertain.
 For example the VIX index, a gauge of future volatility
expectations for U.S. stocks, remains at a relatively low level
and there is minimal correlation been peripheral debt spreads
and moves between the euro and dollar.
 Heading into the new week, investors were widely expecting a
bailout for Ireland from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund but were uncertain about when it would be and what
form it would take.
 The issue is not about Ireland per se. Investors fear a
spread of the crisis to other, larger indebted euro zone
economies.
 ""I don't think it's big enough to derail global recovery in
the same way the subprime crisis did,"" said State Street Global
Advisors Chief Economist Christopher Probyn. ""But it would
create a whole different level of angst if it spreads to Spain.""
 HOT CHINA, COOL AMERICA
 Perhaps of at least equal importance is what is happening in
China, which has been signalling it will take more aggressive
steps to tame its inflation, implying slower growth.
 Following on from this, China raised banks' reserve
requirements on Friday for the second time in two weeks.
 The danger of tightening is if it over-slows the Chinese
economy and with it the export-oriented economies surrounding
it, putting at risk the huge flows of investment money that have
gone into Asia this year.
 Not incidentally, Chinese growth has also been behind a lot
of developed market stock gains because of its impact on the
earnings of major global companies.
 Bob Parker, senior adviser to Credit Suisse's asset
management arm, says if China slows too much it would hit the
region first, then spill over globally and finally end up
hurting developed market earnings ""given that China is seen as a
growth driver in corporates"".
 Like others, he believes China can control inflation without
too much damage to growth, the so-called soft landing, but
recent moves in financial markets have shown what's at risk.
 The Shanghai Composite has lost around 7 percent since
November 11 and MSCI's Asian stocks ex Japan index is back to
where it was a month ago.
 Part of the inflation pressure on China, meanwhile, comes
from the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to start buying assets
in a new quantitative easing programme. Over the long run, that
is expected to weaken the dollar, to which China's yuan is
linked.
 But the third issue for investors is that the QE decision
has not yet had the market impact that might have been expected.
The dollar, for example, is stronger than it was when QE was
announced and U.S. Treasury yields are higher.
 This may be the result of asset rebalancing after a long
period of pricing in QE. If it is not, then it raises the
question of what might be needed next to boost the U.S. economy.
 GROWTH AHEAD?
 All this is occurring against a backdrop of fairly positive
economic data and no sign of the worldwide recession returning.
 In its twice-yearly report on Thursday, the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast
world growth would slow next year, but to 4.2 percent from 4.6
percent this year. It expected a return to 4.6 percent in 2012.
 So assuming no collapse in Ireland, a controlled slowdown in
China and some traction for the U.S. economy, investors could
therefore be looking at a good climate for risk assets.
 In the coming week, they will get some things to chew on
from a Portuguese budget vote on Friday, flash PMI manufacturing
a services data in Europe, a U.S. Treasury auction and minutes
from the Federal Reserve's last meeting.

 By Michel Rose
 London, Nov 19 (Reuters) - World stocks inched lower and
commodities fell on Friday as China raised banks' reserve
requirements, but a tense market remained focused on hopes of an
Irish bailout and its broader implications for euro zone debt.
 European shares fell, with mining stocks sagging on
expectations the order for Chinese lenders to lock up more money
with the central bank would cut demand from the world's growth
engine, while European banks were down on euro zone worries.
 The euro recouped losses against the dollar, rising 0.6
percent to move further away from a seven-week low hit earlier
this week as traders anticipated an Irish rescue deal emerging
from a visit to Dublin by an EU-IMF mission to assess the health
of the country's banks.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index fell around 0.1 percent
and Wall Street looked set for a weaker start.
 China said it would raise banks' reserve requirements by 50
basis points, effective Nov. 29 and its second hike in two
weeks.
 The country is one of the world's largest metals and
commodity consumers, and stocks such as BHP Billiton and Rio
Tinto were under pressure, losing between 1.75 percent and 2
percent, while South African shares fell 0.5 percent.
 Emerging markets shrugged off Chinese demand concerns,
however, rising about 0.2 percent.
 Speculation had grown since an official Chinese newspaper
suggested that Friday could be a convenient time to raise rates
before banks settle accumulated interest on the 20th day of the
month, and the move had been broadly priced in already.
 ""China has stepped up the pace of tightening but the
reaction has been fairly muted because the market was expecting
a move,"" said Manik Narain, analyst at UBS in London.
 ""No one is really bearish because of China. People are
defensive because of the euro zone issues and Ireland, that's
the dominant theme at the moment.""
 Ireland is in discussions over an aid package potentially
worth tens of billions of euros from the European Union, but
with Dublin not yet at the point of requesting a loan, talks
were expected to run into next week.
 At 1215 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.85 percent at 1,098.25 points, after rising
1.4 percent on Thursday.
 For the week, the European benchmark is set to post a small
decline but is up more than 70 percent from its lifetime low of
March 2009, with several major economies having emerged from
recession, helped by government and central bank stimulus.
 Optimism on a deal for Ireland helped the euro to edge up on
Friday, with the dollar falling, boosting metals prices.
 ""I think markets will react more if the IMF comes away from
Ireland empty-handed. That could cause a ripple effect on other
(euro zone) credits but people are not expecting an
announcement before the weekend,"" UBS's Narain added.
 
 U.S. VS CHINA
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended the U.S.
central bank's controversial bond-buying programme, saying a
vigorous U.S. recovery is central to global economic health.
 Large emerging powers like China are in conflict with the
United States, with each seen by the other as artificially
weakening its currency to boost exports.
 Bernanke kept up the battle on Friday, saying emerging
countries which kept down their currencies were creating an
additional burden.
 The Fed's second round of monetary stimulus has also raised
concerns about overheating in fast-growing emerging countries,
which fear the emergence of asset bubbles and inflation.
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao had emphasized that his
government was preparing steps to tame price rises, with
inflation running at a 25-month high.
 Raising interest rates or taking measures to cap domestic
prices could constrain commodity demand or drain liquidity from
markets, but analysts said such a move was necessary for
sustainable long-term growth.
 ""China is not going to slam on its brakes, it's
progressively tightening to limit inflation pressures and I
don't think it will have a significant impact on world growth,
though it could impact markets in the short term as China is
such a big consumer of commodities,"" said Philip Poole, head of
global and macro strategy at HSBC Asset Management.
 Foodstuffs are likely to be hardest hit, highlighting
Beijing's focus on consumer inflation.
 Corn, cotton and zinc -- favoured by speculators in recent
months -- saw some of the biggest falls with U.S. cotton down
around 3 percent and 1 percent-plus losses in corn and zinc.

 * Euro gains, bond spreads narrow as markets bet on rescue
 * Experts worry Irish rescue won't stem contagion
 * Irish minister says aid requirement for banks unclear
 
 By Jan Strupczewski and Padraic Halpin
 BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A financial aid plan to
help Ireland cope with its battered banks will be unveiled next
week, EU sources said on Friday, but experts warned a rescue may
not be enough to prevent contagion in the single currency bloc.
 The euro rose and the risk premium investors demand to buy
Irish and other peripheral euro zone debt instead of benchmark
German bonds narrowed in a sign of optimism that an aid deal for
Dublin will be sealed soon.
 But a poll of participants at a high-level banking congress
in Frankfurt showed that nearly three quarters believed the
crisis that has shaken the euro zone for a full year would rage
on even after an Irish rescue and ensnare other financially weak
countries such as Portugal.
 ""As long as the fundamentals don't improve, the pressure
will continue on other countries too,"" Daniel Gros, who heads
the Centre of European Policy Studies, told Reuters Insider TV
at the congress. ""The problem is that no problems are currently
being solved. Many believe that the euro zone is just moving
from one crisis to the next.""
 Ireland's central bank chief has acknowledged that the
country needs a loan running into the tens of billions of euros
to shore up an extremely fragile banking sector that has grown
dependent on ECB funds.
 Reflecting concerns among other euro zone periphery
countries that Ireland's financial troubles could spread,
Greece's finance minister pressed Dublin to move fast.
 ""We are now at a point where decisions have to be taken,""
George Papaconstantinou told the banking congress in Frankfurt.
""Time is of the essence.""
 
 UNCLEAR ON AID AMOUNT
 Irish community minister Pat Carey said the government would
publish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15
billion euros early next week. EU sources said the financial aid
plan for Ireland would be presented at roughly the same time.
 ""They would be close in time,"" one EU source with insight
into the process said.
 Sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 The head of the euro zone's temporary fiscal safety net,
from which funds could come, said aid could be raised in five to
eight days if needed, notably from investors in Asia.
 ""We are confident that we can raise the necessary funds from
institutional investors, central banks and sovereign funds, in
Asia in particular,"" Klaus Regling, chief executive of the
European Financial Stability Facility, told French daily Le
Monde.
 Carey said it was impossible to say how much aid Ireland
would need until a joint mission of the European Commission,
European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, which
arrived in Dublin on Thursday, had gotten to grips with the
state of the banks.
 Banks in Ireland have been largely shut out of market
lending due to concerns about their solvency. They are almost
entirely reliant on funding from the ECB, which reached 130
billion euros by end-October, plus an extra 35 billion euros
from the Irish central bank.
 Allied Irish, the hardest hit listed Irish bank, is expected
to give a trading update later on Friday which will be
scrutinised for signs of any rise in retail deposit withdrawals.
 Dublin's borrowing costs have rocketed since late October as
concerns about the banks' swelling liabilities and a German-led
drive to create a system for restructuring stricken euro zone
state debts unsettled investors.
 Markets have settled after it became clear Ireland was open
to financial aid. On Friday, the euro pushed up to $1.3720 and
the risk premium on Irish 10-year bonds edged down to 5.45
percentage points over German benchmark Bunds.
 The bond spreads of other financially weak euro countries
like Greece and Portugal also fell.
 
 BONE OF CONTENTION
 There remains a risk that aid talks could drag out if Dublin
and the EU are unable to agree on the conditions attached to
financial assistance.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan has insisted the IMF
and EU will not have any input into Ireland's budgetary
measures, even though EU rules stipulate that assistance
programmes can only be granted to governments that sign a strict
fiscal conditionality agreement.
 Ireland's rock-bottom 12.5 percent corporation tax is
shaping up as a major bone of contention, with euro zone
neighbours pressing Ireland to raise it as part of any deal and
Dublin resisting, arguing it is crucial for foreign investment.
 Irish Deputy Prime Minister Mary Coughlan told parliament
on Thursday that the corporate tax rate, which countries like
Britain and Germany have long viewed as a form of unfair
competition, was ""non-negotiable"".
 The government, under severe pressure from the media and an
opposition which smells blood, faces a by-election next week
which threatens to cut its already razor-thin parliamentary
majority.
 Speaking at the airport on Friday, embattled Irish Prime
Minister Brian Cowen vowed to get the ""best possible outcome""
for the Irish people in the talks.

 By Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Nov 19 (Reuters) - China ordered lenders on
Friday to lock up more of their money at the central bank for
the second time in two weeks, stepping up its battle to pull
excess cash out of the economy before inflation has a chance
to take off.	
 The People's Bank of China said that it would increase
banks' required reserves by 50 basis points, its fifth such
announcement this year. Including an earlier temporary
increase, the move takes required reserve ratios (RRR) to 18.5
percent for big banks, a record high.	
 The tightening step was intended ""to strengthen liquidity
management and appropriately control money and credit
issuance"", the central bank said in a statement on its website
(www.pbc.gov.cn).	
 It was not a surprise and, in fact, could be something of
a relief for investors who had expected worse. 
 ""It suggests China is intent to manage price pressures
through withdrawing liquidity from the system,"" said Dongming
Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. ""However, it
also suggests that China is being cautious about aggressive
monetary tightening.""	
 
 The central bank made the announcement after domestic
markets had closed for the weekend. 
 But European stocks extended their losses after the news.
Big miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton were
both down more than 2 percent on worries that tighter monetary
policy would reduce China's appetite for commodities.
[ID:nLDE6AI11T]	
 Oil futures weakened and the Australian dollar ,
which is sensitive to the strength of Chinese demand, fell
against the U.S. dollar. [ID:nTOE6AI03E] [ID:nLDE6AI0TA] 
 China's ruling Communist Party is acutely sensitive to
inflation as a political issue. Rising prices added to
discontent in the buildup to widespread anti-government
protests in 1989.	
 Inflation now is mild by comparison and though plenty of
consumers have been grumbling about higher food prices, the
strains have not been enough to unleash unrest.	
 
 MORE TIGHTENING AHEAD 
 Chinese stock markets have tumbled nearly 10 percent over
the past six trading days on concerns that the government
would ratchet up its monetary policy tightening after
inflation sped to a 25-month high in October above 4 percent.	
 Such concerns were crystallised when China's cabinet vowed
on Wednesday to take ""forceful"" measures, including price
controls if necessary, to rein in inflation. [ID:nSGE6AH00A]	
 ""This RRR hike will not reduce the chance of raising
interest rates, and I expect the central bank will raise
benchmark rates one more time within the year,"" said Lu
Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai. 
 China raised interest rates on Oct 19 -- the first time in
nearly three years -- and most analysts still expect 2-4 more
increases by the end of next year.	
 Increasing reserve requirements is a more direct approach
to absorbing the excess liquidity that has been spurring
Chinese inflation.	
 The 50 basis point increase, which takes effect on Nov.
29, should lock up about 350 billion yuan ($52.7 billion) that
banks could otherwise lend.	
 Along with playing a key role in the fight against
inflation, policy tightening also signals the government's
confidence that the world's second-largest economy is on solid
ground, even as the U.S. and European recoveries remain fragile.	
 In addition to increasing required reserves and interest
rates, China has also issued strict orders to banks to curtail
their lending.	
 
 WEIGHING ON COMMODITIES 
 ""China tightening reserve requirements is just part of the
arsenal that they will use and we would expect to see more of
these measures coming through,"" said Michael Lewis, global
head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank.	
 ""Our sense is that energy and industrial metals are most
exposed to this sort of Chinese action because obviously it is
going to raise people's concerns about the growth outlook,"" he
added.	
 The move by China's central bank could also cause a
funding squeeze for some firms as banks without excess
reserves are forced to call in loans, forcing companies to
seek alternate funding sources and operate with less working
capital.	
 Chinese policy makers have blamed monetary easing in the
United States for propelling cash towards emerging markets,
fuelling commodity price rises and inflation risks.	
 But most of the excess cash that lies at the root of
inflation in China has domestic origins. To power the economy
through the global financial crisis, state-owned banks
unleashed an unprecedented credit surge and the government has
been slow to mop up the money still cascading over the economy.	
 Food prices have driven Chinese inflation. Accounting for
about a third of the consumer price index, food costs rose
10.1 percent in the year to October, while non-food inflation
crept up just 1.6 percent.	
 Overall consumer price inflation reached 4.4 percent in
October from a year earlier and many analysts expect that the
November figure could breach 5 percent. 
 The government's target was to keep inflation at a
full-year average of 3 percent, but that is increasingly
looking in doubt.

 LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Friday,
recouping earlier losses on expectations that Ireland was near a
deal to get tens of billions of euros from its European partners
and the IMF for its shattered banks.
 The euro hit the day's high versus the dollar after China
tightened monetary policy on Friday by raising banks' reserve
requirements [ID:nL3E6MJ0N8], as a fall in many major currencies
on the initial news was countered by a wave of buying.
 Still, some higher-risk currencies including the Australian
dollar  traded lower on the day, as China's tightening
moves were seen as detrimental to the Aussie, which tends to
rise on signs that Beijing's economy is growing.
 Investors awaited an announcement on debt assistance to
Ireland. Dublin said discussions would run into next week, and
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told parliament it was not yet at
the point of requesting a loan. [ID:nLDE6AH0HV]
 Analysts said a bailout package would boost the euro.
 ""There is a degree of calm on anticipation of a near-term
resolution for the Irish banks, which has fed renewed
risk-taking and a relief rally for the euro, which could
potentially rise to $1.40,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 By 1205 GMT, the euro  rose 0.5 percent on the day to
a session high around $1.3730. It has recovered from a slide to
a seven-week low of $1.3446 earlier in the week and is poised to
end the week slightly higher against the dollar.
 Support was seen at the 55-day moving average at $1.3607 on
Friday, traders said. Offers were seen around $1.3700 and above.
 Losses versus the euro helped to push the dollar index
<.DXY> down 0.5 percent on the day.

 BERNANKE DEFENDS QE
 Analysts said money market rates have remained higher since
Greece's debt problems came to a head earlier this year,
suggesting investors have priced in the possibility of more
sovereign debt crises and minimising the possibility of another
hefty sell-off in the euro.
 ""We're not seeing the vicious, speculative selling of the
euro as we did during Greece's problems,"" said Stephen Gallo,
head of markets analysis at Schneider FX.
 ""You're also not seeing real money moving out of their
longer-term euro long positions,"" he said, adding that selling
in the euro under $1.3500 had offered a good chance for
long-term investors to pick up euro assets, albeit cautiously.
 Still, some analysts said the euro could be vulnerable if an
aid package for Ireland did not materialise quickly.

 By Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Nov 19 (Reuters) - China ordered lenders on
Friday to lock up more of their money with the central bank
for the second time in two weeks, stepping up its battle to
pull excess cash out of the economy before inflation has a
chance to take off.	
 The People's Bank of China said that it would increase
banks' required reserves by 50 basis points, its fifth such
announcement this year. Including a temporary increase, the
move takes required reserve ratios (RRR) to 18.5 percent for
big banks, a record high.	
 The increase was intended ""to strengthen liquidity
management and appropriately control money and credit
issuance"", the central bank said in a statement on its website
(www.pbc.gov.cn).	
 The move was not a surprise and, in fact, could be
something of a relief for investors who had expected worse.	
 ""It suggests China is intent to manage price pressures
through withdrawing liquidity from the system,"" said Dongming
Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. ""However, it
also suggests that China is being cautious about aggressive
monetary tightening.""	
 The central bank made the announcement after domestic
markets had closed for the weekend. The Australian dollar
, which is sensitive to the strength of Chinese
demand, fell briefly against the U.S. dollar.	
 Chinese stock markets have tumbled nearly 10 percent over
the past six trading days on concerns that the government
would ratchet up its monetary policy tightening after
inflation sped to a 25-month high in October.	
 Such concerns were crystallised when China's cabinet vowed
on Wednesday to take ""forceful"" measures, including price
controls if necessary, to rein in inflation. [ID:nSGE6AH00A]	
 ""This RRR hike will not reduce the chance of raising
interest rates, and I expect the central bank will raise
benchmark rates one more time within the year,"" said Lu
Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai.	
 
 LOCKING UP CASH 
 China raised interest rates on Oct 19 -- the first time in
nearly three years -- and most analysts still expect 2-4 more
increases by the end of next year. 
 Increasing reserve requirements is a more direct approach
to absorbing the excess liquidity that has been spurring
Chinese inflation.	
 The 50 basis point RRR increase, which takes effect on
Nov. 29, should lock up about 350 billion yuan that banks
could otherwise lend.	
 Along with playing a key role in the fight against
inflation, policy tightening also signals the government's
confidence that the world's second-largest economy is on solid
ground, even as the United States and European recoveries
remain fragile.	
 In addition to increasing required reserves and interest
rates, China has also issued strict orders to banks to curtail
their lending. 
 ""China tightening reserve requirements is just part of the
arsenal that they will use and we would expect to see more of
these measures coming through,"" said Michael Lewis, global
head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank in London.	
 ""Our sense is that energy and industrial metals are most
exposed to this sort of Chinese action because obviously it is
going to raise people's concerns about the growth outlook,"" he
added. 
 Chinese policy makers have blamed monetary easing in the
United States for propelling cash towards emerging markets,
fuelling commodity price rises and inflation risks.	
 But most of the excess cash that lies at the root of
inflation in China has domestic origins. To power the economy
through the global financial crisis, Beijing called on banks
to lend more aggressively.	
 Banks responded by unleashing an unprecedented credit
surge and the government has been slow to mop up the money
still cascading over the economy.	
 Food prices have driven Chinese inflation. Accounting for
about a third of the consumer price index, food costs rose
10.1 percent in the year to October, while non-food inflation
crept up just 1.6 percent.	
 Overall consumer price inflation reached 4.4 percent in
October from a year earlier and many analysts expect that the 
November figure could breach 5 percent. The government's
target was to keep inflation at a full-year average of 3
percent, but that is increasingly looking in doubt.

International Monetary Fund aid plan for Ireland is likely to
come next week, together with, or very shortly after the release
of Dublin's 4-year austerity scheme, EU sources said on Friday.
 ""They would be close in time,"" one EU source with insight
into the process said.
 Irish community minister Pat Carey said on Friday the
government's four-year fiscal plan for making 15 billion euros
in savings from 2011 to 2014 will be published early next week.
 Dublin is discussing an aid package potentially worth tens
of billions of euros from European partners and the IMF, mainly
to support its ailing banking sector.
 Another senior euro zone source said it was a good
assumption the EU/IMF programme for Ireland would come at the
same time or very soon after Dublin publishes its 4-year plan.
 Banks in Ireland have been largely shut out of market
lending due to concerns about their solvency. They are almost
entirely reliant on funding from the ECB, which reached 130
billion euros by end-October, plus an extra 35 billion euros
from the Irish central bank.
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.

 PARIS, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Funds to aid Ireland could be
raised in five to eight days if needed, notably from investors
in Asia, the head of the euro zone's temporary fiscal safety net
said in a newspaper interview published on Friday.
 Klaus Regling, chief executive of the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), told French afternoon daily Le Monde
Ireland's problem was its banking sector and not public
finances, where its needs are covered until mid-2011.
 A team from the European Commission, European Central Bank
and International Monetary Fund that arrived in Dublin on
Thursday will need around two weeks to identify financing needs
and structural reforms, Regling said, according to Le Monde.
 Asked if the EFSF, created after Greece's debt crisis rocked
the euro zone earlier this year, could raise sufficient funds if
needed, Regling highlighted Asian investor appetite.
 ""We are confident that we can raise the necessary funds from
institutional investors, central banks and sovereign funds, in
Asia in particular,"" he said.
 Regling said he recently went to China to talk to potential
investors, adding: ""The Asians are very positive in general"".
 He said that after debt market turmoil in Europe in April
and May, Asian investors had returned to European assets faster
than Americans. ""That's because some people on Wall Street were
asking whether the euro would still exist five years on. That's
not the state of mind you find in Asia.""
 Asked if Ireland's problems risked spilling over to other
euro zone countries seen as weak links, Regling said: ""The
Portuguese situation is very different to that of Ireland. The
banking sector there is very solid.""

 * Analysts see Telenor remaining in India despite risks
 * Telenor shares off 1.5 percent, underperform telco peers

(Adds quotes, analysts, context)
 By Wojciech Moskwa and Mikael Holter
 OSLO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Norway's Telenor confirmed its
commitment to India on Friday, even as a scandal over the
awarding of licences roiled India's government and telecoms
sector and armed critics of its presence on the subcontinent.
 ""We are in India to compete and do business. We're
definitely part of the mobile game in India,"" Telenor spokesman
Esben Tuman said.
 Shares in Telenor and other operators in India were lower on
Friday as the scandal deepened over the allocation of telecoms
spectrum, which a government audit said may have cost India $31
billion and led to the weekend sacking of Telecoms Minister
Andimuthu Raja.
 A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the
telecoms regulator had recommended cancelling 38 licences,
including eight held by Telenor's Indian operations, because the
operators did not meet rollout obligations.
 Telenor shares were down 1.5 percent at 92.2 crowns at 0951
GMT, while the STOXX 600 European telecoms index was down 0.35
percent.
 Tuman said Telenor had not received any official
communications regarding any recommendation to cancel the
licences held by its joint venture with Unitech.
 ""We have launched operations in 13 circles, and the latest
figures show we have 13.5 million customers in India, and we are
adding huge (subscriber) numbers each month,"" Tuman said.
 Analysts have long been cool on Telenor's entry into India,
a market of fast growth but wafer-thin margins, where few
believe the Norwegian company can quickly turn a profit.
 Analysts expect Telenor, which has operations throughout
emerging Asia, eastern Europe as well as the Nordics, to remain
in India for now, as the licences row plays out.
 ""They're not just going to give up and go home,"" said John
Davies, an analyst at ING, adding that Telenor could be a buyer
or a seller in Indian mobile consolidation, which is expected in
a year or two.
 Davies said: ""People were already of the view that it's a
difficult market ...(in part) because they're in the hands of
government rather than a well understood and objective process.
Basically, you're either optimistic on India or you're not.""
 Telenor has praised its strong market development in India
over the third quarter but said it would post an EBITDA loss of
4.5 billion crowns ($775 million) for its India operations in
2010.
 Analysts said many investors would prefer the Norwegian
company simply to pull out of India as soon as possible.
 ""There is no doubt about that in the financial community.
That view (that Telenor should exit India) is the consensus,""
said DnB NOR Markets analyst Frank Maaoe.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2010 06:20AM ET</span>","FACTBOX-Trade, energy ties between China and Russia"," Nov 22 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao heads to
Russia on Monday as he seeks to nail down a pricing agreement
for gas supplies to China and expand trade cooperation..
 Wen's visit underscores the increasingly close relationship
between two of the world's biggest emerging economies -- a
marked shift from the decades of distrust because of disputes
over Communist ideology.
 Wen will also go to Tajikistan for a meeting of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) -- a Central Asian
regional group comprising Russia, China and four ex-Soviet
Central Asian states.
 Here are some facts about energy and trade ties between
Russia and China:
 ENERGY
 -- Russia wants to diversify more of its energy exports
away from Europe, its traditional market, and into fast-growing
China, while China, the world's largest oil consumer, wants to
boost its energy security by looking for new sources of fuel.
 -- Russia has begun test-pumping about 600,000 tonnes of
oil along a new East Siberian-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline
that is set to start bringing 300,000 barrels per day to China
in January next year.
 -- China's oil imports from Russia could double if the
pipeline is used to capacity and the volume now exported by
rail and sea continues.
 -- Russia has been eager for more Chinese cash to fuel
growth. China agreed in October to lend Russia $6 billion for
the development of coal deposits. It also agreed in 2009 to
lend $10 billion to Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and
another $15 billion to state-controlled oil giant Rosneft in
exchange for the 300,000 bpd of Russian oil to be transported
through the pipeline over 20 years..
 -- China and Russia in September laid a cornerstone of a 13
million-tonne/year (260,000 bpd) joint refinery in Tianjin city
for which Russia pledged to supply 70 percent of crude oil
needs.
 -- Russia, which has built a nuclear reactor in China, has
agreed to expand nuclear power cooperation in seven areas with
China, including building floating nuclear power plants,
exploring uranium mines, eliminating old plants and developing
markets abroad.
-- But their close energy ties have been clouded by a
dispute about pricing for gas, which have dragged on for years,
and that Chinese officials say they hope to resolve during
Wen's visit.
 -- Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, said in 2006 it would
build two major pipelines to China but the projects have been
delayed because of wrangling over pricing.
 ECONOMIC TIES AND BILATERAL TRADE
 -- Russia has been pushing for a greater role for the
rouble in global financial markets and, eventually, as some
form of reserve currency. China is also seeking a greater
international role for its still tightly controlled yuan.
 -- Russia will start trading the yuan against the rouble
next month as they seek to simplify settlements for energy
sales by avoiding use of the U.S. dollar..
 -- Russia is China's 13th-largest trade partner, ranking
behind the Netherlands and Singapore, even though two-way trade
rose 43.4 percent to $45.1 billion in the first 10 months of
this year.
 -- The Kremlin expects the volume this year to return to
the $55.9 billion recorded in 2008, before the economic crisis.
 -- China is Russia's second-largest trading partner after
the European Union. Bilateral trade with China rose to $41.8
billion in the first nine months of 2010 compared with $26.7
billion a year ago, according to the Russian Federal Customs
Service data.
 -- But China accounts for just 9.5 percent of Russia's
foreign trade, while the European Union claims 49.5 percent.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Friday,
recouping earlier losses on expectations that Ireland was near a
deal to get tens of billions of euros from its European partners
and the IMF for its shattered banks.
 The euro may also have been helped after China tightened
monetary policy on Friday by raising banks' reserve requirements
, as traders has already been positioning for a possible change
in Chinese policy, a trader said.
 China's move put pressure on the Australian dollar and
commodity prices. The Aussie was down 0.2 percent at $0.9870.
 Dublin said discussions over Ireland's situation would run
into next week, and Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told
parliament it was not yet at the point of requesting a loan.
 ""There is a degree of calm on anticipation of a near-term
resolution for the Irish banks, which has fed renewed
risk-taking and a relief rally for the euro, which could
potentially rise to $1.40,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 By 1020 GMT, the euro was up 0.4 percent on the day at
$1.3704. It had fallen to a seven-week low of $1.3446 on trading
platform EBS on Tuesday.
 Support was seen at the 55-day moving average at $1.3607 on
Friday, traders said. Offers were seen around $1.3700 and above.
 Options with strike at $1.3600 and $1.3700 were set to
expire on Friday, which may also hem the pair in, traders said.
 Against the yen, the euro was flat at 114.00 yen, but up
from the week's low of 112.27 yen on Tuesday.
 Some said the euro could be vulnerable if an aid package for
Ireland did not materialise quickly.
 ""If people are expecting something early next week, we could
see a wobble in the euro,"" said Daragh Maher, deputy head of FX
strategy at Credit Agricole CIB, although he still sees the euro
hovering around $1.42 by year-end.
 
 BERNANKE
 With little data scheduled, markets were waiting for
comments from European Central Bank officials including ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet and ECB Governing Council member
and Bundesbank President Axel Weber at a conference.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hit back at
critics of the U.S. central bank's latest bond-buying programme
and issued a thinly veiled attack on China's policy of keeping
its currency depressed, in prepared remarks for delivery at the
conference.
 The remarks helped push down U.S. Treasury yields, which in
turn discouraged players from buying dollars, traders said.
 The dollar eased 0.4 percent to 83.18 yen, coming off a
six-week high of 83.79 yen marked on Thursday, helped by upbeat
U.S. economic data showing factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic
region accelerated in November, and by a closely watched gauge
of jobless benefits falling to a two-year low.
 One-month dollar/yen implied volatility fell to a six-month
low around 9.75, according to Reuters data, from around 11.8
percent earlier in the week, as downside risks for the pair
eased, traders said.
 Bernanke also dismissed claims of QE debasing the dollar,
saying: ""The best way to continue to deliver the strong economic
fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar, as well as
to support the global recovery, is through policies that lead to
a resumption of robust growth in a context of price stability in
the United States.""

 DUBLIN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Ireland came under renewed
pressure from euro zone partners on Friday to accept quick
support for its banks, but Dublin said it remained unclear for
now how much its battered financial institutions required.
 A day after Ireland's central bank chief acknowledged the

edged up on expectations of an aid deal and Irish bond spreads
narrowed.
 Reflecting concerns among other euro zone periphery

could sow contagion in the 16-nation single currency bloc,
Greece's finance minister pressed Dublin to move fast.
 ""We are now at a point where decisions have to be taken,""
George Papaconstantinou told a European banking congress in
Frankfurt. ""Time is of the essence.""
 Irish community minister Pat Carey said the government would
publish the details of its four-year fiscal plan to save 15
billion euros early next week, before a Nov. 25 by-election
which threatens to cut the already razor-thin parliamentary
majority of unpopular Prime Minister Brian Cowen.
 But Carey said it was impossible to say how much aid Ireland

 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of

 EURO GAINS, SPREADS NARROW
 Dublin's borrowing costs have rocketed since late October as
concerns about the banks' swelling liabilities and a German-led
drive to create a system for restructuring stricken euro zone
state debts unsettled investors.
 Markets settled down in recent days after it became clear
Ireland was open to financial aid. On Friday, the euro pushed up
to $1.37 and the risk premium on Irish 10-year bonds edged down
to 5.5 percentage points over German benchmark Bunds.
 The bond spreads of other financially weak euro countries
like Greece and Portugal also fell.
 ""There is a degree of calm on anticipation of a near-term
resolution for the Irish banks, which has fed to renewed
risk-taking and a relief rally for the euro which could
potentially rise to $1.40,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist

 Still, aid talks could drag out if Dublin and the EU are
unable to agree on the conditions attached to financial
assistance that is expected to come from a 60 billion euro fund
set up by the 27-nation bloc in May following a joint EU/IMF
rescue for Greece.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan has insisted the IMF
and EU will not have any input into Ireland's budgetary
measures, even though EU rules stipulate that assistance
programmes can only be granted to governments that sign a strict
fiscal conditionality agreement.
 Ireland's rock-bottom 12.5 percent corporation tax is
shaping up as a major bone of contention, with euro zone
neighbours pressing Ireland to raise it as part of any deal and
Dublin resisting, arguing it is crucial for foreign investment.
 Irish Deputy Prime Minister Mary Coughlan told parliament
on Thursday that the corporate tax rate, which countries like
Britain and Germany have long viewed as a form of unfair
competition, was ""non-negotiable"".
 The government is under severe pressure from the media and
an opposition which smells blood.
 In an exchange on Thursday night on RTE radio, an opposition
MP from the Labour Party screamed at community minister Carey
for ruining the country.

recouping earlier losses on expectations that Ireland was near a
deal to get tens of billions of euros from its European partners
and the IMF for its shattered banks.
 Dublin said discussions would run into next week, and
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told parliament it was not yet at
the point of requesting a loan.
 ""There is a degree of calm on anticipation of a near-term
resolution for the Irish banks, which has fed renewed
risk-taking and a relief rally for the euro, which could
potentially rise to $1.40,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 By 0825 GMT, the euro was up 0.3 percent on the day at
$1.3685. It had fallen to a seven-week low of $1.3446 on trading
platform EBS on Tuesday, stalling above $1.3436, the 50 percent
retracement of its August to November rally.
 Bids were seen around $1.3610/20, just ahead of the 55-day
moving average at $1.3607 on Friday. Offers were seen at $1.3695
and above, traders said.
 Options with strike at $1.3600 and $1.3700 were set to
expire on Friday, which may hem the pair in, traders said.
 Against the yen, the euro was flat at 114.00 yen, but up
from the week's low of 112.27 yen hit on Tuesday.
 With little data scheduled, markets were waiting for
comments from European Central Bank officials including ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet and ECB Governing Council member
and Bundesbank President Axel Weber at a conference.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hit back at
critics of the U.S. central bank's latest bond-buying programme
and issued a thinly veiled attack on China's policy of keeping
its currency depressed, in prepared remarks for delivery at the
conference.
 He also said: ""The best way to continue to deliver the
strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the
dollar, as well as to support the global recovery, is through
policies that lead to a resumption of robust growth in a context
of price stability in the United States.""
 Speculation China may raise key interest rates initially
dragged shares in Shanghai lower and weighed on the Australian
dollar, but they reversed course later in Asian trading. The
Shanghai stock index ended up 0.8 percent and the Australian
dollar was up slightly at $0.9895.
 The dollar eased 0.2 percent to 83.31 yen but remained in
sight of a six-week high of 83.79 yen marked on Thursday, helped
by upbeat U.S. economic data showing factory activity in the
Mid-Atlantic region accelerated in November, and by a closely
watched gauge of jobless benefits falling to a two-year low.
 ""It's just a case of continued position unwinding before
Thanksgiving,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank, referring to
the dollar's recent rise against the yen.
 A drop in dollar/yen option volatilities -- the one-month
fell to a six-month low on Friday -- also lent support to the
greenback, which may test 85 yen next week, the trader said.

 SINGAPORE, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets rose
slightly on Friday and the euro held recent gains after a
strong Wall Street performance and moves towards heading off a
potential Irish debt crisis.	
 By 0745 GMT the MSCI All-Country World equity index
was up 0.2 percent after hitting a
one-month low earlier in the week.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index
of top shares opened flat. 
 Shares in Shanghai and South Korea
rose nearly 1 percent, while Japan's Nikkei
average marked a five-month closing high above 10,000,
propelled by hedge fund inflows from overseas and with a fall
in the yen providing additional support. 
 Blue-chip shares rose broadly. Banking stocks were likely
buoyed by short-covering and fresh buying by a U.S. brokerage
on the view that they are undervalued, one market player said.	
 The charts also point to stronger upside potential after
the Nikkei on Thursday broke through solid resistance at its
200-day moving average for the first time since May.	
 ""Many hedge funds close books in November and now is a
time when short-covering tends to emerge. Solid U.S. economic
data and GM's listing yesterday are also lending help,"" said
Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief equity marketing officer at Tokai
Tokyo Securities.	
The Nikkei ended the day up 0.1 percent to 10,022.39, its
highest finish since June 22. On the week, it added 3.1
percent. The broader Topix was also up 0.1
percent.	
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.3670,
supported by rising expectations of a financial rescue plan
for Ireland. [ID:nLDE6AH0HV]
The euro held onto its recent gains but stopped
short of breaking above major resistance after analysts warned
that the single currency was not out of the woods yet, with
Ireland's debt troubles threatening to spill over to other
highly indebted peripheral euro zone countries such as
Portugal. 
 The dollar held steady against a basket
of currencies and against the yen. 
 News that Ireland may avert a debt crisis weighed on
bonds. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
fell 5/32 in price to lift yields to
2.90 percent.	
 U.S. crude oil futures  gained nearly 40
cents to $82.02 per barrel, retracing part of a four-session
drop, while spot gold was at $1,357.45 an
ounce.	
 In South Korea, investors resumed bond purchases on Friday
after comments from Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong-yong and on
market hopes that foreigners' existing holdings would not be
subject to a bond tax aimed at curbing hot money flows. 
Yim told Reuters the government prefered the option of
imposing flexible withholding tax rates, but did not elaborate
on what that would mean in practice. [ID:nTOE6AI00G]

""The appetite for Asian bonds is pretty strong and Korean
bonds stand out as retaining value,"" said Kenneth Akintewe, a
Singapore-based bond fund manager who helps manage $5 billion
in Asian fixed income at Aberdeen.	
 Global stocks rose on Thursday as a blockbuster General
Motors Co stock offering dovetailed with
upbeat U.S. economic data and easing Irish debt tensions.	
 GM's return to the market less than 18 months after it
emerged from bankruptcy, raised $20.1 billion, the largest
U.S. initial public offering. [ID:nN18285952] 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.6
percent on Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
gained 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq Composite

 WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ultra-low interest rates in
the developed world are fueling dangerous speculation in
emerging markets, forcing counter measures that could hurt
global economic growth, a top official at Mexico's central
bank said on Thursday. 
 Manuel Sanchez, a member of the Bank of Mexico's board,
told Reuters Insider he was concerned about a tit-for-tat in
economic policy that could damage trade relations. 
 ""To the extent that appreciation of those currencies have
pushed some governments into a reactive stance, generating
some measures of capital controls in some cases or
interventions in foreign exchange markets, I argue that that's
not a good sign for the ongoing recovery of the world
economy,"" he said on the sidelines of a meeting sponsored by
the CATO Institute. 
 The Federal Reserve's ultra-loose monetary policy, and in
particular its decision this month to pump an additional $600
billion in monetary stimulus into the banking system by buying
up U.S. Treasury bonds, has raised sharp criticism overseas.	
 Officials from key emerging countries like China and
Brazil have depicted the policy as a backdoor attempt to help
boost U.S. exports by weakening the U.S. dollar, an intent Fed
officials expressly deny.	
 Sanchez, the Bank of Mexico's deputy governor, said he saw
the rapid influx of cash into riskier but higher yielding
financial assets in the developing world as an unintended
consequence of Fed easing, albeit a key one.	
 ""The most important threat generated by these actions is
widespread movement toward protectionism that could hamper the
sustained recovery of the global economy. Thus it's preferable
to completely avoid these measures,"" Sanchez said in remarks
earlier in the day.	
 Asked about Mexico's outlook, he said the economy appeared
set to expand by around 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent in 2011,
citing the central bank's official forecasts. That would be
down from an estimated 5 percent growth rate for 2010, and
reflect in part dimmer prospects for the U.S. recovery.	
 Mexico's economy is very closely linked to the United
States, with about 80 percent of the country's exports
destined for its large northern neighbor.	
 Sanchez did not comment directly on monetary policy. The
central bank said earlier this month it could cut interest
rates or boost international reserves if a flood of foreign
investment into the country's capital markets persists.

 * Bernanke defends QE, shows no sign of backing off
 * Markets keeping eye on China for any rate moves
 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro held onto its
recent gains on Friday on budding hopes that Ireland is near a
deal to shore up its banks and budget deficit, although the
currency stopped short of breaking above major resistance.
 The euro also got a marginal boost after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a full-throated defence against
criticism of the bank's controversial bond-buying programme,
showing no signs of backing away from implementing the plan.
 But analysts warned that the euro was not out of the woods
yet with Ireland's debt troubles threatening to spill over to
other highly indebted peripheral euro zone countries such as
Portugal.
 There is also uncertainty whether China will adopt more
stringent measures to keep a lid on inflation, including a
drastic rise in key interest rates.
 The euro was clinging to most of the gains built up since
bouncing from Tuesday's seven-week low, trading at $1.3640, flat
on the day and up more than 1 percent from Tuesday's trough
around $1.3446.
 ""I feel that the worst for the euro is over,"" said a trader
at a U.S. bank. With its fall to a seven-week low, the euro had
given back half of its gains from late August to Nov. 4.
 ""The last time the euro was in an adjustment, in August, it
rebounded after achieving a 50 percent retracement,"" the trader
added.
 The single currency still needs to get above resistance at
$1.3750/1.3785, however, to put an end to the downward correction
of the last couple of weeks.
 UPBEAT DATA
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro was near 114.00 yen,
recovering from a fall to 112.23 yen on Tuesday.
 Upbeat U.S. economic data, including a drop in a closely
watched gauge of jobless benefits to a two-year low, helped to
lift the dollar to a six-week high of 83.79 yen on Thursday.
 It last traded at 83.49 yen, finding the going tough around
the session high of 83.66, which also represents a 61.8 percent
retracement of the September to November fall.
 The top end of a cloud on the daily ichimoku chart, which
serves as resistance, is at 83.68 yen, although a convincing
break above that could see the dollar retest 84.20 before
reclaiming 85.94 yen, highs last seen in mid-September.
 Sparking hopes of imminent aid for Ireland's shattered banks,
central bank governor Patrick Honohan said he expected Dublin to
receive tens of billions of euros in loans from European partners
and the IMF to provide stand-by funds.
 ""It feels like we're getting closer to some sort of
resolution ... so that's certainly seen euro get a better tone,""
said Grant Turley, strategist at ANZ.
 ""People are waiting to see what shape or form the package
might entail.""
 Healthy bids for Spanish bonds at a sale on Thursday further
helped to settle nerves, triggering a rally in European and U.S.
stocks. It pushed Wall Street's favourite pulse of investor
anxiety, the CBOE Volatility Index, down nearly 14 percent.
 Fed chairman Bernanke also reiterated the case for the Fed to
act now in the text of a speech for delivery to a conference at
the European Central Bank in Frankfurt later in the day. The text
was released ahead of his scheduled Friday appearance.
 While there was little surprising in Bernanke's comments,
some traders said they helped to push down the dollar as they
showed no signs of budging on quantitative easing despite growing
frustration over the policy both at home and abroad.
 Improved risk sentiment helped commodity prices to recover
from a recent fall and gave commodity currencies such as the
Australian dollar a shot in the arm.
 But a fall in Chinese shares amid policy tightening fears
undermined the Australian dollar, which fell 0.5 percent on the
day to $0.9850.
 Although it is still up more than 1 percent from this week's
low of $0.9725, it is some 3 percent below a 28-year peak around
$1.0183 set earlier in the month.
 Against the yen, it fell 0.5 percent to 82.30 yen.

(Adds quotes, background, market reaction)
 SEOUL, Nov 19 (Reuters) - South Korea plans to prepare
additional measures to reduce sharp swings in capital flows by
the end of this year, following legislative steps to re-impose a
tax on foreign bond holders.
 Vice Finance Minister Yim Jong-yong told Reuters on Friday
the government also prefers the option of imposing flexible
withholding tax rates on foreigners' local bond investments, the
approach included in one of two bills that ruling party members
introduced to the National Assembly last week.
 ""We are planning to complete it within this year,"" Yim said
on the sidelines of the Asian Development Cooperation Meeting,
when asked about additional measures to contain sharp swings in
capital flows and the won .
 On Thursday, he said the government would unveil further
measures on capital flows if necessary, which might include a
bank levy and limits on foreign exchange forward positions held
by banks. [ID:nTOE6AH04O]
 The remarks came after the ministry issued a statement to say
it would support lawmakers' bills to re-impose a withholding tax
on foreigners' bond investments, in a move seen as helping speed
up the process of passing one of the tax bills at parliament.
 ""We prefer a flexible tax rate so we can quickly deal with
changes in the situation,"" Yim said.
 A ruling party member submitted a bill last week to the
National Assembly to reintroduce a 14 percent withholding tax on
capital gains earned by foreign investors from holdings of
domestic treasury and monetary stabilisation bonds.
[ID:nTOE6AB07V]
 Another lawmaker from the ruling Grand National Party has
also submitted a similar bill to parliament, calling for a
flexible tax rate on foreign bond holdings.
 Meanwhile, Yim said the government will not consider any
measures to slow foreigners' stock investments, adding that stock
funds and bond funds were different.
 Some market players speculate the government may impose
regulations on foreigners' stock investments if controls on bonds
cause foreign investors to shift into emerging market equity,
pushing up the won .
 The three-year treasury futures  dropped 0.06 points
to 112.26 as of 0125 GMT, while the won gained further to trade
at 1,131.5 against the dollar.

 By Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - China's shipments to Japan of
rare earths could resume next week, Japan's trade minister
said on Friday, nearly two months after exports of the
minerals, vital for making many high-tech products, stalled
amid a spat over disputed islands in the East China Sea. 
 Customs procedures for shipments to Japan are improving,
Trade Minister Akihiro Ohata told reporters, adding: ""I
strongly hope that shipments will start moving next week."" 
 Japanese firms have complained of restrictions on
shipments of the minerals by Chinese customs officials since
late September, when a Chinese trawler captain was detained
after his ship collided with Japanese patrol boats near the
disputed islands. He was later released and sent home.	
 In a move to diversify its sources of supplies of the
strategic minerals, Japan agreed with Mongolia on Friday to
cooperate on developing mineral resources, including rare
earths.	
 China produces 97 percent of the world's rare earth metals.	
 A survey by Japan's trade ministry of more than 30 firms
this week showed that 16 out of 27 that gave detailed
responses said there had been signs of improvement in China's
customs procedures. 
 ""I think the Chinese understand that stalled exports of
rare earths to Japan would in turn have a big impact on
China's production of computers,"" Ohata said. 
 ""I strongly hope that rare earth shipments to Japan will
get back to normal."" 
 He said the improvement in customs procedures was in line
with comments by Zhang Ping, the head of China's National
Development and Reform Commission, who told him last weekend
that the issue would be resolved soon. [ID:nTKF107091] 
 Daily checks showed there had been very little loading of
Japan-bound rare earths in the past two months, said Tsutomu
Murasaki, director of the trade ministry's nonferrous metals
division. 
 The survey showed most shipments still being blocked,
though some loading began after Chinese customs gave the
go-ahead to the shippers on Nov. 17, Murasaki told a news
conference. Shippers had applied for customs clearance in
early October.	
 He said the ministry had no information on the impact on
users of rare earths such as glass and auto parts makers. 
 Tensions remain between Japan and China despite the
release of the trawler captain. The two countries' leaders,
however, signalled a thaw may be in sight when they met on the
sidelines of the Asia-Pacific leaders' gathering in Japan last
weekend. [ID:nTOE69400V] 
 China has set 2010 export quotas of rare earths 40 percent
lower than 2009 levels, raising alarm among buyer nations
about supplies. 
 The shortage and higher cost has resulted in an increase
of smuggling of rare earths, an official at a Beijing-based
metals pricing service told Reuters last month. [ID:nTOE69R0C0] 
 
 Japan, seeking to offset the risk of its dependence on its
giant rival, has recently been pledging closer ties with other
Asian nations and partnering with them on rare earth
development. 
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Mongolian President
Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj agreed on Friday to build a strategic
partnership and to seek cooperation on developing mineral
resources in Mongolia.	
 In October, Japan agreed with India to cooperate in
developing and recycling rare earth minerals and rare metals,
as well as with Vietnam to mine rare earths in the southeast
Asian nation. [ID:nSGE69U00S] [ID:nTOE69O087]

 * South Korea says ""very limited"" revisions needed
 * US-Korea Business Council expects deal this year
(Adds lawmaker comments) 
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
told congressional critics of a free trade deal with South
Korea he would consider asking Seoul for changes to labor,
investment and financial provisions of the pact to help win
approval of the deal in Congress, a lawmaker said on Thursday.
 ""He wanted us to give him a list of what our other concerns
were,"" Representative Michael Michaud, a Maine Democrat, told
Reuters after he and eight other lawmakers met with Obama.
 Obama said he ""is willing to go over that list and see
which ones they agree with, and the ones that they do (agree
with) they'll try (to pursue) when they continue the
negotiations with the Koreans,"" the Maine Democrat said.
 But Michaud, who is chairman of the House of
Representatives Trade Working Group, said also Obama made clear
finalizing the trade deal was a priority and ""he definitely
does not want to start from scratch"" to get that done.
 Obama's conversation with Michaud and his colleagues
reflects the political problems he faces in embracing the
Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which the two countries signed
three years ago when George W. Bush was president.
 For many Democrats, the pact is based on a ""bad template""
that Bush used to negotiate a raft of trade deals during his
eight years in office, Michaud said.
 U.S. and South Korean negotiators plan to resume talks soon
on the trade deal in Washington, following their failure to
resolve beef and auto trade issues during Obama's recent trip
to Seoul for the Group of 20 summit.
 Michaud said his group told Obama ""we're willing to work
with him on Korea and other trade deals, but we have very
serious concerns beyond autos and beef ... We have issues with
labor, investment and financial chapters .""
 An extended list of U.S. demands could complicate chances
of quick agreement on the deal, and Michaud acknowledged they
had to be ""realistic"" about what more Obama could get.
STICKING POINTS
 Despite the setback at the G20, U.S. business have tried to
remain optimistic that a deal is still possible and could be
sent to Congress for approval early next year.
 Tami Overby, president of the U.S.-Korea Business Council,
said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Demeterios Marantis told
her on Wednesday he still believes it is ""matter of days and
weeks"" before a deal is sealed.
 Obama and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak set the G20
deadline for resolving differences about the pact, which was
signed by the countries in June 2007 but never ratified.
 The sticking points mainly involve U.S. auto industry
concerns that the pact does not do enough to tear down South
Korean regulatory barriers blamed for low U.S. car sales while
phasing out remaining U.S. tariffs on South Korean vehicles.
 The United States also is looking for assurances outside
the agreement that South Korea's market will remain open to
U.S. beef and continue to grow, after a number of trade
disruptions in the past decade.
 South Korea conceded on Thursday some changes may be needed
to the pact but said any revisions would be limited.
 ""It is not full-fledged negotiations. What is inevitable is
we need negotiations on a very limited scale to give and take
what each side needs,"" South Korea's deputy minister for trade,
Choi Seok-young, said in Seoul.
 The United States wants a slower phase-out of tariffs on
South Korean cars and U.S. industry fuel economy and emissions
standards to be automatically recognized in South Korea.
 Choi said any change to the tariff phase-out schedule will
have to involve changes to the text itself and is therefore
unacceptable as a matter of principle. But he left open the
possibility for discussions.

 TORONTO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar ended higher
against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday as optimism that
Ireland may soon resolve its debt woes nudged investors toward
higher-yielding currencies and away from the greenback.
 Global stocks soared on Thursday, while the euro firmed as
uncertainty about the Irish debt crisis ebbed. [FRX/]
[MKTS/GLOB]
 Ireland's central bank chief said on Thursday he
expected Dublin to receive tens of billions of euros in loans
from European partners and the IMF to shore up its shattered
banks. [ID:nLDE6AH0HV] [FRX/]
 ""It was obviously the news, or the expectations, that
Ireland would accept EU and IMF support. At least a temporary
resolution of that situation was what helped risky assets,""
said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency
strategy.
 Chandler said the Canadian currency also got a bounce from
domestic data that showed the composite leading indicator rose
0.2 percent in October after dropping in September, while
wholesale trade unexpectedly rose 0.4 percent in September.
[ID:nSCLIME67B] [ID:nN18271262]
 ""We did have better economic statistics to kick off the
day, but mostly it's just a reflection of the risk-on move that
had the U.S. dollar weaker against a broad swath of currencies.
Canada definitely benefited from that.""
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0215 to the
U.S. dollar, or 97.90 U.S. cents, up from Wednesday's finish at
C$1.0243 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.63 U.S. cents.
 The currency touched a session high of C$1.0155 to the U.S.
dollar, or 98.47 U.S. cents, shortly after the release of the
domestic data, before easing.
 Also helping the commodity-linked currency's move higher
was a bounce in the price of oil, which climbed toward $82 a
barrel, while gold and base metal prices were also firmer.

 BONDS LOWER

 ""Bonds are reacting to the same common factor which is
higher equities, more risk-on appetite. We did have stronger
data, but it was mostly global factors driving things,"" said
Chandler.
 The two-year bond  sagged 8 Canadian cents to
yield 1.634 percent, while the 10-year bond  sank 23
Canadian cents to yield 3.613 percent.

 * Official announcement may not come for a few days
 * Rousseff may ask central bank chief to stay on initially
(Adds details on Mantega in paragraphs 9-10)
 BRASILIA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance Minister
Guido Mantega accepted an invitation by president-elect Dilma
Rousseff to stay on as finance minister, a source with direct
knowledge of the decision told Reuters on Thursday.
 Rousseff's decision to keep Mantega would be the latest
sign that she does not intend to stray far from the economic
policies of her predecessor and political benefactor President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who leaves office on Jan. 1.
 Those policies have helped Brazil enjoy its biggest
economic boom in almost three decades while also boosting the
country's clout in global forums such as the G20 group, where
Mantega has emerged as an influential voice.
 The choice dovetails with widespread speculation in
financial markets and political circles that Rousseff would
leave Mantega in his post as a way of easing concerns among
investors worried about any abrupt changes in economic policy.
 But even if there is no changing of the guard at the
finance ministry, some analysts believe that Rousseff will look
to put her own stamp on economic policy and that some changes
may be on the horizon.
 ""Continuity of people doesn't necessarily mean continuity
of policies. And the continuation of the current policies is
not enough to take Brazil to the next stage,"" said Pablo
Goldberg, a strategist with HSBC in New York.
 Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported on Thursday that
Rousseff is also weighing asking Henrique Meirelles to stay on
temporarily and that she will likely wait to announce her
economic team until she picks someone for the central bank.
 Both the finance ministry and the central bank declined to
comment.
 The choice of Mantega may have been a missed opportunity
for Rousseff to appoint a more fiscally credible person in the
finance ministry, analysts said. The government's expansionary
fiscal policy during an election year in 2010 has come under
criticism, pressuring public accounts despite a rebound in tax
revenues.
 Mantega, a close Lula lieutenant who advised him on
economic policy from 1993 to 2002, is known for advocating
increased development spending in Brazil. Before his post as
finance minister, he worked as the planning minister and as the
head of state development BNDES.
 Lula has reportedly lobbied on the behalf of Mantega and
Meirelles, arguing that it would help ensure a smooth
transition period at a time of global economic uncertainty.
 Speculation over Rousseff's possible cabinet has been rife
as investors look for reassurances that the new administration
will rein in public spending and move ahead with long-sought
structural reforms aimed at ensuring the economy can keep
growing at a fast pace. For more on the names under
consideration see [ID:nN10169667].
 CURRENCY WOES AWAIT
 Mantega, 61, has overseen Brazil's economic boom in recent
years, with the economy now growing at robust rates that make
it the envy of many still-struggling developed nations.
 Throughout his more than four years as finance minister,
Mantega has clashed with the central bank over the level of
Brazil's interest rate and confounded analysts and investors
with a more interventionist stance on the economy that was
championed by many in the ruling Workers' Party.
 He has also presided over a steep increase in government
spending and a deterioration of public finances, prompting some
investors to wonder if he is committed to the fiscal discipline
and economic reforms that many say Brazil needs to sustain its
brisk expansion.
 ""Mantega is not the same combative minister who in 2006
took office and clashed right away with the central bank. He
has learned and is more mature, and could give markets a
surprise,"" said Jose Francisco Lima Goncalves, chief economist
at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.
 ""My perception is that he is conscious of the need for some
prudence in the fiscal area,"" he added. ""Mantega won't open the
faucets as he did during this election year.""
 A well-placed official in Rousseff's Workers' Party told
Reuters she plans to officially announce her choice for finance
minister by the end of the month. The rest of the cabinet would
likely be unveiled by Dec. 15, the source added.
 Record-low interest rates in the United States, Japan and
other developed economies have caused an avalanche of dollars
into emerging economies like Brazil, propping up currencies
like the Brazilian real  and causing what Mantega dubbed
an ""international currency war.""
 Frustrated with the flow of hot money into Brazil, Mantega
raised taxes on capital inflows and lambasted the U.S. Federal
Reserve's new quantitative easing policy, calling it dubious.
 Meirelles faces more resistance within the Workers' Party
than Mantega, meaning the chances of a change at the central
bank are greater than in the finance ministry, said the party
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The euro strengthened on
Thursday, posting its largest one-day gain against the U.S.
dollar in two weeks, as investors became more optimistic about
a rescue plan for debt-stricken Ireland.
 Gains in the euro, however, may prove short-lived given
concerns Ireland's troubles may spread to other peripheral
economies in the euro zone such as Portugal and Spain.
 Problems in Ireland overshadowed generally upbeat U.S.
economic reports that propelled the U.S. dollar to a six-week
high against the yen. Data on Thursday showed some improvement
jobless claims while factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic
region grew more than expected in November. For details, see
[ID:nN18277350]
 ""At this point, Europe is going to address the Irish
problem,"" said James Dailey, chief investment officer and
senior portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund, a mutual
fund based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
 ""I think what you saw over the last two weeks with Angela
Merkel (German Chancellor) ... talking about debt holders
having to share in the losses and backtracking from that is
indicative ... (Europe) is likely to monetize this problem,""
said Dailey, who oversees assets of about $45 million.
 The euro earlier climbed about 1.0 percent versus the
dollar and yen as the cost of insuring Irish debt against
default fell after Ireland's central bank chief said he
expected Dublin to receive tens of billions of euros in loans
from European partners and the IMF. [ID:nLDE6AH0HV]
 ""The issues in Europe are going to take time to iron out,""
said Greg Faranello, managing director and head of Treasury and
trading at Espirito Santo Investment S.A. in New York.
 ""But the euro will be subject to periods like today where
markets are stretched and sentiment on the euro has gotten very
negative. Short-term, we were due for a little bit of a
correction anyway.""
 FURTHER EURO DOWNSIDE SEEN
 Market participants cautioned, however, that lingering
worries about other debt-laden European countries will likely
continue to weigh on the euro, which has lost about 3.0 percent
this month as funds liquidated long positions.
 TEAM's Dailey said he expects further downside in the euro,
falling to anywhere between $1.30-$1.32. ""We'll probably see a
spike because the decline has been pretty much linear. When
that happens, we can go back up to $1.36-$1.37 and that would
probably be an opportune time to sell the euro again.""
 Year-end flows could further support the dollar versus the
euro along with an improving U.S. economic picture. Recent U.S.
data, including Thursday's regional manufacturing and leading
indicators reports, all suggested the economy's recovery has
become more stable.
 ""On the whole, the news coming out of the U.S. seems to be
slowly improving,"" said Espirito Santo's Faranello. ""I think in
general any strength in the euro should be a short-term
phenomenon.""
 The euro  hit a session high of $1.3668 on trading
platform EBS, moving away from a seven-week low of $1.3446 set
on Tuesday. It was last up 0.8 percent at $1.3629, the euro's
best daily performance since early November.
 Traders said stop-losses were triggered at $1.3630.
Resistance is at $1.3750, followed by $1.3765, the 38.2 percent
retracement of this month's fall.
 It also rose 1.1 percent against the yen  to
113.80.
 Still analysts said even if a quick resolution is reached
over Ireland, investors are likely to fret about other
peripheral economies and their debt levels, with Portugal
viewed as the next crisis spot.
 Against the yen , the dollar rose 0.3 percent to
83.50 yen, extending gains after the release of Thursday's
positive U.S. data. It earlier hit a a high of 83.79, the
dollar's strongest level since Oct. 5, according to EBS.
 Optimism about Ireland also bolstered risk appetite toward
equities and commodities and drove higher-yielding currencies
up. The Australian  and New Zealand  dollars
rose about 1.0 percent on Thursday.

 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies firmed on Thursday as fears over Irish debt
subsided, prompting investors to return to the region's
higher-risk assets.
 Ireland is expected to receive tens of billions of euros in
loans from European partners and the IMF to help shore up its
shattered banks and stabilize the economy. [ID:nLDE6AH0HV]
 ""The news about Ireland has brought back enough optimism
for traders to take positions of risk -- the peso is performing
quite well,"" said one currency trader from the western Mexico
city of Guadalajara.
 A Spanish bond auction that passed relatively smoothly,
reflecting greater confidence in the euro zone, also helped
Latin American currencies to strengthen, said Pedro Tuesta, a
Latin America economist with 4Cast in Washington.
 The Mexican currency  strengthened 0.62 percent to
12.286 per dollar.
 Concerns over euro zone debt had battered Latin American
currencies over recent days. As well as scaring investors away
from emerging markets, a full-blown crisis in Europe could also
impact global growth, reducing demand for Latin America's
exports.
 The Mexican peso lost 1.78 percent between Nov. 5 and this
past Tuesday. Its recent losses brought the currency close to
its 50-day moving average against the dollar before it changed
tendency on Wednesday.
 ""The resistance of the dollar (versus the Mexican peso)
against its 50-day moving average gives more reassurance that
the peso will recover over the next few days,"" wrote analysts
at the MetAnalisis consultancy in Mexico City.
 The Chilean peso  closed 0.67 percent stronger,
bidding 480.2 per dollar as the price of copper, the country's
main export, made strong gains.
 ""International stock markets are positive, copper improved
in international markets and this is causing the peso to
appreciate a little against yesterday's close,"" said one trader
in Santiago. ""All of this, because there is less uncertainty
over the Ireland issue.""

 See graphic on factors driving Chile's peso:
http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/F/11/CL_PESOCU1110.gif
 
 The Brazilian real  bid 0.58 percent stronger to
close at 1.714 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market,
edging away from the two-month low it hit earlier this week.
 Brazil has fought at the forefront of what Finance Minister
Guido Mantega calls an international ""currency war."" tripling a
tax on capital inflows into local bonds to 6 percent last month
and regularly buying dollars in the foreign exchange market.
 The measures have helped contain the rise in the local
currency somewhat, but the real is still up more than 4 percent
since late June.
 ""Given Mantega's rhetoric we would expect more noise again
as soon as we touch close to 1.70,"" 4Cast's Tuesta said.
 Bank of Mexico Deputy Governor Manuel Sanchez on Thursday
added to complaints against the U.S. central bank's Treasury
bond purchasing program that is seen keeping the dollar weak
and causing Latin American currencies to appreciate.
 Rock-bottom interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve
are dangerous, and risk fanning trade protectionism and hurting
global economic growth, Sanchez said in Washington.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - European Union President Herman
Van Rompuy played down on Thursday his comment that the future
of the 27-nation union was at stake because of debt problems
experienced by some countries, such as Ireland.
 Van Rompuy said in a prepared speech that his statement this
week that the EU was ""in a survival crisis"" had referred to the
situation from April and May when Greece's ballooning budget
deficit brought the euro zone to the brink of a crisis.
 He said his remark did not point to the current debt
problems of Ireland. Since the Greek crisis, the euro zone had
set up an emergency aid mechanism to help euro zone members.
 He stressed that he was confident the euro zone would
overcome its current problems and that he had never questioned
the ability of the euro zone to survive.
""I had hoped that the message would have come across, rather
than a reference to 'survival crisis' of the spring, which was
wrongly interpreted as also referring to the present situation,""
he said.
 He said the euro zone's economic situation was generally
sound, although divergences, such as between Germany and Greece,
needed to be corrected.
 ""Economic growth in the euro zone is much stronger than most
of us thought... The fundamentals of the euro zone are sound,""
he said.
 He reaffirmed his determination to reform euro zone budget
discipline rules so as not to allow its member states' deficits
and debt levels to grow too much.
 He confirmed that a team of the European Commission, the
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank was
working with the Irish authorities ""to determine the best way to
provide the necessary support to address market risks.""
 Van Rompuy told a Brussels think-tank on Tuesday that the
future of the EU was at stake in the latest spasm of a debt
crisis that began a year ago with Greece.
 ""We are in a survival crisis,"" he told the European Policy
Centre. ""We all have to work together in order to survive with
the euro zone because if we don't survive with the euro zone, we
will not survive with the European Union.""

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 01:16PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Austerity measures around the euro zone," Nov 18 (Reuters) - A euro zone debt crisis triggered by
Greece has forced European governments to take action to tackle
high public debt levels.
 Here are details of some austerity measures around the euro
zone: 
 
 * GREECE:
 -- Greece pledged on Thursday to raise VAT, freeze pensions
and cut government waste further in 2011 to meet the terms of an
EU/IMF bailout after admitting it would miss this year's
targets.
 -- The deficit will shrink by 5.1 billion euros in 2011 to
16.8 billion euros, or 7.4 percent of gross domestic product,
back in line with the terms of the bailout deal, it said, after
fiscal slippages and a deeper-than-expected recession derailed
this year's efforts.
 -- The new cuts are bigger than the initially planned 2.2
billion euro deficit reduction targeted in last month's first
budget draft. The 2010 deficit will amount to 9.4 percent of GDP
compared with a bailout plan target of about 8 percent of GDP.
 Some measures revealed on Thursday include: 
 -- An increase in the lower VAT rates to 13 percent from 11
percent and to 6.5 percent from 5.5 percent, along with a levy
on large profitable firms.
 -- Cuts in government operating costs and a nominal pension
freeze.
 -- Significant cuts in operational and wage costs of
loss-making public utilities, in health costs, defence spending.
The health ministry has said it plans extra spending cuts worth
840 million euros in 2011.
 
 * IRELAND:
-- A joint mission of the European Commission, the European
Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund began talks on
Thursday with the central bank and the finance ministry on a
possible rescue package for Ireland.
 -- Finance Minister Brian Lenihan, however, insisted the IMF
and EU would not have any input into Ireland's budgetary
measures, even though EU rules stipulate that any emergency
lending can only be granted to a government that signs a strict
fiscal conditionality agreement.
 -- Ireland said on Nov. 4 it would push through spending
cuts and tax hikes totalling 6 billion euros in 2011 to get its
budget deficit under control by a deadline of 2014.
 -- Lenihan said he expected next year's adjustment, which
will be weighted more on the spending side, would cut the
deficit to 9.25-9.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and to 2.75-3 percent
of GDP in 2014, the deadline he has agreed with Brussels to get
the shortfall under control.
 -- The budget deficit is set to blow out to 32 percent of
GDP in 2010 due to the one-off inclusion of a mammoth bill for
bailing out Ireland's banks. Excluding the bank bill, the
deficit will be nearly 12 percent of GDP this year.
-- Fitch cut Ireland's credit rating last month and consumer
morale slumped as the cost of cleaning up its banks hit home,
piling pressure on the government to bring forward the 2011
budget, the toughest on record, due on Dec 7.
 
 * FRANCE: 
 -- France's Constitutional Council approved President
Nicolas Sarkozy's pension bill on Nov. 9, clearing the last
hurdle to a reform that will raise the retirement age by two
years to stem a huge pension deficit.
 -- The law will raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 by
2018, making people work longer for a full pension, and will
raise public sector contributions to private sector levels. The
reform will also raise the eligible age to receive a full
pension to 67 from 65.
 -- The budget aims to cut the public deficit to 6 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011 from an estimated 7.7 percent in
2010, in the first phase of a plan to trim the shortfall to the
EU's 3 percent ceiling in 2013, and 2 percent in 2014.
 The budget envisages:
 -- Raising the top marginal rate of tax to 41 percent from
40 percent to fund pension reforms.
 -- Raising the tax on capital gains by one percentage point.
 -- The end of a one-off corporate tax break in 2010 will
increase revenues by 5.3 billion euros.
 -- The government aims to raise some 400 million euros from
the sale of property in 2011.
 -- The end of fiscal stimulus measures will cut 8.2 billion
euros from the deficit.
 
 * PORTUGAL:
 -- Portugal's parliament on Nov. 3 approved the general
guidelines of the budget bill, clearing another hurdle for a
fiscal programme that aims to sharply cut the deficit.
 -- Portugal has promised to cut this year's budget deficit
to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product from 9.3 percent last
year and further reduce it to 4.6 percent in 2011.
 Here are some of the measures:
 -- Cuts of 5 percent in civil servant wages and increases in
taxes in an effort to save 5.1 billion euros ($6.93 billion)
next year.
 -- On the revenue side, the measures would add 1.7 billion
euros to state coffers, or one percentage point of gross
domestic product. They include:
 -- Value-added tax to be raised by 2 percentage points for
top level to 23 percent from 21 percent, expanding on a 1
percentage point increase on all levels implemented in July.
 
 * SPAIN:
 -- Spain revealed full details of its 2011 budget on Oct. 7
before parliament, including its estimates for bond issuance in
2011. Announced measures include:

 * Some energy firms trying to delay legislation-CDM Watch
 
 By Nina Chestney
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Italy and some energy firms are
out to thwart efforts to restrict the use in the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme of carbon credits from controversial projects to
destroy industrial gases in developing countries, two green
groups said.
 The European Commission was due this month to propose curbs
or a ban from 2013 on the use of offsets from industrial gas
projects in the European Union trading scheme (EU ETS), the
bloc's system for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
 It wants to stop exploitation of the system by project
developers, in countries including China and India, who are
suspected of adjusting plants to produce more of potent
greenhouse gas hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and then destroying
it to claim profitable carbon offsets.
 HFC-23 is a waste by-product from manufacturing
refrigerants.
 On Thursday, British campaigning group the Environmental
Investigation Agency accused Italy of trying to sabotage efforts
to reform the EU ETS.
 ""With the EU prepared to institute a much-needed reform,
Italy seems intent on snatching defeat from the jaws of
victory,"" said Clare Perry, senior campaigner at EIA.
 Italy has said it rejects the EU's plan because the curbs
may threaten some of its investments. Instead, it prefers a
gradual phasing out of the credits.
 The EIA said the Italian government holds a stake in two
HFC-23 projects, and Italian energy company Enel is financially
involved in six others, including one through its Spanish unit
Endesa.
 Italy allows up to 15 percent of its emissions reductions
under the EU ETS to be met by offsets and relies heavily on
HFC-23 credits, it added.
 Enel said on Thursday that the EU's proposed reform would
undermine the authority of the United Nations, which issues the
credits from the HFC-23 projects.
 Seperately, the group CDM Watch accused some other energy
companies of lobbying to delay the legislation.
 EU member states were due to vote on proposals in
mid-November but private sector interference has caused delays
in the internal consultation process, the group said.
 An EU Commission spokeswoman said the proposal was still
being discussed.
 ""We are optimistic about having it on the table before
Cancun,"" she told Reuters, referring to a U.N. climate summit in
Mexico starting on Nov. 29.
 Any delays in consultations threaten to add to confusion in
the carbon market.
 A United Nations panel, which suspended issuing credits to
HFC-23 projects in September, issued 871,000 credits to an
Indian project last week and cannot rule out doing so again.

 * G20 and APEC sent ""the right signals"" for 2011 deal
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - World Trade Organization chief
Pascal Lamy has invited its 153 member delegations to a meeting
on Nov. 30, seeking to build on calls this month by the G20 and
APEC summits to finish the Doha round of global trade talks.
 Lamy wants to revitalise the stalled talks on global
commerce which began nine years ago, sources close to the trade
negotiations said on Thursday.
 A series of meetings in recent months by small groups of key
ambassadors to brainstorm on how to move the talks forward has
led to a a greatly improved atmosphere among negotiators in
contrast to gloom and frustration earlier this year.
 But Lamy and senior negotiators say leaders still need to
signal their political will to reach a deal so that markets can
be opened up in food, manufactured goods and services while
helping poor countries.
 Lamy believes calls to conclude the talks which were issued
at the summits of the G20 rich and emerging economies and APEC
Asia-Pacific countries this month have sent the right signals.
The G20 spoke of 2011 being a narrow window of opportunity.
 He has told delegates that leaders expect them to deliver a
Doha deal next year, the sources said.
 Exhortations to reach a Doha deal have been routine at
summits for years, and it remains to be seen whether 2011 will
simply join the long list of missed deadlines.
 The latest call comes against a background of protectionist
pressures exacerbated by tensions over exchange rates and
economic policy. But the sources said Lamy hopes it will provide
the political momentum to translate fresh optimism among trade
diplomats in Geneva into the real give and take of negotiation.
 All sides in Geneva agree that some give and take is needed,
but there are differences over how big a push is needed to reach
a deal approved in national capitals.
 The United States, ultimately the key to any deal, wants big
emerging economies like China, India and Brazil to go much
further in opening their markets than already agreed.
 The emerging powers say they have already committed to
enough in a negotiation that is supposed to be about helping
developing countries, and they do not envisage more than
tinkering at the margins.
 The ground for the Nov. 30 meeting is likely to be prepared
with a smaller session with ambassadors from the main trading
powers and the diplomats that head the various negotiating
groups, one trade source said.
 Outside Geneva, EU trade chief Karel De Gucht is also
looking at bringing together ministers from key players later
this year or early next, trade sources said.

 * Scope for further downward movement limited
 * Says outlook for inflation has improved
 
 (Adds COSATU reaction)
 By Stella Mapenzauswa
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - South Africa's Reserve Bank
cut its repo rate by 50 basis points as expected on Thursday,
saying the outlook for domestic inflation had improved while the
economy was still struggling and the rand remained strong.
 Governor Gill Marcus said the scope for monetary easing was
limited, but Thursday's cut, which leaves the repo rate at a
historical low of 5.5 percent, may not be the bottom of the
interest rate cutting cycle.
 The move adds to 600 basis points of reductions in interest
rates since December 2008, partly aimed at boosting economic
growth after Africa's biggest economy suffered its first
recession in two decades last year.
 ""Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC), the outlook for domestic inflation has improved further
against the backdrop of a continued negative domestic output gap
and sustained strength in the exchange rate of the rand,"" Marcus
told a press conference.
 Marcus said inflation, which slowed to 3.2 percent
year-on-year in September, was expected to average 4.3 percent
for 2010 and 2011, before accelerating to 4.8 per cent in 2012,
but still within the central bank's 3-6 percent target range.
 The main risks to the inflation outlook continued to emanate
from cost-push factors, including wage trends and administered
prices, while food and petrol prices were also identified as
potential longer term risks.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 For a graphic on the repo rate and targeted inflation:

 For analysts' comments on the rate cut, click
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Marcus said the rand had appreciated by over 3 percent
against the U.S. dollar since the last policy meeting and was
""more or less unchanged on a trade-weighted basis"".
 The rand has gained 26 percent against the dollar since the
start of 2009 -- raising concerns within government, the central
bank and labour that this was hurting the economy in general and
the key manufacturing sector in particular.
 
 LABOUR WANTS BIGGER CUTS
 Labour federation COSATU, a powerful government ally,
welcomed the cut, but said reductions so far had been ""much too
small and too slow, given the continuing rise in unemployment,
the sluggish growth of the economy and the high levels of
poverty and inequality"".
 ""COSATU demands that the commercial banks heed the call by
the SARB Governor ... to pass on the full interest rate
reduction to their customers,"" it said in a statement.
 Marcus said persistently low growth in the United States and
renewed quantitative easing, combined with renewed concerns
about the solvency of some euro area countries, would prolong
the current environment of low global interest rates and
continued capital flows to emerging market economies.
 ""The recent observed volatility in the bilateral rand
exchange rates has been mainly as a result of the volatility in
the euro/dollar exchange rate. From a policy perspective, focus
is maintained on the trade-weighted exchange rate,"" she said.
 The rand was last at 7.0023 against the dollar from 6.9630
just before Marcus announced the cut. The yield on the benchmark
2015 bond was at 7.015 percent -- down 12 basis points on the
day -- from 7.08 percent beforehand.
 Marcus said the domestic economic recovery remained fragile
after last year's downturn, with adverse global developments
making the outlook more uncertain.
 ""The MPC believes that while monetary policy cannot
determine the long term growth path of the economy, it can
impact on cyclical deviations of output from potential output,""
she said.
 ""The view of the MPC is that there is room for further
stimulus, given the weakness in the supply side of the economy.""
 Marcus said the action was consistent with the continued
attainment of the inflation target but the scope for further
downward movement was limited ""given the signs of recovery in
household consumption expenditure and credit extension"".
 Analysts polled by Reuters last week saw a 60 percent
probability of a rate reduction, with 16 of 21 economists
surveyed predicting the Reserve Bank would cut the repo rate by
50 basis points to 5.5 percent.
 ""I think there is possibly room still to ease. In my mind
the door has been left open somewhat, just by the comment that
any further movement will be motivated by the economic stats as
they come out,"" said Brait economist Colen Garrow.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 11:52AM ET</span>","US, EU skirmish at appeal over Airbus subsidies"," * Appeals turn on legal technicalities, not rights or wrongs
 * Initial ruling condemned billions of dollars of Airbus aid
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The United States and European
Union traded blows at an appeal over EU subsidies for passenger
jet maker Airbus, part of the world's biggest trade dispute.
 In a recording broadcast on Thursday of statements to a
World Trade Organization appeal court on Nov. 11, the two sides
sought to unpick each other's arguments while challenging
findings by the original WTO panel that they disagreed with.
Both sides are appealing in the case brought by the United
States against subsidies for Airbus passenger jets paid by the
European Union and four of its member states.
 A WTO panel ruled in June that the EU must axe prohibited
export subsidies to Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS, that have
injured its rival Boeing.
 The panel found that Airbus had only been able to launch a
series of jets thanks to subsidies from the EU and Britain,
France, Germany and Spain.
 ""We are here today because the panel in this dispute found
that the European Union and certain member states -- France,
Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom -- gave massive subsidies
for the development and production of Airbus large civil
aircraft,"" a U.S. government trade lawyer told the appeal court.
 ""These payments together amounted to at least $18 billion.
The European Union has shown no error with the panel's findings
on these points.""
 WTO appeals look at only the points of law used by the
original panel and how it interpreted them, rather than
re-examining the rights and wrongs of the case.
 ""It is the panel's refusal to conduct the necessary analysis
that the EU requests the Appellate Body to reverse,"" an EU
lawyer said.
 The European Union says the dispute -- and a counter-suit it
launched against U.S. aid for Boeing planes -- can only be
resolved through negotiations.
 
 NEW RIVALS
 Both sides are keen to establish fair rules for trade in
large passenger jets, as other countries such as China, Brazil,
Canada, Japan and Russia eye a market worth $1.7 trillion.
 State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC)
announced on Tuesday it had won a 100-plane order for its first
commercial jetliner.
 WTO cases are usually held behind closed doors, but both
sides agreed to admit the public to the opening statements in
the appeal, delaying the broadcast by a week to allow the
parties time to remove commercially sensitive information.
 The EU is appealing almost everything, from whether its
payments amounted to illegal aid to whether they hurt Boeing.
 The United States, which says it was broadly satisfied with
the overall ruling, is seeking to overturn two points.
 It disagrees with the way the panel found only three of the
seven payments targeted by the United States were prohibited
export subsidies.
 And it wants the WTO to recognise the entire system of
European support for aircraft, dubbed ""launch aid"" by the
Americans, as a coherent subsidy programme with implications for
future aircraft, and not just a series of single payments.
 The judges hearing the appeal are unlikely to issue their
verdict until next year, following further hearings in December,
missing an earlier deadline because of the complexity of the
six-year-old dispute. But publication next month is possible.
 The delay in the appeal was a disappointment to Boeing,
which had hoped the Airbus case would be completed, and the
illegality of Airbus subsidies confirmed, before the U.S. Air
Force decides whether to pick Boeing or EADS for a refuelling
plane contract worth up to $50 billion.
 The Air Force is due to decide by Dec. 20 whether to pick a
plane based on Boeing's 767, or an EADS option based on the
Airbus A330.

 * Congressional critics meeting President Obama
 * South Korea says ""very limited"" changes needed
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The outlook is good for
concluding trade talks between the United States and South
Korea by the end of the year, despite a major setback this
month, a U.S. business official said on Thursday.
 Tami Overby, president of the U.S.-Korea Business Council,
said her group met Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios
Marantis on Wednesday ""and he continues to say a matter of days
and weeks"" before the deal is sealed.
 The two countries plan to resume talks on the trade deal in
Washington, after they failed to resolve remaining beef and
auto trade issues during President Barack Obama's recent trip
to Seoul for the Group of 20 summit.
 Overby said she was waiting to hear the date of the talks
but thought a deal could be reached by the end of this year.
 ""I would expect that,"" she said.
 Obama and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak set the G20
deadline for resolving differences about the pact, which was
signed by the countries in June 2007 but never ratified.
 The sticking points mainly involve U.S. auto industry
concerns that the pact does not do enough to tear down South
Korean regulatory barriers blamed for low U.S. car sales while
phasing out remaining U.S. tariffs on South Korean vehicles.
 The United States also is looking for assurances outside
the pact that South Korea's market will remain open to U.S.
beef and continue to grow, after a number of trade disruptions
in the past decade.
 About a dozen Democratic lawmakers who have raised concerns
and are pressing for other changes were due to discuss the pact
with Obama later on Thursday.
 South Korea conceded on Thursday that some changes may be
needed but said the scope of any revisions would be limited.
 Previously, Seoul resisted reopening the text of the pact,
which it said could cause it to unravel by upsetting the
delicate balance of concessions on both sides.
 ""It is not full-fledged negotiations. What is inevitable is
we need negotiations on a very limited scale to give and take
what each side needs,"" South Korea's deputy minister for trade
in charge of talks on the pact, Choi Seok-young, said in
Seoul.
 The United States wants a slower phase-out of tariffs on
South Korean cars and U.S. industry fuel economy and emissions
standards to be automatically recognized in South Korea.
 Choi said any change to the tariff phase-out schedule will
have to involve changes to the text itself and is therefore
unacceptable as a matter of principle. But he left open the
possibility for discussions.
 The deal, if ratified by the two countries' assemblies,
would be one of the largest free trade pacts ever and the
largest signed by the United States since the North American
Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico that went into
effect in 1994.

 * Foreigners invest heavily in Canadian stocks, bonds
 * Leading indicator rises, signals end to soft patch
 * September and Q3 GDP still seen weak
 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A rare set of upbeat Canadian
economic data on Thursday raised hopes the recovery would veer
back on track, despite an anemic third quarter that has kept
central bank interest rates on hold.
 Statistics Canada said wholesale trade in September climbed
0.4 percent, twice the rate forecast, on a surge in auto and
machinery sales.
 Foreign investors continued to be lured into Canadian
markets in a big way that same month, scooping up C$12.25
billion ($12.01 billion) billion worth of securities with a
focus on private corporate bonds issued by resource and
financial firms, and provincial bonds.
 In October, the composite leading indicator beat
expectations with a 0.2 percent gain, pushed higher by the
stock market and stronger demand for exports.
 The leading indicator's performance was ""a sign the soft
patch in the Canadian economy is ending,"" according to Jonathan
Basile, vice-president of economics at Credit Suisse.
 While the wholesale figures are a plus for monthly gross
domestic product, Scotia Capital economists Derek Holt and
Gorica Djeric said the economy may still contract in September
and growth could slow in the third quarter overall.
 Bad news on exports, manufacturing sales and housing starts
in the past few days has pointed to a further slowdown in
growth from the already disappointing 2 percent annualized pace
in the second quarter.
 Statscan will provide quarterly GDP figures on Nov. 30.
 ""Despite today's gain, September GDP could come in
negative,"" said Holt and Djeric in a note to clients.
 ""Our hope is for a decent gain in September's retail sales
report ... and what are expected to be solid results from the
broad cross sections of the services and resource sectors,
which are largely unobservable, but likely performing healthier
than manufacturing and housing related sectors.""
 The Bank of Canada, which projects 1.6 percent growth in
the July-September period, is widely expected to keep its key
interest rate unchanged at 1 percent in December and through
the first quarter of next year.
 The data contributed to the Canadian dollar's bounce
against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday. The currency 
reached C$1.0153 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.49 U.S. cents,
immediately after the data, but later slipped back, though it
remained above Wednesday's finish of 97.63 U.S. cents.
BOND BUYING EXTENDED
The biggest rise in wholesale activity came in the motor
vehicle and parts sector, while the machinery, equipment and
supplies sector also posted strong gains. Wholesale inventories
grew for the fifth time in six months, up 0.5 percent.
 Foreign investors continued a Canadian bond-buying spree
that began in January, adding C$8.81 billion worth of bonds to
their portfolios in September.
 Of the total, C$3.6 billion was in private corporate bonds.
Money pouring into federal government bonds has doubled since
January 2009 but tapered off to C$1.9 billion from C$3.2
billion in August.
 Nonresidents also bought C$3.28 billion in stocks, which
Statscan said was the result of foreign takeovers of Canadian
companies and the resulting new issues to shareholders.
 Canadians, for their part, invested C$4.56 billion in
foreign securities in September, mainly in stocks and to a
lesser extent in bonds.

 * Euro rises on easing worries over Irish debt crisis

 * Aussie, kiwi dollars gain as risk appetite increases
 (Adds quote, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday on
optimism Ireland will get loans to ease its banking and debt
crisis, but the gains may prove short-lived as investors
remained concerned about the risk of contagion to the rest of
Europe.
 The euro earlier climbed about 1.0 percent versus the
dollar and yen as the cost of insuring Irish debt against
default fell after Ireland's central bank chief said he
expected Dublin to receive tens of billions of euros in loans
from European partners and the IMF.
 Analysts cautioned, however, that lingering worries about
other debt-stricken European economies including Portugal and
Spain will likely continue to weigh on the euro, which has lost
about 3 percent this month as funds liquidated long positions.
 Year-end flows could further support the dollar versus the
euro. Recent U.S. data, including Thursday's regional
manufacturing and leading indicators reports, has showed an
improving economic picture, which could spur investors to close
out short dollar positions ahead of the end of the year.
 ""If Ireland does get some help, it will, at least for the
day, be a positive and will possibly put the euro up by a cent
or more,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, senior currency strategist at
Wells Fargo in New York. ""But after that news, it probably
won't take long at all before markets start turning their
attention toward the next problem area in Europe.""
 The euro hit a session high of $1.3668 on trading platform
EBS, moving away from a seven-week low of $1.3446 set on
Tuesday. It was last up 0.8 percent at $1.3626. It also rose
0.9 percent versus the yen.
 Traders said stop-losses were triggered at $1.3630.
Resistance is at $$1.3750, followed by $1.3765, the 38.2
percent retracement of this month's fall.
 Some analysts said that even if a quick resolution is
reached over Ireland, market participants would fret about
other peripheral euro zone economies and their debt levels,
with Portugal thought to be in the market's sights.
 A Spanish bond auction passed relatively smoothly, as it
sold 3.7 billion euros worth of 10 and 30-year bonds, albeit at
higher yields.
 ""The markets are not wholly convinced that contagion issues
will be contained. That's why we're not seeing a really
aggressive rally in the euro. Otherwise, the euro would be up
at around $1.38 or $1.39,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief
strategist of FX brokerage OANDA in Toronto. ""We are certainly
seeing interest to actually sell euros on rallies."" Factory
activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region grew much more than
expected in November, a survey showed on Thursday, while a
separate report showed a gauge of future U.S. economic activity
posted a solid rise in October.
 Against the yen, the dollar was rose 0.6 percent to 83.74
yen, extending gains after U.S. data.
 An increase in risk appetite boosted sentiment toward
equities and commodities and drove higher-yielding currencies
up. The Australian dollar rose 0.9 percent and the New Zealand
dollar was up 1 percent.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, dropped 0.7 percent to
78.560, off Tuesday's seven-week high of 79.461.
 Karen Jones, technical analyst at Commerzbank, said the
U.S. dollar index has charted ""a significant low"" and should
resume its uptrend toward the 80.00/50 key level after its
latest correction.
 The dollar came under pressure after data on Wednesday
showed U.S. core consumer inflation rose 0.6 percent from a
year ago, the smallest increase since records started in 1957,
which bolstered the case for the Fed to deliver all of its $600
billion of quantitative easing.

 * Farm unions say move could threaten farmers' viability
 * No details on future CAP budget in paper
 (Adds French government reaction)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The EU executive adopted plans
on Thursday that will force farmers to do more to protect the
environment in order to justify public subsidies, despite farm
unions warning that could threaten their economic viability.
 In a policy paper on reforming the EU's common agricultural
policy (CAP) from 2013, the European Commission said linking
direct subsidies -- currently worth about 40 billion euros ($54
billion) a year -- to new ""green"" objectives would help justify
the costly policy to EU taxpayers.
 ""The CAP has never been so close to a crisis of legitimacy
as it is today,"" EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos told
EU lawmakers in Brussels. ""This is an opportune moment to
refocus (the CAP) in line with the expectations of society.""
 But EU farmers' union Copa-Cogeca said the Commission's
focus on ""greening"" the CAP risked undermining EU food
production by increasing farmers' costs.
 ""The only concrete proposal in the paper is to add more
costly (environmental) burdens onto EU farmers,"" said Copa
President Padraig Walshe. ""Increasing costs lowers incomes and
will have a devastating effect on production,"" he told a news
conference in Brussels.
 The Commission will present its plans to EU farm ministers
on Nov. 29, with a formal response from EU governments expected
early next year ahead of the Commission's legislative reform
proposals due in July.
 France's farm minister Bruno Le Maire said many of the ideas
floated in the paper reflected a joint Franco-German position on
the CAP reform agreed in September.
 German farm minister Ilse Aigner called the paper ""a good
basis for further negotiations on a national and European
level.""
 Britain would have liked to see a greater recognition in the
paper of the fiscal and economic challenges facing the EU, a
diplomatic source said on Thursday, referring to the deep cuts
in public spending being made by many EU governments.
 ""Whilst recent reforms to the CAP reflect the right
direction of travel, this needs to be accelerated, promoting
greater competitiveness (and) efficient use of taxpayer
resources"" a British government spokesman said.
 Environmental groups gave the paper a cautious welcome, with
Friends of the Earth calling it a ""long-awaited step towards a
more people and planet-friendly food and agriculture policy.""
 
 BUDGET QUESTIONS REMAIN
 Lawmakers in the European Parliament -- which will have an
equal say in the reform with EU governments -- criticised the
paper for its lack of detailed proposals.
 ""The Commission's paper is so widely drawn that nearly
everyone will find something in it that appeals to them,""
Scottish liberal MEP George Lyon said.
 The most glaring lack of detail was on the future size of
the CAP budget, currently worth about 55 billion euro ($74
billion) a year.
 The EU executive is due to publish proposals for the bloc's
next long-term budget from 2014-2020 early next year. Few expect
a drastic cut in farm spending, though many believe the
Commission will try to reduce CAP spending to fund new
priorities.
 ""The real threat of big budget cuts still hangs over the
whole policy debate, and the final decision on the budget will
have a profound impact on the final outcome,"" Lyon said.
 France, Spain and other traditionally pro-CAP governments
have pledged to resist any moves to cut the CAP budget, pitting
them against Britain, Sweden and others who want to limit EU
spending and refocus it on economic growth and innovation.
 
 
 LIMITING PRICE VOLATILITY
 Other proposals floated in the paper include limiting the
level of direct subsidies paid to individual farms, and ensuring
that only active famers are eligible for EU subsidies.
 But Germany's Aigner said a limit on direct subsidies to
individual farms was ""not in the interests of German
agriculture"", given the high number of large farms in the
economically-weak east German regions.
 The Commission also called for a fairer distribution of
subsidies between old and new member states, with direct aid
currently varying from more than 500 euros ($674.9) per hectare
in Greece to less than 100 euros in Latvia.
 The paper ruled out an EU-wide flat-rate subsidy, but said
farmers in all countries could receive a minimum percentage of
the EU average rate -- currently about 250 euros per hectare.
 ""We have to ensure that this rebalancing is acceptable to
those who will be on the receiving end of reductions (and) will
not entail an over-abrupt change for certain farmers,"" Ciolos
said.
 Le Maire said France would oppose any bid to weaken direct
subsidies, while Germany's Aigner said any redistribution must
be limited and phased, and was dependent on the overall size of
the future EU budget.
 Market management tools such as export refunds should be
kept as a ""safety net"" against growing price volatility, the
Commission said, but new tools such as public-private funded
harvest insurance and mutual funds could also be introduced.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 11:20AM ET</span>","UK to launch Asian, African low-carbon energy funds"," * Two new public-private partnership funds next year
 * UK fast-start finance is transparent, open - minister
 
 By Nina Chestney
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The UK government will launch two
new public-private partnership funds to promote generation of
renewable energy in Africa and Asia next year, the secretary of
state for international development said on Thursday.
 The funds will target low-carbon energy and related
investments in Asia and large-scale renewable energy projects in
Africa.
 ""We hope to launch these partnerships next year,"" Andrew
Mitchell said at a briefing in London.
 A spokesman for the UK's department for international
development said it was looking at ways the funds could be
financed and could not put a value on them yet or identify the
potential private sector partners.
 Early modelling of the Asian fund suggests that it could
bring 9 pounds of private sector investment for every pound
committed by the government.
 Over the next 25 years, the project could generate up to 5
gigawatts of renewable energy and avoid 150 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide emissions.
 The African fund could generate up to 500 megawatts of new
renewable energy per year from 2015, providing enough
electricity for over four million households.
 The government will also launch a new advocacy fund to help
the poorest nations get heard in international climate change
and trade negotiations.
 ""This fund will provide access to legal, technical and
logistical support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries
(...) whose full participation is essential if we are to achieve
an equitable deal,"" Mitchell said, referring to a global
agreement on climate change.
 
 FINANCE
 In its spending review in October, Britain said it would
provide 2.9 billion pounds ($4.64 billion) of international
climate finance to 2015. This will partly fund a 1.5 billion
pound pledge of fast-start finance from 2010 to 2012.
 At last year's Copenhagen climate summit, rich countries
pledged $30 billion of ""fast start finance"" to help poorer
countries adapt to climate change and reduce their greenhouse
gas emissions during 2010-2012.
 Although European governments have fulfilled a promise to
deliver 2.2 billion euros ($3 billion) to help developing
countries tackle climate change, critics have said the money
might have come from rebranding existing aid pledges.
 ""We promised to report openly on our fast-start commitments.
The UK aid transparency guarantee was testament to our
commitment to be open and transparent and we are abiding by that
promise,"" Mitchell said in response to such criticism.
 ""(Our climate finance pledge) gives us the credibility to
press other donors to meet their commitments and press for an
agreement on new and innovative sources of climate finance,"" he
added.
 Climate finance has been a contentious issue since the
Copenhagen Accord last year. Developing countries say funds to
help them are not enough while developed countries struggle to
allocate aid in the wake of an economic downturn.
 A U.N. summit in Cancun, Mexico, from Nov.29-Dec.10 will be
trying to find ways to leverage finance and stimulate investment
in low-carbon technologies.

 By Lorraine Turner and Carmel Crimmins
 DUBLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ireland's central bank chief said
on Thursday he expected Dublin to receive tens of billions of
euros in loans from European partners and the IMF to provide
contingency capital for its shattered banks.
 Central Bank Governor Patrick Honohan was speaking as a
joint mission of the European Commission, the European Central
Bank and the International Monetary Fund began talks at the bank
and the finance ministry on a possible rescue package.
 ""The intention is and the expectation is, on their part and
personally on my part, that negotiations or discussions will be
effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as
necessary,"" Honohan told state broadcaster RTE.
 ""We're talking about a very substantial loan for sure --
tens of billions, yes,"" Honohan said, acknowledging substantial
outflows of funds from the Irish banking sector since April.
 The government said the talks would ""undoubtedly"" run into
next week before a decision is taken on whether to make a formal
application for assistance.
 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told parliament the
government was not yet at the point of requesting a loan and he
could not put a figure on the amount needed. But what was under
discussion was ""substantial contingency capital to be made
available to back Ireland"".
 He insisted the IMF and EU would not have any input into
Ireland's budgetary measures, even though EU rules stipulate
that any emergency lending can only be granted to a government
that signs a strict fiscal conditionality agreement.
 In a move to calm savers, Lenihan said the government was
extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of
next year, six months longer than previously announced.
 Opposition finance spokesman Michael Noonan told parliament:
""I have had ... constituents ringing me to know whether they
should open sterling accounts and move their money out.""
 Irish banks have suffered withdrawals from corporate clients
and Honohan said that had necessitated exceptional funding from
the Irish central bank on top of ECB liquidity assistance.
 After 10 days of losses, European stock and bond markets
and the euro rebounded on expectations Ireland would become the
second euro zone country after Greece to receive a bailout to
cope with high debts and deficits.
 Dublin's borrowing costs have gone through the roof since
late October as concerns about the banks' swelling liabilities
and German-driven EU moves to create a system for restructuring
stricken euro zone states' debts unsettled investors.
 Irish bond spreads over German Bunds narrowed and the cost
of insuring Irish, Portuguese and Greek debt against default
fell as markets anticipated a likely rescue.
 Spain found solid demand for 3.6 billion euros in 10- and
30-year bonds at an auction but had to pay a higher price than
two months ago, as did fellow euro zone struggler Portugal,
which sold treasury bills on Wednesday.
 That helped dampen fears of contagion from Ireland to other
highly-indebted euro zone members.
 
 NIGHTMARES
 The chief executive of Italy's biggest bank, Federico
Ghizzoni of UniCredit, said he had ""nightmares"" over the euro
zone debt crisis and was worried about Europe's ability to
address sovereign debt issues urgently.
 ""I am concerned about the fact that if not politically
properly addressed, it will continue to be in the market,
generating volatility,"" Ghizzoni told reporters in Frankfurt in
a rare public airing of fears shared by many senior bankers.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet voiced
concern at the risk of bank dependency developing on the ECB's
emergency liquidity measures as conditions normalise.
 Irish banks, largely shut out of interbank lending due to
concerns about their solvency, are almost entirely dependent on
ECB funding, which reached 130 billion euros by end-October,
plus an extra 35 billion euros from the Irish central bank.
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 In an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead,
France said Ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent
corporation tax rate -- a taboo in Irish politics -- in return
for the assistance package.
 Higher-tax countries, including Britain, Germany and France,
whose approval would be required for any emergency loans, have
long seen the Irish rate as a form of unfair competition.
 But Irish Deputy Prime Minister Mary Coughlan told
parliament the government would not raise the corporate tax
rate. ""It's non-negotiable,"" she said.
 Prime Minister Brian Cowen has repeatedly rejected
suggestions that his government is discussing a bailout that
would place public finances under EU-IMF supervision.
 Lenihan is due to detail a four-year, 15 billion euros
budget-cutting plan next week and the government will put a 2011
austerity budget to parliament on Dec. 7.
 Some analysts said Cowen is playing for time to avoid
applying for aid before a key Nov. 25 by-election that could
reduce his parliamentary majority to just two seats.
 Euro zone sources said there was an agreement in principle
to trigger aid when the joint mission completes its work --
perhaps in days -- and the aid would not be just for the banks.
 Ireland has said the bill for cleaning up its banks could
top 50 billion euros but investors fear the final figure could
be even higher given rising residential mortgage arrears,
deposit outflows and higher funding costs.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, has said it stands ready to help. Prime Minister
David Cameron told parliament London could provide bilateral
assistance or join an EU mechanism, or both.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 09:28AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Raw materials present EU with trade, growth conundrum"," * EU struggling to shape policy on raw materials
 * Scarcity of materials threatens to depress EU growth

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - To fuel its economic recovery,
Europe needs raw materials. But its efforts to acquire
them are being frustrated by a mistrust of foreign supplies and
internal disagreement over what a raw material is.
 The European Union, the world's largest trading zone, has
complained for years about non-EU countries restricting the
export of essential materials used by European manufacturers to
make products such as steel, semiconductors and light bulbs.
 It has even taken China, one of the world's largest raw
materials exporters, to the World Trade Organization for
inflating the cost of materials via steep export taxes, a
challenge that has been joined by the United States and Mexico.
 But its efforts have done little to increase access to the
ingredients it needs, and now China is threatening an even more
restrictive policy, with plans for ceilings on exports of rare
earths -- sought-after raw materials used in most high-tech
products and a driver of the global economy.
 The situation has prompted European policymakers and
industry to try to come up with measures that will encourage
countries to be more open with their resources. But it has also
led to a debate about what exactly constitutes a raw material,
and how much the EU should be making or buying from abroad.
 The EU now finds itself trying to create a market mechanism
that will strike a balance between encouraging foreign suppliers
to keep their exports coming, while at the same time stopping
those same suppliers from flooding the EU market. 
 Simultaneously, the EU is trying to agree a clear definition
of those raw materials it has a strategic interest in importing.
 For EU industry, it has become a difficult juggling act.
 ""If we remove tariffs or demand an end to China's export
restrictions we run the risk of being flooded by these
commodities again, endangering what is left of EU production,""
said Ines Van Lierde, secretary-general of EuroAlliages, an
industry group that represents Europe's iron alloy producers.
 Rising raw material prices depress profit margins for
EU-based companies, which can lead to factory closures, lay offs
and the relocation of industry to cheaper locations where the
supply of raw materials is plentiful, such as China.
 
 DEFINING RAW MATERIALS
 One conundrum for the EU is defining strategically important
raw materials so that it has clarity on which products its wants
greater access to and can then work on increasing the supply.
 The European Commission, the EU's executive, this summer
defined 14 raw materials as being critical to the EU economy,
among them chemical elements, rare earths and platinum metals.
 But the list did not address the profit squeeze experienced
by EU firms that rely on vast supplies of heavy goods such as
iron ore and copper, triggering the need for other initiatives.
 Earlier this year, Italy, encouraged by its influential
manufacturing sector, urged Europe to provide a leg-up for
European production by suspending import tariffs on an entirely
different set of critical raw materials -- including pig iron,
silicon, cow hides and silk thread.
 Backed by countries including Germany, that wishlist quickly
swelled to 92 products, many of them intermediate products such
as leather, cotton fabric and chemical compounds -- before it
was put on ice because the issue was becoming too complicated.
 ""We couldn't agree on what should be the definition of a raw
material. For some of us it's broader than what you dig out of
the earth, and for others it's very narrowly defined,"" an EU
diplomat told Reuters. ""So we are not expecting this
(Italian-led) initiative to go ahead any time soon.""
 Tariff suspensions along the lines of the Italian plan are
still possible, EU diplomats say, but they may have to travel
through the slow-moving channels of EU customs legislation,
meaning their impact on raw material imports will be delayed.
 In the interim, an EU raw materials strategy to be unveiled
this year, built on the narrow 14-product list, is likely to
address looming shortages by calling for more efficient
recycling and tighter controls on valuable metals and minerals
that leave the EU in the form of scrap electronics and cars.
 But EU controls on scrap exports will call into question the
bloc's publicly stated support for free trade. And recycling is
not sufficient to meet demand, meaning the EU still has a
pressing need to get hold of foreign raw materials at low cost.
 
 FOREIGN SUPPLIES
 Reflecting that need, a new EU trade policy unveiled this
month threatens legal action against non-EU suppliers who
restrict exports of critical goods.
 Yet such threats are a blunt instrument and face strong
opposition: even if the EU could agree internally on what raw
materials supplies it should focus on acquiring, any concerted
action is likely to prompt a row with trading partners.
 For some countries -- Russia in particular -- export tariffs
represent an important source of income and an attack on them
would be a direct threat to national budget policy.
 Powerful emerging economies intent on pushing their exports
up the value chain may also balk at pressure to supply the EU
with raw commodities that they themselves want to use.
 China -- the most obvious target of the EU's newly assertive
approach -- insists its export restrictions reflect concerns for
diminishing resources and the environment, not protectionism.
 An alternative is for the EU to increase protection of its
own struggling EU raw materials' producers, rather than relying
so heavily on cheaper foreign imports. But that risks increasing
inefficiencies, potentially hurting powerful producers such as
Germany, and is unlikely to go unchallenged.
 For the EU, the raw materials puzzle is a long way from
being unlocked.

 * Talks focus on agriculture
 * EU says some requirements not negotiable
(Adds background)
 KIEV, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Negotiations on a free trade
agreement between the European Union and Ukraine could be
concluded next year if there is ""political will"", the bloc's
ambassador to Ukraine said on Thursday.
 Trade turnover between the EU and the former Soviet nation
peaked at $40 billion in 2008 before falling to $22 billion last
year due to the global downturn. The two have been discussing a
free trade deal since early 2008.
 ""An EU-Ukraine free trade agreement could be wrapped up in
terms of negotiations by next summer if the political will
exists,"" EU Ambassador Jose Manuel Pinto Teixeira told
reporters. ""We have a positive expectation.""
Ukraine's top trade negotiator told Reuters this month it was
too early to talk about a concrete date as a number of issues,
mostly in the agricultural sector, had yet to be resolved.
[ID:nLDE6AE0H2]
 
 TENSE TALKS
 Teixeira said the talks had gained momentum within the past
month.
 ""We are negotiating an agreement but this agreement has some
standard requirements that are not negotiable,"" he said.
 Ukraine's main exports to the EU are agricultural products,
energy, chemicals, iron, and steel. EU exports to Ukraine are
mostly machinery, transport equipment, chemicals, textiles and
clothing, as well as agricultural products.
 With a free trade deal that would mean dropping most import
duties on both sides, Ukraine hopes to boost sales of its
agricultural goods and attract investment into sectors such as
pig farming.
 On the other hand, it wants to protect its car industry by
retaining import duties on European vehicles. Europe, in its
turn, protects its own farmers by requirements such as minimum
entry prices which would erase Ukraine's competitive advantages.
 Europe also insists on respect for its trademarks such as
champagne and cognac -- which are treated as generic product
names in many ex-Soviet nations.
 To reach an agreement, both sides must drop duties on at
least 95 percent of traded goods.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 08:44AM ET</span>",Credit hurdles remain hindrance to Iran oil trade," * Banks remain reluctant to finance Iranian oil trade
 * Iranian crude supplies to IEA members fall in August
 * Iran says drop in trade with China, Japan, only temporary
 
 By Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Oil trade with Iran remains more
difficult following tougher sanctions against the Islamic
Republic, industry sources said, despite a message from the
European Union that such operations are legal.
 Saras, an Italian oil refiner, said last week that
transactions with Iran have become more challenging as banks are
reluctant to get involved. Other European oil companies have
made similar remarks privately.
 ""The banking side is the tough part. It is very tough. It
has to be banks that haven't got any kind of interests in the
United States,"" said an Iranian crude oil customer in Europe.
 Iran is a major oil exporter and its production is equal to
about 4.2 percent of daily world demand. The amount of Iranian
crude sold to countries that are members of the International
Energy Agency declined by 22 percent in August.
 The financing hurdle follows a host of sanctions on Iran
over its nuclear work passed this year by the United Nations,
European Union and the United States. Tehran denies the West's
charge that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons.
 The European Union said its sanctions against Iran came
into force on Oct. 27 and were not intended to restrict Iranian
oil dealings. But some traders say they remain reluctant to
touch Iranian crude.
 ""I didn't hear from any single bank that following
clarifications from the EU they are happy to resume business,""
said an oil trader in the Mediterranean.
 The EU also said financial transfers of as little as 40,000
euros ($55,520) or more require authorisation, a move which
analysts said will put a heavy bureaucratic burden on any
national export control authority.

 TRADE FINANCE
 Much of all the world's oil trade is done with the help of
bank funding as banks' cost of capital is lower than that of oil
companies and trading houses.
 The United States has not bought Iranian crude since 1995 as
part of its unilateral sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
Scrutiny by the U.S. remains a deterrent to oil trade with Iran,
in the view of some traders.
 ""They (the U.S.) have tortured us for weeks, long after we
abandoned everything,"" said a trader with a company that used to
deal with Iranian oil, referring to U.S. requests for paperwork
on the transactions. ""I have a feeling that no one cares about
what the EU thinks.""
 ""The Russian customs would not blink a single time if I
decided to resume Iranian business. Frankly, everything depends
on the U.S.,"" said a Russian trader.
 Asia buys most of Iran's oil and sizeable imports flow to
Europe. Companies are still finding ways to buy Iranian oil.
 Royal Dutch Shell and some Italian and Spanish refiners buy
Iranian barrels with finance coming from Chinese and Italian
banks, traders have said.
 IEA data shows the amount of Iranian crude supplied to its
member-countries fell in August to 1.45 million barrels per day
(bpd) from 1.87 million bpd in July. August's total is still
higher than the 1.28 million bpd shipped a year earlier.
 The IEA represents 28 industrialised countries. Its data
excludes big importers of Iranian oil such as China and India,
which are not IEA members.
 Iran has maintained that sanctions will not damage its
economy.
 Iran's OPEC representative Mohammad Ali Khatibi was quoted
as saying on Oct. 29 that Iran's oil trade with China and Japan
had fallen only temporarily, and crude importers could not avoid
buying from Iran.

 * Proposal to back rare earth operations in Greenland
(Adds detail, background, quotes)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A shortage of raw materials has
become a systemic risk for the global economy, the European
Union trade chief Karel De Gucht said on Thursday.
 Speaking to the European Parliament during a hearing on raw
materials, De Gucht said no country possessed all the raw
materials it needed.
 ""Everybody is affected as this is a systemic risk,"" he said.
""We need to find a global solution, but there is no quick fix.""
 Shortages of raw materials -- particularly of rare earth
minerals used in high-tech and defence production -- have sent
jitters around the world since Chinese restricted their export.
China controls more than 90 percent of current global rare earth
production.
 De Gucht has sent letters to numerous Chinese ministers
voicing EU concerns and the issue of securing steady supplies
has become a key topic in EU-U.S. dialogue, he said.
 Beyond rare earths, the EU is suffering shortages of cotton
and wood, he said. The EU has been pressing India to drop export
limits on cotton and Russian export taxes on timber.
 ""Cotton is a very important raw material and there are more
and more problems on that. The same applies for wood,"" De Gucht
said.
 To lessen Europe's dependence on foreign raw materials the
EU should reopen existing mines and back rare earth operations
in Greenland, a landmass that could harbour as much as 25
percent of the world's rare earth supplies, he said.
 Europe should focus on local extraction and forge better
diplomatic ties with countries with large natural resource
deposits, deputies and industry representatives participating in
the hearing said.
 The 27-nation bloc should also improve its recycling
technologies and stop millions of tonnes of raw materials
leaving Europe each year in the form of scrap electronics and
cars, deputies said.

 * Rally seen as driven by speculators, event risk looms
 * Spain bond auction goes smoothly but yields higher
 * Stocks, higher-yielding currencies gain

(Adds quote, updates prices)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Thursday as
optimism that Ireland's debt crisis may be easing fuelled
speculative buying, but the move was seen as undermined by
peripheral risks elsewhere and position-squaring into the
year-end.
 The dollar was broadly softer after subdued U.S. inflation
data on Wednesday reinforced the U.S. Federal Reserve's case for
monetary easing.
 ""We view this as a short-term speculative rally in the euro,
driven by weaker U.S. CPI and some optimism for Ireland as the
IMF and EU arrive in Dublin for talks,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 ""There are other factors at play for the dollar. Year-end
flows should be supportive as profit-taking versus emerging
currencies fuels repatriation,"" he said.
 Uncertainty about the Irish crisis, which has also supported
the dollar recently, looked to be loosening its grip on markets
after Dublin agreed to work with a European Union-International
Monetary Fund mission on urgent steps to shore up its shattered
banking sector.
 The cost of insuring Irish debt against default fell as
investors grew increasingly confident that a deal would be
reached.
 The euro hit a session high of $1.3664 to the dollar. As of
1225 GMT, it was up 0.9 percent on the day at $1.3645. The
single currency had hit a seven-week low of $1.3446 on Tuesday.
 Traders said stop-losses were triggered on the break of
Ichimoku resistance at $1.3630. The next resistance was seen at
$1.3765, the 38.2 percent retracement of this month's fall.
""IMF involvement points powerfully towards funding support
for Ireland, probably to ring-fence the banks, which reduces
risks to some extent,"" said Ray Farris, currency strategist at
Credit Suisse.
 ""But this is not a silver bullet for Ireland. The Irish
budget and election are its next event risks,"" he said.
 The euro is still down some 5 percent from a 10-month high
above $1.4280 set on Nov. 4.
 Some analysts saying that even if there a quick
resolution is reached over Ireland, players would fret about
other peripheral euro zone economies and their debt levels, with
Portugal thought to be in the market's sights.
 A Spanish bond auction passed relatively smoothly, as it
sold 3.7 billion euros worth of 10 and 30-year bonds, albeit at
higher yields. Against the yen, the euro rose 1.0 percent to
113.82 yen.
 
 RISK-ON
 Investors' risk appetite drove U.S. stock futures up 1.1
percent, and higher-yielding currencies also gained. The
Australian dollar rose 1 percent to $0.9900, up from this week's
low around $0.9726.
 ""It is a risk-on environment today, and we are seeing an
outperformance of riskier assets,"" said Christian Lawrence,
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 Subsequently, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, dropped 0.8
percent to 78.438, off Tuesday's seven-week high of 79.461.
 Data on Wednesday showed U.S. core consumer inflation rose
0.6 percent from a year ago, the smallest increase since records
started in 1957 and backing up the case for the Fed to deliver
all of its $600 billion of quantitative easing.
 Traders also say hedge funds are likely to close dollar
short positions ahead of their book-closing later in the year.
 The dollar, which gained 4 percent from a 15-year low to a
high of 83.60 yen this month, held at 83.20 yen.

 (Recasts with minister's comments)
 By Lorraine Turner and Carmel Crimmins
 DUBLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ireland insisted on Thursday its
low rate of corporation tax was ""non-negotiable"" as it discusses
an aid package worth tens of billions of euros from European
partners and the IMF for its shattered banks.
 Eurozone neighbours are pressing Ireland to raise the 12.5
percent corporation tax rate as part of negotiations for a
rescue package but Dublin is resisting, arguing it is crucial
for foreign investment.
 But Irish Deputy Prime Minister Mary Coughlan told parliament
the corporate tax rate was ""non-negotiable"".
 European Minister Dick Roche echoed that comment, saying
that, ""it is certainly not up for negotiation.""
 ""There has been some very unhelpful chatter in the
background in the last few days about our corporation profit
tax. Where would be the sense of destroying one of the great
drivers of growth?"" he told BBC television.
 Britain and Germany have long viewed low Irish taxes as a
form of unfair competition and the finance ministers of Austria
and France said the corporation tax may have to be raised as
part of any deal.
 Officials from the European Commission, the European Central
Bank and the International Monetary Fund visited Dublin on
Thursday for talks on a possible rescue package.
 ""We're talking about a very substantial loan for sure --
tens of billions, yes,"" Central Bank Governor Patrick Honohan
told state broadcaster RTE, acknowledging substantial outflows
of funds from the Irish banking sector since April.
 The government said discussions would run into next week and
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told parliament Dublin was not
yet at the point of requesting a loan.
 What was under discussion was ""substantial contingency
capital to be made available to back Ireland"".
 He insisted the IMF and EU would not have any input into
Ireland's budgetary measures, even though EU rules stipulate
that assistance programmes can only be granted to governments
that sign a strict fiscal conditionality agreement.
 In an effort to calm savers, Lenihan said the government was
extending an unlimited guarantee for depositors until the end of
next year, six months longer than previously announced.
 Irish banks have suffered withdrawals from corporate clients
and Honohan said ""a steady drain of deposits"" had necessitated
exceptional funding from the Irish central bank on top of ECB
liquidity assistance.
 After 10 days of losses, European stock and bond markets
and the euro rebounded on expectations Ireland would become the
second euro zone country after Greece to receive a bailout to
cope with high debts and deficits.
 Dublin's borrowing costs have gone through the roof since
late October as concerns about the banks' swelling liabilities
and German-driven EU moves to create a system for restructuring
stricken euro zone states' debts unsettled investors.
 Irish bond spreads over German Bunds narrowed and the cost
of insuring Irish, Portuguese and Greek debt against default
fell as markets anticipated a likely rescue.
 Ratings agency Fitch, which has Ireland on A-plus with a
negative outlook, said it would review that credit rating in the
light of any IMF-EU package, and said there was ""considerable
uncertainty"" about possible additional losses in the banking
system, including from residential mortgage lending.
 Spain found solid demand for 3.6 billion euros in 10- and
30-year bonds at an auction but had to pay a higher price than
two months ago, as did fellow euro zone struggler Portugal,
which sold treasury bills on Wednesday.
 That helped dampen fears of contagion from Ireland to other
highly-indebted euro zone members.
 
 NIGHTMARES
 The chief executive of Italy's biggest bank, Federico
Ghizzoni of UniCredit, said he had ""nightmares"" over the euro
zone debt crisis and was worried about Europe's ability to
address sovereign debt issues urgently.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet voiced
concern at the danger of banks growing dependent on the ECB's
emergency liquidity measures as conditions normalise.
 Irish banks, largely shut out of market lending due to
concerns about their solvency, are almost entirely reliant on
ECB funding, which reached 130 billion euros by end-October,
plus an extra 35 billion euros from the Irish central bank.
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 Lenihan is due to detail a four-year, 15 billion euros
budget-cutting plan next week and the government will put a 2011
austerity budget to parliament on Dec. 7.
 Greece pledged to raise its Value Added Tax, freeze pensions
and cut government waste further in 2011 to meet the terms of
its EU/IMF bailout after admitting it will miss this year's
deficit reduction target.
 Some analysts said the Irish government was playing for time
to avoid applying for aid before a key Nov. 25 by-election that
could reduce its parliamentary majority to just two seats.
 Ireland has said the bill for cleaning up its banks could
top 50 billion euros but investors fear the final figure could
be even higher given rising residential mortgage arrears,
deposit outflows and higher funding costs.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, has said it stands ready to help. Prime Minister
David Cameron told parliament London could provide bilateral
assistance or join an EU mechanism, or both.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Global stocks rebounded on
Thursday, while the euro recovered ground against the dollar on
optimism that Ireland may soon see a solution to the debt
problems which have recently dogged financial market sentiment.
 Uncertainty about the Irish crisis ebbed after Dublin agreed
to work with a European Union-IMF mission on steps to shore up
its shattered banking sector, sending the euro up as much as 1
percent against the dollar.
 But analysts were sceptical any rebound in risk appetite
would be sustained, with fiscal problems in Ireland and other
peripheral euro zone countries such as Portugal still severe and
many investors inclined to cut risk exposure before year-end.
 ""It's absolutely vital for the authorities to take proactive
steps in order to try to resolve this crisis as soon as
possible. The market should see some relief in relation to
that,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Wealth. 
The MSCI world equity index was up nearly 1 percent after
touching a one-month low the previous day. European shares
rose 1.2 percent, with automakers surging after General Motors
pulled off the biggest initial public offering in U.S. history
, and U.S. futures pointed to a strong Wall Street open.
 The gains came after Japan's Nikkei jumped more than 2
percent to close above 10,000 for the first time since late
June, while China shares also rose. Emerging stocks were up 1.3
percent.
 The euro rose 1 percent against the dollar to $1.3624. The
dollar fell 0.8 percent against a basket of currencies.
 The dollar was also softer after subdued U.S. inflation data
reinforced the Federal Reserve's argument for injecting extra
stimulus into the economy via quantitative easing.
 German bund futures fell 77 ticks to 127.68, while Irish
bond yields fell, narrowing the spread over their German
counterparts. The cost of insuring against default on Irish,
Portuguese and Greek debt also dipped.
 
 REBOUND MAY BE SHORT-LIVED
 But analysts were unconvinced the rally in the euro and
equities would last.
 ""We view this as a short-term speculative rally in the euro,
driven by weaker U.S. CPI and some optimism for Ireland as the
IMF and EU arrive in Dublin for talks,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 Concerns Chinese economic growth may slow if the country
tightens monetary policy to dampen inflation may also return to
pressure equity markets, commodities and riskier currencies,
with the Australian dollar particularly vulnerable.
 Commodity prices rebounded, with U.S. crude oil rising close
to $82 per barrel and retracing part of a four-session drop,
while prices of copper rose around 1.5 percent and gold around
1.6 percent.
 For now, remarks by an academic advisor to the People's Bank
of China, Zhou Qiren, helped temper some of the speculation
about a rise in interest rates as he said China should not rely
solely on rate hikes to curb inflation.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 06:52AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Eurozone rescue row doesn't shake German view," *Germans deflect blame for bond sell-off
 *Insist private investors must share risk
 *Merkel seen defending principles
 By Stephen Brown and Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Germany has grown inured to
criticism over its role in Europe's woes and, seeing itself
vindicated by events, is unlikely now to give up its insistence
private investors accept risk in future euro zone crises.
 When Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday
Germany was not to blame for the euro zone's problems and would
stick to its proposal for a new crisis mechanism, he was not so
much being defensive as saying what Germans find obvious.
 Greece, Ireland and some European Commission and European
Central Bank officials accuse Germany of causing a sell-off in
peripheral euro zone bonds by insisting, with French support,
that investors must in future share the sovereign default risk.
 ""Taken out of context there is obviously merit to the
Franco-German proposal. But the timing could not have been more
damaging,"" wrote Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Centre
for European Reform in Brussels.
 According to German logic, European Union leaders already
accepted at their October summit Berlin's proposal to replace
the European Financial Stability Facility, which was set up in
May and expires in mid-2013, with a new mechanism making private
holders of euro zone debt accept some exposure to risk.
 So when the same leaders like Greece's George Papandreou say
Germany could ""break backs"" and prompt bankruptcies by insisting
investors face the risk of default, or a haircut, the German
conclusion is that they are just playing to domestic audiences.
 Merkel said on Thursday she was ""completely convinced"" this
would happen. A day earlier, Sueddeutsche Zeitung wrote in an
editorial ""the chancellor should not sacrifice her principles"".
 ""The indebted countries are attacking their chief financier,
Germany, and the main attackers innuin the blame game are the
most indebted countries,"" said the newspaper.
 Apart from a few isolated editorials, though, the criticisms
have largely fallen on deaf ears in the German media.
 ""I'm not sure anyone in Germany is really taking a lot of
notice,"" said Gero Neugebauer, political scientist at Berlin's
Free University, when asked about the anti-German sentiment.
 
 BE WISE, NOT QUICK
 The response from Merkel has so far been characteristically
moderate despite the heated tone of criticism heaped on Germany.
 ""We have resisted the pressure at home and in Europe,"" she
told a party conference this week, where she was reelected by 90
percent of delegates as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU)
despite a decline in popularity since she won a second election
in 2009.
 ""We made clear that a good European is not always the one
who acts quickly, but the one who acts wisely,"" said Merkel, who
was pilloried this year for dragging her feet on a Greek rescue
package as she demanded greater fiscal sacrifices from Athens.
 Critics say her delays pushed up Greece's borrowing costs
until the crisis threatened to engulf other southern European
countries and she ceded in May -- signing up to a much bigger
bailout mechanism to stabilise the common currency days later.
 Germany argues the austerity measures it insisted upon for
Greece -- now being painfully implemented -- led to a rethink of
budget discipline across Europe that helped underpin the euro.
 Six months later, fiscally-disciplined German taxpayers'
resentment at having to bankroll the rescue of more profligate
EU partners has been tempered by Germany's recovery, though this
in turn causes mutterings abroad about its reliance on exports.
 Germany is unapologetic, with Merkel taking out a newspaper
advert this week thanking citizens for making Germany ""the
country that came through the world economic crisis best"".
 This is not intended to transmit any disconnect from the
euro zone's problems, with Merkel repeating this week that the
fate of the joint currency is of ""intrinsic interest"" to her
country and that ""if the euro fails, Europe fails"".
 
 STICKING TO THEIR GUNS
 Officials in Berlin say the crisis mechanism must be settled
now, before deficits climb even higher.
 ""This step is very important and we have to stick to it,""
said Michael Meister, a finance expert and senior member of
parliament for Merkel's CDU.
 One official compared Germany's current role in Europe's
finances to the U.S. role in global military affairs, saying
that, like Washington, Germany has to exercise leadership, even
at the cost of being liked.
 ""Germans feel like the paymaster for the EU and have a sense
of entitlement,"" said Neugebauer, adding that Merkel ""tends to
act like a schoolmistress at times"".
 Merkel also has a very compelling reason for taking a hard
line on euro zone crisis management in the form of a pending
decision from Germany's constitutional court on whether the
existing bailout mechanism is legal. A ""no"" would block aid and
probably provoke an even deeper crisis in Europe.
 But, like the foreign leaders criticising her, Merkel also
plays to her domestic audience, mindful of the six regional
elections she faces in Germany next year, said Neugebauer.
 While Germany would be the chief contributor to any bailout
for Ireland within a rescue scheme already agreed on by European
leaders, it can be difficult convincing the public the largesse
shown to deficit sinners like Greece should be repeated.
 ""I don't think Germany should help Ireland because it's all
so pointless,"" saidJoachim Bayer, a 53-year-old carpenter in
Berlin. ""We saw with Greece there was only bad blood and an ugly
back and forth after we helped out. Why bother?""

 * Says fee structures commonplace and ""common sense""

 By Andrew Macdonald
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - German property fund manager IVG
Immobilien doubts a legal row over investment advice by Deutsche
Bank for its fund that part-owns London's ""Gherkin"" tower will
spark a wave of copycat actions.
 A German court ruled in late October that Deutsche Bank had
not met its duty to an investor by failing to draw his attention
to fees it would receive for recommending the IVG-managed
Euroselect 14 fund, in an IVG prospectus.
 The fund owns half of the ""Gherkin"" office tower in London's
City financial district.
 Following the court's ruling, up to 10 other investors in
the Euroselect 14 fund have contacted German law firm CLLB to
advise them on whether they also received poor advice related to
the product, according to media reports. It is not known whether
Deutsche Bank advised these investors.
 ""Most of these things are not tips of the iceberg, they are
just single cases that don't lead to a general change of the
business ... I don't see that this will become a major issue,""
Martin Praum, IVG's head of investor relations, said late on
Wednesday.
 Euroselect 14 and investment bank Evans Randall bought the
""Gherkin"", a standout feature of London's skyline, for 600
million pounds ($953 million) in 2007.
 IVG's funds business, which focuses on high-quality office
properties in big European cities, has about 12.7 billion euros
($17.4 billion) of assets under management.
 Praum said IVG's prospectuses were approved by financial
regulators.
 Fees in IVG's funds for private investors were charged up
front, while in those for institutional investors were recurring
on an annual basis, he said.
 ""Overall, I think in the markets that's common sense, I
would say ... An informed investor would know,"" he said.
 ""I'm totally surprised that people make such a big fuss
about that, given the number of closed-end funds in Germany,
which all work the same way.
 Besides Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank was the other
distribution agent for Euroselect 14.
 In accepting the Wuppertal regional court's decision,
Deutsche Bank agreed to repay the investor his original
investment of 65,000 pounds, plus interest.

 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday as
optimism that Ireland's debt crisis may be easing fuelled
speculative buying, but the rally was seen undermined by
peripheral risks elsewhere and position squaring into year-end.

 The euro stood at $1.3630, up around 0.8 percent on the day

 DOLLAR INDEX FALLS
 U.S. core consumer inflation climbed 0.6 percent from a year
ago, the smallest increase since records started in 1957 and
arguing in favour of the Fed delivering all of its $600 billion
of quantitative easing. Stronger data had fuelled doubts it
would need to follow through on the entire programme.
 The dollar, which gained 4 percent from a 15-year low to a
high of 83.60 yen this month, held at 83.20 yen.
 Traders also say hedge funds are likely to close dollar
short positions ahead of their book-closing later in the year.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, dropped 0.7 percent to
78.520, off Tuesday's seven-week high of 79.461.
 The softer U.S. currency helped the Australian dollar to
rise 1 percent on the day to around $0.9900, up from this week's

 * Trend shows slowdown in exports, GDP growth
 * Emerging markets in Asia, Latin America drive exports
 * OECD sees 2011 Swiss GDP growth of 2.2 percent
 
 ZURICH, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Swiss exports rose in October
despite the strong franc as Asian consumers and companies kept
buying Swiss watches and machines, data showed on Thursday.
The resilience of exports is fuelling the view that the
Alpine economy is heading for only a moderate slowdown following
this year's brisk recovery.
 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) forecast Swiss economic growth of 2.2 percent for 2011 in
a report on Thursday, down from an estimated 2.7 percent this
year, but it warned that a further surge in the franc posed a
risk to the export-dependent economy.
 In October, Swiss exports rose 6.2 percent from September
when adjusted for price swings and seasonal effects, the Swiss
Customs Office said. They rose 6.8 percent on the year in real
terms and the trade surplus widened to 2.1 billion francs.
 Economists said exports were holding up surprisingly well
given the strong currency, which is still not far off record
levels against the euro and the dollar.
 ""For now we are still not seeing a large negative impact of
the strong Swiss franc,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Fabian
Heller.
 ""A lot is dependent on economic growth in Asia and also in
the traditional importing countries in Europe, such as Germany,
where we are seeing positive economic growth,"" he said.
 Exports to Asia rose some 9 percent in October in nominal
terms and the Swiss sold nearly 7 percent more in Latin America.
 Central bank data show that in both regions the franc has
risen against a basket of currencies in trade-weighted terms in
recent months though it is still below last year's levels.
 Last week, Swiss luxury watchmaker Richemont reported
soaring profits on buoyant demand for top-of-the-range watches
and jewellery in Asia and the Americas.
 ""The watch and the metals industry are still topping the
growth ranking,"" the customs office said on Thursday.
 Exports to Germany -- Switzerland's single most important
trading partner -- rose some 5 percent in October, but sales to
Europe stagnated overall, suggesting a hit from the strong
franc.
 In general, the trend pointed towards slowing exports and an
overall economic cooling, Sarasin analyst Jan Poser said.
 ""Overall, it looks as if we get a soft landing, but it's a
landing after all. Such positive figures are white noise in an
overall downward trend.
 The ZEW investor sentiment index showed on Thursday that a
growing majority of analysts expect the economy to cool. But the
November survey also indicated that more economists thought the
economic situation was still improving.
 The Swiss National Bank expects the economy to slow markedly
next year as the franc takes its toll.
 Markets have taken the central bank's outlook as a sign that
it is in no rush to increase borrowing costs, only pricing in a
significant chance of a rate hike in September 2011.
 The OECD said that the central bank would have to start
raising rates gradually from 2011 onwards in order to prevent
inflationary pressures from building up.

 * Keeps full-year loss forecast steady at $75-85 million
 * Says freight rates remained low in Q3
 
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Weak rates for product tanker
shipping knocked Denmark's Torm A/S to losses for the third
quarter, in line with a warning from the firm earlier this
month, as fleet growth and slack demand held rates down.
 ""Market conditions were difficult in the third quarter and
the rates for product tankers continue to be weak as the signs
of recovery seen during the summer months have not materialised
into better rates,"" Chief Executive Jacob Meldgaard said in a
statement.
 Torm, which operates around 140 vessels and is the world's
biggest listed player in the product tanker business, had warned
on Nov. 4 that rates had remained weak and that it expected a
2010 pretax loss in a range of $75 million to $85 million -- a
forecast that it repeated on Thursday.
 Product tankers carry refined oil products, such as gasoline,
jet fuel, naphtha and diesel oil.
 Third-quarter pretax losses amounted to $27 million against
a profit of $4 million in the same quarter last year, Torm said.
 ""The result in (the third quarter of) 2010 is not
satisfactory and slightly below expectations,"" Torm said in the
statement.
 Across segments freight rates were hit by ample tonnage
supply, absence of general arbitrage opportunities and limited
use of vessels for floating storage, said Torm, which is also a
player in the dry bulk market.
 A few positive market signs seen during the summer, driven
by selective arbitrage opportunities and refinery disruptions in
South America, were not sufficient to support a freight rate
improvement in the third quarter, the company said.
 Medium-range (MR) product tanker freight rates continued to
be under pressure due to low western demand for refined
products, Torm said.
 Shares in Torm traded up 0.5 percent at 35.08 crowns by 1277
GMT, roughly matching a 0.3 percent rise in the Copenhagen
bourse.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 05:16AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Myanmar's economy and investment," Nov 18 (Reuters) - Military-ruled Myanmar, one of the
world's most isolated states, appears to be taking steps to
attract more investment after a new government was formed
following the first election in 20 years on Nov. 7. 
 The resource-rich country has been hurt by decades of
economic mismanagement and deep-rooted corruption. Western
sanctions in place because of the regime's poor human rights
record have squeezed investment and Myanmar has no access to
loans from major financial institutions. 
 Analysts say it is possible sanctions could be reviewed
when a new government is formed and if Nobel laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, who was released from house arrest on Nov. 13, leads
a campaign to have them scrapped. [ID:nSGE6AD02C]	
 Following are details about Myanmar's economy, trade and
investment. 
 
 ECONOMY 
 Official statistics from Myanmar's secretive military
government are notoriously unreliable and it claims to have
achieved growth of between 10-13 percent annually from
2004-2009. Economists believe this is exaggerated. The Asian
Development Bank estimates growth of 7 percent in 2006, 5.5
percent in 2007, 3.6 percent in 2008 and 4.4 percent last year.	
 The ADB said exports surged 47 percent in 2006 before
declining annually, with export growth of 4.4 percent last year.	
 Myanmar was not affected by the global economic crisis
because of its limited trade and financial links with the
West. However, the devastating Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which
claimed as many as 140,000 lives, did major damage to its rice
fields.	
 Agriculture forms the backbone of Myanmar's economy,
accounting for about 40 percent of GDP and employing over 50
percent of the workforce. 
 
 TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
 Myanmar's biggest trade partners are its immediate
neighbours and other Asian countries. Forty-two percent of its
exports go to Thailand, 21 percent to China, 13 percent to
India and 9 percent to Singapore. Five percent of its exports
go to Africa. 
 According to government data, China has pumped $8.17
billion into Myanmar in the current fiscal year, accounting
for two thirds its total investment over the past two decades.
Energy projects formed the bulk of the investment, with $5
billion in hydropower and $2.15 billion in the oil and gas
sector. 
 Total foreign direct investment (FDI) for the 2009-10
fiscal year was almost $315 million compared to nearly $985
million a year earlier, although independent economists
dispute this data.	
 
 EXPORTS 
 Gas is by far Myanmar's biggest and most lucrative
resource for export and most of it is consumed by Thailand.
When construction of a huge pipeline from the Bay of Bengal to
China's southwestern Yunnan province is complete, gas and oil
exports are expected to surge. 
 Teak and hardwood is also a major export area, with China
its main customer, as are garments, although the sector has
been hard hit in recent years by regional competition. 
 Agriculture and commodities like beans and pulses, fish
and seafood are lucrative areas for Myanmar. Rice is seen as
an area with huge potential if the government carries out
much-needed reforms to its rice sector. 
 Under British colonial rule, Myanmar was the world's
biggest rice exporter and shipped 3.4 million tonnes in 1934.
It shipped 1.09 million tonnes in 2009, up from 547,000 tonnes
in 2008. Industry officials say Myanmar is planning to become
a major rice exporter in the next few years. [ID:nSGE67S00J] 
 
 PRIVATISATION DRIVE 
 Private sector reforms have accelerated over the last year
in Myanmar with the selloff of about 300 state assets, from
real estate, gas stations and toll roads to ports, shipping
companies and an airline. [ID:nSGE68508V] 
 The privatisation process was seen as a move to strengthen
the hand of businessmen with close ties to the ruling junta.
The sales were highly opaque and many were not advertised to
ensure only cronies of the military took part in the bidding
process.	
 Four new banks set up this year are owned by close allies
of the generals. Banking in Myanmar is seen as a largely
dysfunctional sector and the private sector's share of credit
has fallen 25 percent in the last five years. [ID:nSGE68D0FB]	
 
 INVESTMENT POTENTIAL? 
 The reclusive junta has formed the Myanmar's Business
Council to promote investment opportunities. It says ""Myanmar
is not a 'maybe market', it will be a 'must have' market"". It
has tried this before, with limited success. 
 It is seeking to attract investment in its energy sector,
promoting its offshore oil and gas reserves and potential for
hydropower and downstream industries. It is also pushing its
tourism potential and is promoting its culture, landscape,
beaches, lakes rivers and mountains as magnets for visitors.	
 Foreigners, including Western companies held back by
sanctions, are showing increased interest in investing in
Myanmar, particularly in its telecommunications sector and in
construction materials [ID:nSGE6A205U]. 
 However, the country remains an unknown quantity.
Corruption and cronyism are rife and regulation is a grey
area. Economists say the government's fiscal policies are
destructive to the country's prospects and the economy is
unbalanced and unstable. While investment consultants believe
the country has huge potential, they also warn of massive
risks.

 * Must reform education system, increase immigration
 * Disposable incomes to rise, boosting consumer demand
 
 PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Germany's export-driven economy
will reach pre-crisis levels in 2011 but Berlin must implement
reforms to achieve better balanced growth, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Thursday.
 The OECD said Europe's largest economy would grow by 3.5
percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, driven by an upturn
in global trade and bolstered by rising consumer demand as
disposable incomes rise sharply.
 But with the current account surplus set to rise to around 6
percent of GDP in 2011, economic growth remains imbalanced.
 ""A more balanced growth outcome could be achieved by
implementing structural reforms that would raise domestic
investment spending,"" the OECD said in its twice-yearly Economic
Outlook, advising Berlin to ease regulation in the services
sector.
 Germany has come under fire during this year's euro zone
debt crisis, accused of undermining the fiscal stability of its
single currency partners with policies that depress spending at
home and undercut competitors on export markets abroad.
 However, private consumption has picked up thanks to a
resilient labour market that saw unemployment fall to an 18-year
low in October. [ID:nLDE69R0TZ]
 ""As the unemployment rate will fall further ...and working
hours continue to normalise, wages per employee are likely to
rise substantially,"" the OECD said.
 ""As inflationary pressures are projected to remain moderate,
real disposable incomes are set to increase markedly, supporting
private consumption spending.""
 The OECD also said that, in view of an ageing population and
a lack of skilled labour, Berlin should reform the education
system and increase high-skilled immigration.
 The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce says the country
lacks about 400,000 skilled workers and should take in more from
abroad. Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet, however, is divided
over whether to relax rules on immigration. [ID:nLDE69I1OG]
 German public finances were set to improve in 2011, the OECD
said, and the headline deficit could even fall below the
European Union's target of 3 percent of GDP.
Budget consolidation would only have ""moderate adverse
growth effects"" in 2011, although the phasing out of the
government's infrastructure spending would weigh on construction
activity.

 By Karen Lema and Erik dela Cruz	
 MANILA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank
kept its policy rate steady at a record low on Thursday, as
the market had expected, and signalled rates were likely to
remain unchanged into 2011 as it also cut inflation forecasts.	
 The overnight borrowing rate was kept at 4.0 percent and
the lending rate at 6.0 percent. The Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas is one of few central banks in Asia that has not
raised rates since the global financial crisis.	
 The central bank said the peso was expected to remain
""broadly stable"" this year and the next, adding the focus of
monetary authorities was to minimise currency volatility amid
hefty capital inflows to the country and the region at large.	
 ""The Monetary Board also noted that the recent run-up in
asset prices, driven in part by strong foreign capital
inflows, does not appear to pose an immediate threat to
financial stability, although it continues to warrant careful
attention,"" the central bank said in a statement.	
 It said inflation remained manageable, but analysts expect
some pressure on commodity prices going forward from a
strengthening economy set to exceed a target of 5-6 percent
growth this year.	
 The annual inflation rate fell to a one-year low of 2.8
percent in October and is on track to come in at the lower
half of the government's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 percent
for the year.

Like its neighbours in Southeast Asia, the
Philippines has attracted growing flows of capital from
investors seeking returns in emerging markets, and there have
been concerns the funds could pump up asset prices, hurt
export competitiveness and complicate policymaking.	
 Central bank governor Amando Tetangco said on Wednesday
that tools other than blunt monetary policy would be used to
manage the impact on the currency and economy.
[ID:nSGE6AG058]
He also confirmed the central bank had allowed
forward maturing positions to mature rather than roll them
over -- which last week exacerbated a dollar shortage in the
local market and sent the peso from 2-1/2
year highs -- saying it could be repeated.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 05:08AM ET</span>",ECB should hold rates until 2012 -OECD," BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Austerity programmes and benign
inflation should encourage the European Central Bank to keep
interest rates at record lows through 2011 and continue to
provide extra monetary stimulus as required, the OECD said on
Thursday.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's
projection for the ECB's rate path, given in its twice-yearly
economic outlook, compares with a market consensus for a first
rate hike in the fourth quarter of next year.
 ""Provided that the recovery remains on track, and given the
weakness of inflation pressures and the expected fiscal
consolidation, monetary policy stimulus should largely remain in
place during 2011 and non-standard measures should continue to
be wound down as conditions allow,"" the OECD said.
 ""The main refinancing rate should gradually be increased
from the early part of 2012, unless higher than expected
inflationary pressures emerge.""
 The ECB's mandate is to keep inflation below, but close to 2
percent over the medium term. Consumer inflation in October was
1.9 percent year-on-year. The central bank's main refinancing
rate is at a record low of 1 percent.
 ""Inflation is likely to remain subdued in view of the
remaining slack, and inflation expectations are well anchored,""
the OECD said.
 It forecast inflation in the euro zone would be just 1.3
percent in 2011, down from 1.5 percent this year and slowing
further to 1.2 percent in 2012. 
 The 16 country euro zone is recovering from a depression but
quarterly growth is likely to have peaked in the second quarter
of 2010 at 1 percent and economists expect it will slow down to
0.2-0.3 percent towards the end of the year.
 ""The recovery is projected to continue, although growth is
expected to have moderated during the second half of the year
compared with the exceptionally strong pace in the second
quarter,"" the OECD said.
 It forecast that euro zone economic growth would be 1.7
percent in 2011, the same as in 2010. In 2012, euro zone growth
would be 2.0 percent, the OECD forecast.
 The report said that in 2011, consumption was likely to
accelerate due to low interest rates, higher household incomes
and rising confidence.
 It said private non-residential investment would increase as
growth prospects improve, but the high level of excess capacity
would constrain the pace of the recovery. 
 ""The necessary fiscal consolidation will be a drag on the
recovery. With the fading support from the weaker effective
exchange rate, contribution of exports to growth will be largely
determined by the strength of world demand.""

 * Fed, ECB should keep rates low until 2012
 * Capital flows fuelling currency tensions
 
 By Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Governments risk unleashing a
protectionist backlash if they act alone to address currency
imbalances, and cooperation among the Group of 20 countries is
key if the global economy is to stabilise, the OECD said on
Thursday.
 The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development said the G20 leading economies must play an
essential role as governments began the delicate task of winding
down exceptional measures that propped up their economies after
the global financial crisis.
 In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the OECD said its 33
wealthy, industrialised member governments should begin
tightening fiscal policy in the course of next year, unless the
economy takes an unexpected turn for the worse.
 ""Austerity measures are not at all political suicide
especially if they are well explained,"" OECD chief economist
Pier Carlo Padoan told Reuters in an interview.
 He said clearly spelling out fiscal plans and timetables
would inspire confidence from companies, and that voters would
be understanding of budget tightening if the burden was broadly
shared. 
 ""Governments have exhausted their short-term measures, so
they need to provide a credible long-term policy framework,""
Padoan said.
 
 MONETARY POLICY LOGJAM
 The OECD forecast in its Economic Outlook that world growth
will shift down a gear next year as the United States rebounds
less quickly than expected and growth in emerging countries
moderate.
 With governments' budgets strained, Padoan said that the
only major short-term measure still available for economic
stimulus was quantitative easing by central banks.
 ""Quantitative easing can work although we feel its impact
will have (a) decreasing return going forward,"" he said.
 He described the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to buy $600
billion dollars in government bonds as appropriate in the
absence of inflationary risk, and recommended that Japan
consider more quantitative easing.
 The OECD said the Federal Reserve should hold off on raising
interest rates until the recovery is firmly entrenched in the
middle of 2012 -- later than the market consensus.
 It said Japan should wait until inflation is clearly
positive before considering higher interest rates, which would
likely be beyond 2012.
 The OECD said the European Central Bank should not raise
interest rates before 2012 and that the Bank of England keep its
current policy stance until the middle of 2011.
 With developed economies awash with liquidity thanks to
rock-bottom interest rates, capital is flooding into faster
growing developing countries with higher rates of return,
driving up their currencies.
 In an editorial in the OECD Outlook, Padoan said unilateral
action to soften the impact of currency appreciation could be
counterproductive and ""risks triggering protectionist moves.""
 However, he said unilateral actions to contain a rising
currency reflected dissatisfaction with attempts to address the
problem with an international cooperative response.

banks is the only short-term stimulus measure still available to
major developed economies, and its effectiveness is diminishing,
OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan said.
 ""Quantitative easing can work although we feel its impact
will have (a) decreasing return going forward,"" he told Reuters
in an interview coinciding with the release of the Paris-based
organisation's twice-yearly economic outlook.
 He said the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent plan to buy $600
billion dollars in government bonds was appropriate in the
absence of inflationary risk, and recommended that Japan
consider more extraordinary stimulus measures.
 In its report, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development said the Federal Reserve should hold off on
raising interest rates until the recovery is firmly entrenched
in the middle of 2012 -- later than the market consensus.
 It also said European Central Bank should not raise interest
rates before 2012, compared with market expectations for a hike
in the final quarter of next year.
 Padoan also told Reuters long-term yields could jump
suddenly if the capacity ramp-up in major economies is
misjudged.
 The OECD's outlook flagged a sudden jump in long-term
interest rates as one of the major risks to the outlook for
major economies.
 ""Interest rates remain at a very, very low level even in the
long term. They may remain like that for a long time but at some
stage they may suddenly -- at a speed which is not foreseen --
start going up because suddenly the market sentiment changes,""
Padoan said in an interview.
 ""We have already seen that in the past in many occasions,""
he added. ""We are not ruling out that possibility.""
 The OECD's outlook said it was difficult to reconcile
current low levels of long-term interest rates with the outlook
for a mild but sustained economic recovery, but Padoan said this
did not necessarily mean markets were misjudging the situation.
 ""There is a risk (of a jump in bond yields), we are not
saying that markets are wrong,"" he said. 
 A trigger to a sharp rise in interest rates could emerge if
inflation pressures proved to be greater than currently thought
because excess capacity in major economies turned out to be
lower than thought.
 ""We do not see that yet, but at some stage we may find
ourselves ... hitting the (inflation) ceiling and that would
reverberate in interest rates going up because of that,"" Padoan
said.

will shift down a gear next year as the United States rebounds
less quickly than expected and growth in emerging countries

yields could directly harm economies by curtailing investment
and indirectly by handing banks and other investors new losses
as bond prices fell.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 05:00AM ET</span>","Japan cuts view on spending, output as stimulus fades"," * Japan government says economy at a standstill
 * Says private consumption shows signs of weakness
 * Economists see sharp Q4 slowdown as stimulus impact fades
 * But govt remains upbeat for output rebound early next year
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Japan's government cut its view on
private consumption for the first time in almost two years and
lowered its assessment of industrial output for a second straight
month, as stimulus measures lose their impact and foreign demand
cools.
 The government also maintained its view that the economy is
at a standstill, after lowering the assessment last month for the
first time since February 2009, despite data this week showing
surprisingly strong third-quarter growth on the back of a rise in
consumer spending.
 But much of that boost came from one-off factors, with
smokers stocking up before a tobacco tax hike and car-buyers
capitalising on subsidies before they expired in September, and
many economists expect the economy to stall or even contract over
the next two quarters.
 ""While private consumption is picking up, some weak movements
are also seen,"" the government said in its monthly economic
report issued on Thursday, downgrading its view on consumption
for the first time since February 2009. Previously, it had said
that private consumption was picking up.
 ""Industrial production is decreasing recently,"" the report
also said.
 The government continued to warn of risks that the economy
could be depressed by a slowdown in the global economy and
volatility in share prices and foreign exchange rates.
 Although the yen has pulled back from 15-year peaks, analysts
say it could resume its rise should the possibility of more
aggressive monetary policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve
come to the fore again.
 A renewed yen rise could prompt the Bank of Japan to ease
policy further through its new pool of funds for buying assets
ranging from government bonds to exchange-traded funds to avoid a
downturn, analysts say.
 The government said in the report that it expects the central
bank to support the economy through ""appropriate and flexible
monetary policy management.""
 In a sign Japanese companies are struggling to cope with the
yen's strength and slowing overseas demand, industrial production
fell for the fourth straight month in September.
 The government maintained, however, that the economy was
expected to pick up again on improvements in overseas economies
and on stimulus measures.
 Underscoring this view, a Cabinet Office official said the
fall in output would likely be temporary, while stabilising wage
growth may help support consumer spending.
 ""The end of the points scheme for cars will hurt auto sales,
but personal incomes are firm, and we hope consumption of other
goods will continue to recover,"" the official told reporters.
 ""Production of cars could fall a lot in the fourth quarter,
but based on what we're hearing from companies, output could rise
again early next year,"" the official said.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2010 05:00AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-After freeing Suu Kyi, Myanmar courts investors"," By Martin Petty and Jason Szep 
 BANGKOK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Just days after releasing
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, Myanmar's
military rulers have a message for investors with a steely
appetite for risk: their isolated country is open for business.	
 After entering a new era of military-managed democracy
following a Nov. 7 election, the secretive junta is courting
investment and touting the potential of a country rich in
natural gas, timber and minerals with urgent infrastructure
needs. 
 Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein gave a rare speech at a
regional summit on Wednesday in the Cambodian capital Phnom
Penh to promote the former Burma's business credentials and
trumpet plans for an investment-friendly regulatory framework.

 ""We encourage participation from the private sector,""
Thein Sein told leaders and business executives from Vietnam,
Cambodia, Thailand and Laos packed into a conference room. ""We
are creating a pro-business environment in order to work
together to get much more business and investment in the
region."" 
 After decades off the investment radar, Myanmar appears
ready to open its doors to foreign businesses, a step analysts
say is easier said than done in a country blighted by decades
of economic mismanagement and closed off by Western sanctions.	

 Sean Turnell, an expert on Myanmar's economy at Sydney's
Macquarie University, cautions that Myanmar is vastly
different from other Asian frontier markets such as Vietnam,
whose communist government opened to foreign investment in the
1990s.	
 Since then, multinationals have piled into Vietnam, keen
to break ground on factories and hire some of Asia's cheapest
workers. Today, Vietnam boasts gleaming shopping malls, a $33
billion stock market and a surplus of foreign-run factories.	
 ""In Vietnam, there may be problems with democracy, but
that country has latched onto the Southeast Asian 'tiger'
economy model which is about identifying external markets and
investing in manufacturing with a view to employing lots of
people and getting into the global production chain,"" said
Turnell. 
 ""But in Burma, it has been about dividing up the domestic
economy rather than any sort of outward projection. The regime
lacks that developmental mindset. That explains a lot their
decisions, which don't make any economic sense. That is what
separates them from Vietnam,"" he said. 
 U.S., European, and Australian sanctions, imposed in
response to human rights abuses, have stifled Western
investment in the country of 50 million people that just over
50 years ago was the world's biggest rice exporter and major
energy producer. 
 The embargoes, however, have not stopped the flow of
money. China, Thailand and India are big investors. Official
data show China pumped $8.2 billion into Myanmar January to
May, including $5 billion in hydropower and $2.2 billion in
oil and gas. 
 
 RECALIBRATING SANCTIONS? 
 But Saturday's release of Suu Kyi may offer a chance to
recalibrate those sanctions, which critics say have hurt
ordinary people by allowing the junta to monopolise the economy.	
 Some diplomats expect the pro-democracy leader to play a
pivotal role in pushing for a relaxing of embargoes. She
hinted at such a day after her release. ""If people really want
sanctions to be lifted, I will consider this,"" she told
reporters. 
 The military junta rarely comments on sanctions. But
diplomats in Myanmar say growing dependence on China is a
concern for the generals, who also want an end to arms
embargoes that limit their access to modern weapons
technology, say analysts. 
 Washington is wasting no time and said on Monday it was
ready to engage with the new government, but made no mention
of sanctions. [ID:nN15272923]	
 The recently formed Myanmar Business Council handed out
glossy pamphlets this week to investors in a ballroom of the
Cambodiana Hotel after its director delivered a PowerPoint
presentation on investment opportunities in Myanmar. 
 ""After 50 years of isolation, Myanmar's doors have been
unlocked"" read one pamphlet. ""Myanmar is not a 'maybe market',
it will be a 'must have' market."" 
 ""Unfavourable"" Western sanctions offer opportunities for
its closest neighbours, the Council added, encouraging Thai
investors to use the baht currency instead of dollars. It said
Myanmar was ""just like Thailand 20 years ago"", offering tax
breaks. 
 But analysts, diplomats and executives with experience in
Myanmar identify a host of risks for those trying to get in on
the ground floor: corruption, fiscal mismanagement, poor
infrastructure, cronyism, a rudimentary banking system, an
unclear regulatory framework and opaque foreign investment
laws. 
 ""The major problem is political uncertainty. We never know
what those generals want and if they will change their mind.
It's very risky,"" said a trader at a leading Thai sugar miller
who declined to be identified. 
 This year, the junta set up the Myanmar Sugarcane
Enterprise, a think tank, ahead of a free-trade zone in the
Association of South East Asian Nations, whose newest members
-- Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar -- must eliminate
tariffs by 2015.	
 Asked how Myanmar is preparing for competition, Yi Yi Mon,
the organisation's general manger, told Reuters: ""We are
planning to increase sugar production."" But she declined to
elaborate. 
 While neighbouring Thailand is the world's biggest sugar
exporter, producing about 7 million tonnes a year, Myanmar
produces just 800,000 tonnes from 6 major millers mostly run
or held by the military. Unlike nearby Cambodia and Laos, it
has done little to attract foreign investment. 
 Some analysts see hints of change. The government sold off
more than 300 state assets in the last year in areas like
shipping, aviation, banking and real estate. 
 Although the deals are likely to favour businessmen close
to the regime, they could also generate interest among U.S.
and European investors willing to take a hit on their
reputation to pursue gains in a country long seen as an
international pariah because of its poor human rights record.

 By David Dolan and Gugulakhe Lourie
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Investec, South Africa's
fifth-largest bank, posted a near 6 percent rise in its
half-year operating profit on Thursday, helped by growth in the
asset management business.
 The investment bank and asset manager said the regulatory
environment remained challenging, but activity levels were
starting to improve.
 Investec, which operates in South Africa, Britain and
Australia, has attempted to counter the grim outlook for lending
and investment banking by building up its asset management
business.
 It took over British wealth manager Rensburg Sheppards in
June and its chief executive told Reuters in September he might
consider buying a similar business in Australia.
 ""We will continue to grow organically unless something comes
along that is reasonably priced and that will fit with the
strategy of the executives that run the asset management
business,"" Managing Director Bernard Kantor told Reuters.
 Analysts said the results showed Investec's strategy of
building up its wealth management business was paying off.
 ""In an environment where lending is going to be quite
constrained for some time it's probably a wise move to focus on
expanding non-interest revenue,"" Afrifocus Securities banking
analyst Johann Scholtz said.
 Investec, which is also listed in London, last month became
the first bank since the credit crisis to return to the
securitisation in the UK of non-standard mortgages, including
some subprime loans, selling 128 million pounds ($203 million)
of securities backed by residential mortgages.
 ""As demand builds up from the business we will go to the
market with another securitisation,"" Kantor said.
 The bank said operating profit totalled 228.15 million
pounds ($362.3 million) in the six months to end-September, up
5.6 percent from 215.9 million pounds a year earlier, or up 34
percent excluding a 46 million-pound profit made in the same
period last year on the repurchase of its debt.
 ""Our strategy of building income from less capital
intensive, fee earning businesses has made good progress,""
Kantor said in the results statement.
 ""Looking ahead there are, of course, reasons for caution but
we are encouraged by the overall levels of activity we see in
our businesses.""
 Investec said in September it expected a ""marginally higher""
group operating profit, citing sluggish demand for credit and a
slow recovery in bad debts.
 The bank said net interest income totalled 321.17 million
pounds, compared with 297.36 million a year earlier.
 Bad debt charges totalled 122.85 million pounds, compared
with 134.29 million a year earlier.
 Asked about Investec's exposure to Ireland's debt woes,
Kantor said the group was fully covered in terms of its
impairments and provisions.
 ""Our Irish exposure is exactly 270 million pounds, which is
1.6 percent of our total book, and we have impaired about 160
million pounds to 170 million pounds and provided 86 million
pounds,"" he said.
 Shares in Investec were up 0.4 percent at 59.14 rand in
Johannesburg by 0935 GMT, when Johannesburg's Top-40 index was
up 1 percent. At the same time the London-listed shares were up
1.4 percent at 507 pence.

 * IMF-Europe mission to start talks
 * France says Ireland may have to raise corporation tax
 * Markets steady, anticipating Irish bailout 
 
 By Lorraine Turner
 DUBLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ireland's central bank chief said
on Thursday he expected the country to receive tens of billions
of euros in loans from European partners and the IMF to help
shore up its shattered banks and stabilise the economy.
 Central bank governor Patrick Honohan was speaking shortly
before the start of talks with a joint mission of the European
Commission, the European Central Bank and the International
Monetary Fund on a possible rescue package.
 ""The intention is and the expectation is, on their part and
personally on my part, that negotiations or discussions will be
effective and a loan will be made available and drawn down as
necessary,"" he told state broadcaster RTE.
 ""We're talking about a very substantial loan for sure --
tens of billions, yes,"" Honohan said, acknowledging that there
had been substantial outflows of funds from the Irish banking
sector since April.
 After 10 days of losses, European stock and bond markets
and the euro recovered slightly on expectations that Ireland
would become the second euro zone country after Greece to
receive a bailout to cope with high debts and deficits.
 Dublin's borrowing costs have gone through the roof since
late October as concerns about the banks' swelling liabilities
and German-driven EU moves to create a system for restructuring
stricken euro zone states' debts unsettled investors.
 ""To some extent the market is anticipating (a bailout), but
once the announcement is made I think we will see these spreads
come in,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, a bond market strategist at RIA
Capital Markets in Edinburgh.
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 In an indication of potentially tough negotiations ahead,
France said Ireland may have to raise its ultra-low 12.5 percent
corporation tax rate -- a taboo in Irish politics -- in return
for the assistance package.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said Irish
business taxation was abnormally low by European standards,
while income taxes were broadly in line with the EU average.
 ""So we will have to see how these (corporate) rates can be
changed without weighing down the Irish economy and driving away
investors,"" she told France-Inter radio.
 Higher-tax countries, including Britain, Germany and France,
have long seen the Irish rate as a form of unfair competition.
 
 ""BANKRUPT""
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen has repeatedly rejected
suggestions that his government is discussing a bailout that
would place public finances under EU-IMF supervision.
 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan insisted on Wednesday after
talks with EU peers that the Irish corporate tax was ""safe"".
 One of the country's leading businessmen, budget airline
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, said the government was
incapable of running the economy and the Irish should welcome
being put under IMF stewardship as soon as possible.
 ""The country is bankrupt. We're now being bailed out. The
government has been lying to us all week. When Irish government
bonds are yielding at nearly nine percent and you can borrow off
the IMF at three percent ... the only way out is the IMF, and
frankly sooner the better,"" O'Leary told reporters in Dublin.
 Lenihan said euro zone peers had welcomed his four-year, 15
billion euros budget-cutting strategy, due to be published next
week, suggesting he sees no need for further fiscal tightening.
 Ireland has said the bill for cleaning up its banks could
top 50 billion euros but investors fear the final figure could
be even higher given rising residential mortgage arrears,
deposit outflows and higher funding costs.
 Some analysts said Dublin appeared to be playing for time,
partly to avoid the political humiliation of applying for aid
before a key Nov. 25 parliamentary by-election.
 An opinion poll on Wednesday suggested Cowen's Fianna Fail
party is set to lose that vote anyway, reducing the governing
coalition's majority to just two seats.
 Euro zone sources said there was an agreement in principle
to trigger aid when the joint mission completes its work --
perhaps in days -- and the aid would not be just for the banks.
 Irish banks have been pushed to the brink by the financial
crisis and a property collapse.
 Allied Irish, whose shares have lost 70 percent of their
value this year and which will be more than 90 percent owned by
the state following a rights issue later this year, will issue a
trading statement later on Thursday.
 The country's largest lender Bank of Ireland signalled last
week that it had seen a 10 billion euros outflow of deposits
from early August until the end of September.
 After Greece's near collapse, the stakes are high. European
Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who heads the body that
groups the EU's 27 national governments, said the EU's future
could be at stake, although others played down those risks.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, has said it stands ready to help, and Lagarde said
France expected London would provide bilateral loans in any
package, given its close economic ties with Dublin.

 By Nick Vinocur
 PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ireland may have to raise its
corporate tax rate as part of efforts to improve its finances
but not so much as to drive away investors and deepen debt
problems, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on
Thursday.
 Britain and Germany have long said low Irish taxes were a
form of unfair competition in the battle for foreign investment
and Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proell has said it would
have to be discussed in any talks on an EU bailout.
 Lagarde said any deal would have to ensure the Irish economy
remains attractive to investors though it was likely that the
country's tax regime -- which aside from corporate tax is in
line with EU standards -- would have to change. 
 ""We will have to see how these rates can be changed without
weighing down the Irish economy and driving away investors,
because we would be shooting ourselves in the foot and Ireland
would be guaranteed to have to come back to the (loan) window,""
she said in an interview on France Inter radio.
 Ireland's central bank chief said on Thursday it was likely
to end up taking a loan from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund that could run into the 10s of
billions of euros, despite reluctance from Irish leaders to
accept a handout. [ID:nWLA8423]
 On Wednesday, the country agreed to open talks with a
European Union-IMF mission in view of taking urgent steps to
shore up its shattered banking sector and establish the
conditions under which it could receive aid. [ID:nLDE6AG004]
 Lagarde said discussions might involve taking a closer look
at an Irish tax regime that she said was ""very light on
companies but on income and some other factors it's quite in
line with European standards.""
 Ireland's finance minister Brian Lenihan brushed off calls
to raise the 12.5 percent corporate tax rate on Wednesday.
 Lagarde said it remained to be determined how crucial
Ireland's tax structure was to the appeal of its economy and
whether it could be adjusted without negative consequences.
 Portugal's borrowing costs have also soared on fears of a
spread of the crisis, but Lagarde said there was no risk that
the euro zone would break up over debt troubles. Ireland needed
to decide for itself whether to accept aid, she said.
 ""When you put that kind of programme in place, the aim is to
ensure the solidity of an economy, to ensure that it recovers so
it does not have to come back to the window and request support
again,"" Lagarde said, adding that Britain could participate in a
an Irish aid package, possibly in the form of a bilateral loan.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday as
optimism that Ireland's debt crisis may be easing fuelled
speculative buying, but analysts said the move was likely to be
short-lived, with the rally stalling ahead of key resistance.
 The dollar was broadly softer after subdued U.S. inflation
data on Wednesday reinforced the Federal Reserve's case for
monetary easing.
 ""We view this as a short-term speculative rally in the euro,
driven by weaker U.S. CPI and some optimism for Ireland as the
IMF and EU arrive in Dublin for talks,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 ""There are other factors at play for the dollar. Year-end
flows should be supportive as profit-taking versus emerging
currencies fuels repatriation,"" he said.
 Uncertainty about the Irish crisis, which also supported the
dollar recently, looked to be loosening its grip on markets
after Dublin agreed to work with a European Union-IMF mission on
urgent steps to shore up its shattered banking sector.
 The euro stood at $1.3629, up around 0.7 percent on the day.
It fell to a seven-week low of $1.3446 on Tuesday.
 Traders reported stop-losses above key resistance at
$1.3630, the top of the Ichimoku cloud.
 ""I suspect Ireland will take some sort of aid package this
week or next week and that'll probably see the euro make up some
gains in the near term,"" said Joseph Capurso, strategist at
Commonwealth Bank.
 The euro is still down some 5 percent from a 10-month high
above $1.4280 set on Nov. 4.
 There was plenty to keep the market uncertain, with some
analysts saying that even if there was a quick resolution over
Ireland, players would continue to fret about other peripheral
euro zone economies and their debt levels.
 A Spanish auction of 10- and 30-year bonds, due around 1000
GMT, was in the market's sights.
 ""Sadly for Spain, the timing is far from ideal as it comes
to the market with the tension over Ireland so elevated, the
outcome so unclear, and the threat of contagion to the
forefront,"" analysts at Credit Agricole CIB said in a note to
clients.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX FALLS
 U.S. core consumer inflation climbed 0.6 percent from a year
ago, marking the smallest increase since records started in 1957
and arguing in favour of the Fed delivering all of its $600
billion of quantitative easing, after stronger data had fuelled
doubts it would need to follow through on the entire programme.
 The dollar, which gained 4 percent from a 15-year low to a
high of 83.60 yen this month, held at 83.18 yen. There was some
talk of stop-loss buy orders at 83.70 yen.
 Some traders say dollar/yen could rise to around 85 yen on
the back of widening in the U.S.-Japan yield gap, with which it
has had a high correlation.
 Traders also say hedge funds are likely to close dollar
short positions ahead of their book-closing later in the year.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, retreated below 79.00 from
a seven-week high of 79.461 hit on Tuesday.
 The softer U.S. currency helped the Australian dollar pop to
around $0.9880, up from this week's low around $0.9726, helped
by a rally in Asian equity markets.

 TOKYO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the euro
on Thursday after subdued U.S. inflation supported the Federal
Reserve's case for quantitative easing, while Asian shares
rebounded after an eight-day sell-off.	
 Hopes that Ireland will soon see a solution to its debt
crisis supported stocks, which have been dogged by uncertainty
about how Europe would tackle Ireland's debt woes and fears
that China may take aggressive steps to curb inflation.	
 Such factors had helped exacerbate a recent sell-off in
risky assets and a rally in the dollar that traders say was
partly due to investors trimming their bets before market
liquidity dwindles towards the year-end.	
 Major European shares rose 0.4 percent in early
trade, following gains in Asia.	
 The euro and Asian equities gained some respite after
Ireland agreed to work with EU and IMF officials on steps to
shore up its shattered banking sector. [ID:nLDE6AG004] 
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan
rose 1 percent to 461.43. It had slid for
eight straight sessions up to Wednesday, shedding 5.7 percent.

 ""After some signs of overheating there had been a bit of a
pullback on concerns about potential interest rate rises in
emerging markets,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manger
for Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo, referring to
Asian equities. 
 ""But at the base there is QE2, with the amount of money
swelling and heading toward risky assets,"" Akino said, adding
that investors were likely to continue to look to buy Asian
equities when they dip. 
 Shanghai shares rose 0.9 percent and Hong Kong
equities gained 1.7 percent as investors picked up
beaten down shares, although sentiment remained fragile as
worries persisted that China may adopt steps to curb inflation
including more aggressive hikes in key interest rates.

 Japanese equities outperformed their Asian peers, with the
Nikkei up 2.1 percent to a five-month high of 10,013.63.	
 Market players said short-covering of Japanese financial
shares by overseas funds helped spur similar moves in other
sectors, with some saying the buying of Japanese equities was
led by European funds balancing their positions ahead of
year-end book closings. 
 The yen's recent dip against the dollar also helped boost

(Updates with background, market reaction)
 SEOUL, Nov 18 (Reuters) - South Korea plans to reintroduce a
withholding tax on foreigners' local bond investments, a finance
ministry official said on Thursday, as part of efforts to reduce
sharp swings in capital flows and the won .
 The finance ministry will hold a briefing later on Thursday
about the fresh measure to curb the flood of hot money.
 ""Now the bill is pending at the parliament, and the
government is also positively considering the measure,"" said the
official, who declined to be named before the official
announcement.
 The prospective measure comes after a ruling party member
submitted a bill last week to the National Assembly to
reintroduce a withholding tax on capital gains earned by foreign
investors from holdings of domestic treasury and monetary
stabilisation bonds. [ID:nTOE6AB07V]
 Another lawmaker from the ruling Grand National Party also
has recently submitted a similar bill to parliament which called
for a flexible tax rate on foreign bond holdings.
 Any decision by the government on the tax re-introduction may
influence the legislators' decision and help speed up the
process. Emerging countries are trying to reduce the impact of
massive fund inflows, which they say is due to ultra-loose
monetary policies in the developed economies.
 In May 2009, the country lifted a 14 percent withholding tax
on foreigners' bond investments to lure long-term offshore funds
in a bid to recover from a global financial crisis.
 December-delivery treasury futures  trimmed the
losses, down 0.05 points to 112.20 as of 0621 GMT, on market talk
that the planned briefing might deal with only tax re-imposition.
 The won  was up about 0.9 percent at 1,134.9 against

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The International
Monetary Fund on Wednesday acknowledged China as a
powerhouse in global economy but said the Chinese yuan was not
used widely enough be to included in the IMF Special Drawing
Right. 
 The IMF on Monday altered the basket of currencies that
make up the SDR, but opted not to add the Chinese currency to
the mix. 
 There had been speculation that the IMF might expand the
SDR basket of currencies to include the Chinese yuan as part
of a five-year review completed on Monday. 
 Instead, the agency stayed with current basket of four
currencies: the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the euro and
the British pound. 
 ""Directors noted that although China has become the
third-largest exporter of goods and services on a five-year
average basis and has taken steps to facilitate international
use of its currency, the Chinese renminbi(yuan) does not
currently meet the criteria to be a freely usable currency and
it would therefore not be included in the SDR basket at this
time,"" the IMF said in a statement. 
 The IMF board urged that the issue be kept under review in
light of China's rising clout in the global economy, the
statement said. 
 China has become the world's second-largest economy, but
its currency is not convertible on the capital account and
therefore barely used outside China.

 * Question whether dollar short-covering letting up
 * Ireland agrees to work with EU-IMF mission
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The dollar's rally to seven-week
highs stalled on Thursday after it failed at chart resistance and
after subdued U.S. inflation data reinforced the Federal
Reserve's case for easing, making dollar short-covering pause.
 Uncertainty about Ireland's debt crisis, which also helped
support the dollar recently, looked to be loosening its grip on
markets after Dublin agreed to work with a European Union-IMF
mission on urgent steps to shore up its shattered banking sector.
 Currencies are see-sawing as year-end book-closing has
prompted a lot of short-dollar positions built up over the past
couple of months to unwind and as Europe's debt problems have
returned to the fore, exacerbating losses in the euro.
 The single currency tested resistance around $1.3560-70,
pushing up as far as $1.3583, where a sustained break would
signal a move up to $1.3650-70. However failure to hold the move
above $1.3560-70 could open up a retest of this week's seven-week
low at $1.3446.
 One trader said there were euro bids below $1.3450 but with
some stop loss sell orders just below $1.3500.
 ""I suspect Ireland will take some sort of aid package this
week or next week and that'll probably see the euro make up some
gains in the near term,"" said Joseph Capurso, strategist at
Commonwealth Bank.
 Still the market was subdued with plenty to keep it
uncertain, with some analysts noting that even if there was a
quick resolution over Ireland, the market would continue to fret
about other peripheral euro zone economies and their debt levels.
 In addition, speculation that China may tighten monetary
policy was keeping appetite for risk subdued.
 The euro was 0.4 percent up from late New York levels at
$1.3578 but is down some 5 percent from a 10-month high above
$1.4280 set on Nov. 4.
 U.S. core consumer inflation climbed 0.6 percent from a year
ago, marking the smallest increase since records started in
1957 and arguing in favour of the Fed delivering all of its $600
billion of quantitative easing, after stronger data had fuelled
doubts it would need to follow through on the entire programme.
 The dollar, which gained 4 percent from a 15-year low to a
high of 83.60 yen this month, held at 83.32 yen. There was some
talk of stop loss buy orders at 83.70 yen.
 One trader said however the dollar was keeping track of yield
differentials and that dollar/yen could rise to around 85 yen
given the U.S.-Japan yield gap.
 Others were less sure, noting that the rate differential had
widened but was already narrowing this week.
 ""Japanese yields should stabilise but I'd be cautious to
chase the rally of dollar/yen from here,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, retreated
below 79.00 from a seven-week high of 79.461.
 The index faces significant resistance levels up at
79.55-80.05 and while it failed there this week, a break higher
would be bullish for the dollar.
 The softer greenback helped the Australian dollar pop above
$0.9800, up from this week's low around $0.9726.
 But growing expectations that China, Australia's largest
export market, will take steps to tackle inflation, including a
rate rise as early as this week, could limit the Aussie's
upside.

(Updates to close, adds commentary)
 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar ended lower
against the greenback on Wednesday, weighed down by weak U.S.
economic data, though it recovered from close to a three-week
low sparked by a sharp drop in oil prices.
 U.S. core consumer inflation touched a record low in
October and new home building sagged, lending support to the
Federal Reserve's move to boost the sluggish U.S. economy
through additional monetary easing. [ID:nN17190977]
 The data pressured both the U.S. and Canadian dollars
against the rest of the G10 currencies.
 ""It was more CAD trading in a very tight range with the
U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollar losing against most of the
other G10 currencies, that dragged Canada down against those
currencies as well,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""Part of the reason the U.S. dollar softened slightly was
... disappointing data, whether you're looking housing starts,
permits, inflation. And that put the North American currencies
on the defensive.""
 Sovereign debt worries in Europe were less of an immediate
drag, noted Strauss.
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0243 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.63 U.S. cents,
down slightly from C$1.0222 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.83 U.S.
cents at Tuesday's close.
 Overnight, the currency fell to C$1.0260 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.47 U.S. cents, its weakest level since Oct. 28,
as London equity futures declined and oil prices fell steeply
on renewed worries that China may increase interest rates to
stave off inflation, cutting demand for commodities. [O/R]
 But in the North American session, Strauss said the
Canadian currency managed to hold its own against the
greenback. It even managed to strengthen as high as C$1.0180
against the U.S. dollar, or 98.23 cents, despite a sharp drop
in oil prices. [O/R]
 To illustrate this he pointed out the Norwegian krona, the
currency of the G10's other major oil producer, was a top
performer on the crosses.
 ""So it seems that the fall in the oil price played almost
no role in CAD's performance today,"" said Strauss.
 The session saw a decided break of a key U.S. dollar
resistance level of C$1.0157, which then turned into a support
level. Strauss said traders are waiting for confirmation of a
new resistance level for the U.S. currency at C$1.0247, which
it tested briefly. Beyond there, C$1.0350 represents the next
major barrier.
 BONDS PRICES MUTED
 Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the
curve, also lacking significant direction.
 The two-year bond  was up 3 Canadian cents to
yield 1.583 percent, while the 10-year bond  slipped
11 Canadian cents to yield 3.109 percent.
 On the long end, Canada's auction of 30-year bonds met with
the strongest demand in at least two decades as investors,
fearing economic uncertainty, flocked to the safety and
relatively decent value of long-term government debt.
[ID:nN17204458]
 ""There continues to be a lot of demand for long duration
assets. And, although the long end of our curve has flattened a
bit in the past few weeks, it's still relatively steep,"" said
Roger Quick, director of fixed income research at Scotia
Capital.
 ""I'm surprised the overall market isn't stronger ... given
very weak data today.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher against
the dollar on Wednesday as tepid U.S. inflation data and weak
housing starts supported the Federal Reserve's quantitative
easing and provided a signal for investors to resume selling
the greenback.
 Talk that Ireland may soon receive help to fix its banking
and sovereign debt problems also lifted the euro, although the
currency's upside could be limited because of concerns that
problems could spread to other euro zone economies.
 The euro earlier slid to a low of $1.3460 on trading
platform EBS, not far from a seven-week trough hit on Tuesday
at $1.3446. Key support lies at $1.3436, the 50 percent
retracement of the August to November rally, and a break could
open the way for a drop toward the low $1.30s, traders said.
 ""With today's CPI data kind of confirming that the Fed is
doing the right thing on QE, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to
back off,"" said Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist at
CitiFX in New York.
 U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in October and
the increase in the year-on-year core rate was the smallest on
record. Housing starts were likewise weak last month, falling
to their lowest level since April 2009. For a wrapup of U.S.
data, click on [ID:nN17190977].
 ""As a result, we've seen yields stabilizing and it looks
like they're headed lower, which is good for risk sentiment,""
Anderson said.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro  was up 0.2
percent at $1.3519. The single currency has lost about 3
percent this month as investors have cut long positions on
peripheral debt worries.
 The market's focus was mainly on Ireland, whose high
borrowing costs and large deficit have kindled fears of a
Greek-style crisis in which budget problems in one country
weigh on the entire euro zone.
 Nervousness grew after European clearing house LCH.
Clearnet doubled its margin requirement on Irish government
bonds to 30 percent of net positions, citing higher Irish
yields over German benchmarks.
 HOPES FOR IRELAND RESOLUTION
 However, speculation that a resolution of Ireland's
problems is close helped the euro. Irish Prime Minister Brian
Cowen on Wednesday said the country is currently not in a
""threatening situation"" and there are ""sensible, precautionary
discussions taking place. [ID:nWLA8368].
 ""Any report of any pending solution to the Irish ...
problem will cause a rebound in the euro,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 ""It will not eliminate the concern but it will sponsor a
reaction against the speculation that has been driving the euro
down. The Europeans are not going to let this situation blow
up. It would be too damaging for the euro.""
 Ireland agreed on Wednesday to work with a European
Union-IMF mission on urgent steps to shore up its shattered
banking sector, a process that could lead to a bailout despite
Dublin's deep reluctance. Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan
said talks would start on Thursday. For more, see
[ID:nLDE6AG004]
 Analysts said given the euro's sharp decline in recent
days, it could bounce back toward $1.37, though the downside
risk remains high.
 Citi's Anderson said he believes the euro may have already
formed a bottom given Tuesday's huge liquidation of long
positions. He said the euro could climb to $1.3850 in a few
weeks, although he is not expecting new highs.
 Markets also await the release of the Irish government
budget due a week from Friday for a clearer picture of
Ireland's sovereign debt.

 * IMF insists defaults unnecessary, haircuts save little
 * Others feel political cost too high and fear ""lost decade""
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - If debt-strapped countries like
Ireland are determined to avoid default in the face of bond
market panics, history appears to be on their side.
 The popular narrative around bond scares is that they become
self-fulfilling prophecies and downward spirals that usually end
in default, with bond traders acting like financial vigilantes
rather than Keystone Kops -- the bungling policemen of silent
movie era.
 But however much deep budget cuts, outside help or local
deflation are necessary to hold the line, the experience since
1990 suggests most countries try and succeed to face the market
down and avoid defaults.
 International Monetary Fund studies of such creditor strikes
in developing economies over the past 20 years show that bond
markets systematically overreact. Only one in five cases where
sovereign borrowing premia rose to more than 10 percentage
points above benchmarks actually ended in default.
 Map that to this month's fright over Ireland's ability or
willingness to repay its debts, which has seen equivalent 5-year
borrowing spreads rise to 6 percentage points. Yet the credit
default swaps market puts Ireland's so-called ""cumulative
probability of default"" over five years at more than 35 percent.
 Now, the vagaries of the Irish situation and reasoning
behind the sudden evaporation of confidence are well documented.
 Guarantees of its ailing banks mean state liabilities have
become a moving target and giant euro zone partner Germany has
confused the situation by demanding unspecified provisions in
euro zone state debt issued after 2013 to ensure ""orderly"" debt
workouts between borrowers and creditors.
 On the other hand, Ireland does not need to raise new debt
until next Summer, it already has the potential support of the
440 billion euro European Financial Stability Facility, and the
European Central Bank continues to provide relatively cheap
funding to its banks.
 But given borrowing rates themselves are a key determinant
of Irish debt sustainability, should Dublin simply accept that
it is caught in some inevitable spiral?
 ""UNNECESSARY, UNDESIREABLE UNLIKELY""
 In the paper published in September before the latest
blowout, the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department said default for
developed economies, including the pressurised peripheral euro
zone sovereigns, was ""unnecessary, undesirable and unlikely.""
 Apart from citing the 20 years of false alarms on sovereign
debt in emerging markets, it said default and haircuts would not
solve the crux of the current problem facing ""advanced""
economies, including Ireland and Greece.
 The IMF's main point was that the challenge facing advanced
countries today, unlike emerging market crises in recent
decades, is bloated primary budget deficits and not the
excessive debt servicing costs of historical debt blowouts.
 The distinction is crucial in assessing gains from any
restructuring and the paper showed that, even with a draconian
50 percent haircut for creditors, there would be little
difference to the fiscal adjustment and budget pain required to
keep the national debt sustainable.
 ""In our view, the risk of debt restructuring is currently
significantly overestimated,"" the IMF's Carlo Cottarelli,
Lorenzo Forni, Jan Gottschalk and Paulo Mauro wrote.
 ""Default would not significantly reduce the need for major
fiscal adjustment. In contrast, the economies that defaulted in
recent decades did so primarily as a result of high debt
servicing costs, often in the context of major external shocks.""
 ""Default would not be in the interest of the citizens of the
countries in question,"" it added, saying there was sufficient
time to allow fiscal cuts to convince creditors.
 Even though marginal borrowing rates look high now, they
added that average interest rates for Ireland, Greece and other
euro zone members remain relatively low and that Ireland, for
example, has an average debt maturity of seven years.
 Crunching the numbers, the Fund said Ireland would require a
not-unprecedented shift in its primary budget deficit of 10
percent this year to a surplus of 0.4 percent in order to
stabilise its debt-to-gross domestic product ratio by 2012.
 The critical bit is that even after a dramatic debt
restructuring with an improbably high creditor haircut of 50
percent, Ireland's debts-stabilizing primary surplus would only
be reduced to 0.2 percent.
 
 COSTS TOO HIGH?
 For many economists, however, the risk calculation is less
to do with bond mathematics than the politics of long-term
deflation, deep budget cuts and the demand of richer European
countries such as Germany that their taxpayers do not become
continuously liable for routine bailouts.
 Without a comprehensive multilateral restructuring along the
lines of Latin America's Brady Initiative in 1989, some feel the
crisis of confidence in euro zone debt risks being as durable
and risky as 1980s' debt crises in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.
 ""Debt restructuring with significant haircuts is the only
long-term solution. Otherwise, it's a bunch of band-aid
solutions that feed into a ""Lost Decade"" of slow growth,
recession, and high unemployment,"" said Win Thin, economist at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 If he's right, the market may indeed be pricing accurately.
 But an ultimately political calculation with such very
definite advice from one of the multilateral agencies likely to
be consulted means bond sellers and buyers alike need to beware.

 By Carmel Crimmins and Jan Strupczewski
 DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ireland agreed on
Wednesday to work with a European Union-IMF mission on urgent
steps to shore up its shattered banking sector, a process that
could lead to a bailout despite Dublin's deep reluctance.
 A team from the European Commission, the International
Monetary Fund and European Central Bank will travel to Ireland
on Thursday to examine what measures may be needed if Dublin
decides to seek aid, euro zone finance ministers said.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen emphasised that the mission
would look at what assistance Ireland might require, again
rejecting suggestions his government was discussing a bailout.
 ""What we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way,
over coming days, to sit down and see in what way can assistance
be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with
properly and appropriately,"" he told parliament.
 ""There has been no question of the government ... (being) in
a negotiation for a bailout,"" he said, dismissing the term as
pejorative to hoots of opposition derision.
 He later told RTE television there were ""sensible,
precautionary discussions"" under way. ""It's urgent. We accept
it's urgent and we need to deal with it.""
 The EU's commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn, said
the EU-IMF team would work intensively with Ireland ""to
determine the best way to provide any necessary support to
address market risks, especially as regards the banking sector"".
 ""This can be considered as an intensification of the
preparations for a potential programme if requested by the Irish
government and deemed necessary by the euro area member states,""
he told reporters after the finance ministers' meeting ended.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said euro zone peers
had welcomed his four-year, 15-billion-euro budget-cutting
strategy which he hopes to publish next week, suggesting he sees
no need for further fiscal tightening.
 But he admitted the banking sector needed help.
 ""What may be required may not in fact be an actual transfer
of money now but demonstration of how much money can be made
available if further difficulties materialise,"" he said.
 Ireland has said the bill for cleaning up its banks could
top 50 billion euros but investors fear the final figure could
be even higher given rising residential mortgage arrears,
deposit outflows and higher funding costs.
 Financial markets appeared unimpressed by Dublin's decision
to reject sovereign assistance, with the premium investors
charge for holding Irish 10-year bonds rather than German Bunds
holding at a near-record 575 basis points.
 LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for sovereign debt, doubled
its margin requirement on Irish bonds to 30 percent of net
positions, an indication of the increased risk of default.
 Underlining the fear that Ireland's problems could spread,
Portugal's borrowing costs soared at a treasury bill auction,
with yields for 12-month paper jumping more than 150 basis
points from a tender earlier this month.
 Lenihan dismissed suggestions that Ireland should raise its
ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate to help cut its
debt. Higher-tax countries, including Britain and Germany, have
long seen the Irish rate as a form of unfair competition.
 ""Of course our corporate tax rate is safe,"" he said.
 Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proell, however, was quoted
as saying the Irish corporate tax rate would have to be
discussed in any talks on aid, foreshadowing tough negotiations.
 Proell earlier told Reuters Insider TV that other euro zone
countries were pressuring Dublin to seek a bailout to help
stabilise the euro and avoid a spillover to other countries.
 ""Contagion risk is one of the dangers that is behind our
pressure to Ireland to go under the umbrella,"" he said.
 After Proell spoke, the Irish finance ministry said its
position was unchanged that the corporate tax was protected.
 Ministers took a tough line on Tuesday with Greece, the
first country to receive an IMF-euro zone rescue, telling Athens
to cut its spending further to meet budget deficit reduction
targets agreed as part of its bailout.
 
 INEVITABLE?
 While Ireland made no request for immediate EU rescue,
resisting pressure to follow in Greece's footsteps, economists
said a state bailout remained a probability even though its
public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011.
 ""Will Ireland dig its way out of this hole without support?""
asked Commerzbank's Peter Dixon in a research note.
 ""Alas probably not, because it has lost market confidence
... In the absence of measures to restructure the banking debt,
we see a high probability that Ireland will ask for European
Financial Stability Facility funding early next year.""
 Some analysts said Dublin appeared to be playing for time
partly to avoid the political humiliation of applying for aid
before a key Nov. 25 parliamentary by-election. An opinion poll
released on Wednesday suggested Cowen's Fianna Fail party is set
to lose that vote anyway, reducing the governing coalition's
majority to just two seats.
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 Euro zone sources said there was an agreement in principle
to trigger aid when the joint mission completes its work --
perhaps in days -- and the aid would not be just for the banks.
 Irish banks, pushed to the brink by the financial crisis and
a property collapse, came under further downward pressure, with
shares in Allied Irish falling anew. They have lost 70 percent
of their value this year.
 The bank, which will be more than 90 percent owned by the
state following a rights issue later this year, will issue a
trading statement later this week.
 The country's largest lender Bank of Ireland signalled last
week that it had seen 10 billion euros in outflows of deposits
between early August and the end of September.
 But Bancassurer Irish Life & Permanent said on Wednesday it
was confident Irish banks would be adequately capitalised to
deal with any downturn in the country's residential mortgage
market.
 After Greece's near collapse, the stakes are high. European
Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who heads the body that
groups the EU's 27 national governments, said the EU's future
could be at stake, although others played down those risks.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, said it stood ready to help, although it was unclear
what steps it might take to assist Ireland.
 ""Ireland is our closest neighbour and it's in Britain's
national interest that the Irish economy is successful and we
have a stable banking system,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne said.

 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Parts of Europe are experiencing
difficulties but Britain's economy looks in better shape now
than it was a few months ago, Bank of England Deputy Governor
Paul Tucker said on Wednesday.
 In an interview with BBC Radio Oxford, Tucker struck a
cautiously upbeat tone and reiterated the central bank's
commitment to bring ""uncomfortably high"" inflation back to
target.
""The world is still a hazardous place and there are
obviously difficulties around Europe. But I think the UK is in a
better position now than perhaps it was a few months ago,""
Tucker said.
 Tucker said the government's action to cut the budget
deficit had taken away some of the risks to the macro-economic
outlook, and noted it had been widely welcomed by the business
community.
 ""The action that has been taken to put the UK public
finances on a better footing over the next few years provides
some insulation for our economy,"" he said.
 Tucker said his tour of companies in the Oxfordshire region
had thrown up a mixed picture. Exporting companies were
typically benefiting from a fall in sterling's exchange rate but
those importing raw materials had been affected by the ""steep
rise"" in commodity prices.
 He said the vast majority of the businesses he saw were
""mildly optimistic"" about the future.
 ""It's not easy, but it's probably going about as well as
people could have expected it to go given how big the fall was
during the crisis,"" Tucker said.
 He reiterated the central bank's determination to bring
inflation -- which rose to 3.2 percent in October -- back to
target while seeking to safeguard the recovery.
 ""The BoE is absolutely determined to return inflation from
its currently uncomfortably-high level of around 3 percent back
down to our target of 2 percent over the next few years and
while we're doing that to support recovery in the economy as
well,"" he said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose from a
seven-week low against the dollar on Wednesday on
softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data and as hopes grew
Ireland may soon receive help to fix its banking and sovereign
debt woes.
 Upside in the single currency is likely limited, however,
amid lingering concerns over the lack of a clear solution to
Ireland's debt crisis and fears problems could spread to euro
zone economies such as Portugal and Spain.
 The euro earlier slid to a low of $1.3460 on trading
platform EBS, not far from a seven-week low hit on Tuesday at
$1.3446. Key support lies at $1.3436, the 50 percent
retracement of the August to November rally, and a break could
open the way for a drop toward the low $1.30s, traders said.
 ""If we get a resolution to Ireland's problems, you could
see the euro bounce,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""But the overall
bias is to the downside, given uncertainty about not just
Ireland but Portugal and Spain. Near-term, it has sold off a

 Ireland agreed on Wednesday to work with a European
Union-IMF mission on urgent steps to shore up its shattered
banking sector, a process that could lead to a bailout despite
Dublin's deep reluctance. Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan
said talks would start on Thursday.
 ""The (U.S.) CPI data was quite benign and there's been some
talk that Ireland may be getting a little closer to reaching an
agreement,"" said Steven Butler, head of currency trading at
Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in October and
the increase in the year-on-year core rate was the smallest on
record. The data supported the Federal Reserve's decision to
ease monetary policy.
 The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.3551. The single
currency has lost about 3 percent this month as investors have
cut long positions on peripheral debt worries.
 Analysts said given the euro's sharp decline in recent
days, it could bounce back toward $1.37, though the downside
risk remains high.
 The nervousness grew after European clearing house LCH.
Clearnet doubled its margin requirement on Irish government
bonds to 30 percent of net positions, citing higher Irish
yields over German benchmarks.
 Markets also await the release of the Irish government
budget due a week from this Friday before obtaining some
clarity on the issue of Ireland's sovereign debt. LOUDER
OBJECTIONS TO QE
 The Fed official's comments came against a backdrop of
objections to the central bank's stimulus moves that have
become increasingly strident since November elections swept
Republicans to control in the U.S. House of Representatives.
 The dollar stayed close to a six-week high of 83.60 yen
struck on Tuesday, with option-related offers around 83.50
capping gains. It was last at 83.14 yen, off 0.1 percent.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was down
0.4 percent at 78.889, retreating from Tuesday's seven-week
high of 79.461.
 Its correlation with 10-year U.S. yields has grown stronger
and analysts at RBC Capital Markets said that if 10-year yields
rise towards the next resistance levels of 3.06 percent and
3.13 percent, the dollar index could gain further.
 ""We are certainly seeing the dollar being underpinned by
safe-haven inflows, given the nervousness amongst investors
about Ireland and fears about tightening in Asia could lead to
a slowdown for commodities,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank.

 MOSCOW, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Russia will reduce its quota for
poultry meat imports in 2011 to boost local production while
keeping quotas for imports of beef and pork unchanged, the head
of Russia's Meat Union said on Wednesday.
 The quota for poultry imports may be slashed to 400,000

States, Musheg Mamikonyan, who leads the meat producers' lobby

Russia in 2009 and the U.S. quota for 2010 was set at 600,000
tonnes, although Russia allowed other suppliers to use a quarter
of it.
 Quotas for beef and pork imports will be kept at levels
earlier announced by the Economy Ministry, Mamikonyan added.
 He said, citing Meat Union estimates, that local production
of poultry will grow 13 percent this year to reach 2.9 million
tonnes and will add 10 percent more in 2011.
 Pork production is seen growing at 8-9 percent in 2010 and
at 10 percent next year, Mamikonyan said.
 Russia could become self-sufficient in poultry meat and pork
before 2013, the head of the country's top meat producer
Cherkizovo told a Reuters Summit in September.
 Earlier this year Russian authorities said the country
should also focus on exporting meat itself, aiming to sell $1.5
billion-$2.0 billion worth of poultry meat and pork by 2020.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against
the euro, yen and Swiss franc on Wednesday and U.S. stocks
wavered between gains and losses as the lack of a solution to
Ireland's debt crisis weighed on markets.
 Treasuries prices rose after U.S. government figures showed
the lowest core annual inflation rate on record and a steep
drop in housing starts from already depressed levels. The data
forcefully argued the case for the Federal Reserve to buy
government bonds to stimulate the economy.
 In New York trade, the euro rose as high as $1.3539 and
last traded at $1.3534, up 0.3 percent from the prior close
. The dollar was little changed at 83.26 yen  and
last traded at 0.9906 Swiss francs , down 0.5 percent.
Both were the session lows.
 Euro zone finance ministers have agreed to lay the
groundwork for bailing out Ireland's banking sector with the
IMF, but Dublin has yet to decide whether to request the aid.
 The nervousness grew after European clearing house LCH.
Clearnet doubled its margin requirement on Irish government

 The euro briefly gained after a report showed U.S. consumer
prices rose less than expected in October and the increase in
the year-on-year core rate was the smallest on record. For
details, see [ID:nN16142691]. But the single currency has lost
3.2 percent this month as investors have cut long positions as
peripheral debt worries mount.
 World markets were also hit by interest rate concerns
involving China, the global growth engine. Premier Wen Jiabao
said his government was preparing steps to tame price rises,
fueling expectations China will intensify tightening policies,
possibly as soon as Friday.
 ""Chinese rate hike prospects are one thing (affecting
markets). There is also the prospect of tighter measures on
inflows in Asia, especially Korea,"" said Gaelle Blanchard,
emerging markets strategist at Societe Generale.
 Chinese shares closed down 1.9 percent, sending wider Asian
stocks to their lowest levels in four weeks and hitting other
countries that depend on China's growth, such as Australia.

 * Portugal next in firing line, then possibly Spain
 * Fears of debt restructuring spook investors despite denial
 
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Despite public assurances of unity
and determination, it's not clear that euro zone finance
ministers know how to stop the rot gnawing away at the 16-nation
European currency area.
 Ireland, the latest member to come under intense bond market
pressure, agreed on Monday to discuss with an EU-ECB-IMF team
how to stabilise its state-guaranteed banks but continues to
resist applying for the kind of state bailout granted to Greece.
 Even if, as seems likely, Dublin accepts an international
rescue after more face-saving words, analysts increasingly doubt
that will stop contagion spreading to fellow weakling Portugal
and, more ominously, perhaps to the much larger Spain.
 ""In practice, hopes that Ireland can be 'ring-fenced' are
unlikely to succeed,"" Citi economists Juergen Michels, Giada
Giani and Michael Saunders wrote in a note to clients.
 In what can become a self-sustaining frenzy, investors bid
up the borrowing costs of troubled countries on the bond market
until they reach an unsustainable level when a government needs
to raise money or roll over expiring debt.
 The European Union stemmed the first wave of debt crisis in
May with ""shock and awe"" tactics by rescuing Greece along with
the International Monetary Fund and creating a $1 trillion
financial safety net for other euro zone states in distress.
 Six months later, the deterrent effect of the 440 billion
euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the main
component of that contingency fund, which EU officials said they
believed would never need to be used, seems to have worn off.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso played down any sense of a renewed
euro zone crisis this week, saying all the necessary instruments
were now in place in case a country needed help.
 But with typical European cacophony, the man who chairs EU
summits and heads a task force on reforming euro zone economic
governance, Herman Van Rompuy, undermined such soothing talk by
saying the currency bloc was now in a ""survival crisis"".
 
 COMMITMENT WEAKENED
 Markets are concerned not just by the scale of deficits,
public and private debts and economic contraction or stagnation
around the euro zone periphery, but also by Germany's campaign
for the EU to make bond holders share with taxpayers the pain of
any future debt restructuring.
 ""The successful ring-fencing of Greece owed much to the fact
that the EFSF was created at the same time, plus strong
political commitments that no euro area sovereign would be
allowed to default,"" the Citi economists wrote.
 ""That commitment has been greatly weakened, given Germany's
recent insistence on the need for a sovereign default mechanism
in the future.""
 Assurances by the EU's big five last week that this would
only apply to debt issued after mid-2013 and all existing bonds
were safe failed to calm investors trying to reprice the risk of
peripheral euro zone government debt.
 Berlin may have backed off from its call for private
creditors to take a ""haircut"" on the value of their holdings of
a distressed state's debt, but months of uncertainty lie ahead
before the EU agrees on a debt resolution mechanism and all 27
member states ratify the necessary treaty amendment.
 Diplomats say Merkel cannot climb down from her core demand
both due to domestic political pressure and because the German
Constitutional Court may otherwise rule the existing EU rescues
incompatible with the treaty's ""no bailout"" clause.
 Meanwhile, Austria's threat on Monday to delay its share of
the next tranche of emergency loans to Greece because Athens has
not met the agreed deficit reduction target has highlighted the
complexity of the euro zone-IMF bailout mechanism.
 Recipients are potentially at the mercy of 15 individual
governments -- some of them fractious coalitions with restive
parliaments -- as well as being subject to decisions taken in
Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington.
 Slovakia, the newest and poorest member of the euro zone,
refused to take part in the 110 billion euro rescue for Greece,
declining to lend money to a country wealthier than itself.
 The public backlash in wealthy, fiscally conservative
Germany and the Netherlands against bailing out Greece is only
likely to grow if additional states have to be assisted.
 
 RADICAL SOLUTIONS
 Each euro zone struggler's case is different. Ireland and
Spain had healthy budgets and below-average public debt before
real estate bubbles burst in 2007-8, leaving huge private debts,
mass unemployment and a gaping hole in government revenues.
 Ireland has been dragged down by its banks' reckless
property lending, while EU stress tests in July showed Spain's
biggest banks remain healthy and Madrid has begun to isolate and
resolve problems in its weaker savings banks.
 Portugal has suffered an inexorable loss of competitiveness
since in joined the euro at its creation in 1999.
 Back-of-the-envelope calculations on the volume of emergency
loans required for Ireland and Portugal suggest each could need
up to 100 billion euros over three years, market analysts say.
 The EFSF, and a more readily accessible 60 billion euro
European Financial Stability Mechanism, should be able to cover
those needs with the IMF lending up to a quarter of the total.
 However a financial rescue for Spain, if that were to become
necessary, would pose a challenge of a different dimension.
 Some economists are urging radical action that seems
politically unrealistic -- pre-emptive debt restructuring by the
most indebted states, large-scale sovereign bond purchases by
the European Central Bank or big fiscal transfers from richer to
poorer euro zone countries.
 In May, the EU briefly managed to get ""ahead of the curve""
in its response to the crisis. But there is little sign that its
current course can restore confidence in the markets.
 ""Unless the EU changes track and agrees to make the EFSF
permanent and the ECB steps up its purchases of the hard-hit
countries' government bonds, investors will believe that default
is inevitable and demand correspondingly punitive interest
rates,"" said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for
European Reform in London.
 ""Contagion to other member states will be all but
inevitable. If, and when, it reaches Spain, the crisis risks
spiralling out of control.""

 * Household, corporate debt burden hard to shift
 * FX controls seen staying until financial system cleaned up
 * Debt problems seen hurting economic growth prospects
 
 By Mia Shanley
 STOCKHOLM, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Iceland has succeeded in
steadying its economy after its 2008 financial meltdown, but is
struggling to find a way to reduce its mountain of corporate and
household debt, win back investors and boost growth.
 The task is huge. Iceland has to restructure vast portions
of 2.7 trillion crowns ($24.4 billion) of private debt owed to
its new domestic banks, set up to replace lenders that collapsed
in the crisis, to funds, and ultimately to overseas creditors
that have claims on the failed banks.
 Iceland's banks expanded aggressively overseas during the
credit boom, expanding their balance sheets to almost 11 times
the island's annual economic output, and became an emblem of the
decade's excesses when the bubble burst in 2008.
 The government has to answer to several parties today,
including its voters and the International Monetary Fund. It
must also convince investors that Iceland will one day again be
a place to do business.
 It faces demands to be soft on ordinary borrowers or risk
the wrath of an already angry population. Corporate debts are
just as big a headache, though less politically sensitive for a
centre-left government whose popularity has plummeted since it
won a 2009 election.
 About a quarter of mortgages and half of corporate loans are
in default, with problem debts equal to more than half the
country's $12.1 billion gross domestic product.
 
 GROWTH ISSUES
 ""Everyone agrees that more needs to be done, and there is
pressure to speed things up,"" Icelandic Finance Minister
Steingrimur Sigfusson told Reuters.
 ""In terms of economic growth, this is one of the most
important issues,"" Sigfusson said, adding that while many firms
had good cashflows, they were too indebted to start investing.
 The central bank recently cut its outlook for the economy --
it now sees a bigger 2.6 percent contraction this year and
softer-than-expected growth next year -- due to sluggish
investments and weak consumer confidence.
 The likely outcome, analysts say, is that targeted measures
for households will be introduced to ease political pressure,
while solutions on corporate debt may wait until next year.
 Certain writeoffs will be inevitable, but the government
will have to tread carefully so as not to take on more public
debt and upset international lenders.
 It is still seeking ways to ease emergency capital controls
imposed in 2008 for investors with a cumulative 300 billion
crowns ($2.7 billion) in Iceland who may want an exit.
 Steadied by an aid programme led by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the government has got the domestic banks
back on their feet and the economy and currency have stabilised.
 It has built up reserves, the crown has recouped one-third
of its losses against the euro and yields have fallen.
 The government has set up a debtors' omsbudsman and is
allowing for temporary payment suspensions for households that
file applications for help with the office. It recently extended
a stay on auctions of foreclosed properties to the end of March.
 
 DEBT RELIEF OPTIONS
 Sigurdur Snaevarr, head of a government committee looking
into debt relief options, said a 15.5 percent across-the-board
write-off for households would cost 185 billion crowns ($1.7
billion). That is something the IMF would frown upon.
 ""A problem with across-the-board writedowns is that most of
the cost would end up on the budget, increasing government debt
and requiring even more fiscal adjustment than currently
envisaged,"" Julie Kozack, the IMF'S new mission chief, told
Reuters on her first visit to Reykjavik.
 Kozack was in Iceland to hold discussions on the country's
fourth aid payment. She said in a statement this week that more
time was needed to assess the impact of new measures under
consideration to facilitate household debt restructuring.
 Another option Snaevarr's committee looked into is cutting
interest rates on all loans permanently to 3 percent so losses
can be absorbed more gradually.
 Iceland could also offer more targeted relief for those
worst-affected by the financial crisis, for example for those
who took out loans in the years running up to the 2008 crisis,
something Kozack said she supported.
 Corporate debt restructuring has been largely left on the
back-burner and a scheme for small-to-medium sized firms may not
be announced until next April.
 Some writeoffs here will be inevitable too, some said.
 Foreign analysts, several of whom saw the crisis coming
before Iceland faced up to its problems, believe the small
country is still struggling to find its way.
 ""This is still very much a country trying to come to terms
with the grips of the crisis,"" said Lars Christensen, a senior
analyst at Danske Bank.

 NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The euro traded near a recent
seven-week low against the dollar on Wednesday and looked set
to slide further amid concerns over the lack of a clear
solution to Ireland's debt crisis.
 The euro earlier slid to a low of $1.3460 on trading
platform EBS, not far from a seven-week low hit on Tuesday at
$1.3446. Key support lies at $1.3436, the 50 percent
retracement of the August to November rally with a break likely
opening the way for a drop toward the low $1.30s, traders
said.
 Euro zone finance ministers have agreed to lay the
groundwork for bailing out Ireland's banking sector with the
IMF, but Dublin has yet to decide whether to request the aid.
 The nervousness grew after European clearing house LCH.
Clearnet doubled its margin requirement on Irish government
bonds to 30 percent of net positions, citing higher Irish
yields over German benchmarks.
 ""If we get a resolution to Ireland's problems, you could
see the euro bounce,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""But the overall
bias is to the downside, given uncertainty about not just
Ireland but Portugal and Spain. Near-term, it has sold off a
lot, but my best bet is it ends the year in the low $1.30s.""
 The euro  was last up 0.1 percent at $1.3509, with
traders citing a large option expiry at $1.3450. The single
currency has lost 3.2 percent this month as investors have cut
long positions as peripheral debt worries mount.
 The euro briefly gained after a report showed U.S. consumer
prices rose less than expected in October and the increase in
the year-on-year core rate was the smallest on record. The data
supported the Federal Reserve's decision to ease monetary
policy. For details, see [ID:nN16142691]
 Markets await the release of the Irish government budget
due a week from this Friday before obtaining some clarity on
the issue of Ireland's sovereign debt.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said talks with the
European Union, European Central Bank and International
Monetary Fund would start on Thursday. [ID:nLDE6AG004]
[ID:nLDE68T0MG]
 ""Investors are looking at all this euro zone uncertainty
and think discretion is the better part of valour,"" said Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""The euro is headed lower and thinning liquidity conditions
ahead of the year-end will exacerbate volatility,"" he said.

 Traders said demand from European exporters helped support
the euro, which was also lifted after the Wall Street Journal
reported Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren as
saying that the Fed would need to consider more stimulus action
if the economy weakened.
 LOUDER OBJECTIONS TO QE
 The Fed official's comments came against a backdrop of
objections to the central bank's stimulus moves that have
become increasingly strident since November elections swept

steady at 79.174, near Tuesday's seven-week high of 79.461.
 Its correlation with 10-year U.S. yields  has
grown stronger and analysts at RBC Capital Markets said that if
10-year yields rise towards the next resistance levels of 3.06
percent and 3.13 percent, the dollar index could gain further.

safe-haven inflows, given the nervousness amongst investors
about Ireland and fears about tightening in Asia could lead to
a slowdown for commodities,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank.

 By Carmel Crimmins and Jan Strupczewski
 DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ireland agreed on
Wednesday to work with a European Union-IMF mission on urgent
steps to shore up its shattered banking sector, a process that
could lead to a bailout despite Dublin's deep reluctance.
 A team from the European Commission, the International
Monetary Fund and European Central Bank will travel to Ireland
on Thursday to examine what measures may be needed if Dublin
decides to seek aid, euro zone finance ministers said.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen emphasised that the mission
would look at what assistance Ireland might require, again
rejecting suggestions his government was discussing a bailout.
 ""What we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way,
over coming days, to sit down and see in what way can assistance
be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with
properly and appropriately,"" he told parliament.
 ""There has been no question of the government ... (being) in
a negotiation for a bailout,"" he said, dismissing the term as
pejorative.
 The EU's commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn, said
the EU-IMF team would work intensively with Ireland ""to
determine the best way to provide any necessary support to
address market risks, especially as regards the banking sector"".
 ""This can be considered as an intensification of the
preparations for a potential programme if requested by the Irish
government and deemed necessary by the euro area member states,""
he told reporters after the finance ministers' meeting ended.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said euro zone peers
had welcomed his four-year, 15 billion euros budget-cutting
strategy which he hopes to publish next week, suggesting he sees
no need for further fiscal tightening.
 But he admitted the banking sector needed help.
 ""What may be required may not in fact be an actual transfer
of money now but demonstration of how much money can be made
available if further difficulties materialise,"" he said.
 Ireland has said the bill for bailing out its banks could
top 50 billion euros but investors fear the final figure could
be even higher given rising residential mortgage arrears,
deposit outflows and higher funding costs.
 Financial markets appeared unimpressed by Dublin's decision
to reject sovereign assistance, with the premium investors
charge for holding Irish 10-year bonds rather than German Bunds
holding at a near-record 575 basis points.
 LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for sovereign debt, doubled
its margin requirement on Irish bonds to 30 percent of net
positions, an indication of the increased risk of default.
 Underlining the fear that Ireland's problems could spread,
Portugal's borrowing costs soared at a treasury bill auction,
with yields for 12-month paper jumping more than 150 basis
points from a tender earlier this month.
 Lenihan dismissed suggestions that Ireland should raise its
ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate to help cut its
debt. Higher-tax countries, including Britain, have long seen
the Irish rate as a form of unfair competition.
 ""Of course our corporate tax rate is safe,"" he said.
 But the euro zone is acting tough with Athens -- on Tuesday
ministers told Greece to cut its spending further to meet budget
deficit reduction targets agreed as part of its bailout -- and
could attach stringent conditions to any Irish aid.
 
 INEVITABLE?
 While Ireland made no request for immediate EU rescue,
resisting pressure to follow in Greece's footsteps, economists
said a state bailout remained a probability even though its
public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011.
 ""Will Ireland dig its way out of this hole without support?""
asked Commerzbank's Peter Dixon in a research note.
 ""Alas probably not, because it has lost market confidence
... In the absence of measures to restructure the banking debt,
we see a high probability that Ireland will ask for European
Financial Stability Facility funding early next year.""
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 Euro zone sources said there was an agreement in principle
to trigger aid when the joint mission completes its work --
perhaps in days -- and the aid would not be just for the banks.
 Irish banks, pushed to the brink by the financial crisis and
a property collapse, came under further downward pressure, with
shares in Allied Irish falling anew. They have lost 70 percent
of their value this year.
 The bank, which will be more than 90 percent owned by the
state following a rights issue later this year, will issue a
trading statement later this week.
 The country's largest lender Bank of Ireland signalled last
week that it had seen a 10 billion euros outflow of deposits
from early August until the end of September.
 But Bancassurer Irish Life & Permanent said on Wednesday it
was confident Irish banks would be adequately capitalised to
deal with any downturn in the nation's residential mortgage
market.
 After Greece's near collapse, the stakes are high. European
Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who heads the body that
groups the EU's 27 national governments, said the EU's future
could be at stake, although others played down those risks.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, said it stood ready to help, although it was unclear
what steps it might take to assist Ireland.
 ""Ireland is our closest neighbour and it's in Britain's
national interest that the Irish economy is successful and we
have a stable banking system,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne said.
 Irish citizens expressed alarm at the developments. ""I was
talking to a lady yesterday and genuinely she was saying 'I
nearly had a heart-attack watching the news, that the country's
going to be taken over,'"" said Andy, a public sector pensioner.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2010 09:28AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Mainstream investors wary of revisiting Irish debt," (Updates with hedge fund comments)
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Appetite for Irish sovereign debt
remains scant among large investors, with many believing the
political backdrop is too murky to take a punt despite the high
yields on offer and the safety net of a probable bailout.
 Interviews with major investment houses this week indicated
that while some hedge funds may have been buying into Irish
bonds in a limited way recently, overall, major investors are
still wary.
 Managers cited an unusual degree of uncertainty about
whether Ireland would accept a bailout and how it would work.
Tuesday's decision by euro zone ministers to send a joint
European Union-International Monetary Fund mission to Ireland
simply delayed clarification.
 Funds ranging from the mainstream fixed income group at
Investec Asset Management to the less constrained absolute
returns team at HSBC Global Asset Management say they have no
Irish debt and no plans to buy any.
 ""There is so much uncertainty,"" said John Stopford, head of
fixed income at Investec AM. ""It is making a speculative
decision on political decisions. We need a lot more clarity on
how this is going to work out over the next five years.""
 British fund firm Standard Life Investment's actions with
its Irish sovereign debt underline that view.
 Correctly anticipating at the beginning of summer that the
spread of 10-year Irish yields over German Bunds was too narrow,
it moved its exposure to underweight against its benchmark,
selling a lot of the debt it was holding.
 The spread has widened to a high of around 680 basis points
recently from some 260 basis points in early June.
 But the firm still holds some Irish bonds, believing Irish
fundamentals are better than some other peripheral euro zone
economies. It holds no Greek or Portuguese bonds, for example.
 That said, the firm is not currently increasing its exposure
to Ireland because of the uncertainty surrounding it.
 ""We are concerned that if they accept any funding from the
EU or IMF (International Monetary Fund) there is the potential
that Irish government debt could be downgraded,"" said investment
strategist Richard Batty. ""This could trigger another wave of
selling, this time from passive index funds.""
 Passive, or tracker, funds follow an index and cannot change
their exposure to individual assets as long as they remain in
the index. A downgrade could kick Ireland out of some indexes.
 
 SOME INTEREST
 But interest in Ireland is not completely absent.
 U.S. investment house Loomis Sayles said last week that it
has been increasing its exposure to Ireland because of the yield
currently offered and an expectation that long-term credit
quality will remain intact.
 Some hedge funds, notorious for not talking about their
trades, appear to be betting on Ireland, at least in a limited
way.
 ""Most managers we know, if they're engaging with Irish debt,
would be buyers rather than sellers, but they would be very
short-term buyers, opportunistic,"" said Serge Umansky, chief
executive officer and co-head of investment management at fixed
income fund of hedge funds Signet Group.
 Even with this, however, the appetite is small. Jason
Manolopoulos, managing partner of Dromeus Capital in Athens,
says Ireland is heading for a bailout but is still in the
""denial phase"", officially arguing it does not need one.
 But the time for reassessment may come soon.
 ""I think there could be some additionally volatility , but
we are approaching the situation where Irish longer-dated bonds,
could be interesting to purchase, with a solid EU/IMF assistance
programme in place,"" he said.

(Adds details, Caspian Sea summit
 By Lada Yevgrashina
 BAKU, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan pledged to deepen energy
ties with neighbouring Iran on Wednesday, signing a memorandum
of cooperation with Tehran on gas supplies and electricity
swaps.
 The memorandum, the details of which were not made
available, was signed during a visit to Baku by Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 Iran is facing tighter trade sanctions imposed in June by
the United Nations, United States and European Union due to
concerns over its nuclear programme, which the West believes is
aimed at developing a nuclear weapon.
 Western diplomats have said that oil- and gas-producing
Azerbaijan could prove a weak link in the sanctions regime given
its ties with Iran, home to a large ethnic Azeri minority.
 ""This document envisages deepening cooperation between our
countries,"" Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said after the signing
ceremony.
 ""It concerns projects in gas deliveries from Azerbaijan to
Iran, electricity swaps and development of railway links within
the framework of the north-south international transportation
corridor,"" Aliyev said in televised comments.
 Ahmadinejad will meet Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on
Thursday at a summit of Caspian Sea states in Baku. An official
in the Russian delegation said Medvedev would urge Tehran to
resume talks with global powers over its nuclear programme,
tentatively slated for Dec. 5.
 Tehran says its nuclear programme is aimed only at
generating electricity.
 In October, U.S. Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial
Intelligence Stuart Levey visited Baku to follow up on the U.N.
sanctions, notably in the banking and investment sectors.
 Azerbaijan supplies just over 400 million cubic metres of
gas to Iran per year, in exchange for 350 mcm that Iran sends to
Azerbaijan's geographically isolated region of Nakhchivan.
 Iran aims to complete construction of a gas compressor
station by the end of this year, which will enable it to handle
gas deliveries from Azerbaijan of up to 1.5 billion cubic metres
per year.
 Azeri supplies of gasoline to Iran were halted earlier this
year after Iran said it could cover its own needs.
 Iran's state energy firm NIOC holds a stake in Azerbaijan's
BP co-led Shah Deniz gas project in the Caspian Sea. The EU
sanctions have been crafted to exclude Shah Deniz.
 Wednesday's memorandum also called for the development of
rail links to encourage trade between the two countries.

 By Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Bulgaria is still interested in
joining the euro zone as quickly as possible despite tensions in
the bloc over the fiscal troubles of Ireland and Greece,
Bulgarian Finance Minister Simeon Djankov said on Wednesday.
 Djankov said Bulgaria was likely to apply to join the

once it could demonstrate that next year's budget deficit would

 ""Our determination to join the euro is as strong as ever,""
Djankov told Reuters in an interview. ""The best option is to
join the euro zone as fast as we can.""
 However, a decision to allow a country to join ERM-2 needs
unanimity among euro zone countries, the European Central Bank
and the EU's executive European Commission.
 Some EU diplomats have said privately that there is limited
enthusiasm for allowing Bulgaria to move closer to the euro,
because of its reputation on corruption and organised crime,
although that situation was improving.
 Opinion polls show public support for adopting the euro is
waning in some EU member states in central and eastern Europe
since the debt crisis first erupted in Greece last year.
 Djankov said he did not expect the euro zone's problems to
make it reluctant to recruit new members.
 ""The euro zone needs countries like Estonia and Bulgaria
which have shown over the years that they have conservative
fiscal policies, low deficits and low levels of debt,"" he said.
Estonia joins the euro zone on Jan. 1, 2011.
 Once it becomes evident that Bulgaria will meet the budget
deficit criterion, it will ask the EU and the European Central
Bank to join the ERM-2. Negotiations on entering the currency
grid may last several months or more.
 A country wishing to adopt the euro must stay for at least
two years in ERM-2, where its currency is allowed to fluctuate
within a certain band around a fixed rate against the euro. The
minister said this would not be a problem since Bulgaria's lev
was pegged to the euro in a currency board.
 ""If next year we follow this budget policy path, then we
will be knocking at the door of the euro zone. I think ... as
early as the second half of next year, we could be ready to
discuss this option (joining the ERM-2),"" Djankov said.
 Djankov also said that Bulgaria's planned eurobond issue
next year would probably be lower that 1 billion euros ($1.35
billion) envisaged in a draft budget.
 ""Better public finances in the last several months gave us
larger fiscal reserves, about 3.3 billion euros, which gives us
some cushion for next year. So it is very likely we will not
need the whole 1 billion, we will need less,"" he said.
 He said Bulgaria would meet macro-economic targets enshrined
in the 2011 draft budget -- cutting the deficit to 2.5 percent
of GDP from 3.9 percent this year and boosting economic growth
to 3.6 percent next year from 0.7 percent in 2010.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2010 07:40AM ET</span>",States chase regional trade deals despite Doha call," * Trade powers push regional pacts while urging Doha deal
 * Distraction or building block?
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Nov 17 (Reuters) - A flurry of calls for free trade
pacts at last week's G20 and APEC summits suggests participants
are hedging their bets on the long-running global Doha talks.
 Both the G20 rich and emerging economies and the group of
Asian-Pacific states in APEC agreed to push for a conclusion to
the Doha negotiations, launched nine years ago last Sunday, with
the G20 saying 2011 offered a narrow window of opportunity.
 World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy says
work on Doha is 80 percent complete and a deal is possible -- if
leaders show political will and negotiators the give and take.
 But countries are aware of the difficulties remaining for
153 countries to agree a deal covering everything from fishing
subsidies to rules for short-term migrant workers, not to
mention trade in farm produce, cars and banking services.
 So a less comprehensive and demanding deal between two
countries or group of states is attractive to leaders wanting to
show they are tackling economic problems by boosting trade.
 At the APEC meeting in Yokohama leaders called for the
21-economy Pacific rim group to become one vast free trade area,
building on existing local pacts.
 In the run-up to both summits and on their sidelines there
was talk of bringing Japan into negotiations between the United
States and other economies to create a Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), launching trade talks between Japan and the European
Union and between Canada and India, and reviving talks between
South Korea and Japan, among other projects.
 For all the talk of finishing Doha, politicians evidently
see more promise in reaching smaller deals closer to home.
 
 LIBERALISATION OR DISTRACTION
 This long-running piecemeal approach does liberalise trade,
if only at the regional level, but at the risk of distracting
from the global effort, said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at
Washington's Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 ""On balance it's positive, but there's certainly some
attention diversion, some trade diversion and some investment
diversion that are costly,"" said Schott.
 Some policy-makers see it that way too.
 ""For Indonesia, we think the best thing to do is to conclude
the Doha round,"" Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said in
Yokohama when asked whether Jakarta should join the TPP talks.
 According to the WTO, as of this month members had notified
479 bilateral or regional free-trade agreements (FTAs), counting
goods and services separately, of which 288 are in force.
 A recent paper by 10 WTO members including Canada, China,
India and Japan, calling for the WTO to improve its
understanding of how such deals work, said the number was
growing and accounting for an increasing share of world trade.
 Many economists say free trade agreements simply divert
existing trade rather than creating new flows of commerce.
 And because they cover only two or a small number of
countries, they impose a bureaucratic burden on businesses,
which have to prove that products originate in the countries
concerned -- no easy task in an age of global supply chains.
 ""Companies are finding that origin rules, as they are in the
Asian FTAs, are too much trouble to bother with,"" said Roderick
Abbott, a former WTO deputy director-general, who says states
should agree a slimmed-down Doha deal and move on to new issues.
 One bilateral deal expected to be wrapped up at the G20 in
Seoul was the U.S.-South Korea pact, sought by many U.S.
businesses after Seoul agreed a similar deal with the EU.
 But the two sides did not reach a deal there, as U.S.
carmakers and unions were still worried that South Korean
standards shut foreign cars out of the local market.
 Many WTO members believe Doha is stalled because trade is
not a U.S. priority, and President Barack Obama's promise at the
previous G20 summit in Toronto to push for the Korean deal,
KORUS, was seen as evidence that trade was back on the agenda.
 ""Finishing the KORUS FTA is really a litmus test of the
political will of the U.S. to continue on its broad trade
agenda,"" said Schott.

 By Carmel Crimmins and Annika Breidthardt
 DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ireland committed itself
on Wednesday to working with a European Union-IMF mission on
urgent steps to help its stricken banking sector, a process that
could lead to a bailout despite Dublin's deep reluctance.
 A team from the European Commission, the International
Monetary Fund and European Central Bank will travel to Ireland
on Thursday to examine what measures may be needed if Dublin
decides to seek aid, euro zone finance ministers said.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen emphasised that the mission
would look at what assistance Ireland might need, again
rejecting suggestions his government was discussing a bailout.
 ""What we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way,
over coming days, to sit down and see in what way can assistance
be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with
properly and appropriately,"" he told parliament.
 ""There has been no question of the government ... (being) in
a negotiation for a bailout,"" he said, dismissing the term
'bailout' as pejorative.
 ""The government is not going to be formally involved in
applying or in engaging in a facility or making a decision of
that type without that preparatory work being considered.""
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said euro zone peers
had welcomed his four-year, 15 billion euros budget-cutting
strategy which he hopes to publish next week, suggesting he sees
no need for further fiscal tightening.
 But he admitted the banking sector needed more help.
 ""What may be required may not in fact be an actual transfer
of money now but demonstration of how much money can be made
available if further difficulties materialise,"" he said.
 Financial markets appeared unimpressed by Dublin's decision
to reject assistance, with the premium investors charge for
holding Irish 10-year bonds rather than German Bunds rising to a
near-record 595 basis points.
 LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for sovereign debt, doubled
its margin requirement on Irish bonds to 30 percent of net
positions, an indication of the increased risk of default.
 The cost of insuring against default by Ireland jumped, with
five-year credit default swaps widening by 25 basis points on
the day to 545 bps, while those for Spain and Portugal also rose
-- a sign of the contagion that EU policymakers fear most.
 Underlining those fears, Portugal's borrowing costs soared
at a treasury bill auction, with yields for 12-month paper
jumping more than 150 basis points from a tender earlier this
month.
 The Irish government is hoping to avoid a humiliating rescue
that could further weaken its grip on power, with a by-election
scheduled for Nov. 25, a vote that could reduce the government's
parliamentary majority to just two seats.
 Lenihan dismissed suggestions that Ireland should raise its
ultra-low 12.5 percent corporation tax rate to help cut its
debt. Higher-tax countries, including Britain, have long seen
the Irish rate as a form of unfair competition.
 ""Of course our corporate tax rate is safe,"" he said.
 But the euro zone is acting tough with Athens -- on Tuesday
ministers told Greece to cut its spending more to meet budget
deficit reduction targets agreed as part of its bailout -- and
could attach stringent conditions to any Irish aid.
 
 INEVITABLE?
 While Ireland made no request for immediate EU rescue,
resisting pressure to follow in Greece's footsteps, economists
said a state bailout remained a probability even though its
public borrowing needs are funded until mid-2011.
 ""There is an air of inevitability that there will be some
sort of bailout,"" said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham
Stockbrokers. ""Why come to Dublin if you are not going to give a
bailout?""
 EU sources have told Reuters Ireland may need assistance of
between 45 billion and 90 billion euros, depending on whether it
needs help only for its banks or for public debt as well.
 Euro zone sources said there was an agreement in principle
to trigger aid when the joint mission completes its work --
perhaps in days -- and the aid would not be just for the banks.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said the mission
to examine Irish banks should be seen in a broader context,
saying it shouldn't be seen as a plan just to help the banks.
 
 HIGH STAKES
 After Greece's near collapse, the stakes are high. European
Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who heads the body that
groups the EU's 27 national governments, said the EU's future
could be at stake, although others played down those risks.
 Britain, whose banks have around $150 billion of exposure to
Irish debt, said it stood ready to help, although it was unclear
what steps it might take to assist Ireland.
 ""Ireland is our closest neighbour and it's in Britain's
national interest that the Irish economy is successful and we
have a stable banking system,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne told reporters ahead of an EU finance ministers
meeting in Brussels.
 Concern that Ireland's crisis could spread to other weak
economies in the 16-country euro area, such as Portugal and
Spain, has unsettled markets and ramped up borrowing costs.
 ""You have to think the market is going to go after all of
the periphery, trying to force them into a bailout, which should
support Bunds,"" a bond trader in London said.
 Shares in Allied Irish Banks fell 8 percent. Driven to the
brink by the global financial crisis and a property crash, the
shares are down 70 percent this year. The bank will be 90
percent state-owned by year-end.
 Bank of Ireland, the country's largest lender, signalled
last week it had suffered a 10 billion euros outflow of deposits
from early August until the end of September.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2010 07:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Ghana pledges pro-growth spending in 2011 budget," * Investments to cover roads, farming, housing
 * Oil gain put at six percent of total 2011 revenues
 * Analysts urge efforts to bolster tax base
 
 (Recasts with details and analysis)
 By Kwasi Kpodo and Hereward Holland
 ACCRA, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ghana's 2011 budget due to be
unveiled on Thursday will include major infrastructure and other
spending aimed at fostering economic growth and employment,
according to a summary published by the finance ministry.
 However it came with a warning that oil due to start flowing
from its Jubilee oilfield in coming weeks would only contribute
six percentage points of total revenues next year and that the
West African country should not neglect existing industries.
 Analysts noted the pledge to spend would be scrutinised for
its impact on public finances and whether it was accompanied by
efforts to bolster Ghana's low rate of tax revenue collection.
 ""There will be significant investments in the areas of
agriculture, energy, housing, rail transport, roads and
highways,"" said the summary, which gave no value to the planned
spending or its expected impact on the economy.
 President John Atta Mills' government focused on narrowing
Ghana's public deficit early in its term but will face pressure
to boost the economy in line with a heavy burden of voter
expectation ahead of an election due in December 2012.
 ""If you look at the political economic cycle you realise
that this is the year the government will push hard to meet the
social demands of the public,"" said Sampson Akligo, senior
analyst at Accra-based investment house Databank.
 Ghana's cedi traded flat around 1.4350 to the dollar on
Wednesday while its $750 million Eurobond yielded around six
percent.
 Ghana joined the world ranking of middle-income countries
this month with a new statistical measure of its economy that
added over 60 percent to its output by giving more weight to
recent growth areas such as telephony and banking.
 
 FOCUS ON NON-OIL SECTORS
 Although purely statistical, the rebasing instantly cuts
debt and deficit ratios that had given rise to concern. The
finance ministry had estimated a 2011 public deficit of 7.5
percent of GDP before the re-basing.
 The budget document said spending will focus on greater
mechanisation of the farming sector; completion of road
projects; the rehabilitation or rebuilding of the rail network;
and the construction of 200,000 new affordable housing units.
 Ghana's economic growth is seen rising from 6.6 percent this
year to above 10 percent next year, partly as a result of oil.
But the budget summary said oil would account for just six
percent of total government revenue.
 ""Ghanaians must therefore continue to focus their attention
on the non-oil sectors of the economy which hitherto have been
the backbone of the economy,"" it said. Ghana is a major gold
producer and the world's second largest cocoa exporter.
 ""This is a much more reasonable basis than earlier
projections,"" said Razia Khan, regional head of research for
Standard Chartered Bank.
 Ghana expects to produce 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) in
the first three years that could ramp up to 250,000 bpd which,
based on current levels, would make it sub-Saharan Africa's
sixth largest producer.
 Its impact on public finances will partly depend on the
outcome of parliamentary debate over long-awaited legislation
governing the oil revenues, with lawmakers split on how much of
them can be used as collateral for borrowing.
 Gold Coast Securities head of research Collins Appiah urged
the government to examine how it could improve its tax base,
with fiscal revenues put at around 16-18.5 percent of GDP after
the re-basing.
 ""Most people are in the informal sector and the government
finds it difficult to tax them, so the thinking should be about
how best they can get revenue from them,"" he said.

 By Michel Rose
 London, Nov 17 (Reuters) - World stocks struggled on
Wednesday from concerns that China will raise interest rates
further, hitting emerging markets, but Europe's equity decline
stopped as investors took a break from Irish debt woes.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher, and European bourses
reversed earlier losses, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares up 0.3 percent, after losing more than 2.3
percent the day before.
 Emerging equities were down more than 0.9 percent, with
South African shares easing 0.3 percent and Russian stocks some
0.2 percent lower, as expectations of weaker Chinese demand
weighed on commodity prices.
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said his government was preparing
steps to tame price rises, feeding into market expectations that
China will intensify tightening policies. There is talk that it
may do so as soon as Friday.
 ""Chinese rate hike prospects are one thing (affecting
markets), there is also the prospect of tighter measures on
inflows in Asia, especially Korea,"" said Gaelle Blanchard,
emerging markets strategist at Societe Generale.
 Chinese shares closed down 1.9 percent, sending wider Asian
stocks to their lowest levels in four weeks and hitting other
countries with exporters plugged on China's growth such as
Australia.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 0.2 percent.
 
 PERIPHERAL SPREADS WIDEN
 Persistent worries still weighed on Europe's bond market,
however, and Bund futures rallied to session highs while
peripheral yield spreads widened, after Austria said the next
tranche of an EU-backed aid package to Greece would be delayed
until January.
 Dublin has so far resisted pressure to request aid, although
euro zone ministers have agreed to send a joint European-IMF
mission to Ireland that could prepare the way for a bailout to
prevent its debt crisis spreading to other countries.
 The euro was a touch higher, trading at $1.3511, near a
seven-week low hit on a lack of a clear solution to the Irish
debt crisis, while sterling was still recovering from Tuesday's
steep decline against the dollar.
 Some support was provided by a Wall Street Journal article
reporting top Federal Reserve official as saying the central
bank may need to go beyond its latest plan to pump $600 billion
into the U.S. economy.
 ""Investors are looking at all this euro zone uncertainty and
think discretion is the better part of valour,"" Simon Derrick,
head of currency research at the Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""They are of the view after Ireland, will it be Portugal?
The euro is headed lower and thinning liquidity conditions ahead
of the year end will exacerbate volatility.""
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell 0.7
percent to $8,095 a tonne, down about 10 percent from a record
high of $8,966 set on Nov. 11.
 Spot gold was a touch lower on the day at $1,337.00 an
ounce, having shed 2 percent the previous day to a two-week low,
while crude oil slipped 0.35 percent to $82.05 a barrel, still
shaky after Tuesday's 3 percent fall.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The euro traded near seven-week
lows versus the dollar on Wednesday, hobbled by the lack of a
clear solution to Ireland's debt crisis, while high-yielding
currencies consolidated, vulnerable to unwinding of risk trades.
 Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to lay the
groundwork for bailing out Ireland's banking sector with the
IMF, but Dublin has yet to decide whether to request the aid.
 That provided little comfort to the market with the cost of
insuring against default by Ireland jumping while differences
within the euro zone on whether more support for struggling
economies should be provided also limiting euro gains.
 This uncertainty and risks that debt problems could spread
to Portugal and other weak economies supported the greenback,
with the dollar index hovering just below a seven-week high.
 Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said talks with the
European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary
Fund would start on Thursday.
 ""Investors are looking at all this euro zone uncertainty and
think discretion is the better part of valour,"" said Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. 
 ""They are of the view: after Ireland, will it be Portugal?
The euro is headed lower and thinning liquidity conditions ahead
of the year end will exacerbate volatility.""
 The euro edged up to $1.3508, off a seven-week trough of
$1.3446 hit on trading platform EBS on Tuesday. It has lost
nearly 5 percent this month as investors cut long positions as
peripheral debt worries mounted.
 A convincing break of $1.3446 and then at $1.3436, the 50
percent retracement of the August to November rally, could pave
the way for the euro to test $1.3334, the peak of the
June-August rise.
 Traders said European exporters were buying the single
currency, providing some support to the euro. It also drew some
support after the Wall Street Journal reported Boston Federal
Reserve President Eric Rosengren as saying the Fed would need to
consider more stimulus action if the economy weakened.
 U.S. consumer price index data for October is due later in
the session and while economists expect a 0.3 percent rise over
the previous month, a downside surprise could lend support to
the view that monetary stimulus was needed to help the economy.
 
 LOUDER OBJECTIONS TO QE
 The Fed officials' comments came against a backdrop of
objections to the central bank's stimulus moves that have become
increasingly strident since November elections swept Republicans
to control in the U.S. House of Representatives.
 The dollar stayed close to of a six-week high of 83.60 yen
yen struck on Tuesday, and last traded at 83.36 yen, up 0.11
percent on the day.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar eased to
79.10, off Tuesday's seven-week high of 79.461, having broken
the 78.90/79.10 resistance zone.
 Its correlation with 10-year U.S. yields has grown stronger
and analysts at RBC Capital Markets said that if 10-year yields
rise towards the next resistance levels of 3.06 percent and 3.13
percent, the dollar index could gain further.
 ""We are certainly seeing the dollar being underpinned by
safe-haven inflows, given the nervousness amongst investors
about Ireland and fears about tightening in Asia could lead to a
slowdown for commodities,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank.
 The Australian dollar, a commodity-linked currency, traded
at $0.9795, up 0.4 percent on the day and consolidating after
posting sharp losses earlier this week. It fell to a low of
$0.9725 on Tuesday, a trough not seen since Oct. 29.
 It showed little impact from China vowing to tame inflation
and intervene in prices.

 By Daniel Flynn and Annika Breidthardt
 BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ireland promised on Wednesday
to work with a European Union-IMF mission on immediate steps to
help its stricken banking sector, a process which could lead to
a bailout which Dublin has so far resisted.
 Euro zone finance ministers agreed late on Tuesday that a
team of specialists from the European Commission, the
International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank would
travel to Ireland on Thursday to examine what measures may be
needed if Dublin decided to seek aid.
 ""What's here now is a common determination that we work on
these difficulties ... that work is well underway,"" Irish
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told state Irish broadcaster RTE.
 Lenihan said euro zone peers had welcomed his four-year, 15

tightening.
 ""Our budgetary policy has full confidence among European
partners. But in relation to banking, steps taken to date

 In an indication financial markets were unimpressed by
Dublin's decision to reject assistance for now, the premium

are for 2011,"" Matthew Baldwin, the European Commission's
director for market access and industry, told reporters in
Beijing.
 He said he would be bringing up the issue when he meets
counterparts at China's Ministry of Commerce this week,
underscoring the increased global worries about China's
stranglehold over the minerals.
 China roiled the high-tech industry and boosted metals
prices in July when it announced it would cut export quotas for
rare earth minerals by 72 percent for the second half of 2010
-- continuing a drop in exports of the material since 2008.
 The EU has said it would demand Beijing's assurance that
China would meet the bloc's medium-term supply needs for rare
earth -- used in high-tech and defence products - during a
meeting in December.
 But Baldwin said the international community should not be
too quick to point the finger at China, which has defended its
export restrictions, citing protection of a diminishing
resource and the environment.
 ""While we are looking with concern at the amounts of rare
earths that are issued this year by China, and we're concerned
that they are being reduced in quantities, this is not an issue
that is completely China-specific,"" Baldwin said.
 ""It's by no means China's fault that it has 97 percent of
the supply, when it only has 37 percent of the reserves,"" he
said.
 ""The international community also needs to look at itself
in the mirror and look at what we can do by way of investing
more in these important commodities in places such as the
United States and Australia.""
 The EU also hopes to raise the issue of equal access to
China's markets at its meeting with Chinese officials, Baldwin
said.
 In 2009, EU outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) that
went to China stood at 53 billion euros -- about 2-3 percent of
the bloc's total FDI, he said.
 ""That's a percentage we would indeed like to see increase,""
he said. ""A number of people have commented to the effect that
often the business environment in China is not as easy as it
could be.""

 (Adds context, comment)
 By Sumeet Desai and Matt Falloon
 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymakers
split three ways again in November, with the majority standing
ready to move policy in either direction, boosting expectations
of no change in the monetary stance for some time to come.
 Sterling rose after minutes from the Nov. 3-4 Monetary
Policy Committee meeting, published on Wednesday showed the same
vote as in October when one wanted more stimulus, another wanted
a rate hike and the rest opting for unchanged policy.
 There had been some speculation one or more members of the
MPC would join the call for a resumption of quantitative easing.
 Inflation, which the BoE predicts will fall below its two
percent target in two years, has held above the target this year
and is expected to remain strong in 2011, making it harder for
the central bank to sanction any further loosening of policy.
 But fears over the growth outlook, especially ahead of big
government spending cuts next year and given concerns about
Europe's economic stability, mean the BoE must be careful not to
choke off Britain's recovery by raising rates too early.
 ""The committee continues to believe that taking any decisive
action at the moment would be premature and is content to 'wait
and see',"" said Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst & Young
ITEM Club.
 Seven members of the nine-strong MPC voted to keep interest
rates at a record low of 0.5 percent and maintain the central
bank's 200 billion pound quantitative easing programme.
 Andrew Sentance repeated his call for a quarter-point rate
hike and Adam Posen argued that the economy needed 50 billion
pounds more QE to alleviate the downside risks from the
government's austerity drive.
 
 MAJORITY ON HOLD
 But the majority felt not enough had changed since their
October meeting and the right action was 'to maintain the
current highly expansionary stance of monetary policy'.
 ""They had differing views on the precise balance of risks to
inflation in the medium term, but stood ready to adjust policy
in either direction as necessary,"" the minutes said.
 The central bank's latest forecasts, published last week,
showed an unusually wide range of risks in both directions for
the economy and inflation, making it more likely policy will
remain unchanged for some time to come.
 Inflation unexpectedly rose further above target in October
-- hitting a four-month high of 3.2 percent and forcing BoE
Governor Mervyn King to write an explanatory letter to finance
minister George Osborne for the fourth time this year.
 ""I think the committee will find it very difficult to embark
on a QE programme while the Governor is writing letters to the
Chancellor,"" said Amit Kara, an economist at UBS.
 The minutes betrayed signs that some members were becoming
more worried recent high inflation outturns could filter through
to higher inflation expectations.
 But for now, most members felt it would be premature to
tighten policy while a lot of spare capacity remained and
medium-term inflation expectations were anchored.
 It would also be premature, they argued, to loosen policy
without clearer signs the economy was growing 'too slowly to use
up the margin of spare capacity' when inflation was so high.
 Separately, official figures showed an unexpected fall in
the number of Britons claiming jobless benefits in October,
suggesting the labour market is in slightly better shape than
many had feared.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2010 05:16AM ET</span>",Mainstream investors wary of return to Irish debt," (Repeats to amend byline. Text unchanged.)
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Appetite for Irish sovereign debt
remains scant among large investors, with many believing the
political backdrop is too murky to take a punt despite the high
yields on offer and the safety net of a probable bailout.
 Interviews with major investment houses this week indicated
that while some hedge funds may have been buying into Irish
bonds in a limited way recently, overall, major investors are
still wary.
 Managers cited an unusual degree of uncertainty about
whether Ireland would accept a bailout and how it would work.
Tuesday's decision by euro zone ministers to send a joint
European Union-International Monetary Fund mission to Ireland
simply delayed clarification. [ID:nTOPNOW2]
 Funds ranging from the mainstream fixed income group at
Investec Asset Management to the less constrained absolute
returns team at HSBC Global Asset Management say they have no
Irish debt and no plans to buy any.
 ""There is so much uncertainty,"" said John Stopford, head of
fixed income at Investec AM. ""It is making a speculative
decision on political decisions. We need a lot more clarity on
how this is going to work out over the next five years.""
 British fund firm Standard Life Investment's actions with
its Irish sovereign debt underline that view.
 Correctly anticipating at the beginning of summer that the
spread of 10-year Irish yields  over German Bunds
 was too narrow, it moved its exposure to underweight
against its benchmark, selling a lot of the debt it was holding.
 The spread has widened to a high of around 680 basis points
recently from some 260 basis points in early June.
 But the firm still holds some Irish bonds, believing Irish
fundamentals are better than some other peripheral euro zone
economies. It holds no Greek or Portuguese bonds, for example.
 That said, the firm is not currently increasing its exposure
to Ireland because of the uncertainty surrounding it.
 ""We are concerned that if they accept any funding from the
EU or IMF (International Monetary Fund) there is the potential
that Irish government debt could be downgraded,"" said investment
strategist Richard Batty. ""This could trigger another wave of
selling, this time from passive index funds.""
 Passive, or tracker, funds follow an index and cannot change
their exposure to individual assets as long as they remain in
the index. A downgrade could kick Ireland out of some indexes.
 
 SOME INTEREST
 But interest in Ireland is not completely absent.
 U.S. investment house Loomis Sayles said last week that it
has been increasing its exposure to Ireland because of the yield
currently offered and an expectation that long-term credit
quality will remain intact. [ID:nN10193757]
 Hedge funds, notorious for not talking about their trades,
appear to be betting on Ireland, at least in a limited way.
 ""Most managers we know, if they're engaging with Irish debt,
would be buyers rather than sellers, but they would be very
short-term buyers, opportunistic,"" said Serge Umansky, chief
executive officer and co-head of investment management at fixed
income fund of hedge funds Signet Group.

expectations that policy will remain on hold well into next year
