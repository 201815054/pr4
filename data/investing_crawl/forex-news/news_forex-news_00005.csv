9,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 04:47PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sudan central bank weakens bank trading exchange rate to 31.5 pounds to dollar,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's central bank said on Sunday it had decided to weaken the exchange rate at which banks can trade their scarce supply of dollars to an upper limit of 31.5 Sudanese pounds per U.S. dollar.
The Sudanese pound has plummeted to record lows on the black market this year after it was devalued to 18 per dollar from 6.7 following a call by the International Monetary Fund to let the currency float freely.
The government has ruled out a market-determined exchange rate but introduced a band at which banks can trade dollars, initially at 16-20 Sudanese pounds per dollar.
That band will weaken to 28.8-31.5 pounds per dollar, effective on Monday, Central Bank Governor Hazem Abdelqader told Reuters.
The black market exchange rate on Sunday was 38 pounds per dollar, according to traders.
Abdelqader said the central bank would not allow importers to make deposits with dollars bought on the black market. It would step in to provide liquidity to commercial banks in order to meet import demand, he said.
The central bank has not specified the current level of foreign reserves.
Hard currency remains scarce in the formal banking system, forcing importers to resort to an increasingly expensive black market.
Sudan's economy has been struggling since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of its oil output. But the United States lifted 20-year-old sanctions in October, and the IMF has advised it to embark on sweeping reforms.
Street protests broke out last month after bread prices doubled, following a government decision to eliminate subsidies in its 2018 budget as part of austerity measures.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>","Asian currencies still cheap in real terms, analysts say","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav S Dogra
(Reuters) - Asian currencies are cheap in historical trade-weighted terms despite a steady rise to multi-year highs over the past year on broad U.S. dollar weakness and strong flows into the region, analysts say.
Malaysia's ringgit, for instance, has appreciated more than 15 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 2017, but in real effective exchange rate terms (REER), it is still 5 percent below its 10-year average.
REER is calculated on a trade-weighted basis against a basket of currencies and adjusted for inflation.
The Japanese yen, Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah are also trading below their 10-year averages.
The rise in regional currencies against their trading partners' currencies over the past year has been much lower than their gains on the dollar, keeping them attractive even now, analysts say.
The South Korean won and the Thai baht have gained more than 12 percent each against the dollar since Jan 2017, but their REER rates rose just about 4 percent in that period.
""If you look at real effective exchange rates, Asian currencies are not very over-valued,"" said Chang Wei Liang, an FX strategist with Mizuho Bank.
""Asian currencies could still have scope to gain, given the very substantial current account surpluses in their economies.""
China's yuan and South Korean won's REER rates are the highest in the region, trading at 122.6 and 110.7 respectively, according to a JP Morgan REER index based at 100 in 2010. 
Asian exports have largely managed to absorb the rise in regional currencies while benefiting from robust global demand and a recovery in commodity prices. 
China's exports increased in 2017 for the first time in three years, while Japan's exports saw their biggest growth in seven years.
Despite the baht gaining about 10 percent against the dollar, Thai exports grew 9.9 percent last year, the biggest rise in six years. 
""Generally exports react more to external demand conditions, rather than currencies,"" said Mizuho's Chang. 
""We don't see currency strength holding back exports in Asia, given that external demand is on an upswing at the moment.""
Regional trade momentum is set to continue this year with South Korea, for example, showing robust export growth in January driven by computer chips and petroleum products.

Nonetheless, the operating profits of Asian companies making much of their revenue from exports are expected to take a hit from the sharp rise in their domestic currencies.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>","China reasonably comfortable with sharp yuan gains, for now - sources","By Kevin Yao and Winni Zhou
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank is reasonably comfortable with the yuan's sharp gains against a dollar that is broadly weakening, but it could become an issue if gains against other currencies affect its export competitiveness, policy insiders and analysts said.
The yuan rose nearly 7 percent against the dollar in 2017, and is up another 3.5 percent this year to its strongest level since August 2015 - when the People's Bank of China (PBOC) stunned markets with a 2 percent devaluation.
Still, China posted strong export growth last year, thanks not only to improving demand globally but efforts to diversify its markets beyond the United States. That push has seen policymakers put a greater emphasis on assessing the yuan's value against a basket of currencies of its trading partners.
""It's obvious that they are pegging (the yuan) directly to the basket,"" said a source close to the central bank who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
On such a trade-weighted basis, the yuan has been remarkably steady, limiting the net impact on China's exports. China's CFETS RMB index was flat last year and has inched up only 1 percent so far this year.
But if other currencies in the basket were to fall relatively more against the dollar than the yuan, that could lift the trade-weighted value and cause some headaches.
""We want to absorb all factors that influence the yuan, not just the dollar... As long as there are no big imbalances, we will not use the exchange rate to adjust trade,"" said a second source.
The sources are involved in internal policy discussions but are not part of the final decision-making process. The PBOC did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
COMFORT ZONE 
Last year's resilient exports may have helped reduce any urgency for China to cap the yuan against the dollar, though trade relations with the United States remain a wild card.
Still, traders and analysts believe the central bank could stop the yuan from breaching 6.2 per dollar, which is seen pivotal as it would match the level just before the 2015 devaluation. On Thursday it was trading around 6.3.
On a trade-weighted basis, some market watchers think the yuan is also still within authorities' comfort zone, despite recent gains.
The index stood at 95.82 as of end-January, its strongest since June 2016. Analysts said weakness in the South Korean won was a factor in the rise.
""My view at the beginning of the year was they would be comfortable with between 94 and 96. If the market pushes it out, I would be looking to see if they respond in some way,"" said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Hong Kong.
The dollar is the largest component of the basket, followed by the euro and yen, but Beijing has nearly doubled the number of currencies to 24 in recent years.
""The dollar is still the most important in the basket but its importance has been falling,"" said another source.
Chinese authorities also remain reluctant to loosen capital controls restricting outflows, highlighting lingering concerns over renewed downward pressure on the currency and the risks of another bout of capital flight like that seen in 2014-2016.
""We should not worry too much about yuan appreciation,"" said one of the sources.

""In the short- to medium- term, yuan appreciation could fade. Instead, we should prevent yuan depreciation.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against a basket of major currencies on Thursday after the Federal Reserve signaled its confidence about inflation and growth in the world's biggest economy, reinforcing views it will raise rates several more times this year.
Traders are now awaiting a host of indicators including non-farm payrolls to see if they offer more than a brief respite to the ailing dollar.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday but said inflation is likely to quicken this year, bolstering expectations borrowing costs will continue to climb under incoming central bank chief Jerome Powell.
""The Fed's message was a little hawkish, but dollar reaction was limited as such a stance did not come as too much of a surprise,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""The heavy selling we saw on the dollar is beginning to run its course, but upbeat U.S. data would be needed for the currency to rebound further,"" Kadota said.
Upcoming U.S. data include Thursday's manufacturing ISM index and U.S. non-farm payrolls and average hourly earnings due on Friday.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 89.127 (DXY) having crawled back from a three-year trough of 88.438 set last week. The index fell 3.2 percent in January. 
The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 109.36 yen , edging away from a four-month low of 108.280 plumbed on Friday. 
It had lost 3.1 percent against the yen in January, weighed by a bevy of factors including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and lingering speculation the Bank of Japan was gearing up to begin an exit from its easy monetary policy.
""Dollar/yen is still in a consolidation phase,"" said Tareck Horchani, head of Asia-Pacific sales trading for Saxo Markets in Singapore, adding that the dollar's bounce was still looking tepid. 
Demand for cross/yen pairs, such as the Canadian dollar against the yen (CADJPY=R), is helping to weigh on the yen and supporting the U.S. dollar, Horchani said.
Some traders are trying to put bullish bets on the Canadian dollar against the yen, after data on Wednesday showed strong growth in Canada's economy in November, he added.
""The demand (for Canadian dollar) has been quite strong, even in the options market,"" Horchani said.
The Canadian dollar  held steady at C$1.2312 per U.S. dollar, having set a four-month high of C$1.2250 on Wednesday.
The euro last changed hands at $1.2417 (EUR=), having pulled away from a high of $1.2475 touched the previous day.
The common currency rose 3.5 percent in January, during which it scaled a three-year peak above $1.25, amid prospects for the European Central Bank to begin normalizing monetary policy this year.
That prospect got a boost earlier on Wednesday after last month's underlying euro zone inflation picked up pace. 

The pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.4200  after surging 5 percent against the dollar in January.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Dollar dashboard 2018: Blinking red,"By Ritvik Carvalho and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The struggling dollar is on track to post its biggest monthly decline in nearly two years as investors ramp up bets that likely higher U.S. interest rates wouldn't support the greenback against the backdrop of a pickup in global growth.
While financial markets expect another three to four rate U.S. hikes in 2018, markets have turned their attention to other parts of the world where growth has picked up noticeably in recent months, particularly in Europe and Japan.
Another factor weighing on the greenback has been the steady unraveling of the so-called ""Trump trade"" - a bet that promised tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal measures will boost the economy - that has fizzled out since last year.
But are markets being too quick to price the dollar as the consensus short trade in currency markets for 2018? Here are nine charts that investors should watch. 
DOWN, BUT NOT OUT
The dollar index is set for its biggest monthly drop since March 2016, and is hovering just above a three-year low of 88.438 hit after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin endorsed a weaker dollar to help American exports last week. However, it is still up 13 percent over the past five years.
POSITIONING
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show speculators are decidely negative on the dollar's prospects, with a total of more than $11 billion in short positions taken out against the dollar versus the Group of 10 currencies. For dollar bears, that is food for thought as excessive positions mean there is a risk for a wider positions washout.
DIVERGING FORTUNES: BOND YIELDS VS. DOLLAR 
Global bond yields have spiked higher in recent days, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hitting a peak of 2.733 percent - its highest since April 2014 - on Tuesday. The rise has contributed to the dollar's decline. Investors should be carefully watching this as interest rate differentials are still a big driver of currencies and the dollar still leads the pack. 
GLOBAL CURRENCY RESERVES
The dollar remains the world's dominant reserve currency for global central banks, with total allocated global FX reserves in dollars more than double of that in euros. Though reserve growth in euros for allocated reserves has outstripped that of the dollar in the past five out of the eight quarters, in times of risk aversion and selloff, the greenback is still a safe haven.
GLOBAL RESERVES RACE
The growth of dollars in central bank reserves has slowed noticeably in recent months as central banks have looked to diversify their holdings into other currencies such as euros or, in recent years, the Chinese yuan. But those holdings still remain small in comparison and far below recent highs. For example, the share of euros among global central banks reserves is still below a late 2009 peak of 28 percent. 
DOLLAR VS. U.S. INTEREST RATES
The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since it started unwinding its 2008 unconventional policies in December 2015, even as most other central banks have remained in crisis-era mode. But over that period, the dollar has declined more than 11 percent. 
TIGHTENING CYCLES
Markets have tended to preempt interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, with the dollar gaining ahead of tightening cycles with protracted weakness seen in the middle and the end of the cycle. That has taken place in each of the past Fed tightening cycles except the ones that began in 1983 and 1999.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
The dollar's weakness has also played its part in keeping financial conditions loose in the U.S. despite the policy tightening. The weaker dollar has encouraged investors to borrow in the greenback and invest it in relatively higher yielding emerging markets.
VALUATIONS 

On a real effective exchange rate basis, the dollar remains within one standard deviation of its median value. This suggests fair value, unlike the extreme overvaluation seen at the height of the early 2000s dot-com bubble and the lows hit during depths of the 2008 financial crisis.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against a basket of major rivals on Wednesday, as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision and U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last at 89.145 (DXY) (=USD), clinging above a three-year low around 88.43 set last week. 
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 108.91 yen . The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2416 (EUR=).
Trump will say in his State of the Union address that he is extending an open hand to work with both Democrats and Republicans, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.
Trump, who is scheduled to deliver the address on Capitol Hill at 0200 GMT, will call on both parties to work together on a plan to rebuild the country's infrastructure.
Traders are cautious ahead of a slate of events this week, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting that ends on Wednesday and a U.S. jobs report on Friday that will include data on nonfarm payrolls and average hourly earnings.
The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged this week, and investors will be looking to its policy statement for fresh hints on the outlook for interest rates this year.
The Fed probably won't make major changes to its assessment of the economic and inflation outlook at this stage, said Roy Teo, investment strategist for LGT Bank in Singapore, adding that any material changes are likely to be ""further down the road"". 
Since market participants already seem to be bracing for the possibility of three Fed interest rate hikes this year, the chances of the dollar getting a lift from the Fed's forthcoming policy statement appear low, Teo added. 
The greenback gained a bit of respite this week as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) rose to levels above 2.7 percent, reaching its highest level since April 2014. 
The dollar is on track for hefty monthly losses against its major peers. For example, the euro has gained roughly 3.5 percent in January, putting the common currency on track for its best monthly performance against the dollar since July 2017.

The dollar has faced headwinds partly because its relative yield attraction is seen at risk as the world's major central banks, and not just the U.S. Federal Reserve, are seen heading toward winding down their stimulus programs.

AUD/USD slid 0.32% to 0.8067, pulling further away from Friday's 32-month peak of 0.8137.
Later Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump was set speak to Congress in his first official State of the Union address.
Comments from the White House recently weighed on the greenback, especially after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was positive for American trade.
However, President Trump contradicted Mnuchin's position by defending the need for a strong currency. Traders fear the U.S. administration may use currency policy as a tool to get better trade deals with other countries.
Market participants were also looking ahead to the Fed's upcoming policy decision on Wednesday for potential indications on the pace of interest rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise rates three times in 2018.
Earlier Tuesday, the National Australia Bank said its business confidence index rose to 11 in December from a reading of 6 the previous month, disappointing expectations for an increase to 12.
NZD/USD fell 0.22% to trade at 0.7309.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.22% at 89.37 by 02:00 a.m. ET (06:00 GMT), further distancing itself from last Thursday's three-year lows of 88.25."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held above a recent three-year low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, with traders turning their attention to U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech and a Federal Reserve policy meeting for catalysts.
The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 89.430, having pulled up from a low of around 88.43 set last week, its weakest level since December 2014.
Analysts said a renewed rise in U.S. bond yields this week lent some support to the dollar. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield reached a peak of 2.733 percent in Asian trading on Tuesday, the highest since April 2014, and last stood at 2.712 percent.
The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2373, edging away from a three-year high of $1.2538 touched last week. 
""There is a pause in the dollar's weakness, at least for now,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore. 
Market participants are probably waiting for Trump's State of the Union speech, due later on Tuesday, for anything further he might have to say about the dollar, Ino said.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gave U.S. currency bears a major boost last week with a tacit endorsement of a weak dollar. Trump later tried to row back from those comments, saying he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong.
Trump said on Monday he will address his proposed immigration overhaul in his State of the Union speech as well as his efforts to lower trade barriers around the world for American exports.
The president will also outline his much-anticipated infrastructure plan in the speech.
Against the yen, the dollar eased 0.2 percent to 108.78 yen, edging back in the direction of a 4-1/2 month low of 108.28 yen set on Friday.
A broad pullback in Asian equities dampened risk sentiment and helped give a lift to the yen, said Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist for Maybank in Singapore.
""There could be some degree of risk aversion,"" Wong said.
The low-yielding yen is a popular funding currency for investments in higher-yielding assets, and therefore tends to benefit when investors trim their risk exposure.
The yen has risen in recent weeks, after the Bank of Japan reduced its buying of long-dated government bonds in market operations earlier this month, sparking speculation of an eventual exit from its large stimulus. 
The next BOJ governor should maintain the central bank's ultra-accommodative stimulus, a key part of the ""Abenomics"" policy mix, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in an interview published on Tuesday.
Koichi Hamada, an emeritus professor of economics at Yale University, added that the yen could firm in the short-term due to speculation about U.S. currency policy.

Hamada also praised BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who is widely expected to be asked to stay on after his five-year term ends in April, but said there were other well-qualified individuals who could take up the reins.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.38% to 89.21 by 09:09 AM ET (14:09 GMT), extending its recovery from last Thursday’s three year trough of 88.25.
For the month, the index is down around 2.8%.
Investors remained cautious on the outlook for the dollar after the U.S. Treasury secretary said last Wednesday at Davos that a “weaker dollar is good for trade.”
The greenback recovered somewhat after President Donald Trump said Thursday the U.S. currency would get “stronger,” appearing to contradict Mnuchin’s comments.
The remarks were seen by markets as a departure from traditional U.S. currency policy. The risk of a weaker dollar is that it could undermine confidence in a wide swath of U.S. assets, including the U.S. Treasury market.
The dollar is also losing its relative yield attraction for investors. U.S. Treasury yields climbed to fresh multi-year highs on Monday, as investors braced for major central banks to begin scaling back ultra-easy monetary policies.
A faster rate of monetary tightening outside the U.S. would lessen the divergence between the Federal Reserve and other central banks.
Data on Monday showed that U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in December, while the personal consumption expenditures price index - the Fed’s preferred inflation measure - climbed from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. On an annual basis it rose 1.5%, staying below the Fed’s 2% target.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies on Monday, helped by rising bond yields and a week packed with U.S. data starting with a central bank policy decision, though the broader outlook remained murky for the greenback.
Conflicting signals from top U.S. officials last week did little to discourage bearish positions, with net short dollar bets increasing to their highest level since October, according to latest positioning data. The dollar is set to post its biggest monthly decline since March 2016.
""The dollar is getting some help from higher U.S. yields and we have the Fed and the jobs data this week, but the broader story remains selling the greenback into any rallies,"" said Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London. 
Against a basket of currencies (DXY), the dollar bounced a quarter of a percent higher to 89.30 after scoring six consecutive weeks of losses. 
On a monthly basis it is set to fall 3 percent. 
Over the last decade, including the global financial crisis in 2008, it has fallen only 10 times by that extent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gave U.S. currency bears a major boost last week with a tacit endorsement of a weak dollar. While Trump tried to row back from those comments, the damage had already been done and the dollar's downturn since November showed little sign of abating.
The greenback is also losing its relative yield attraction for investors. Short-term interest rates are expected to rise in other countries as the European Central Bank and many others start to scale back their easy monetary policy.
Bond yields in Germany jumped to multi-year highs on Monday after weekend comments from Dutch central bank president Klaas Knot that the ECB should be clear on ending asset purchases after September.
Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.3 percent to trade at 108.95 yen , after hitting a low of 108.28 yen on Friday, its lowest level since mid-September.
Comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda in Davos on Friday that the central bank is finally close to the inflation target sparked expectation of an exit from its massive stimulus.
""Many foreign players are now betting on a BOJ policy change. The dollar/yen has no major support if it falls below its September low of 107.32. A break of that level probably means a shift to a new trading range,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The euro (EUR=) traded at $1.2400, down 0.2 percent and off a three-year peak of $1.2538 touched on Thursday.
Its failure over the past couple of days to stay above $1.25 is seen by some traders as a sign of fatigue in its six-week old rally.

In Asia, New Zealand reports its trade balance for December with a NZ$3.42 billion deficit seen on year. Japan reports household spending, seen down 0.6% on month and up 1,6% on year for December. As well, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7% and retail sales are seen up 1.8% on year.
Later in Australia, the NAB business confidence and NAB business survey are due.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last quoted down 0.36% at 88.87.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve meeting, the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen before she hands the chairmanship over to Jerome Powell, will be in focus as well as Friday’s U.S. jobs report for January and Wednesday’s euro zone inflation data.
Last week, the dollar index recorded its largest weekly decline since June, following comments by the U.S. Treasury secretary earlier in the week welcoming a weaker currency.
The dollar slumped to three year lows against a currency basket after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday at Davos that a “weaker dollar is good for trade.”
The dollar recovered after President Donald Trump said Thursday the U.S. currency would get “stronger,” appearing to contradict Mnuchin’s comments. Trump added that he thought the remarks by his Treasury secretary had been taken out of context by investors.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross mudding the waters even further detailing in Davos that ""What was perfectly appropriate in 1945 is singularly inappropriate as we sit here this year. There's no longer a need to subsidize China, or Japan, or Europe with our money.""
The comments were seen by markets as a departure from traditional U.S. currency policy. The risk of a weaker dollar is that it could undermine confidence in a wide swath of U.S. assets, including the U.S. Treasury market. 
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi criticized Mnuchin’s comments about the dollar on Thursday, warning that such language violated longstanding international agreements designed to prevent currency wars.
Draghi said recent exchange rate volatility is a source of uncertainty and needs to be monitored for its impact on short term price stability.
The dollar remained lower after data on Friday showing that U.S. economy grew by an annualized 2.6% in the fourth quarter, rather than the 3% expected, down from 3.2% in the previous three months.

71,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Mega funds bet big on sterling turning a corner,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest investors are betting on a sustained recovery in the pound, confident that Britain will avoid a disorderly crash out of the European Union and that the Bank of England will hike interest rates more than previously expected.
Bets on the pound, built up over the last few months, mark a sharp reversal in sentiment towards the currency from even a few months ago. Then, the risk of a ""hard Brexit"" under which Britain retains no preferential access to the EU's single market, and the weaker performance of the UK economy, dominated headlines. 
Wagering on the pound to continue the slide that followed the June 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU proved painful for hedge funds last year. The currency's rally in recent months has forced many to unwind such positions and others to buy into the recovery. 
On Thursday, trade-weighted sterling shot to levels not seen since the days after the Brexit vote, while at more than $1.43 the pound is on track for its best month against the dollar since 2009. 
BlackRock, the world's biggest investment manager, has raised a long sterling position by five times over the past year, to around 2.5 percent of an $11.7 billion fund. 
Investors such as State Street have also bought sterling in recent months.
""We thought a lot of bad news was priced in for sterling and the downside risks were asymmetrically priced. Over the past few months we have significantly increased our position,"" said Marilyn Watson, head of the global fundamental bond product strategy team at BlackRock. 
""When you look at the UK economy, it is on a lower trajectory than what it was before but still healthy. The market is pricing one hike but I think they can hike a couple of more times,"" Watson told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The slump in the pound in 2016 came to symbolize the economic loss that many predict Britain's departure from the EU will trigger. While exporters have benefited, Britons traveling abroad have seen their cash squeezed and UK inflation has topped 3 percent. 
""We are long sterling in our long term strategies as we think the undervaluation has room to correct,"" said James Binny, global head of currency at State Street Global Advisors in London, adding that the asset manager had raised its sterling holdings in the last few months. 
""While Brexit concerns remain in the short term, we think sterling is still undervalued despite the recent run."" 
But many investors warn that uncertainty over the shape of Britain's future relationship with the EU is making them cautious about the rally. 
UBS Wealth Management lifted its three-month sterling/dollar forecast to $1.40 from $1.36 this week, while keeping the 12-month forecast at $1.36. 
G10 UNDERPERFORMANCE
The pound's performance also reflects a broad sell-off in the dollar, now languishing at a three-year low against the euro, rather than improvements in Britain's prospects alone. 
The pound has gained a fifth from a 2017 low below $1.20 last January but is still some way off a pre-Brexit-vote high of around $1.50.
Against the euro, perhaps a better barometer of Brexit-related risk, it strengthened this week below 87 pence, its highest since June but still far below the sub-80 pence levels of before the vote to leave.
Roger Hallam, currency CIO at JP Morgan Asset Management, said he was, on balance, short sterling against the euro ahead of months of ""challenging negotiations"" with the EU. 
Tepid British indicators point to an economy that is struggling despite a global boom, with the International Monetary Fund predicting 2018 growth of 1.5 percent, less than half the global rate. 
""There is no question that the UK economic data is underperforming the G10. I don't attribute sterling strength to the data,"" said Kamakshya Trivedi, Goldman Sachs' co-head of Foreign Exchange and Emerging Market Strategy, describing the views of the bank's clients on sterling positioning as ""split"".
Confidence remains high over the short-term, with futures data showing net long positions in the pound held by hedge funds and other speculators at a 3-1/2 year high. But longer-term investors such as central banks have barely budged, retaining a more cautious view. 
Jane Foley, strategist at Rabobank, said the bank was getting calls from clients asking for upside protection against the pound in the derivatives markets, indicating investors have been taken by surprise by the recent rally.
That is a far cry from requests for hedges against further falls following the Brexit vote.
BOE TO SURPRISE? 
Negotiations between Brussels and London have dominated sterling trading since 2016 but expectations for a transition deal to smooth Britain's exit have risen recently.
The reduced risk of a disorderly Brexit has pushed investors to focus on the performance of the UK economy and monetary policy, both of which appear to be on a slightly firmer footing as evident from employment and wages data this week. 
Even some investors who are bullish on the UK see betting solely on the currency as too risky, however. 
Alliance Bernstein senior portfolio manager John Taylor said he expected the BoE to raise rates twice this year from the current 0.5 percent, against the market consensus of one 25 basis point hike and for government bond prices to fall.

""It is a cleaner way to play the higher interest rate story via the bonds side as the currency could get affected by Brexit headlines,"" he said.

As was widely expected the European Central Bank (ECB) left rates unchanged, while ECB president Mario Draghi attempted to stifle growing expectations that the central bank is nearing a shift toward a more hawkish stance on monetary policy.
Draghi confirmed that the Eurozone has shown robust economic expansion but warned that the recent surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty that could warrant further attention should the US continue to express support for a weak dollar.
This comes a day after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said “Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities.""
Draghi also said that while strong momentum has underpinned confidence for faster inflation growth, he expected that inflation would likely hold at current levels in the months ahead, suggesting that recent investor expectations for a hawkish ECB may have been exaggerated.
Traders, however, appear to have upped their bets on a shift in ECB policy, which now is expected in March, as they piled into the euro against the dollar, which jumped 0.67% to $1.2498.
A mixed pair of economic reports, meanwhile, did little to improve sentiment on the greenback as initial jobless claims beat forecasts while new homes sales fell undershot expectations.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales declined 9.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 units last month.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Jan. 20.
GBP/USD rose 0.18% to $1.4266, while USD/JPY fell 0.59%.

83,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 10:27PM ET</span>","Dollar smarts from Mnuchin's comments, hits three-year low; euro awaits ECB test","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar skidded to a three-year low against its peers on Thursday after caving on comments by U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin that he welcomed a weaker currency, while the euro was firm ahead of the European Central Bank's policy decision.
The single currency extended its overnight rally to $1.2425, up 0.15 percent and going as high as $1.2428, its strongest since December 2014.
The dollar slumped after Mnuchin told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that ""obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities."" His comments were seen by markets as a departure from traditional U.S. currency policy.
U.S. treasury secretaries have been repeating that the strong dollar is in the national interest since the late 1990s, when Robert Rubin held the job in the Clinton administration.
The greenback had already been on the defensive on trade protectionism worries fanned by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels earlier in the week.
""Last week the dollar was under pressure on expectations towards the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan normalizing monetary policy, but the bear trend has entered an entirely new phase after Mnuchin's comments,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
The U.S. currency was 0.1 percent lower at 109.105 yen, after sinking 1 percent the previous day to a four-month trough of 108.965.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stretched overnight losses to plumb 89.064, lowest since December 2014.
The immediate focus was on the ECB's policy setting meeting later in the global day as markets look for any signs that the central bank is worried about the rapidly appreciating euro.
The euro zone economy may be roaring ahead though the expectation is that a rapidly strengthening euro may see ECB President Mario Draghi pour cold water on the view the bank is speeding towards an interest rate hike.
""The ECB could curb euro strength if it downplays the prospect of early monetary policy normalization and warns against a rising currency,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""Such a stance by the ECB could be seen as a joint effort to verbally intervene after the BOJ made it clear earlier that it does not intend to normalize policy any time soon.""
The BOJ kept monetary settings unchanged as expected on Tuesday and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda hosed down market speculation of a shift away from ultra-easy policy later this year.
Kuroda's comments, however, did little to arrest the yen's appreciation against a beleaguered dollar. 
""Some players are likely to lighten their long euro positions if the ECB shows concern about the currency's strength. But even such comments probably won't be enough to halt ongoing dollar weakness,"" Ishizuki at Daiwa Securities said.
The Australian dollar traded at $0.8054 advanced to a four-month high of $0.8086.
The Canadian dollar reached C$1.2316 per dollar, its strongest since late September.
A rally in crude oil prices has given an extra lift to commodity-linked currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars.
The New Zealand dollar was 0.55 percent higher at $0.7381, but off a five-month peak of $0.7437 after data showed the country's consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter.

Upbeat UK employment data, on the other hand, helped lift the pound to $1.4275, a fresh 1-1/2-year top.

87,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>",White House Says `Stable' Dollar Reflects Strong U.S. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said a stable U.S. dollar reflects the strength of the world’s largest economy and reiterated President Donald Trump’s support for market-determined exchange rates.
“Currently we have a very stable dollar because of how well the U.S. is doing and is as powerful as it’s ever been,"" she said Wednesday at a briefing in Washington, responding to a question from a reporter. “We believe in free-floating currency. The president’s always believed in that.""
The dollar fell to a three-year low on Wednesday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier that a weaker U.S. currency benefits trade and that he’s not concerned by its value over the short run. The longer-term strength of the dollar is an indicator of the economy’s health, he added.
It’s an observation he’s made several times to a domestic audience since becoming Treasury secretary last year, but it took on added resonance on a bigger stage at the elite global gathering in Davos, and comes at a time when the dollar has been struggling.
While it may be jarring for investors to hear a U.S. Treasury secretary discuss the merits of a weaker dollar, it fits with the Trump administration’s stance on trade policy aimed at supporting exporters and reducing the nation’s trade deficits.
Even Trump has signaled his preference for a softer dollar. He said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in April that because of confidence in him as president, the currency was rising, but that such strength could become harmful to the economy.
Mnuchin’s earlier comments added to pressure on a greenback that’s been in decline for a year, with the effects rippling across markets as growth in European and emerging economies continues to accelerate past America.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, also speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in an interview with CNBC, later seemed to backpedal on Mnuchin’s comments. He said investors overreacted and that fellow Cabinet officials in no way advocated a shift from America’s long-standing strong dollar policy.

90,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>",White House Provides More Ammunition for Dollar Bears at Davos,"(Bloomberg) -- Whether or not the White House choreographed the dollar’s slide to its lowest level in three years, the U.S. administration is certainly providing ammunition for those betting that the greenback will continue to weaken.
The U.S. currency is caught in the rhetorical cross hairs after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin laid out the benefits of a weaker dollar for the American economy at Davos on Wednesday. The comments came days after U.S. President Donald Trump stepped up his protectionist push by slapping of tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Subsequent remarks by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that Mnuchin has not shifted America’s long-standing strong-dollar policy did little to slow the currency’s depreciation.
Mnuchin’s comments give “a green light to ongoing dollar weakness as far as the market is concerned,” said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of foreign-exchange trading strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG in New York. “As long as these kind of messages are presented it allows the market to imagine that’s what the administration wants to see. It validates the idea that further weakness is possible.”
Losses for the greenback have mounted since Trump’s inauguration a year ago, with the currency weakening against every Group-of-10 peer. That may have more to do with the vagaries of central-bank policy and interest rates and divisions in Washington than it does with Trumponomics. But whatever the reason, the administration’s acceptance of a weak dollar provides additional encouragement for bears.
“Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,” Mnuchin told reporters in Davos. The currency’s short term value is “not a concern of ours at all,” he said.
Bloomberg’s dollar index slumped as much as 1 percent.
America’s Interest
Stuart Bennett, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA, said the comments show the White House may be ready to use the currency as part of its trade agenda.
The remarks are “in line with protectionist headlines that we have had recently,” he said. “Given the market’s willingness to blindly sell the dollar, such comments only help.”
While Treasury secretaries since Robert Rubin in 1993 have tended to promote a “strong dollar” as being in America’s interest, most have tweaked the message from time to time, albeit perhaps not as aggressively as Mnuchin and sometimes more in error than design.
In 1997, Rubin noted the dollar had been robust “for some time now,” prompting a selloff. In 2001, Paul O’Neill told a German newspaper “we don’t follow, as is often said, a policy of a strong dollar,” before returning to the traditional rhetoric. His successor John Snow was more outspoken, saying in early 2003 that he wasn’t “particularly concerned” by a falling greenback and noting the benefits to exporters.
‘Bad Things Happen’
Mnuchin’s comments also appear to echo the sentiments of his boss. During his first year in office, Trump has expressed his displeasure with a lofty currency, telling the Wall Street Journal last year that “I like a dollar that’s not too strong” and adding that “lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar.”
“The forum and the context are crucial in sending a message that at a minimum, the U.S. views dollar weakness as benign and in the short term, potentially even favorable,” said Alan Ruskin, global co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). “The dollar’s obviously been trading awfully to even what might be good news for some time now. It’s clear its more responsive anyway to negative news at this moment.”

104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Secret to Dollar's Dim Future Found in Last Fed Hiking Cycle,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders wagering on a dollar revival as the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates need only look back to America’s most recent tightening cycle to see just how wrong those bets could go.
That’s the message from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, who see numerous similarities between the global macro environments of 2004 and now. Brightening outlooks in Europe and China, rising commodity prices and scaled-back stimulus abroad are overshadowing continued U.S. rate hikes and fiscal accommodation.
Moreover, a spending impasse in Washington underscores the political headwinds facing a greenback already off about 9 percent over the past year. While lawmakers on Capitol Hill moved to reopen the U.S. government after a three-day shutdown, expectations for the world’s reserve currency among traders, investors and strategists remain depressed.
“The key characteristic of that era was that although U.S. growth was buoyant, so was global growth,” said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Suisse in New York, hearkening back almost a decade and a half. “That period suggests to me there could be more dollar weakness. I don’t see any reason, if things continue, that the dollar can’t be 10 percent lower a year from now.”
The 2004 situation mirrors dollar bulls’ plight over a decade later. Growth in the euro zone has outpaced the U.S. for the past two years, while China’s economy is on the upswing, with growth accelerating on an annual basis for the first time since 2010. Meanwhile, commodity prices are hovering near the strongest levels since 2015. The International Monetary Fund boosted its 2018 worldwide growth forecast to 3.9 percent Monday, in what would be the fastest pace since 2011.
Similar to the prior episode, the currencies of those faster-growing economies will likely outshine the greenback in the years to come, according to Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, which oversees about $83 billion.
“I wouldn’t describe the economy as booming now, but clearly growth is on the strongest footing since the mid-2000s,” said Upadhyaya. “It’s not so much a dollar languishing story, it’s more of a pro-non-dollar story. It suggests the planets are lining up for cyclical weakening.”
Further clouding the greenback’s outlook are expectations the European Central Bank is poised to dial back its quantitative easing program over the coming years, a sentiment that already has the euro on the cusp of levels unseen since late 2014. Though the Fed raised interest rates 17 times from mid-2004 to mid-2006, the ECB embarked on its own hiking path in late 2005, drawing investor attention across the Atlantic.
“In that 2005 to 2007 period, we were definitely at the late stages of the tightening cycle,” said Upadhyaya. “Same thing now. Even though the Fed was hiking more than the ECB, the markets were starting to look past it.” 
Read more: IMF Says Global Growth Picking Up
The fading influence of U.S. monetary policy on the greenback may be another manifestation of the global reflation trade, according to Oliver Harvey, a London-based macro strategist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn). As investors look beyond U.S. borders to capture rising growth around the globe, asset allocation has shifted away from America and into faster-growing regions.
As a result, the euro-dollar exchange rate has become unmoored from the widest yield gap between two-year U.S. and German debt since the 1990s, which would typically signal dollar strength. The rotation out of still-expensive U.S. assets into more attractively-priced investments abroad matters more for the dollar than relative monetary policy stances, according to Harvey.
“We’re seeing flows move against the dollar in favor of Europe and driving dollar weakness,” said Harvey. “It’s not to say monetary policy doesn’t matter, but we’re in a different regime in which relative growth and asset allocations matter more than central banks.”
‘Negative Surprises’
Monday’s stopgap spending bill out of the U.S. Senate, which will fund the government through Feb. 8, did little to ease the political pressures on the greenback that have helped fuel the currency’s 2 percent rout to start the year.
“The balance of risk on politics right now seems more geared towards the U.S. throwing out negative surprises than Europe,” Jalinoos said. It “is the first time that’s been the case in many years.”

108,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 02:38AM ET</span>",Yen turns lower as BOJ hoses down stimulus end speculation,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen slipped on Tuesday after comments from the Bank of Japan chief quelled speculation the central bank follow other central banks in scaling back monetary stimulus, while the dollar recovered losses after the U.S. government's shutdown ended.
The yen weakened to 111.15 yen to the dollar , down 0.2 percent from late U.S. levels, after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated his commitment to strong monetary easing, saying there is still some distance to meeting inflation target.
That helped the Japanese currency reverse its earlier gains to 110.55 per dollar, which put it within sight of last week's four-month low of 110.19, after the BOJ maintained its policy and its economic and price projections.
The comments came after U.S. senators struck a deal to lift a three-day government shutdown, which helped the dollar recover earlier losses. However, the greenback remained mired near a three-year low against a basket of currencies on lingering concerns about its yield advantage being chipped away.
The BOJ said risks to prices are still tilted to the downside, though its slight change to its assessment on inflation expectations to ""flat"" from ""weak"" was enough to trigger a bout of yen buying.
""I don't see anything in today's announcement that suggests a change in the BOJ's stance. Rather today's price action talks more about how the market is preoccupied with the idea that the BOJ will adjust its monetary policy at some stage in the future,"" said Minori Uchida, chief FX analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
The yen has gained after the BOJ trimmed its buying of long-dated government bonds earlier this month, sparking speculation of an eventual exit from its large stimulus.
The dollar's index against a basket of major currencies (DXY) (=USD) stood at 90.49, not far off its three-year low of 90.104 touched on Jan. 17.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term measure on Monday to fund the federal government through Feb. 8 after it won enough support in the Senate.
Still, a boost from the deal did not last long partly because the measure secured funding for only a little more than two weeks, with the Republicans and Democrats still at loggerheads on many issues.
One reason often cited by traders for the dollar's climbdown is that its relative yield attraction is at risk as the world's major central banks are seen winding up their stimulus.
That would change the interest rate dynamics of the past few years, when the U.S. Federal Reserve was the only central bank raising rates.
The euro  stood at $1.2277, consolidating its rally after having hit a three-year high of $1.2323 on Jan. 17.
Expectations that the European Central Bank may withdraw its stimulus gained momentum earlier this month after the accounts of its last policy meeting showed it could shift its policy communication early this year.
But sources have told Reuters the ECB is unlikely to ditch a pledge to keep buying bonds at its upcoming meeting on Thursday.
The British pound  hit its post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4005, helped by optimism that Britain will reach a favourable divorce deal with the European Union.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday Britain would be able to have a bespoke deal with the European Union after Brexit, one of Prime Minister Theresa May's objectives.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",The U.S. dollar's slide and what lies ahead,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar took a harsh beating in 2017, on the way to its nearly 10 percent fall, its worst annual performance since 2003. The currency is still reeling this year. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, recently fell to a three-year low.
Moves by central banks around the world toward monetary policy normalization, increased political uncertainty in the United States and the dearth of volatility across markets have hurt the greenback. Worries about a possible U.S. government shutdown is just the latest factor that could weigh on sentiment for the dollar in the near term.
SO WHAT'S AILING THE DOLLAR?
President Donald Trump's election victory had boosted hopes of American outperformance at the beginning of 2017 and drove the dollar index to a 14-year high. Market participants were betting that the U.S. economy would outperform its European, Japanese and Chinese counterparts and that U.S. monetary policy would tighten much more aggressively than it would elsewhere in the global economy.
But there has been a big repricing of those assumptions over the last thirteen months.
The slower-than-expected delivery by the Trump administration on some of its economic promises hurt the dollar, reversing its initial post-election rally.
Meanwhile, the euro area economy, which had been in the doldrums about a year ago, perked up.
The respective election victories of French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel thwarted the threat of right-wing populism and helped support the euro. This ignited hopes of an end to the European Central Bank's bond purchases in 2018 and a rate hike soon after.
Other central banks including the Bank of Canada, Bank of England and Bank of Japan also started talking about tighter monetary policy and even the People's Bank of China moved to reduce monetary stimulus.
Exceptionally low volatility across the market also diminished the safe-haven allure of the U.S. dollar.
Dollar Index v Euro: http://reut.rs/2BHqgH1 
WHY IS THE DOLLAR SENSITIVE TO CENTRAL BANK POLICY DECISIONS?
Central banks influence the cost of capital - the price of money - in a given market. Rising interest rates boost the allure of the dollar and attract foreign investment, increasing the demand for the greenback and thus its value.
Interest rate differentials lead to traders selling lower- yielding currencies to fund the purchase of higher-yielding currencies.
With other major central banks looking at policy normalization, the dollar is no longer the only game in town.
WHAT IMPACT DOES THE WEAKER DOLLAR HAVE ON U.S. COMPANY EARNINGS AND THE ECONOMY?
U.S. multinational companies can benefit from declines in the dollar, which make overseas sales more valuable when translated back into the U.S. currency.
The weaker currency is also a boon for exporters and manufacturers as it places them at a competitiveness advantage with respect to overseas rivals.
But a weaker dollar makes imported goods more expensive for U.S. consumers and hurts companies that rely on foreign goods, such as retailers. It can also make U.S. assets less attractive to foreign investors. 
WHAT COULD EXERT MORE PRESSURE ON THE GREENBACK?
So far the currency market has largely discounted the prospect of trade war with China or the heated rhetoric around the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations. If the chances of a trade war rise it could hurt the dollar in the longer term.
If the U.S. economy fails to show any meaningful uptick in inflation, which has been stubbornly weak despite the declining dollar, that could tie the Fed's hands when it comes to interest rate hikes and drag the dollar lower. This could be aggravated if it comes at a time when the ECB turns more hawkish.
Investors looking for the dollar to see a boost from multinational companies converting foreign profits into dollars may have to temper their hopes for a prolonged rebound.
If global investors look to diversify their dollar holdings into other currencies such as the euro, that could weigh on the dollar.
An analysis of the quarterly data published by the International Monetary Fund of the currency composition of the world's foreign exchange reserves held by global central banks showed that reserve managers were increasing the pace of adding non-dollar based currencies to their reserves.
To be sure, some analysts warn that the dollar's weakness is overdone and excessive bearish bets against the dollar could spur a short squeeze in the event of any positive news for the dollar.

The rough patch for the U.S. dollar, while not over yet, is forecast to ease in 2018, according to a majority of foreign exchange analysts in a recent Reuters poll.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","At a three-year high, euro faces ECB scrutiny","By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - After hitting a three-year high against the dollar, the strong euro is likely to preoccupy global markets and European Central Bank policymakers in particular in the coming week.
The ECB, whose Governing Council meets on Thursday, last expressed concern over the single currency in September, when it said exchange rate volatility was an uncertainty that required ""monitoring"".
Then the euro had only briefly nudged beyond $1.20.
In the last week it has surpassed $1.23, and is now some 4 percent higher than when ECB policymakers met in December, although on a trade-weighted basis the euro's rise is not as steep.
Its January surge followed the release of minutes from the December ECB meeting showing the bank intended to revisit its policy message in early 2018, prompting markets to price in a 70 percent chance of a rise in interest rates by the end of the year. The ECB last hiked rates in 2011.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the ECB was unlikely to ditch its pledge to keep buying bonds at its January meeting. 
Public comments in the past week show its policymakers are growing more alert to the euro's strength. Vice-President Vitor Constancio said that, while the ECB did not have an exchange rate target, he was concerned by sudden movements that did not reflect changes in fundamentals.
Austrian central bank chief Ewald Nowotny called the euro's gains against the dollar ""not helpful"".
PAIN THRESHOLD
European firms used to express more concern about the euro crossing what they called the pain threshold, curbing exports and so overall growth. The euro zone economy is currently motoring along at a decade-high pace of 2.5 percent per year.
Carsten Brzeski, Frankfurt-based economist for ING, says the impact of a strong euro on growth has steadily faded as an increasing number of invoices are denominated in euros and companies are more active hedging their currency exposure.
""This time it matters more for inflation than for growth,"" he said.
Sustained euro strength, he said, would reduce the ECB's inflation assumptions this year and next - 1.4 and 1.5 percent respectively - by 0.2 percentage points. This would move them further from the ECB target of close to but below 2 percent and reduce the prospects of an early and sudden end to quantitative easing.
Indeed, the most recent euro zone inflation figures vindicate the ECB's easy policy stance. The rate in December fell to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent in November and underlying inflation, excluding volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, was a mere 0.9 percent for the third month in a row.
The euro might not have hit a pain threshold yet, but ECB policymakers will not want to encourage any further rise.
Jan von Gerich, economist at Nordea Markets, suggests ECB President Mario Draghi will sound a shade less optimistic than in December to convince markets that the next rate hike is not coming sooner and to stop the euro from rising further.
""We expect to see some downside pressure on the euro and bond yields in response to the ECB's immediate message next week,"" he said in a note on Thursday.
AMERICA FIRST
The Bank of Japan, with a two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, is also seen keeping policy on hold, including a pledge to keep short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent, while painting a slightly better picture of the economy.
In the United States, whose Federal Reserve meets at the very end of January, data should show an economy racing on, with annualized growth forecast to be at least 3 percent for the third consecutive quarter in the Oct-Dec period.
Consumer spending has been strong and business investment solid.
U.S. President Donald Trump may see such a rate as confirmation that he is making America great again.
Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist of UniCredit, tempers the optimism, saying a range of factors, including inventories, trade, oil and the savings rate, are providing temporary boosts and will fade.
Without a planned tax cut, another temporary boost, Bandholz says growth would fall back to 2-2.5 percent by mid-2018, towards what he sees as potential U.S. growth of 1.5-2 percent.
On the trade front, the coming week may also see more signals about Trump's ""America First"" stance.
U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators will convene in Montreal from Tuesday in talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Prospects for the talks are unclear. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that terminating NAFTA would result in the ""best deal"" to revamp the pact, which he blames for Mexico's large trade surplus with the United States. Economists polled by Reuters, however, broadly expect NAFTA to be renegotiated with only minor changes.

The week will close with the president himself delivering a highly anticipated speech on last day of the World Economic Forum at Davos in the Swiss Alps.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar labored near a three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday, heading for a fifth week of falls that would be its longest losing streak since May 2015, as worries about a possible U.S. government shutdown weighed. 
The U.S. currency slipped to its lowest since December 2014 this week, with investors selling it on the view that other central banks will join the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates, after years of ultra-loose policy adopted to combat the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent recessions.
It was slightly off Thursday's lows on Friday but was nevertheless down 0.1 percent on the day against its basket of six major rivals (DXY). 
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to fund government operations through to Feb. 16 and avoid agency shutdowns this weekend when existing allocations expire. The bill has yet to be approved by the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future. [nW1N1OJ02A]
""(This) is not having a major impact... because we have had lots of threats of shutdown in our lives and (this) would need to turn into something much more significant to have a big impact,"" said Kit Juckes, Societe Generale's chief macro strategist in London. 
The prospect of Senate approval has been complicated by President Donald Trump saying that an extension of funding for the children's health insurance program, a Democratic priority, should not be included. [nL1N1PD0EC] 
The euro  edged up 0.2 percent to $1.2257, near a three-year high of $1.2323 touched on Wednesday. Having advanced more than half a percent this week, the common currency looks set to post a fifth consecutive week of gains, with traders now focused on next Thursday's European Central Bank meeting. 
The dollar slipped by 0.4 percent to 110.60 yen , with its rebound from Wednesday's four-month low of 110.19 already fading despite a rise in U.S. debt yields.
A tiny reduction in the Bank of Japan's bond buying this month was enough to spark speculation about possible modification of policy, even though many market players think any move will be many months away. [nL3N1PC1DT]
""Markets are increasingly sensitive to the prospect of a less-dovish BOJ, which is putting pressure on dollar/yen,"" analysts at UBS Wealth Management said in a note. They added that they will be looking to the BOJ's policy meeting next week to gain more clarity on the central bank's stance. 
""For now, we do not think the BOJ has any urgency to shift its yield curve control regime,"" they added. 

Another underlying factor behind the dollar's weakness has been global investors, including sovereign wealth funds and central banks, diversifying their holdings by switching more funds into other currencies.

138,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Weak Dollar Poses $3.4 Trillion Question for U.S. Credit Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- A key patron of U.S. corporate debt markets -- overseas investors -- may turn from friend into foe this year.
The weak dollar has whittled down returns for unhedged money managers, raising the prospect of capital flight if the greenback’s losing streak gathers pace, warn  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. strategists.
""We see a distinct risk that non-U.S. investors could become net sellers as global economic growth converges and central banks transition from a nearly a decade of easing to more normalized polices, resulting in a lower USD,"" strategists led by George Bory wrote in a report distributed to media this week.
Higher relative yields and the U.S. recovery lured a tide of capital inflows into U.S. credit markets from mid-2014. That eased last year as a dip in the greenback created a ""nasty"" drag on unhedged portfolios in paper terms. 
Overseas flows into the $8.6 trillion U.S. investment grade, high yield and leveraged-loan markets fell by 35 percent in 2017, according to Wells Fargo estimates.
With spreads on U.S. corporate bonds at 2007 lows, Wall Street shares no such fears over waning foreign demand amid buoyant retail demand for fixed income, strong economic data and higher nominal yields relative to Europe. Currency weakness, meanwhile, makes debt cheaper for new buyers outside the U.S., and may reduce the incentive to snap up costly hedges in foreign-exchange markets.
But with non-resident investors amassing 39 percent of the outstanding debt stock after a three-year binge, a ripple of foreign selling could unanchor credit markets from their bullish moorings, Bory and his team conclude.
""A period of sustained foreign selling due to changes in FX valuations could be quite destabilizing for USD (and global) credit markets."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday, pulling back from a three-year high above $1.23 as some European Central Bank officials voiced worries about the currency's strength.
The euro's decline helped stabilize the greenback, which also had brief support from a weaker Canadian dollar after the Bank of Canada struck a cautious tone along with an expected rate hike on Wednesday.
The outlook for the dollar, however, remains dour on the view that other central banks besides the Federal Reserve are moving away from the ultra low-rate stance and unconventional tools they adopted after the 2008 global credit crisis.
""There's still a lot of bearish sentiment on the dollar,"" said Minh Trang, senior foreign currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
Still, the greenback snapped a four-session losing streak.
At 3:12 p.m. (2012 GMT), the index that tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies was up 0.26 percent at 90.629. It hit a three-year low of 90.113 earlier.
The Canadian dollar rose 0.17 percent to C$1.2411. It weakened briefly after the BOC policy statement.
The euro was down 0.29 percent at $1.2223 after hitting a three-year peak versus the greenback at $1.2322.
Digital currencies suffered another day of heavy losses on worries about a widening regulatory crackdown.
Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) fell more than 10 percent to below $10,000 for the first time since Dec. 1 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. The biggest digital currency has lost half its value since it peaked near $20,000 about a month ago. 
ECB WEIGHS IN ON RISING EURO
The speed of the euro's rise in early 2018 - up more than 3 percent in the last two weeks - has prompted comments from ECB officials, highlighting growing concerns, according to analysts.
ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny told reporters on Wednesday the euro's recent strength against the dollar is ""not helpful,"" which encouraged a bout of profit-taking before a policy meeting next week.
In an interview with Italian newspaper la Repubblica Vitor Constancio, the ECB vice president, said he did not rule out that monetary policy would still continue to be ""very accommodating for a long time"".

""The euro's strength will cause some concerns to the ECB and it will definitely complicate their policymaking thinking, and some investors are taking profits after the recent rally,"" said Adam Cole, chief FX strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.

The move was made a day after the Yemeni prime minister issued a public plea for funds to prop up the rial and help stave off hunger in the war-torn country.
""It's not a loan, it's a deposit and the legitimate Yemeni government will not have to pay it back,"" a source close to the Saudi government said.
Yemen has been divided by nearly three years of civil war between the internationally recognized government, backed by Riyadh, based in the south, and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement which controls the north including the capital Sanaa.
Its currency, the rial, has lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar and soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis.
Aid workers on the ground told Reuters they expected the rial to rebound due to the Saudi cash injection.
“It is a strategic move to further damage the North,” said one aid worker. It remains to been seen if civil servants in the South will be paid, which would increase the gap with the North, he said.
Based in the southern port city of Aden, Yemen's Central Bank has struggled to pay public sector salaries on which many Yemenis depend amid dwindling foreign exchange reserves.
The conflict has unleashed a humanitarian and economic crisis on the impoverished country. A deadly cholera epidemic erupted last year, and the United Nations has said that Yemen could face one of the deadliest famines of modern times.

""Saving the rial means saving Yemenis from inevitable hunger,"" Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr said on Wednesday.

155,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Italy's election: From obstacle to opportunity for big bond investors,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan, Dhara Ranasinghe and Fanny Potkin
LONDON (Reuters) - Barely a year after French and Italian government bonds tanked on fears of a wave of anti-euro sentiment seemingly sweeping through Europe, the world's biggest bond investors are viewing Italy's election with equanimity and even some relish. 
Italy goes to polls on March 4 and although anti-establishment party 5-Star Movement is riding high in the polls, a euro zone economic recovery has scotched political worries that troubled the market this time last year.
Indeed, some of the world's biggest investors - who manage trillion euros of assets between them - are considering buying Italian government debt should there be any sell-off in the run-up to election day. 
""The Italian election very much provides investors with a buying opportunity,"" said Nick Gartside, chief investment officer at JP Morgan Asset Management, one of the largest investors in the world with 2.5 trillion dollars of assets under management. ""If you take a step back and look at the health of the Italian economy and the euro zone economy overall, it adds to a compelling case for Italian government debt."" 
JP Morgan AM believes Italian government debt is undervalued and the 10-year premium over Germany could go as low 90 basis points compared with the current level of about 145 bps.   
PIMCO, the world's largest bond investor, is neutral on Italy, said Nicola Mai, an analyst and portfolio manager for the fund. 
""The Italian spread of about 150 basis points over benchmarks is actually decent carry relative to what's out there because everything is so tight,"" he said.
WHAT'S DIFFERENT? 
A strong euro zone economy, which outperformed the United States last year, has changed the game for investors. 
Italy, the bloc's third largest economy, is a key part of that: it is largely expected to beat official estimates of 1.5 percent growth in 2017 and earned its first ratings upgrade from Standard & Poor's for at least three decades last October.
Those betting against the region got burned in the interim. Scottish hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry, a high profile seller of Italian bonds, was one of them and closed his fund Eclectica Asset Management late last year. 
""From an index point of view, the most important thing is the possibility of a downgrade - and the positive economic backdrop makes this unlikely even if there's a political shock at the election,"" said Antoine Lesne, head of ETF strategy for State Street, the world's largest passive investor with nearly $2.5 trillion of assets under management. 
In addition, a tweak in Italy's election law makes it harder for populist parties to come to power, and they have anyway toned down their anti-euro rhetoric.
Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which is leading opinion polls ahead of the election, said last week that pulling Italy out of the euro zone was no longer a goal of his party.
In any case, the possibility that an anti-establishment government comes into power is slim, said Mai of PIMCO. 
""Our base case is some kind of grand coalition government, which is not a great outcome but nor is it a tail risk. It is 'Italy as usual' - a shaky government, not reform oriented,"" he said.
BOUTS OF VOLATILITY
This does not necessarily mean the run up to the election will be tension-free. 
For example, the Italian/German bond yield gap widened by about 30 basis points in the last three weeks of December after the election date first emerged. 
Though a good chunk of those losses have since been recouped, those are the sorts of bouts of volatility that many investors will be looking out for. 
""We've reduced the amount of bonds we have in Italy by roughly half in anticipation of the election volatility and we're looking to increase it again if that volatility comes to bear,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income and Franklin Templeton in London. 
""We still fundamentally like Italy we just think that tactically we wanted to reduce our exposure so that we have the ability to add more if we get a sell off."" 
Even promises of increased spending in the run-up to the vote are unlikely to change the overall belief that Italy is on its way to reducing its high debt levels, said Patrick Barbe, who heads the sovereign team at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. 

""Of course the market takes into account coalition promises, but we don't expect any crisis like what was expected last summer,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a three-year low against its peers on Wednesday, with an earlier bounce sputtering as the euro edged back after shaking off a potentially negative turn in German politics.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.27 percent lower at 90.158 (DXY) after hitting 90.113, its lowest since December 2014.
The dollar index momentarily recovered to 90.826 on Tuesday after slipping steadily this month on expectations major central banks would eventually normalize monetary policy. 
But its rebound dissipated as underlying fundamental expectations that had weakened the greenback so far this year remained intact.

164,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 02:47PM ET</span>","Regulatory Crackdown Triggers Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt as Ripple Slumps 30%","
Investing.com – The price of Ripple’s XRP fell sharply on Tuesday as traders fled cryptocurrencies after the threat of regulatory action grew on reports China, and South Korea were preparing to step up efforts to curb cryptocurrency activity.
South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government is preparing a set of measures to curb cryptocurrency related activity, which may include banning cryptocurrency exchanges. It was reported, however, that plans for increased regulatory measures are yet to finalized.
That added to regulatory fears as China was also said to be considering a ban of centralised trading of virtual currencies.
Ripple (XRP) fell 30% to $1.26 after reaching an all-time high of $3.28 last Thursday, as the threat of regulatory action overshadowed recent positive developments including a partnership announcement with Moneygram last week.
Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell 18.44% to $1,058.90 well below its recent all-time high of $1,423.2 set on Jan.13.
An exodus of South Korea crypto-investors is widely viewed as a major headwind for the Ethereum as more 10% of the cryptocurrency is said to be traded against the South Korean won.
Bitcoin continued its recent decline falling 17.29% to $11,440. The digital currency has fallen nearly 50% from its December peak of $19,891.
Bitcoin skeptics have been quick to comment on bitcoin’s demise as former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich said the popular digital currency was a “pyramid scheme,” adding that he was “surprised it isn't even lower."""
165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Yen Emerges as Top Currency Wager for Funds Betting on BOJ Shift,"(Bloomberg) -- A minor tweak in the Bank of Japan’s bond purchases has emboldened investors to bet the central bank is about to wind back monetary stimulus.
Going long on the yen is the biggest currency wager for AMP Capital Investors Ltd.’s Nader Naeimi. Singapore-based hedge fund Kit Trading Fund Ltd. started a bet on the yen last week, predicting the currency will appreciate about 10 percent to 100 per dollar. Options traders are the most bullish on the yen among developed-market currencies.
Japan’s longest stretch of economic growth in two decades is fueling bets the BOJ will join its global peers and begin normalizing policy as soon as this year. The central bank cut purchases of longer-maturity bonds last week, prompting speculation it will allow 10-year yields to rise above its current target of around zero percent. The 10-year yield climbed to 0.08 percent last week, the highest since October.
“A shift in market sentiment on the BOJ could send the yen significantly higher,” said Naeimi, Sydney-based head of a dynamic investment fund at AMP Capital, which oversees about $137 billion. “The BOJ has come to the end of the line and there is little else it can and would want to do to ease policy further, outside of aiming for a steeper curve.”
The BOJ introduced a policy of yield-curve control in September 2016, seeking to restrain interest rates through bond purchases. In its Jan. 9 operation, the central bank trimmed buying of 10-to-25 year debt by 10 billion yen ($90 million) and cut purchases of debt due in more than 25 years by 10 billion yen. The BOJ has been buying fewer bonds since adopting its yield-curve control, when it shifted focus to controlling interest rates instead of asset purchases.
‘Inflection Point’
While BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda this week reiterated the central bank’s resolve to maintain its stimulus program until inflation reaches its 2 percent target, investors aren’t convinced.
“We are at or closer to an inflection point in Japan,” said Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income in Singapore at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $590 billion. “Changes in long-term policy start in the short term, so markets have to read into bond-buying actions as an early warning.”
The yen may strengthen past 108 per dollar should the BOJ move closer to tapering this year, De Mello said.
Purely Technical
Not everyone is convinced the BOJ is about to start withdrawing stimulus.
The BOJ’s decision to cut long-term bond purchases last week was “purely a technical move to stop Japan’s yield curve flattening and does not signal the start of an early exit from stimulus,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, head of currency strategy at NatWest Markets in Singapore. “The BOJ will only consider tightening monetary policy formally when it sees more evidence of firmer core inflation in Japan.”
The yen will weaken to a range of 115 to 120 per dollar this year as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates every quarter, while the BOJ refrains from tweaking its yield-curve control policy, Mohi-uddin said.
Market positioning remains negative. Leveraged funds boosted bearish net yen wagers to 100,432 contracts in the week ended Jan. 9, near a 10-year high of 118,526 reached in November, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Markets are on high alert for any insight into how and when central banks intend to withdraw the emergency stimulus they adopted following the financial crisis, almost five years after the Fed sparked the so-called taper tantrum. The euro surged to a three-year high earlier this week after European Central Bank policy makers said they’re open to tweaking their policy guidance to align it with a strengthening economy.
“As we have seen with the euro, as soon as the market gets a sniff of a new policy direction they position for it,” said Keith Dack, a hedge-fund manager at Kit Trading Fund in Singapore. “It does feel like this is starting to be the case with the yen as well, especially given overall market short yen positioning and the weaker dollar.”"
166,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Currency Traders Brace for Possibility of `Hawkish Hold' by BOC,"(Bloomberg) -- Foreign-exchange traders who had all but priced in a Bank of Canada rate hike are suddenly paying up to hedge against the risk of a letdown at Wednesday’s policy meeting.
The country’s five biggest lenders all brought forward their rate-hike expectations to January from April this month after the nation’s jobless rate dropped to its lowest in more than 40 years. But the cost to protect against loonie losses has skyrocketed after reports the U.S. would withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement gave investors pause and thrust the prospect of a stand-pat BOC into the spotlight.
Implied volatility contracts with a tenor of one week spiked to 10.6 intraday Tuesday, the highest since the days surrounding the central bank’s September gathering, when officials shocked markets with their second hike in as many meetings. The loonie fell as much as about 0.95 percent Jan. 10, the most in more than two months, the day the Nafta speculation swirled. The Canadian currency has gained about 6 percent versus the U.S. dollar in the past 12 months, and the pair currently trades around C$1.2430.
The market-implied odds that the BOC raises rates this week still stand at about 92 percent, based on overnight index swap pricing. They fell to as low as 73 percent last week after Canadian officials said they saw an increasing likelihood that U.S. President Donald Trump would withdraw from Nafta. Twenty-six of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the central bank will raise its benchmark rate 25 basis points to 1.25 percent.
“There are more two-way risks around the hike than the bond market is pricing in,” said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), a strategist at TD Securities, which pushed forward its rate-increase call to January. McCormick said he puts the odds of a rate boost this week around 65 percent.
Even if the BOC did hike, it probably wouldn’t do much to help the Canadian dollar since Nafta talks resume next week and there’s more at stake in the next round of negotiations, McCormick said.
‘Hawkish Hold’
If the Bank of Canada does raise rates Wednesday, it could signal that further increases are unlikely to be aggressive, a so-called “dovish” hike, in an effort to extend the economy’s stellar 2017 performance. And if it leaves rates unchanged, the bank could still offer a resolute tone on gradual tightening as policy makers must now be wary of stoking inflation.
“In the event that we do get a hike, it would be a dovish hike,” said Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank. “In the event we get a hold, it would be a hawkish hold because in the event of a hold, I don’t think it’s an environment in which they’d want to ease financial conditions. That’s the outcome I would lean toward, a hawkish hold.”
Scotiabank’s house view is for a rate increase Wednesday, though Theoret says “the hawkish hold is underappreciated as an outcome.”
Following the report on Canadian officials’ concerns about Nafta negotiations, a White House official said there hasn’t been any change in the president’s position on the agreement. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Jan. 11 he expects the pact “will be renegotiated, or we’ll pull out.”
The sixth round of Nafta talks is scheduled to start Jan. 23 in Montreal. Canada, Mexico and the U.S. have already planned a subsequent round of talks in February in Mexico City, two people familiar with plans said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling surged above $1.38 for the first time since the results of Britain's vote to leave the European Union on Monday, as the dollar weakened broadly and on hopes that other EU members would seek a relatively ""soft"" Brexit. 
The pound posted its biggest jump in four months against the dollar on Friday, on a media report that the Netherlands and Spain were open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the trading bloc crushed short positions. 
Officials from those countries later denied the report. But market-watchers say the dialogue around Britain's exit from the bloc has in general turned more positive for Britain. 
""Up to now the remaining EU countries have presented a fairly uniform front of trying to make things as hard as possible for Britain,"" said ACLS Global chief strategist Marshall Gittler. 
""If it turns out that they do try to negotiate a 'win-win' solution for Britain, it could help the pound a lot,"" he said, highlighting a report by Bloomberg that Luxembourg's prime minister had called for ""pragmatism"" and wanted ""to limit the negative impact for both sides"".
Some analysts said German Chancellor Angela Merkel's breakthrough last week in talks to form a grand coalition in government had helped the pound, as Merkel is seen by markets as an ally of Britain's and someone who would pursue a mutually beneficial trade deal. 
Sterling traded as high as $1.3819  on Monday, up 0.6 percent on the day and marking a climb of almost 4 U.S. cents since Thursday. 
The pound was 0.1 percent down against a euro that was trading at three-year highs, with the pound changing hands at 88.89 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3). 
After slumping in 2016, the pound last year had its best performance in a decade as Britain made some progress on negotiating its exit from the European Union and economic data came in better than expected.
The latest positioning data shows long sterling bets have become bigger in recent days, with net sterling long bets rising to their biggest since mid-September 2014.
""We see the case for Cable (sterling/dollar) to continue in a bullish mood, however in a more relaxed manner,"" wrote IronFX strategists in a note to clients. 
Tuesday will offer a stern test for sterling bulls with consumer price inflation data. Expectations are for a 3 percent rise in prices for December according to Reuters forecasts; any undershoot would kick sterling lower.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.51% to 90.16 by 12:20 PM ET (17:20 GMT), a level not seen since December 2014.
Trade volumes are expected to remain light on Monday as U.S. markets are closed for the Martin Luther King Day holiday.
The euro hit fresh three-year highs against the dollar, building on last week’s strong surge, with EUR/USD rising 0.61% to 1.2271.
The euro was bolstered by investor speculation that ECB policy makers are preparing to wind down their bond buying stimulus program.
A faster rate of monetary tightening outside the U.S. would lessen the divergence between the Federal Reserve and other central banks, weighing on the dollar.
Against the yen, the dollar fell to its lowest levels since mid-September, with USD/JPY falling 0.48% to 110.53.
The yen was boosted by comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda  on Monday highlighting the country’s economic recovery.
Sterling also pushed higher against the dollar, with GBP/USD rising 0.59% to 1.3807, the most since Britain’s vote to exit the European Union in June 2016.
The pound rallied on Friday following a report that the Netherlands and Spain are open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the EU after Brexit.
The pound shrugged off a subsequent denial of the report from officials from the Spanish and Dutch finance ministries.

179,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Behind the Dollar's Drubbing Is a Catalog of Excuses: Gadfly,"(Bloomberg Gadfly) -- A Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search for the phrase ""death of the dollar"" produces about 168 million results in less than half a second, including articles, YouTube videos and books all predicting the demise of the U.S. currency. The greenback seems to have few friends.
After slumping against every major currency apart from the Brazilian Real last year, the dollar has started the first two trading weeks of 2018 by taking a renewed beating on the foreign exchange market.
The justifications for its weakness, though, seem to be excuses rather than reasons. There's the threat of a U.S. government shutdown. There's a pick-up in core inflation, as evidenced by Friday's figures. There are concerns that U.S. fourth-quarter earnings will disappoint. And there's the resurgence in the euro zone economy, which is giving the common currency a boost.
Except…the threat of a U.S. government shutdown is omnipresent, and has become something of an annual circus. Faster inflation has helped drive two-year Treasury yields to 2 percent, which should attract investors away from the negative 0.6 percent levels prevailing on comparable German notes. A weaker dollar should boost profit for U.S. exporters. And economists are predicting the U.S. economy will grow by 2.6 percent this year, still outstripping the euro zone's 2.2 percent forecast.
Lurking in the background are worries about a trade war between the U.S. and China. China's trade surplus with the U.S. rose by 13 percent to 1.87 trillion yuan ($291 billion) last year, according to China's customs administration.
But with the yuan climbing to its strongest against the dollar in two years, the risk of U.S. President Donald Trump making good on his campaign threat to label China a currency manipulator seems remote, especially since he backed away from that stance in April. 
On Monday, Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret revealed that the German central bank has decided to add the Chinese yuan to the currencies it uses in its foreign reserves. The yuan's share of global transactions on the world's main network, however, remains miniscule.
China's currency accounted for just 1.75 percent of transactions across the SWIFT network in November, down from an average in the past three years of almost 2 percent. The euro, meantime, is stuck with about a third of the market, after surpassing 40 percent for most of 2011 and 2012.
And while the dollar's 39 percent share is its lowest since February 2014, it's bang in line with its six-year average and up from less than 30 percent for most of the first half of 2012.
So for now, the dollar remains the currency of first choice for international transactions. Despite its current market weakness, reports of the death of the dollar remain greatly exaggerated.

The dollar is headed for another down year, especially against the euro, which rose 12% against the U.S. currency in 2017.
Whether it's worries about low in the U.S. or optimism about the strengthening Euro Zone economy, there seems to be no shortage of reasons to bet against the dollar in 2018.Analysts don't expect further U.S. interest rate hikes to support the dollar.
Instead, they say signs the European Central Bank is pulling back on its easy money policy will help extend the euro's rise against the dollar,Citibank, for instance, expects the dollar to fall another 5% overall.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is among the most bullish on the euro, forecasting a euro/dollar rate as high as 1.30. "

183,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Stays Bearish on Pound Even Amid Brexit Breakthroughs,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound has hit the highest level since the Brexit vote in 2016, yet JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). remains relatively glum on its prospects.
While recent Brexit developments have been constructive, the bank sees sterling failing to maintain its strength amid flagging economic fundamentals and a “non-negligible risk” that Brexit talks collapse. It sees the pound falling to $1.30 by March 2018, compared with a median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for $1.33.
Brexit “still has the potential to drive large and potentially abrupt movements in sterling, albeit this shouldn’t completely overshadow more prosaic fundamentals,” wrote strategists including Paul Meggyesi in a research note. “And on this front, conditions have moderately deteriorated for the pound as the U.K. economy is being left behind as the rest of the world powers ahead.”
The pound has been supported by the Bank of England’s tightening policy, said Meggyesi, who sees two more interest-rate hikes this year versus the market’s current pricing for one by November 2018. However, the rate cycle is “inherently bad news” as it reflects high inflation and low growth, he said.
That view contrasts with the currency’s most bullish forecaster  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, which sees positive economic data and a Brexit transition deal returning the pound to pre-Brexit levels at $1.53 by year-end.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro held at three-year highs against the dollar on Monday after last week's surge, its rise fueled by growing expectations that the European Central Bank will tighten monetary policy, while the dollar weakened further.
The dollar has dropped as markets grow increasingly confident that central banks will wind down their monetary stimulus. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.2 percent on Monday (DXY), its lowest since early 2015.
Its recent weakness against the euro has been marked, as the growing economic recovery in the euro zone spurs more investors to rebalance their portfolios towards the region.
Speculators boosted net long positions in the euro to a record high for the week ending Jan. 12, according to the latest futures data. Against a basket of currencies, the euro is at its highest level since late 2014. 
""We remain bullish on the euro in coming months because we expect that the political risks in the euro zone will finally start abating on a more sustained basis after the March election in Italy,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said.
""In addition, we expect the ECB to continue to taper its asset purchases and, ultimately, stop expanding its balance sheet ... . "" 
The euro  was up 0.1 percent at $1.2218, adding to the gains it made last week after the ECB said it could revisit its communication stance in early 2018. That heightened expectations policymakers were preparing to reduce their stimulus program.
Still, with the euro at three-year highs, some analysts cautioned that its strength would soon worry the ECB, encouraging it to talk down the currency.
Against the yen, the dollar slipped to its lowest levels since mid-September, as comments from the head of the Bank of Japan highlighted Japan's economic recovery.
Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its stimulus program until 2 percent inflation was achieved and maintained. But he also said the country's economy was expected to continue moderately expanding. 
Core consumer prices are rising around 1 percent, Kuroda said in a speech to BoJ regional branch managers. That was a slight change from his previous speech to branch managers, when he said core consumer prices were around zero.
""We continue to see dollar/yen sellers, to be honest,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo.
""Let's see if we start to see some rumblings from Japanese officials, about yen strength,"" he said. ""We might see some comments to calm market expectations of yen strength.""
China's yuan  rose to its strongest in more than two years against the dollar, after a Bundesbank board member said the German central bank had decided to include the Chinese currency in its reserves and companies offloaded their dollar holdings. The dollar was 0.2 percent lower at 110.74 yen , after earlier falling as far as 110.6.

The onshore yuan rose as much as 0.81 percent to 6.4138 per dollar, after the People’s Bank of China raised the daily reference rate the most in three months and as the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell for the fourth day in a row.

“The recent advance is unsurprising compared with other Asian currencies and dollar weakness,” said Gao Qi, Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank. “Technically some correction may be needed for a further advance, but a widening trade surplus with the U.S. and the weakness in the dollar should continue to offer support.”
China’s trade surplus with the U.S. rose 13 percent to 1.87 trillion yuan ($291 billion) in 2017, customs spokesman Huang Songping said at a briefing Friday. Bloomberg’s dollar index was down 0.35 percent, taking its loss since last Tuesday to 1.7 percent.
The central bank was said to have recently removed the so-called counter-cyclical factor used in setting the yuan’s daily reference rate, which some have interpreted as a sign it’s comfortable letting the market play a bigger role in the exchange rate. Gao said the yuan’s gains may be “fairly big” following the move.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar advanced against its broadly weaker U.S. counterpart on Friday as oil prices climbed and chances rose that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next week.
At 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was up 0.4 at C$1.2472 to the greenback, or 80.18 U.S. cents. The currency traded in a range of C$1.2466 to C$1.2556.
For the week, the loonie lost 0.5 percent. 
Investors took the view that the Bank of Canada will hike on Jan. 17 despite a more uncertain outlook for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
""They realize, all things being equal, that they have to be more hawkish and hike rates,"" said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Redwood Asset Management.
""It might be more of a dovish hike,"" Taylor said. ""We have to start normalizing, but we really can't be more aggressive in our hiking stance due to some of the uncertainties around NAFTA.""
Expectations that the Bank of Canada will boost interest rates for the third time since July had surged after recent blowout domestic jobs data.
Bets had been tempered by a Reuters report on Wednesday that Canada was increasingly convinced U.S. President Donald Trump would soon announce the United States intends to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the chances of a hike next week have since recovered to around 80 percent, the overnight index swaps market indicated. 
Canada, which sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States, welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that talks to modernize NAFTA could be extended beyond the end-March deadline, a move which might help break a deadlock at the negotiations. [nL1N1P70QZ]

The Balkan country remains the poorest EU member state and needs to work to uproot widespread graft and further reform its small economy to align its low living standards to those of wealthier EU peers. 
Speaking at a ceremony starting Bulgaria's six-month presidency of the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker praised Bulgaria's strong public finances and said all countries that meet the criteria should be able to adopt the euro.
""I did not say that Bulgaria will be automatically the next member of the euro zone but it is heading in the right direction because ... Unemployment is falling, the budgetary situation in strong, so when it comes to genuine convergence, Bulgaria has achieved progress,"" Juncker said.
""It is not quite enough yet and our Bulgarian friends are aware of this, but when it comes to real convergence there has been genuine progress,"" he said.
Bulgaria's gross domestic product per capita, when calculated under power purchasing parity, is at 49 percent of the EU average, well below euro zone member states and many blame that level on corruption that scares away investors.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov reiterated Sofia meets all the formal criteria for adopting the single currency and said he expected the country to be allowed into the ERM-2 mechanism - the two year obligatory precursor to the euro.
""All we had to do as homework, we have done it. Besides we are in a currency board regime with huge fiscal reserves so that two levs are one euro,"" the centre-right leader said.
""As Mr Juncker said, for the euro zone's ""waiting room"" we are ready and we hope that soon this will be a fact,"" Borissov said, adding that member states should also allow Bulgaria and neighboring Romania into the EU's passport-free Schengen area. 
Bulgarian officials said on Thursday they wanted to file a formal application in the middle of this year to lock their currency into ERM-2.

""I am sure that Bulgaria will, or should, join the ERM-2 as rapidly as possible,"" Juncker said.

Sterling reversed a weekly decline as the dollar fell ahead of a U.S. inflation report that follows weaker-than-expected producer prices on Thursday. The pound had been pressured earlier this week by continued signs of division over Brexit and disappointing U.K. economic data.
“It’s likely being dragged higher by general dollar selling,” said Neil Jones, head of currency sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “It will probably target highs for last year but the market is not bullish the pound per se. Political and economic factors should weigh overall.”
The pound gained 0.6 percent to $1.3617. It weakened 0.2 percent to 89.07 pence per euro, as the common currency rallied following a preliminary agreement in German coalition talks. The yield on U.K. 10-year government bonds rose two basis points to 1.33 percent.
Pound traders are likely to continue to focus on developments in the Brexit talks, as banks including Morgan Stanley were said to be activating contingency plans and setting up headquarters in Frankfurt.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 04:53AM ET</span>",Euro surges above $1.21 to three-year high on ECB tapering bets,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro surged above $1.21 for the first time in three years on Friday, on growing expectations that the European Central Bank hinted is getting ready to wind down its massive monetary stimulus program.
The single currency had already rallied on Thursday, after ECB policymakers said in minutes of the bank's December meeting that they could revisit their communication stance in early 2018.
Investors took the relatively hawkish statement as a signal that the ECB will wind down its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.07 trillion) bond purchase scheme this year if Europe's economy continues to hum along, and that it will start moving towards interest rate hikes. 
The euro soared 0.8 percent to as high as $1.2134 , its strongest since Dec. 31 2014. It was on track for a more than 1.5 percent rise since Thursday - its strongest two-day performance since August. 
""We all know that the ECB tapering is coming but now it's about the timing, and yesterday's minutes suggested there's a growing dissent among ECB members about waiting too long,"" said ING currency strategist Petr Krpata in London. 
""The sooner the market realises that the end of ECB tapering is coming, it will start asking itself what the next step is, and that's ECB rate hikes. That's not priced in yet,"" he added. The bank sees the euro at $1.30 by the end of the year. 
Hit by the strong euro, the dollar index - which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals - slipped 0.6 percent to its weakest in four months, at 91.329 (DXY). 
The dollar was also pressured by data on Thursday that showed U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in December, which could temper expectations that inflation will accelerate in 2018.
Against the yen, the dollar hit a six-week low of 111.00 yen . 
It was still down a steep 1.7 percent for the week, with the Japanese currency having soared as a routine operational reduction in bond purchases by the Bank of Japan triggered speculation that the central bank would unwind its massive stimulus.
""Yen short positions had been building, and investors seem to be looking for opportunities to trim them,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.
Japan's economy minister on Friday suggested it was possible for the government to declare an end to deflation before consumer prices reach the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target. 

Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) was up 1.8 percent at $13,485 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. It skidded over 11 percent in the previous session after the government of South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrency, said it was considering a plan to ban cryptocurrency trading.

206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",FX Options Traders Get Wake-Up Call From Central-Bank Signals,"(Bloomberg) -- The currency world showed signs of emerging from its low-volatility stupor this week after the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank surprised traders with messages on their bond-buying policy that fueled rallies in the euro and yen.
The BOJ kicked things off Tuesday by cutting purchases of long-dated Japanese government bonds, spurring bets it may also tweak its yield-curve control policy. Then on Thursday, ECB policy makers said they’re open to tweaking policy guidance soon to align it with an improving economy, leading traders to speculate the bank will end its bond buying this year.
On the heels of those developments, the currency-options market kicked into high gear. Euro options transactions reported Thursday to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. were more than double the five-day average, while activity in the yen was about 75 percent higher than it’s been. The euro surged Thursday, approaching a four-month high, while the yen touched the strongest level since November.
“There’s a palpable feeling that the euro and the yen will be among the best-performing currencies this year,” said Bipan Rai, a foreign-exchange and macro strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “There’s going to be more demand in the options space to participate in those gains.”
The burst of business in options and the prospect of heightened volatility is likely to be welcome news for currency investors, whose returns suffered last year as volatility tumbled amid well-telegraphed central-bank policy. The JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) FX volatility index, a gauge of three-month implied volatility, this week touched the lowest level since 2014.
“The market is catching on that central banks are going to be adjusting policy this year,” said Rai."
207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","Nafta or Not, North America's Other Two Currencies Are on a Ride","(Bloomberg) -- Anyone who thought it was better to downplay the risk of a Nafta collapse got a rude shock this week, when the Canadian and Mexican currencies sank against the U.S. dollar. The reason: Canadian officials said Wednesday it’s increasingly likely that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to dump the trillion-dollar trade pact.
The White House was quick to deny it. And today, Canada said it’s preparing new talks related to autos, signaling a potential breakthrough in one of the biggest Nafta sticking points.
Still, the sudden slide means implied volatility -- a measure of expected swings priced in options contracts -- has soared. For the Mexican peso and Canadian loonie, one-month volatility is trading near this year’s high.
“Markets have underestimated negative Nafta risks,” said Win Thin, the New York-based head of emerging markets at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “U.S. exiting Nafta unilaterally would be very negative for the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.”
Choppy trading will be the norm as negotiators head into the next round of Nafta negotiations, set for Jan. 23-28 in Montreal. One-month volatility captures market swings throughout the next set of talks.
It’s more than a battle of currency traders. At stake is a relationship between the three nations whose annual trade in goods totals about $1 trillion -- and even the business models of companies such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). that have adapted their supply chains to take advantage of the trade zone.
Yet the Nafta headlines also weighed on the expectations for a tightening in the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy. The probability of an interest-rate hike by the central bank at its meeting next week slipped to 71 percent Wednesday from 87 percent the day before, swaps pricing indicated.
“Nafta comments are a bit of a reality check for BoC tightening expectations at least,” said Shaun Osborne, the chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.
For the peso, jitters over the North American Free Trade Agreement adds to uncertainty over Mexico’s July presidential election. The currency started the year as the best performer among major currencies, extending the rebound since September, but lost the post after Wednesday’s drop.
“If true, this is honestly a bomb for the Mexican peso,” said Juan Carlos Rodado, the New York-based head of research at Natixis SA, about the possibility of U.S. exiting the agreement. “If you add on top of Nafta noise the political uncertainty, the trend for Mexico’s peso is simple: weakness until July 1.”"

The Labor Department said Thursday its producer price index for final demand fell 0.1% last month after rising 0.2% in November. In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 2.6, missing expectation for a 3% rise.
The softer wholesale inflation data renewed inflation jitters, easing investor optimism for a more aggressive Federal Reserve stance on monetary policy as investors awaited a consumer inflation report due Friday.
RBC said the softer PPI data signalled “downside risk” to the consumer prices index (CPI) data slated for Friday, noting that the finished consumer goods component fell 0.4% after an impressive 1.7% gain in November.
In a separate report, The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended Jan. 5, missing forecasts of a 4,000 decrease.
Amherst noted that jobless claims reached their highest since September but remained confident that initial claims should return to “normal” as seasonally volatility is expected to disappear in the coming weeks.
The dollar had started the session on the front foot after reversing some of Wednesday’s losses as China rejected a media report suggesting it plans to slow or halt US Treasury bonds purchases, saying it is either “fake news” or based on incorrect sources.
Also weighing on the dollar was a sharp move higher in the euro above $1.20, following the release of hawkish European Central Bank (ECB) minutes.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 04:27AM ET</span>",Dollar regains some poise after China dismisses U.S. bonds report,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recouped some of its recent losses on Thursday after China's regulator dismissed a report that the country could halt its buying of U.S. treasuries, boosting the greenback following its biggest one-day fall in a month.
The dollar has been struggling to gain traction in the opening days of 2018 after losing around 10 percent against a basket of currencies last year as economic growth elsewhere, notably Europe, overtook the U.S.
And while the U.S. Federal Reserve has been slowly tightening policy over the last two years, traders have been repricing market expectations of when Europe and Japan will follow suit. 
Bloomberg News had reported on Wednesday that Chinese officials reviewing the country's foreign exchange holdings had recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing 10-year yields higher and the dollar lower. 
China's foreign exchange regulator said the report could be based on erroneous information, adding that the country was diversifying its forex to safeguard their value.
The dollar then rallied and was up 0.4 percent against the yen, although the U.S. currency is still down more than 1 percent against the yen this week after markets bet the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could start to tighten monetary policy faster than expected.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar was up 0.2 percent on Thursday, off the previous day's near three-month lows. 
Many analysts remain bearish.
""We go into the year on the proviso that the while the dollar may have become a little oversold and due a moderate correction, we favor the dollar structural depreciation to extend,"" Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at London-based CIBC Capital Markets, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. 
""While we favor another year of euro gains these will be less pronounced than in 2017. We do however favor yen outperformance as assume that investors have become overly complacent as regards BoJ policy.""
The dollar was flat against the euro , holding below the key level of $1.20 before the publication of the minutes of the last European Central Bank meeting in December, when policymakers held monetary policy unchanged.
Market sentiment seems tilted toward the dollar's downside, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""Market reaction to dollar-buying factors has been subdued, while market reactions to dollar-selling, and yen-buying factors, have been more vivid,"" Murata said.
The Canadian dollar  weakened to its lowest level this year, before recovering, as worries of a U.S. withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement moderated bets that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next week. 
The Australian dollar touched its highest levels in nearly three months at $0.7887  after data showed that Australian retail sales recorded the biggest monthly rise in four years in November.
Bitcoin tumbled another 10 percent after South Korea said it would move to ban cryptocurrency trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after a report that China was ready to slow or halt its U.S. treasury purchases, with the greenback on track to post its biggest single-day drop against the Japanese yen in seven weeks.
Officials reviewing China's foreign-exchange holdings have recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. government bonds, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Against a basket of currencies (DXY), the dollar was down 0.38 percent.
""The dollar was already notably weak ahead of today, despite the fact that U.S. data remained strong and yields continued to rise,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.
""This change of dynamic suggests we may be in the midst of a regime change in the market where the dollar actually falls as U.S. yields rise on fears of deficit expansion and debasement of the currency,"" said.
The dollar had been on the back foot even before the news report as the Bank of Japan's move to trim its purchases of long-dated government bonds (JGB) this week reverberated across currency markets. On Tuesday, the dollar fell 0.39 percent against the yen.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen jumped on Tuesday after the Bank of Japan trimmed its buying of long-dated Japanese government bonds in market operations, helping to stoke speculation about a future exit from its massive stimulus policy.
The yen rose about 0.4 percent to 112.62 yen to the dollar <JPY=>, bouncing back further from its two-week low of 113.40 per dollar touched on Monday.
""The BOJ's operation was a trigger for the yen's gains, although I suspect there were a lot of New Year flows given today was the first business day for quite a lot of people,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX/equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""I think it is still too early for the BOJ to clarify its stance towards an exit from the current policy,"" he said.
The BOJ trimmed the amount it bought in Japanese government bonds of 10 to 25 years left to maturity and those of 25 to 40 years to maturity by 10 billion yen ($88.39 million) each from its previous operations. [L4N1P4168]
Since it adopted the yield curve control policy in 2016, the BOJ has occasionally tweaked its bond operations, with officials saying any changes are meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy.
While Tuesday's move was considered largely technical, it surprised some market players.
The euro languished on Tuesday after slipping from last week's high as investors were cautious after a months-long rally, while the dollar firmed against the yen though a lack of catalysts tempered its momentum.
The euro <EUR=> traded at $1.1971, little changed in Asia after having slipped 0.5 percent on Monday, its largest daily drop since late October.
Analysts said a correction was inevitable for the common currency after its rally over the past couple months to near its 2017 peak of $1.2092, thanks to signs of acceleration in the euro zone economy.
Speculators' net long position in euro/dollar futures in Chicago reached a record high last week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday, pointing to potential for profit-taking.
""The euro is going through a consolidation after it had reached high levels above $1.2. Friday's euro zone inflation data was somewhat weaker than expected,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX and rates strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""Going forward, the market's outlook depends more on U.S. factors, such as whether the Fed raises interest rates three times or more, and also the impact of the tax reform,"" he said.
While many Federal Reserve officials have said they expect three rate hikes this year, markets are not fully convinced as inflation remains tame despite very tight labor market conditions.
Indeed, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, a voter on interest rate policy this year, said on Monday that the Fed may only need to raise interest rates two times in 2018 given weak price pressures.
Such doubts have held the dollar index down near its lowest levels since 2015 during the past few months.
The index stood at 92.239 (DXY), after having fallen to 91.751 last week, not far from its 2-3/4-year low of 91.011 touched last September and way below its 2017 high of 102.26.

243,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",Yen's Spike Shows Taste of What Comes When BOJ Really Does Shift,"(Bloomberg) -- A minor tweak in a regular Bank of Japan bond-purchase operation on Tuesday was enough to send the yen climbing the most in almost a month, even though evidence weighs overwhelmingly against the adjustment signifying anything meaningful.
What the yen’s spike does show is just how big a move will come whenever the central bank does telegraph a fine-tuning in its stimulus program. Tuesday’s gain was as big as 0.5 percent against the dollar, in wake of the BOJ trimming purchases of bonds dated in 10-to-25 years by 10 billion yen ($89 million) compared with its previous operation.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last January, in wake of speculation about the significance of similar mechanical tweaks, that such operational tweaks don’t send any signals on policy intentions. Just in the past two weeks, he emphasized that policy makers are far from their 2 percent inflation target and that Japan’s ""deflationary mindset"" isn’t easily going away -- no indication of any appetite to scale back stimulus.
Tuesday’s move was minor compared with what happened to the euro on June 27, when traders interpreted comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi as a sign that ECB tapering was coming. The euro surged 1.4 percent that day, and has remained stronger ever since.
The prospect of similar appreciation in the yen could itself reduce chances of the BOJ engaging in fine tuning of its policy keeping 10-year government bond yields around zero. Moves like Tuesday’s help explain why Kuroda hasn’t been willing to drop the annual 80 trillion yen bond-buying target from policy statements -- even though the actual purchases are now far below that pace.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 03:19PM ET</span>",Dollar gains as euro rally falters,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a more than one-week high against a basket of other major currencies on Monday, helped by a pullback in the euro as investors took profits after the common currency's recent rally.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.46 percent at 92.368.
The euro  slipped 0.57 percent to $1.196. It had hit a nearly four-month high of $1.2089 on Thursday.
""The euro got a little bit over its skies when it traded over $1.20,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York.
""It's a little bit of profit-taking and some healthy correction going on the euro's side, which is driving some of the dollar trades,"" he said.
The euro, which has rallied in recent weeks on expectations for a shift in European Central Bank monetary policy this year, was on a weaker footing after a cooler-than-expected reading of the euro zone's December consumer price index on Friday.
Lackluster inflation pressure in Europe has been accompanied by a strengthening economic recovery across the continent and solid economic growth in China and the United States, fueling risk appetite.
The dollar found some support after generally solid U.S. economic data last week.
""The dollar selling that has been going on since Christmas got a little bit overdone, and we are sort of taking some of that back,"" Bechtel said.
The dollar has too many tailwinds for a meaningful correction, Bechtel said, citing a tightening Federal Reserve, tax-driven dollar repatriation flows and strength in the U.S. economy.
Sterling climbed against the broadly weaker euro, after a Cabinet reshuffle alleviated some of the political uncertainty that has pressured the UK currency in recent months.
The Canadian dollar  was slightly weaker against its U.S. counterpart. Canadian companies remain optimistic about future sales despite some moderation from highs, and signs of capacity pressures and labor shortages have picked up, the Bank of Canada said on Monday. [nL1N1P30JL]
Bitcoin sank after website CoinMarketCap, which shows real-time prices and market capitalizations for more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies, removed prices from South Korean exchanges from its calculations of digital currency rates.

260,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar Turns Positive, Shrugs Off Weak Jobs Report","Investing.com – The dollar turned positive against a basket of major currencies shrugging off weaker-than-expected payrolls data but gains were capped by a surge in the Canadian dollar amid bullish employment data.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.13% to 91.71.
The dollar held gains despite falling expectations for a more rapid pace of US rate hikes after the economy created fewer jobs than expected.
The Labor Departed reported the US economy created just 148,000 jobs in December, below the 190,000 jobs expected by economists, while wage growth, was in line with expectations, rising 0.3%.
The subdued jobs report reduced investor expectations for a more aggressive path to higher interest rates, said TD Securities, as the Federal Reserve would likely need to see more “convincing evidence” of inflationary pressures prior to raising rates in March.
Other market participants, however, downplayed the impact of the report.

261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Trump Is Probably to Blame for a Weak Dollar: Leonid Bershidsky,"(Bloomberg View) -- President Donald Trump keeps bragging about the stock index gains since his election. He did so again on Friday, claiming he'd helped create ""six trillion dollars in value."" Be that as it may, it's also likely that Trump is at least partially responsible for the dollar's weak performance in 2017, which, from an international perspective, wiped out much of that ""value.""
Last year, the U.S. dollar lost 10 percent against the euro and 5.5 percent against the renminbi. It was the second worst performer among major currencies after the New Zealand dollar, and its drop was the steepest in more than a decade despite three interest rate hikes and the passage of Trump's tax reform, which could logically be expected to drive the dollar's value upward. This happened for a complex set of reasons which may include the dollar's popularity as a funding tool for foreign companies and governments, but Trumps's effect on his country's global standing must be a key driver of the dollar's decline.
In a 2017 paper, Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley, and Arnaud Mehl and Livia Chitu of the European Central Bank developed a ""Mercury and Mars"" hypothesis about the value of reserve currencies. They wrote that there are two sides to a currency's appeal. The Mercury side is economic: It's all about safety, liquidity, network effects and economic connections. The Mars side is geopolitical: It reflects the issuing country's strategic, diplomatic and military power.
The researchers attempted to quantify this duality by looking at the composition of nations' currency reserves. They found that as long ago as between 1890 and 1913, countries were more likely to hold reserves in the currencies of their defense pact partners, even when purely economic choice would have dictated otherwise. The same is still true, with a nuclear-era twist. Nations such as Japan and South Korea, dependent on the U.S. for security, hold a greater share of reserves in dollars than France, Russia or China, which possess their own nuclear deterrent. Eichengreen, Mehl and Chitu developed a model to predict the composition of countries' foreign reserves with and without the ""Mars effect"" and found that for America's security dependents, the actual share of dollar holdings (shown on the chart below) was always higher than the model's highest predictions:
Eichengreen and collaborators argued that the dollar's ""security premium"" accounts for a significant part of its attractiveness as a reserve currency. Losing it would mean a 30 percentage point reduction in the share of U.S. currency in nations' reserves. Isolationist ""America First"" policies would certainly seem to undermine the ""security premium."" Einchengreen, Mehl and Chitu wrote:
The dollar’s dominance as an international unit is buttressed by the country’s role as a global power guaranteeing the security of allied nations. If that role were seen as less sure and that security guarantee as less ironclad, because the U.S. was disengaging from global geopolitics in favor of more stand-alone, inward-looking policies, the security premium enjoyed by the U.S. dollar could diminish. Our estimates suggest, in this scenario, that $750 billion worth of official U.S. dollar-denominated assets – equivalent to 5 percent of US marketable public debt – would be liquidated and invested into other currencies such as the yen, the euro or the renminbi.
All year, the Trump administration has blown hot and cold on its commitment to alliances, to the point that any assurances it makes today can't be taken at face value. Trump's quick temper and his willingness to play the ""whose nuclear button is bigger"" game haven't helped bolster the U.S. reputation as a security guarantor. The constant leaks pointing to Trump's incompetence, such as the new Michael Wolff book, appropriately titled ""Fire and Fury,"" also detract from the dollar's reputation as a safe asset.
No wonder its share of global foreign exchange reserves, as reported to the International Monetary Fund, stood by the end of the third quarter of 2017 at the lowest level since the middle of 2014. It declined throughout the first three quarters of last year.
That share still stands at 63.5 percent, dwarfing other reserve currencies. Central Banks hold $6.13 trillion. It would take many years or even more drastic shake-ups to destroy both the ""Mercury"" and the ""Mars"" advantages of the U.S. juggernaut. But the slight shift in favor of other currencies reflects a perception that making bigger bets on the U.S. might be unsafe. That's likely one of the motives behind other reserve currencies' exchange rate gains relative to the dollar.
Trump, of course, has spoken out in favor of a weak dollar because it helps trade competitiveness. But the U.S. currency is not weakening because of any consistent policy. On the contrary, it's Trump's loose cannon behavior that's undermining it. An unhinged Mars is beating up Mercury in a fit of fire and fury.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened to a three-month high against its U.S. counterpart on Friday after stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data boosted expectations for a Bank of Canada interest rate hike as soon as this month.
The Canadian economy added almost 80,000 jobs for the second month in a row in December on a surge in part-time employment, and the jobless rate dipped to a 41-year low of 5.7 percent, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had expected a modest gain of 1,000 jobs.
""It certainly fits with a central bank that is likely to lift rates this quarter,"" said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. 
Chances of a hike at the next rate decision on Jan. 17 rose to more than 60 percent from 35 percent before the data, the overnight index swaps market indicated. 
In separate data, Canada's trade deficit in November widened to C$2.54 billion as both exports and imports benefited from increased activity in the automotive industry, Statistics Canada said.
At 9:17 a.m. EST (1417 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was trading at C$1.2379 to the greenback, or 80.78 U.S. cents, up 0.9 percent.
The currency touched its strongest since Sept. 27 at C$1.2355.
Still, analysts in a Reuters poll say that an uncertain outlook for the North American Free Trade agreement could weigh on the loonie over the coming months.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) pared gains against a basket of major currencies on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in December.

270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Angola Joins Long List of Oil Producers in Scrapping Dollar Peg,"(Bloomberg) -- Angola is poised to become the latest emerging-market nation to dispense with a pegged currency, another sign that a four-year slide in oil prices has battered exporters in the $2.2 trillion-a-year market.
The southern African nation, an OPEC member, said this week that it would let the kwanza trade within a new band. The rate at which it was fixed against the dollar since April 2016 “does not reflect the truth,” according to central bank Governor Jose Massano.
It joins a long list of commodity exporters -- from Russia to Egypt, Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Uzbekistan -- that have floated or devalued currencies in a bid to end crippling shortages of foreign exchange and to revive economic growth.
“It was a long time coming,” said Kaan Nazli, a strategist at Neuberger Berman in The Hague, which manages almost $300 billion, including Angolan bonds.
The move underlines just how forcibly President Joao Lourenco is trying to bolster his nation’s finances, three months after he replaced Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the ruler for almost four decades.
Angola, which relies on oil for more than 90 percent of exports, kept a tight grip on its currency as the commodity slid. While the kwanza has already weakened 40 percent to 166 per dollar since mid-2014, analysts say it’s still too strong. Charles Robertson, Renaissance Capital’s chief economist, said in a note Thursday that the kwanza was the most overvalued of the more than 50 currencies he analyzes and that its fair value was 348 to the greenback.
The currency has tumbled to 430 on the black market as dollars run dry, leaving hundreds of companies struggling to pay foreign workers and overseas suppliers. Economic growth fell to zero in 2016 after averaging almost 9 percent per year during the previous decade.
Angola has bled reserves -- which more than halved in the past four years to the lowest since 2010 -- to defend the peg. The dos Santos administration said it was the best way for the import-dependent nation to curb inflation, which stands at 28 percent.
It could take a currency depreciation of 30 percent during the next year to improve Angola’s fiscal balances while also ensuring foreign debts remain manageable, according to Neuberger Berman’s Nazli.
Still, a devaluation alone may not be enough given the nation’s tight capital account controls and lack of kwanza-denominated securities to attract investors, according to Paarl, South Africa-based NKC African Economics. Angola is one of the few major African economies that lacks a stock exchange.
“While a more liberal stance on the kwanza is certainly welcome, we would argue against an immediate move toward a completely free float,” NKC analyst Cobus de Hart said in a note Thursday. That would raise the risk of the currency “spiraling out of control” and it “may not lead to a significant amount of foreign-exchange inflows initially due to the lack of developed stock and domestic debt markets.”
Finance Minister Archer Mangueira said late Wednesday that he would also “renegotiate our debt with our main partners throughout 2018.”
After his statement, yields on the government’s dollar-denominated $438 million of securities due in 2019 rose 25 basis points, although yields fell on its $1.5 billion of Eurobonds due in 2025. The Finance Ministry later said it was committed to servicing both foreign and local debt.
Much of Angola’s roughly $40 billion of foreign debt is in the form of bilateral lines from nations such as China or loans taken on by state oil company Sonangol.
“The government is more likely to focus on renegotiating the Chinese loans and the debts taken on by Sonangol,” said Nazli. “The Eurobonds only make up a small proportion of the external debt.”

273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Mexican Peso Seen Being Reinvented as World-Beating Currency,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the concern that the U.S. might dump Nafta or that Mexico’s next president could upend economic policy, the peso is forecast to be the world’s best-performing major currency in the first half of 2018.
True, the expected gain is due in no small part to how much it sank at the end of last year. The peso tumbled to a nine-month low against the dollar on Dec. 26, capping a four-month decline fueled by worries Donald Trump will pull out of the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, and that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could win election in July. The peso lost a third of its value during the past four years, when it was the worst performer among the world’s most-traded currencies.
Yet the forecast also reflects Mexico’s growth potential, stronger fiscal position and narrowing current account deficit, particularly as the year wears on, said Ernesto Revilla, who heads Latin America economics at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). His bank expects the peso to rally more than 5 percent during the next six months to a year, and to reach 17 per dollar -- 14 percent stronger -- beyond a year, or in the ""long term.""
""There definitely has been some overshooting, not explained by fundamentals, but explained by overall emerging-market behavior and some concerns of Nafta and the election,"" said Revilla, a former chief economist at Mexico’s Finance Ministry. ""The Mexican peso still looks cheap relative to its long-term value.""
The peso rose 0.4 percent at 11:20 A.M. in New York, extending a four-day winning streak.While the top forecasters tracked by Bloomberg universally expect the peso to strengthen, some investors may hesitate to buy pesos until it’s clear that risks have dissipated. Alejo Czerwonko, an analyst at UBS AG, expects the peso to appreciate modestly to 19 per dollar by the end of June and close at that level at the year’s end. With the peso’s high carry -- the interest paid to investors holding the currency -- that’s a solid bet, but he says he still wouldn’t recommend the currency.
""There are more interesting opportunities out there in the emerging world,"" Czerwonko said. ""The market is currently partially but not fully pricing in a failure of Nafta or a Lopez Obrador presidency, which means that if either one were to materialize, we would expect a weaker trend for the peso.""
Analysts on average expect the peso to strengthen 1.9 percent in the first half of the year, according to the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. While that may not seem like much, it’s enough to be the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Thirteen are forecast to weaken.
Citigroup’s analysis includes the real effective exchange rate -- the purchasing power adjusted for inflation -- tracked by the Bank for International Settlements, Revilla said. Mexico’s currency is among the most undervalued by that measure when compared with its long-term average.
The bank’s peso forecast assumes ""macroeconomic stability"" and ""continued implementation of economic reforms,"" Revilla said. If the presidential winner takes a different policy path, Citigroup could reconsider its projections.

GBP/USD rose 0.22% to 1.3546 by 05:04 AM ET (10:04 AM GMT) from around 1.3538 earlier. Sterling slid 0.57% the previous day to pull back from a three-and-a-half month high of 1.3612.
Research group IHS Markit reported that its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.2 in December from 53.8 in November, compared to forecast for a reading of 54.1.
""However, as has been increasingly the case in recent months, the good news comes with a health warning about the sustainability of the upturn,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Firms reported that new order growth eased to 16-month low amid concerns over Brexit, while the rate of job creation slipped to a nine-month low. Input costs rose at the fastest rate in three months, the report said.
""Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signaled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment,"" Williamson added.
The report came after similar surveys earlier in the week showed that growth in the UK manufacturing sector cooled last month from four-year highs struck in November, but remained solid.
Meanwhile, growth in the construction sector slowed last month for the first time since September.
Taking the three sector surveys together, Britain's economy probably expanded at a quarterly rate of around 0.4% to 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, the report said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Thursday after upbeat U.S. data and supportive minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting helped it shake off recent weakness.
The dollar index (DXY), measuring it against a basket of six major currencies, extended the previous day's bounce to stand 0.02 percent higher at 92.183 . It had declined to 91.751 on Tuesday, its lowest since Sept. 20.
The dollar bounced after Wednesday's strong U.S. manufacturing and construction data. 
It gained further support as the minutes from the Fed's Dec. 12-13 meeting were more hawkish than anticipated, indicating the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.
Fed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labor market's solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed worries about persistently low inflation.
That suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach in raising rates but could hasten the pace if inflation accelerates.
""The dollar did feel downward pressure at the turn of the year, but the selling was not based on very strong factors,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
Rebalancing of positions caused by investors closing their books toward the turn of each year can lead to dollar selling.
""As such, strong U.S. data and the Fed's minutes, which suggested board members were not as pessimistic toward the potential economic impact of U.S. tax cuts as many in the market expected, helped the dollar get back on course,"" Yamamoto said.
The euro was little changed at $1.2016  after losing roughly 0.4 percent overnight. The common currency had surged to a three-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday against a broadly weaker dollar.
The U.S. currency was 0.15 percent higher at 112.655 yen . It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750, scaled in December.
Increasing investor risk appetite in broader markets also supported the dollar, notably against perceived safe-havens such as the yen and Swiss franc. The latter was at 0.9778 franc per dollar  after sliding 0.6 percent the previous day to pull back from a three-month peak of 0.9699.
Buoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying 2.5 percent. Crude oil prices were at 2-1/2-year highs, helping fuel inflation expectations.
Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, expects dollar/yen to stay around 110 yen in the medium term.
""Yen demand stemming from Japan's current account surplus will be checked by yen selling pressure stemming from 'risk on' generated by global economic growth,"" he said. ""Dollar/yen is likely to remain in range around 110 yen amid this tug-of-war.""
The pound was steady at $1.3515 , following overnight losses of 0.6 percent, when it fell back from a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 against a rebounding dollar.

The Australian dollar was a shade lower at $0.7832  and the New Zealand dollar added 0.1 percent to $0.7098 .

While generally looking favorably on the rising stock market indexes, some officials have expressed concern that keeping policy overly accommodative could inflate bubbles.
“In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, a couple of participants expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions could, over time, pose risks to financial stability,” the minutes said.
Overnight, the dollar rebounded from nearly four-week lows against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday buoyed by bullish economic data stoking investor expectations for solid economic growth.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 59.7 in December from 58.2 in the previous month. That beat economists for forecast for reading of 58.2.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, well below 50 indicates contraction.
The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8% to a record of $1.257 trillion in November, topping economists forecast for a 0.6% rise.
The uptick in economic activity has fueled expectations for an uptick in inflation as Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi recently said that strong gains in the ISM Prices Index in December pointed to inflationary pressures in the months ahead, which may strengthen the case for additional monetary policy tightening.
Other market participants, however, tempered expectations for a sharp turnaround in inflation as the Bank of Montreal warned that rising manufacturing costs are less important to the Fed’s inflation concerns than rising consumer costs.
The most recent reading of the Core Price Expenditure (CPE) Index, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, showed inflation remained well below the central bank’s target of 2%.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 07:25AM ET</span>",Dollar rebound leaves investors disinterested,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar bounced on Wednesday, snapping a three-week losing streak as investors consolidated positions before manufacturing data and minutes of a December U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due later in the day.
But despite the dollar's rebound, market strategists remain downbeat about the prospects of the greenback in the near term on concerns that future U.S. rate hikes were broadly priced into the markets.
""From a DXY basis, there is very little going on for the dollar from current levels as we are seeing the continuation of very easy financial conditions with accompanying fiscal stimulus,"" said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets referring to the dollar's trade-weighted basket against its rivals by its popular acronym. 
Evidence of easy financial conditions were evident with real interest rates in the U.S. holding near their lowest in nearly five years, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
The greenback (DXY) bounced 0.3 percent on the day to 92.10 after falling 2.5 percent over the last three weeks. On an annual basis, 017 was the biggest annual drop for the greenback in 14 years.
Despite the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years passed by U.S. policymakers in late-December, market analysts believe the worrying lack of inflation pressures would keep the dollar on the back foot in the coming months.
""The key question for markets is what is the game changer for the dollar in the short term and unless we see a significant pick up in inflation, the dollar will remain on the back foot,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
Seasonal forces were also at play such as a broad decline in dollar funding requirements over the thin-year period which typically acts as a support for the greenback.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategists said dollar funding pressures as noted by cross-currency basis swaps peaked earlier than usual in December and has eased dramatically in recent days, eroding a key support. 
Euro/dollar cross-currency basis swaps for three-month maturities settled at its tightest levels in nearly three years at 22.5 basis points, indicating that broad demand for dollars was muted. .
Meanwhile, the euro  was flirting near a four-month high hit on Tuesday prompted by optimism over the euro zone's economy and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its bond-buying stimulus in 2018.
The ECB board member in charge of the central bank's market operations, Benoit Coeure, said at the weekend he saw a ""reasonable chance"" bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.
The single currency was trading at $1.2017 after hitting a four-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday, marking a gain of roughly 3 percent from a mid-December trough and bringing it close to a September high of $1.2092, the currency's highest level since early 2015.
Helping the euro has also been higher eurozone bond yields in recent weeks the spread between ten-year U.S. and German bond yields holding near its tightest levels in nearly six weeks.
Among data due later in the session is manufacturing ISM data in the United States and minutes of the December U.S. central bank meeting.

Prior to market opening on Wednesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set its official yuan midpoint  at 6.4920 per dollar, breaching the key threshold 6.5 per dollar level.
Wednesday's official midpoint was 159 pips, or 0.24 percent, firmer than Tuesday's fix of 6.5079 and was the strongest since May 3, 2016.
In the spot market, the onshore yuan  opened at 6.4988 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.5057 at midday, 108 pips weaker than the previous late session close and 0.21 percent softer than the midpoint. 
Traders said corporate demand for the greenback emerged after the spot yuan rate strengthened to below 6.5 per dollar.
A Shanghai-based trader at a foreign bank said overall market sentiment remained cautious as the market had no strong expectations for the yuan's trend.
State-run Securities Times warned against ""over-inflated"" expectations for the yuan in a front-page commentary on Wednesday. 
""Currently, the yuan exchange rate is strengthening to approach a high it reached in September ... Should the yuan continue to rise? Obviously, it requires the central bank to release some signal to stabilise (the Chinese currency),"" the newspaper said, reinforcing that the 6.5 per dollar level remained ""a key threshold"".
The newspaper also said a continued rise in the yuan would hurt exports and stimulate speculation in the foreign exchange market. 
Multiple traders said they did not expect any policy to be taken out to stabilise the yuan any time soon as the market was already very stable.
The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index (RXYH), which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 95.76, weaker than the previous day's 95.93. 
The global dollar index (DXY) rose to 91.917 from the previous close of 91.872.

297,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Lower Amid Fears Over Rising US Output,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled lower on Tuesday, as the North Sea Forties pipeline restarted offsetting support from potential supply disruptions in Iran amid ongoing anti-government protests.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for February delivery fell 0.08% to settle at $60.37 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 0.42% to trade at $66.59 a barrel.
Crude oil prices started the year on a sour note as pipelines in the North Sea and Libya reopened offsetting gains on expectations unrest in Iran could spark supply disruptions.
The 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown while a Libyan pipelined gradually returned to production after an explosion last week disrupted operations.
The restart of the Fourties pipeline weighed heavily on Brent crude, narrowing the Brent-WTI spread to its lowest in nearly two weeks.
The sharp rise in oil prices, however, has encouraged US shale oil producers to ramp up output raising fears US output could hit record highs of over 10 million bpd in the weeks ahead.
U.S. oil production averaged about 9.6 million barrels per day in 2017, rising 1.8% to 9.64 million barrels a day in October.
Sentiment on oil prices remained bullish despite fears over rising US production as data published by regulators and exchanges showed portfolio managers held a record 1.33 billion barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil during the week ending Dec. 26.
The recent rally in oil prices above the $60 barrel has been largely supported by the OPEC-led output cuts and expectations for growing global demand.
In November, OPEC agreed to extend joint production cuts with Russia of 1.8 million barrels per day through 2018."

299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Dollar Staggers Into 2018 With Global Reflation Trade in Play,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar sank to a three-month low as rising commodity prices reignited bets that the global reflation trade will take hold in 2018, dimming the greenback’s appeal relative to currencies of faster-growing economies.
The U.S. currency fell against most major and emerging-market counterparts Tuesday as the Bloomberg Commodity Index reached its highest level in about 11 months. Combined with reports showing strength in Chinese and European manufacturing, there is probably more pain ahead for the dollar as investors anticipate money flowing into other economies, said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC) at Toronto Dominion Bank.
“The backdrop for the dollar is just not very good,” said McCormick, the bank’s North American head of foreign-exchange strategy. “The global reflation trade is progressing along and the backdrop is that we’re rotating into a regime shift and that comes with a changing backdrop for capital flows.”
Dollar weakness will also persist through 2018 as more central banks move toward policy normalization, according to McCormick. European Central Bank policy maker Benoit Coeure suggested as much over the weekend, saying that unless inflation disappoints, there’s a “reasonable chance” the central bank’s extension of quantitative easing in October could be the final one. 
The greenback could catch a break as the U.S. tax-overhaul plan takes effect, said Brad Bechtel, a currency strategist at Jefferies. Though American companies’ estimated $2.6 trillion of cash stashed overseas may already be mostly in dollars, the greenback will still benefit from the return of funds held in other currencies, according to Bechtel.
That said, it’s far from smooth sailing for dollar bulls, especially if investors see better value in other currencies with global growth picking up. Against that backdrop, the dollar faces a cloudy outlook even as the Federal Reserve signals more rate hikes in 2018, Bechtel said.
“Commodities have been rallying across the board, and that’s putting some pressure on the dollar,” he said. “It’s a tough road ahead for the dollar.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro traded close to its highest level in three years against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, on optimism over a brightening economic picture in the euro zone.
It finished 2017 with its best year against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its monetary stimulus grew, boosting demand for the single currency.
The euro started the year by adding to those gains, and climbing as much as 0.6 percent to a four-month high of $1.2081, within sights of the $1.2092 it hit in September, the highest since early 2015. 
The single currency was also higher against the Japanese yen at 135.64 (EURJPY=), reaching levels not seen since late 2015.
Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.
""It's a combination of dollar weakness and euro strength. The euro strength is underpinned by some hawkish comments from the ECB's Coeure,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen in Frankfurt, referring to comments made by the European Central Bank's Benoit Coeure
Coeure said on the weekend he saw a ""reasonable chance"" the bank's bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.
Nguyen said the euro was approaching levels where the ECB might start to signal some discomfort with its rise.
The euro gained as the dollar was broadly weak. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) slipped to 91.75, its weakest level since September.
For the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback's worst annual performance since 2003.
Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London, said the end of a dollar funding squeeze typical of December and a rally in commodity prices, had reduced demand for dollars since the holiday season, but that the euro was also gaining because of the better economic performance of its member states.
""Fundamentally, what is helping the euro is the brightening economic outlook in the euro area. The momentum should continue,"" he said. 
Tan said Societe Generale forecasts the euro will strengthen to $1.25 by the middle of the year. 
Some foreign exchange strategists said traders were wary of taking on big positions ahead of the introduction on Wednesday of the wide-ranging EU financial markets directive known as MiFID II, which is aimed at making European markets more transparent and providing better value for investors.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",China's yuan extends rally to near four-month high on dollar weakness,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan rose to its firmest against the U.S. dollar in nearly four months in thin trade on Tuesday, breaching a key threshold, supported by a stronger fixing and broad dollar weakness.
The dollar slipped to its lowest in more than three months against a basket of major currencies, marking its steepest annual drop since 2003, on doubts over durability of a pick-up in U.S. economic growth in the wake of the country's tax overhaul.
The Chinese currency registered a rise of around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, the biggest gain in nine years, also recovering from a roughly 6.5 percent loss a year earlier and reversing three straight years of depreciation.
Prior to market opening on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate  at 6.5079 per dollar, 263 pips or 0.4 percent firmer than the previous fix of 6.5342 on Friday.
Tuesday's fixing was the strongest since Sept. 11, 2017.
The firmer fixing lifted spot yuan higher. The onshore yuan  opened at 6.5030 per dollar, breaching the psychologically important 6.5 per dollar level and rose to a high of 6.4922 at one point, the firmest since Sept. 8.
As of midday, the onshore spot yuan was changing hands at 6.5012, 57 pips firmer than the previous late session close and 0.10 percent stronger than the midpoint.
Its offshore counterpart  was trading only 1 pip higher than the onshore spot at 6.5011 per dollar at midday. 
Traders said the rally in the yuan on the first trading day of the year was catching up with dollar weakness in overseas markets. 
Tommy Xie, economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore, said in a note on Tuesday that gains in the yuan in the past two weeks were mainly driven by ""thin liquidity and a weaker dollar"".
Trading remained tepid on Tuesday as many market participants were still on holiday. The daily trading volume  stood at $7.925 billion, compared with around $15 billion typically.
Xie Yaxuan, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, said he expects the yuan to trade in a range of 6.45 to 6.95 per dollar in 2018, due to the central bank's ""counter-cyclical factor"", domestic foreign exchange supply and demand, and potential gains in the dollar.
The ""counter-cyclical factor"" was introduced by the central bank in May 2017, and was designed to reduce price swings and stabilize market expectations.
On a trade-weighted basis <.CFSCNYI>, the yuan was largely flat from a year earlier against a basket of currencies of China's trading partners at the end of 2017, according to official data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS).
The index, published on a weekly basis, stood at 94.85 on Friday, up 0.02 from 94.83 at the end of 2016.
The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index (RXYH), which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 95.95, firmer than the previous day's 95.89. 
The global dollar index (DXY) rose to 92.183 from the previous close of 92.124. 
Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs), considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 6.6325, 1.88 percent weaker than the midpoint.

One-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.

315,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 03:00PM ET</span>",Mexican Peso Posts Best Year Since 2012 as Volatility Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- For Mexico’s currency, 2017 was a tale of two halves. After rebounding from a Trump-sized crater through July, the peso slumped -- although not quite enough to erase what turned out to be its first annual gain in five years. More Nafta jitters and a presidential election mean next year might be just as volatile.
The fate of Nafta, covering $1 trillion of trade between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, have weighed on the peso since Donald Trump took office. And July brings an election in which leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador looks likely to unseat Mexico’s scandal-ridden ruling PRI party.
""A lot of the peso’s gain was a correction of the over-pessimism in the past,"" said Danny Fang, an analyst at BBVA (MC:BBVA) in New York. ""For the first quarter of 2018, we can expect the MXN to remain sensitive to new rounds of political noise, with the electoral process and Nafta negotiations being the main drivers.""
The peso sank nearly 14 percent immediately after the November 2016 victory by Trump, who threatened during his campaign to pull out of the trade pact. But then it quickly climbed, posting the best performance among emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg in the first quarter. Though the rally faltered by mid-year, the peso still ended 2017 up 5.4 percent, lagging only the Chilean peso’s 8.9 percent gain among Latin American currencies. An increasingly hawkish central bank could help push the peso higher next year.
Yet investors remain wary. Yield spreads between local and hard-currency bonds are at a six-year high as investors hedge against currency risk. As pressure builds ahead of the election, it remains to be seen whether the currency can repeat the performance next year.

The rise in foreign debt was mainly driven by debt securities, as more foreign institutions entered China's debt market, and also by trade credit and pre-payments, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said.
""Demand for cross-border financing in the real economy has been gradually rising as the two-way fluctuations of the yuan exchange rate increase significantly while the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable,"" it said.

Outstanding short-term foreign debt stood at $1.09 trillion at the end of September, accounting for 65 percent of total debt, the regulator said.

Last week, the United States approved a massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that slashes the corporate rate and reduces taxes for many individuals as well, which has prompted fears that investment in Mexico could slow.

Uncertainty over the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is also seen as a factor weighing on the peso.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of currencies and slid against the euro on Wednesday in thin holiday trading, while a rally in commodity prices helped push the Canadian and Australian currencies to their highest levels in recent weeks. 
Traders said there was little news to support the euro's rise, but some investors have positioned for a possible strengthening into the new year. In 2017 the euro had its best year against the greenback since 2003.
Sterling enjoyed a bounce amid the broad dollar decline, with the pound up 0.3 percent at $1.341  at 1235 GMT. It had traded as high as $1.3423 earlier on Wednesday, its highest since Dec. 15.
Oil prices surged to two and a half-year highs on Tuesday, boosted by news of an explosion on a Libyan crude pipeline as well as voluntary OPEC-led supply cuts. Copper prices on Wednesday rocketed to their highest in three and a half years.
That helped support demand for the currencies of commodity exporting countries, with the Canadian dollar touching C$1.2628 , close to its highest level since October.
The Australian dollar  rose 0.6 percent to $0.7776, its highest level in two months.
The U.S. dollar, measured against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.25 percent (DXY).
The U.S. dollar was also down 0.3 percent versus the euro at $1.1897 . 
""There are very few events to drive anything today,"" said Christin Tuxen, an FX strategist at Danske Bank, adding that the passage of the U.S. government's landmark tax reform last week was not helping the dollar. ""For most people it's not going to be this dollar-supportive event."" 
Tuxen said euro-U.S. dollar trading in December had been driven by volatility in Euro/dollar cross-currency basis swaps, which widened significantly earlier this month as demand for dollars jumped.
Monetary policy convergence could weigh on the dollar next year, now that central banks other than the U.S. Federal Reserve have either begun moving away from monetary stimulus, or started to raise interest rates, said Peter Chia, FX strategist for United Overseas Bank in Singapore.
Against this backdrop, Japanese policymakers may at least start dropping more hints about an eventual tightening of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, Chia said, adding that the dollar could slip to 108 yen by the end of March.
""I think that policymakers in Japan want to prepare markets way ahead for some policy change ... The signaling process could be on a higher intensity next year,"" he said, adding that actual BOJ policy-tightening might occur only in 2019.
The dollar held steady against the yen at 113.22 yen. 
Bitcoin rose marginally to about $15,854 (BTC=BTSP) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, putting it about 14 percent up this week, after last week suffering its biggest weekly drop since 2013.

325,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 02:29PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Just Below $60 After Libya Pipeline Explosion ,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled higher on Tuesday buoyed by fresh supply disruptions following the explosion of a major Libyan oil pipeline while ongoing expectations that OPEC will continue to comply with the deal to curb output supported sentiment. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 2.6% to settle at $59.97 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 2.56% cents to trade at $56.39 a barrel.
Oil prices started the week on the front foot after reports of a major oil pipeline explosion in Libya raised the prospect of fresh supply disruptions in the region. 
Reuters reported, citing a Libyan oil source, that Libya’s crude oil output fell by about 90,000 barrels per day (bpd), following an explosion at a Waha oil company owned Libyan crude oil pipeline that feeds the Es Sider sea terminal. 
The Mediterranean port of Es Sider is the largest oil depot in Libya with a capacity of more than 400,000 barrels a day. 
The mostly positive day for oil prices comes amid ongoing optimism concerning OPEC’s compliance with the deal to curb output amid upbeat comments from Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi, who said supply and demand would balance by the first quarter of 2018.
""During the first quarter of next year there will be more balance between supply and demand, which will reflect positively on improving global oil prices,"" Luaibi said.
In the U.S. meanwhile, traders turned attention to fresh inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute slated for Tuesday following an early indication of weaker future US production.
The number of oil rigs operating in the US remained unchanged at 747 in the week to Dec.22, said oil field services company Baker Hughes on Friday. 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand. A higher rig count tends to signal a further rise in U.S. production. "

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank sold an additional $500 million in foreign exchange hedges on Tuesday to support the peso after the currency fell last week against the dollar on uncertainty over the economic outlook in 2018.
On Friday, the peso  hit its lowest level since mid-March against the dollar due to concerns over inflation and the potential impact on Mexico of new U.S. corporate tax cuts.
The peso initially rose by more than 0.7 percent against the dollar after Mexico's currency commission announced the extra auctions, which were drawn from a $20 billion program set up in February to reduce exchange rate volatility.
The currency later pared most of its gains and was trading up 0.05 percent at 19.69 per dollar at 1530 GMT.
The central bank said it received bids worth $375 million for the $250 million in 57-day hedges put up for auction, and bids worth $255 million for the $250 million in 30-day hedges.
In a separate auction to renew 60-day currency hedges that was scheduled weeks ago, Mexico received bids worth $600 million for another $300 million on offer.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a tax overhaul into law on Friday that cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, fueling worries that Mexico will lose out on investment to its northern neighbor.
Trump's threats to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the deal that underpins much of Mexico's foreign trade, has also weighed on the peso. Market analysts say that is likely to continue into 2018.

Mexico's finance ministry is evaluating whether to make fiscal changes in response to the U.S. tax cuts.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan is to devalue its currency to 18 Sudanese pounds per dollar in January from the current exchange rate of 6.7, the finance minister said on Tuesday.
The International Monetary Fund urged Sudan earlier this month to float its currency to boost growth and investment, but the government has ruled out a market-determined exchange rate.
The devaluation which includes the customs exchange rate - the rate used to calculate customs duties - is timed to take place when the 2018 budget begins, in the first week of January, Finance Minister Mohamed Othman Rukabi told Reuters.
Traders said the black market rate jumped to 27 SDG per dollar from 25 SDG per dollar on Tuesday after the devaluation was announced.
""The whole budget for the new year is based on a an official rate of 18 SDG per dollar. We expect the results of this policy to be positive for the Sudanese economy,"" he said.
The Sudanese pound has weakened sharply against the dollar since Washington lifted 20-year-old economic sanctions in October, encouraging traders to step up imports and putting pressure on scarce hard currency.
Businesses are unable to secure their hard currency needs at the official peg of 6.7 pounds to the dollar and are forced to resort to a parallel market.
To stem the flow of scarce currency out of the banking system, Sudan announced emergency measures last month after the pound fell to a record low of 27 against the dollar on the black market.
The country also imposed tight restrictions on imports of luxury goods, directing remaining liquidity toward ""sectors that boost growth"", the central bank said.
The import-dependent country has suffered both from the sanctions and from the secession of the south in 2011, when it lost three-quarters of its oil output, its main source of foreign currency.

The IMF last year agreed to loan Sudan's neighbor Egypt $12 billion if it implemented tough fiscal reforms.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies on Tuesday as traders brushed off encouraging Japanese inflation data and Bank of Japan minutes that signaled policy-makers favored sticking to a loose monetary policy.
Bitcoin staged a comeback after it recorded a 25 percent decline on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange last week (BTC=BTSP), its biggest weekly drop since April 2013.
Currency trading volume was light as London and many major financial centers remained closed after the Christmas holiday. 
""The market is going to be quiet for the balance of the week,"" said Jason Leinwand, chief executive officer of FirstLine FX Currency Strategy in Randolph, New Jersey.
The greenback is expected to be supported into early 2018 in the aftermath of the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years which became law last week.
The consensus among analysts was a drop in corporate tax rates would spur business investments, bolstering the U.S. economy and the dollar even though the tax plan would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt in 10 years.
""The dollar has some room to strengthen in the first half of 2018,"" Leinwand said.
At 10:27 a.m. (1527 GMT), the index that tracks the greenback versus six other currencies (DXY) was down 0.09 percent at 93.262.
The euro was little changed at $1.1867  and 134.38 yen (EURJPY=), while the dollar held steady at $113.24 yen 
The market had a muted reaction to data released early on Tuesday which showed that Japan's core consumer prices rose for the 11th straight month, up 0.9 percent year-on-year, and household spending jumped in November.
While the inflation rate remains distant from the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, the rise offered some hope that a steady economic recovery will gradually drive up prices. 
""The inflation numbers were pretty good,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo. 
Minutes of the BOJ's October meeting, released on Tuesday, showed most members shared the view that the central bank should maintain its easy policy. 
The BOJ kept monetary policy steady last week and its governor reassured markets the central bank will lag well behind overseas peers in ending its ultra-easy policies. 
Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rebounded following last week's dramatic selloff. It was last up over 13 percent at $15,800 (BTC=BTSP) on Bitstamp, which was almost $4,000 below its record intraday peak set on Dec. 17.

The dollar stood little changed at 113.30 yen  in Asian trade on Monday, hardly gaining traction from upbeat U.S. economic data published on Friday.
U.S. consumer spending accelerated in November and shipments of key capital goods orders increased for the 10th straight month.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.1 percent in November for an annual increase of 1.5 percent, accelerating from 1.4 percent in October.
The data helped to push the two-year U.S. yield to a nine-year high of 1.899 percent (US2YT=RR) and dollar interest rate futures  to price in more than two rate hikes next year for the first time.
""2017 was the year when the dollar couldn't rise even as the dollar short-term interest rates rose,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
""As long as U.S. long-term bond yields are capped, so too will be the dollar,"" he added. ""The dollar hit this year's high against the yen and also against a basket of major currencies on Jan. 3 and I expect a similar pattern next year as well."" 
The euro was also little changed at $1.1850 , having slipped a tad on Friday after Catalan separatists won a regional election, deepening Spain's political crisis in a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and European Union leaders who backed him.
With most currency trading centers except for Tokyo shut on Monday for Christmas, trading volume was less than 20 percent of the average for major currency pairs including the euro/dollar and the dollar/yen, according to the Thomson Reuters FX Volume Heatmap.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar headed into 2018 stuck in the middle of a recent range, with traders and economists torn on whether the Bank of Canada will hike rates in January or wait until March or April, and whether it will out-tighten the Fed over time.
The loonie was little changed against the greenback on Friday as trade wound down ahead of the Christmas break, with stalled economic growth data for October challenging inflation, trade and retail sales data from earlier in the week that had made a January hike a 50:50 call.
The Canadian central bank raised rates twice in 2017, in July and September, while the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked in March, June, and December. 
""What the market seems to be pricing now, as best as I can tell, is that Bank of Canada is going to actually out-hike the Fed next year and flatten the gap in cash rates to zero,"" said Daniel Katzive, head of North American currency strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), adding that seemed ""aggressive given the NAFTA uncertainty"".
Negotiators for Canada, the United States and Mexico will meet in Montreal from Jan. 23-28 for North American Free Trade Agreement talks on thorny subjects such as autos, dispute settlement and an expiry clause, while the Bank of Canada's next rate decision is due on Jan. 17.
At 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.2733 to the greenback, or 78.54 U.S. cents, slightly stronger on the day. It traded between C$1.2697 and C$1.2797, and was up more than 1 percent on the week.
BNP Paribas' Katzive said their models point to long-term equilibrium at C$1.27, and to push outside C$1.25-C$1.30 would require one of the central banks to significantly out-tighten the other. Along with a neutral view on range-bound oil, that made him ""quite aggressively neutral on the dollar-Canada outlook,"" he said.
Canadian government bond prices were slightly higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year up 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.662 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 4 Canadian cents to yield 2.026 percent. 
The spread between yields on Canadian and U.S. two-year bonds was -23.3 basis points, near its tightest in more than a month. The Canadian issue traded at a premium to its U.S. counterpart in September and early October.

The Canadian bond market closed at 1:30 p.m. ahead of the Christmas break, while U.S. trading wound down at 2 p.m.

EUR/USD was trading at 1.1799 as of 4:44 AM ET (09:44 GMT) from a high of 1.1819 earlier.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 03:55AM ET</span>",Euro climbs on caution over impact of U.S. tax bill,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose slightly on Tuesday as investors took a cautious view over how much tax reforms, if passed, would boost the U.S. economy, with most major currencies trading in tight ranges in a relatively thin market.
Traders are shying away from taking big positions ahead of the holiday season, although news that the U.S. tax overhaul was set to become law helped support some risk appetite.
The euro  was up 0.2 percent at 1.1805 against the dollar, and broadly flat against the pound (EURGBP=D3) at 88.16 pence per euro.
""It's a bit neutral,"" said Viraj Patel, a foreign exchange strategist at ING. ""The tax reform is going to be one of the key angles for markets this week...(but) nobody is going to be taking any major positions before the year-end.""
The euro is up more than 12 percent against the dollar so far this year and is on track for posting its best annual performance since 2004. 
While it remains roughly 3 percent away from the 2-1/2 year peak of nearly $1.21 hit in early September, the 2017 gains show how sentiment towards the euro zone has turned around completely from earlier this year when the bloc's breakup was discussed. 
The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress appears all but certain this week to pass the sweeping tax overhaul backed by President Donald Trump after two Senate Republican holdouts agreed on Monday to support it. 
Rising hopes of the bill's passage helped push U.S. stocks to record highs on Monday. European stock futures had a timid start after corporate deal-making had pushed markets higher earlier in the week.
While Fed policymakers expect the U.S. economy to get a short-term lift from the tax reform, they project growth will then ease back to about 2 percent by 2020 and not rise to around 3 percent as Trump and his administration predict.
""We expect the bill to pass, as do many market participants, and it seems to make the equity investors happy,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
The dollar was flat against the yen at 112.535 yen , drifting in a range between a high of 113.750 hit a week ago and Friday's low of 112.035.
Bitcoin was down 0.3 percent at $18,875 (BTC=BTSP) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, below its record high of $19,666 hit on Sunday.
The Australian dollar  edged up 0.1 percent to $0.7676, within sight of six-week highs touched last week, as the country's central bank expressed greater confidence about the economic outlook.
Minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) December meeting released on Tuesday showed policymakers were encouraged by improved economic data, though weakness in consumer spending was still a ""significant risk.""

Bilateral trade between the countries totaled $13.8 billion in 2015 to 2016.
Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who has been central to the planning and implementation of China-Pakistan economic ties, was reported discussing the proposal after unveiling a long-term economic development cooperation plan for the two countries.
Iqbal said Pakistan would continue to use the rupee domestically. 
The long-term plan highlighted key cooperation areas between the neighboring states including road and rail connections, information network infrastructure, energy, trade and industrial parks, agriculture, poverty alleviation and tourism.
The plan marks the first time the two countries have said how long they plan to work together on the project, known as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC,)taking the economic partnership to at least 2030. 

China has already committed to investing $57 billion in Pakistan to finance CPEC as part of Beijing's ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build a new Silk Road of land and maritime trade routes across more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa.

368,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 02:31PM ET</span>",Funds Clash Over Whether Aussie Will Drop Below 70 Cents in 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- Two of Australia’s largest asset managers are at odds about whether the currency will break below 70 U.S. cents.
The Aussie will slide under that level by mid-2018 as the yield on the nation’s bonds falls below that on U.S. Treasuries, according to Brisbane-based QIC Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $63 billion. The Aussie is likely to stay above 70 cents due to China’s robust economy and a tailwind from commodity prices, says AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages about $137 billion.
Australia’s dollar has tumbled about 6 percent from this year’s high in September as the premium on its two-year notes vanished last month for the first time since 2000. Mixed economic data means the Reserve Bank of Australia isn’t likely to raise interest rates from a record-low 1.5 percent any time soon, while the Federal Reserve has increased its benchmark five times since December 2015 to reach a similar level.
“There’s a possibility that the whole yield curve up to the 10-year point will trade below the U.S.,” said Susan Buckley, managing director of global liquid strategies at QIC. “We may well be in a period where the interest-rate differential factor will start to weigh on the currency more than other factors.”
Australia’s two-year premium is now five basis points, down from as much as 510 basis points in February 2008. The extra yield of 10-year bonds has shrunk to 17 basis points from as high as 277 basis points in 2008.
The RBA will only tighten in the second half of next year, while the Fed will probably raise rates three times in 2018, QIC’s Buckley said.
‘Look to Buy’
Stable growth in China, Australia’s biggest trading partner, is likely to help limit further declines in the Aussie, said Nader Naeimi, who heads a dynamic investment fund at AMP Capital in Sydney.
Iron ore delivered to Qingdao in China, a global benchmark, has jumped more than 20 percent since Oct. 31. Robust factory output and consumer spending helped the world’s second-biggest economy expand 6.8 percent in the third quarter.
“China and commodity tailwinds coupled with local headwinds is why I believe the Australian dollar is unlikely to have a clear trend anytime soon,” Naeimi said. “I continue to look to buy the currency in the 70-to-73 cent range and sell in the 82-to-85 range.” 
No ‘Disaster’
Australia’s vanishing yield spread will not be the “FX disaster” some are predicting, said Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. Yield isn’t the only consideration for reserve managers and other investors seeking to diversify their holdings, he said. The nation’s equities still offer superior dividend yields and will also support the currency, Berry said.
Estimates for where Australia’s dollar will be at the end of next year range from 67 cents to 86 cents, highlighting the divide among forecasters. The currency was at 76.60 cents at 5 p.m. in Sydney on Monday. The last time it traded below 70 cents was in February 2016.
Market positioning is become less favorable, with hedge funds and other large speculators cutting their long positions to 44,409 contracts in the week ended Dec. 12, from a four-year high of 86,204 at the end of August, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The Aussie is likely to keep weakening unless it finds a trigger to arrest its decline, said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, head of currency strategy in Singapore at NatWest Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc.
“The Australian dollar’s outlook remains bearish over the next few months,” he said. “What would change this dynamic is if the RBA turns hawkish in 2018 and starts signalling interest-rate hikes.”"

380,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 04:10PM ET</span>",Venezuelan community group launches currency to combat cash shortage,"By Fabian Cambero
CARACAS (Reuters) - A socialist collective in one of Caracas' emblematic hilltop slums has launched its own currency, the panal, to try to overcome chronic shortages of cash in the crisis-wrought nation. 
Venezuela's inflation, considered the world's highest, is so steep that the central bank is not printing enough bills to keep up. People often must spend hours in queues to take out cash or make bank transfers for even minor purchases. 
The group known as El Panal 2021, based in the 23 de Enero barrio overlooking the presidential palace, echoes President Nicolas Maduro's assertion that cash shortages are caused by bills being smuggled across the border to Colombia.
""It's complicated to buy products because we do not have cash in our community, so we decided to boost the communal economy,"" Jose Lugo, whose commune consists of about 4,000 families, said during a news conference to announce the currency. 
The group has started selling the panal for 5,000 bolivars, about 5 U.S. cents at the black market exchange rate. 
The currency can be exchanged on Saturday for rice that members of the community grew and harvested, as part of an initial trial of the new bills. 
The group hopes people can eventually use the panal, whose three denominations include one bearing a picture of late leftist leader Hugo Chavez, to buy a much broader range of products.
Opposition critics tend to chuckle at such measures, which in the past have included barter exchange markets and similar community currencies, and have gotten little traction. 
They say cash shortages are the result of central bank incompetence, adding there is no incentive to smuggle bolivars to Colombia because they do not function as legal tender there.
Still, local residents are so far reveling in a chance to get their hands on cash again. 
Homemaker Cindy Masso, 31, was buying her first panals at the group's small bank on Friday and was planning to spend them on rice for her family on Saturday. 
State worker Alfredo Perdomo said he was satisfied with the ""quick and easy"" process of buying the money, a far cry from Venezuela's usually crowded and chaotic bank branches. 

""This is a benefit for the entire community because it helps us, given we're going through a difficult time in terms of cash,"" Perdomo said as he exited the bank.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.22% to 93.84.
CNBC said, citing two sources, Marco Rubio will support the final Republican tax bill after the GOP made changes to win his vote.
Rubio had said earlier this week, he won't approve the GOP tax plan unless it raises the refundable portion of the child tax credit currently at $1,100. Tax-reform is widely viewed as inflationary, providing the economy with a fiscal lift and considered a dollar positive.
Rising optimism surrounding the progress of tax reform offset earlier data showing industrial production and manufacturing activity fell short of expectations.
The Empire State manufacturing index fell to 18.0 in December from 19.4 the month prior, in-line with expectations.
Industrial production—a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities—rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in November from the prior month, the Federal Reserve said Friday. This was slightly below the 0.3% rise forecast by economists.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a nine-day low against the yen on Friday, after wrangling in the United States Congress over a bill to change the tax code dented confidence that the reforms would be pushed through in their current state. 
The greenback had climbed to a one-month high of 113.750 yen on Tuesday. But it made a U-turn midweek after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected but also expressed concern about low inflation.
The dollar lost further ground after two U.S. Republican senators on Thursday were reported to have sought changes to the proposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. tax code.
The U.S. currency slipped to 112.035 yen on Friday , down 0.3 percent on the day. 
""In the end the effect will depend a lot on the details of the final tax bill,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt. ""The more the tax bill gets watered down, the less pronounced the effect will be on the dollar."" 
The tax bill needs a simple majority to pass in the Senate, in which Republicans hold just 52 of the 100 seats, and no Democrats are expected to support it.
Democrat Doug Jones won the contest for a U.S. senate seat on Tuesday in Alabama, a Republican stronghold, trimming the Republicans' already narrow Senate majority.
""The overall process of overhauling the tax bill is not in peril. That said, even if the tax bill is passed and becomes law, the positive impact on the dollar could be limited as the market has already priced in such a scenario for the most part,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1792  after losing about 0.4 percent on Thursday. 
The common currency flagged after the European Central Bank on Thursday raised growth and inflation forecasts for the euro area, but stuck with its pledge to provide stimulus for as long as needed.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 0.18% to $57.14 a barrel, while on London\'s Intercontinental Exchange, Brent slipped 0.11% to $63.34 a barrel.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday, shrugging off data forecasting a faster than expected rise in US shale oil production next year, while an ongoing pipeline shutdown supported Brent crude prices.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its monthly oil market report, published on Thursday, revised upward its projection for US oil production, warning that total supply growth could exceed demand growth in the months ahead.
The IEA raised US crude oil growth to 390,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year and 870,000 bpd for 2018. Non-OPEC output, led by the US, will rise by 630,000 bpd in 2017, followed by an increase of 1.6 million bpd during 2018.
That supports a similar view from OPEC, who said in its monthly report, published on Wednesday, that non-OPEC production would rise faster than expected by 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 990,000 bpd in 2018.
Rising non-OPEC output has weighed on the efforts of OPEC as the oil cartel attempts to rid the global market of excess oil supplies. OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output reached its highest this year, rising to 115%.
Sentiment on Brent crude oil prices, meanwhile, remained positive amid the ongoing Forties pipeline shutdown earlier this week. The Forties pipeline carries 40% of North Sea oil and gas, and repairs could take weeks.
Andrew Gardner, chief executive of the Ineos Forties Pipeline System said “We’re estimating just now between two and three weeks,” when asked how long the system was likely to be down.

The GOP agreed to a tax-reform bill on Wednesday with a corporate tax rate would be decreased to 21%, higher than the original 20% proposed and would be implemented in 2018. Investors believe the tax cuts would help companies invest more and boost the economy.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. trade chief hails WTO splinter groups as victory,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization failed to conclude any new agreements at its biennial meeting this week, but U.S. President Donald Trump's trade chief is hailing as a victory the formation of factions by some WTO countries to push their own interests.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on Thursday that the ministerial conference in Buenos Aires ""will be remembered as the moment when the impasse at the WTO was broken."" 
The assessment was in contrast to dejected fellow WTO trade ministers who lamented the 164-member trade body's inability to reach new agreements on electronic commerce, agriculture and curbs to fisheries subsidies. 
Despite his sharp criticism of the 164-member trade body's inability to negotiate new agreements, Lighthizer managed to attract enough allies at the meeting to form smaller groups of countries to pursue new rules for open electronic commerce and to break down unreasonable trade barriers on food safety. 
The U.S. also agreed to team up with the European Union and Japan to work within the WTO to combat the kinds of market-distorting trade polices practiced by China, such as subsidies to state-owned enterprises and technology transfer requirements.
""Many members recognized that the WTO must pursue a fresh start in key areas so that like-minded WTO members and their constituents are not held back by the few members that are not ready to act,"" added Lighthizer, who left Buenos Aires the night before the conference concluded on Wednesday.
Lighthizer's endorsement of a new direction for the WTO talks may ease fears that Trump will pull out of the trade body, as he once suggested during his election campaign last year. But the statement made no mention of U.S. actions to block WTO judicial appointments, widely seen as a gambit to win reforms in its dispute settlement system. 
INDIA, U.S. TRADE BARBS
The U.S. trade agency and India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry traded thinly veiled barbs at each other for holding up progress in Buenos Aires.
Lighthizer blamed ""one WTO member with an extreme position"" for blocking a short ministerial declaration expressing the shared views of 164 members.
A source familiar with the WTO negotiations said that India would not agree to the statement's final wording. U.S. officials had previously refused to include references to the ""centrality"" of the global trading system and the need for trade to drive development.
India has long insisted that the WTO follow through on the development mandates of the previous Doha round of negotiations before moving on to new areas such as e-commerce.
New Delhi also nearly blocked a routine renewal of the WTO's 1998 tariff moratorium on cross-border digital downloads, meeting participants said.
India's post-conference statement singled out U.S. opposition to a deal on agriculture, specifically India's demands for permanent tariff rules to promote food security for developing countries. 
""Unfortunately, the strong position of one member against agricultural reform based on current WTO mandates and rules led to a deadlock without any outcome on agriculture or even a work program for the next two years,"" India's Commerce ministry said.
Lighthizer added that he was ""proud to defend the interests of U.S. stakeholders at the WTO, including our farmers and ranchers.""

He said that U.S. agriculture interests needed WTO rules based on today's market realities, rather than the ""outdated and unworkable"" negotiating framework set when the Doha round was launched in 2001.

393,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 03:31PM ET</span>","Hunt for Asia's Next Big Currency Trade Lands on Ringgit, Yuan","(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia’s ringgit and China’s yuan are emerging as Asia’s most-promising currencies for fund managers as they look for the best place to put their money in the new year.
A rebound in exports, widening current-account surpluses for some nations and an ongoing global chase for yields are fueling optimism that regional currencies will extend their rally into 2018. A gauge of Asian currencies is up 5.5 percent this year, set for its best performance since 1998. South Korea’s won is leading spot gains, while the ringgit tops in terms of total returns.
“We expect the Asian economies to do well as the global recovery broadens out,” said Wilfred Wee, a Singapore-based fund manager at Investec Asset Management Ltd., which oversees $132 billion globally. “We can expect Asian currency strength to sustain into 2018.”
But there are risks too. While the Federal Reserve this week maintained its projections for three interest-rate increases in 2018, a more hawkish tilt could spoil the party for Asian exchange rates. A surprise jump in global inflation or a war on the Korean peninsula are other spoilers, say investors, who also favor Indonesia’s rupiah and the Indian rupee, while being less optimistic about Thailand’s baht and the won.
Here are the detailed comments on major Asian currencies:
Malaysian ringgit
This year has marked a turnaround for the ringgit, which has rebounded from a 19-year low on the back of surging oil prices and bets the central bank will tighten policy. With prospects for better exports and economic growth, the currency has delivered a total return of more than 13 percent.
Chinese yuan
The offshore yuan is set to halt three years of losses as exports rise and manufacturing activity firms up. The PBOC’s move Thursday to boost market interest rates showcased authorities’ determination to continue with a deleveraging campaign that’s propelled bond yields. That bodes well for the yuan in 2018 as higher rates are seen luring investors.
Indian rupee
Having risen more than 5 percent, the rupee is on course for its first annual advance since 2010 as Indian stocks and bonds have attracted global funds on the promise of economic reforms and political stability.
Indonesian rupiah
Once part of Morgan Stanley’s “Fragile Five,” the rupiah has rallied due to a combination of high yields and an improving economic outlook. Buoyant agriculture prices are expected to add to tailwinds for the commodity-exporting nation, as optimism around President Joko Widodo’s reforms burnishes the rupiah’s appeal.
South Korean won
South Korea’s won weathered bouts of bond outflows and multiple missile tests from North Korea to lead Asia with an 11 percent gain this year. Analysts expect the won to lose some ground heading into early 2018 with most of the positives, including higher domestic interest rates, seen as already being in the price.
Thai baht
With a 10 percent advance, the baht is the region’s second-best performer this year, thanks to Thailand’s current-account surplus, rising exports and bond inflows."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.25% to 93.62.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that retail sales rose 0.8% last month. that was above economists’ forecast of a 0.3%.

""Consumer spending is expected to play a larger role in driving fourth quarter growth,"" CIBC said. “Our 2.7% forecast might be low as growth looks more like 3%.""
The upbeat data came as the euro weakness provided additional support for the greenback after the European Central Bank (ECB) left rates unchanged, while ECB president Mario Draghi’s remarks were interpreted as “dovish”, easing monetary policy tightening expectations.
""Domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend,” Draghi said in a press conference on Thursday, adding that an “ample degree” of stimulus is still needed.
EUR/USD rose fell 0.34% to $1.1786, while EUR/GBP fell 0.51% to £0.8770.

Draghi said inflation will converge with the ECB’s target in time, though underlying inflation pressures have not yet shown a convincing upturn.
The ECB sees price growth slowly accelerating over the coming years and hitting 1.7% in 2020, Draghi said, below the ECB’s target of close to, but just under, 2%.
Growth next year is now seen at 2.3% versus an earlier 1.8% forecast.
He added that the euro zone still needs “favorable” financing conditions, even though the growth outlook has shown a “significant improvement” since the bank’s last meeting.
Earlier Thursday euro zone data showed that the economy picked up further momentum in at the end of 2017, with December seeing the fastest growth in business activity in almost seven years.
The euro was slightly lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP dipping 0.08% to 0.8807.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro consolidated gains at a one-week high on Thursday after the European Central Bank kept its ultra-easy policy stance unchanged, an outcome that was widely expected by financial markets.
""The ECB took some quite big steps a few weeks ago and nothing new was expected today,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""If there was anything that markets were looking out for was a possible change in timing of the first rate hike but we are quite a long way from that.""
Six weeks after agreeing to halve asset buys from January, the bank reiterated its commitment to continue bond purchases at least until the end of September, and to keep reinvesting cash from maturing debt until much later to support a rebound in growth and inflation.
Against the dollar <EUR=EBS>, the euro was flat on the day at $1.18275. It has risen more than 2.5 percent over the last month and was trading at a one-week high.
The euro has been the standout performer among the major G10 currencies this year, gaining than 12.5 percent against the dollar so far this year as growth expectations have overtaken other drivers for the currency such as interest rate differentials and capital flows.
The dollar held at more than one-week lows on Thursday after the U.S. central bank kept its economic forecasts unchanged with investors expecting more losses if the European Central Bank outlines a more optimistic outlook on the economy.
Though the Fed delivered a quarter percentage point rate hike as widely expected, some analysts expected policy-makers to sound a more upbeat note on the economy thanks to a U.S. tax bill that may become reality over the next few weeks.
The Fed projected three more hikes in both 2018 and 2019, unchanged from the last round of forecasts in September and said the tax overhaul would boost the economy next year but leave no lasting impact, with the long-run potential growth rate likely stalled at 1.8 percent.
The dollar plunged 0.6 percent against a trade-weighted basket of currencies (DXY) after the decision on Wednesday, erasing a large chunk of its near 2 percent rise in the last three weeks. On Thursday, it was broadly flat and nursing losses at 93.46.
Against the yen <JPY=EBS>, the dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 112.69 yen, after sliding 0.9 percent on Wednesday and having retreated from Tuesday's four-week high of 113.75 yen.
Sterling trimmed earlier gains and was broadly flat on the day after the Bank of England stuck to its view that interest rates were likely to rise gradually.
The pound <GBP=D3> was flat at $1.3425 after the BoE said last week's breakthrough in Brexit talks has reduced the risk of Britain leaving the European Union in a disorderly way and may boost economic confidence, but still said only ""modest increases in (the) Bank Rate would be warranted over the next few years.

400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 08:01AM ET</span>",Euro Set to Capture Currency Throne From Dollar Again in 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- After trouncing the dollar this year, the euro is set for a repeat performance in 2018, according to forecasters.
Buying the shared currency ranks among next year’s top trades as it’s set to get new momentum from the European Central Bank’s gradual unwind of ultra-loose monetary policy. The euro surged 12 percent for the best Group-of-10 performance against the dollar this year. ING Bank NV is predicting a gain of about 10 percent in 2018.
The median estimate of strategists surveyed by Bloomberg has the euro climbing to $1.21 by the fourth quarter while options put the odds of attaining that level at more than 80 percent by then. Another bullish indicator can be found in so-called risk reversals, where calls cost more than puts.
The focus on a more hawkish ECB dominates thinking among bulls, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. CIBC and ING had the second- and third-best forecast scores among banks and financial firms in a Bloomberg survey for the third quarter of 2017.
ING’s chief European rates strategist Petr Krpata expects currency markets to price in a deposit rate of zero long before the ECB moves.
“That will drive up the euro,” Krpata said.
The central bank’s deposit rate, now at minus 0.4 percent, has depressed the euro since going negative in 2014.
“Rolling back the deposit rate is going to be significant, because a number of central banks and sovereigns have significantly reduced euro holdings because of those negative rates,” said Jeremy Stretch, CIBC’s head of Group-of-10 currency strategy. 
Still, markets aren’t currently pricing in an interest-rate increase by the ECB until at least 2019, with the central bank’s asset-purchase program set to run until at least September next year. There could also be disappointment for bulls should eurozone inflation continue to undershoot the ECB’s goal and mute hawkish pronouncements by the central bank.
The euro was steady at $1.1830 at 1:17 p.m. in Frankfurt before the ECB announces its last policy decision of the year. It added 0.7 percent Wednesday after soft U.S. consumer price data weakened the dollar.
The dollar’s pain could be the euro’s gain as the greenback is caught in the crossfire of infighting among lawmakers over taxes and unravelling optimism about fiscal easing. That leaves the dollar more vulnerable should the Fed embark on a slower-than-expected tightening path, according to London-based broker Argentex LLP.
“The euro has got greater potential to outperform the U.S. dollar,” said John Goldie, a currency dealer at Argentex. “The Fed has been raising rates for the last three years but the markets have been a little disappointed with the rate of hikes. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them slow down.”

GBP/USD was at 1.3423 by 07:18 AM ET (12:18 GMT) down from around 1.3443 earlier.
The monetary policy committee voted to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5% in a unanimous decision.
The BoE also maintained its current quantitative easing stimulus program, which has bought £435 billion of government debt and £10 billion of corporate bonds.
The bank noted that UK inflation hit 3.1% in November, well above the targeted rate of 2%, which it blamed on the slump in sterling since the EU referendum in June 2016.
The bank said inflation is likely to be close to its peak and it expects that it will fall back towards the 2% target over the medium term.
On Brexit, the BoE said there has been “progress” in negotiations between the UK and Brussels, which has reduced the risk of a disorderly Brexit and is likely to support household and business confidence.
The BoE stuck to its view from last month that interest rates were likely to need to rise gradually.
“The committee remained of the view that, were the economy to follow the path expected in the November Inflation Report, further modest increases in Bank Rate would be warranted over the next few years,” the BoE said.
The decision came a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a third time this year and indicated that it would stay on a similar path next year.

Retail sales volumes were 1.6% higher than a year earlier, up from a flat reading in October.
Sales were boosted as shoppers took advantage of Black Friday bargains but the report also indicated that the underlying trend was weaker.
Sales in the three months to November grew by just 1.0% compared with a year earlier, the weakest since May 2013.
The report also pointed to rising inflation pressures, with average shop prices up 3.1% in November from a year earlier.
The fall in the pound since last year’s Brexit vote has fueled inflation by pushing up the cost of imported goods. With inflation outstripping wage growth pressure on household spending is likely to worsen which could dampen growth.

Mr. Moore denied any wrongdoing and declined calls from Republican party leaders to step aside in the race for the seat Jeff Sessions held before he became attorney general.
The race was closely watched by markets because of the potential impact on a razor-thin margin in the Senate ahead of an expected final vote on Trump's tax cut plans.

Starting this week, the brokerage will allow its users to take short positions on bitcoin futures under certain conditions, according to company spokeswoman Kalen Holliday, who said the decision was made “in response to client demand.” Interactive Brokers has accepted long positions with a margin requirement of at least 50 percent since the contracts debuted Sunday on Cboe Global Markets Inc.
Shorting bitcoin futures, or betting that their price will fall, is potentially an even riskier strategy. It’s possible to lose an unlimited amount of money on a short position, particularly if the cost of the digital currency and its derivatives continues to climb. 
Interactive Brokers has a few requirements for shorting bitcoin futures: the spread must be one-to-one, and the short leg must have the earlier expiry date so that once it expires the surviving leg will be long, according to Holliday. Trading won’t be offered in retirement accounts or to Japanese residents."

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  BNP Paribas  SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are all touting a version of the strategy, based on the idea that the greenback will benefit from rising U.S. interest rates and tax cuts, while the Swiss National Bank maintains the lowest policy rate of any major central bank.
“Our G-10 FX directional trade of the year is higher USD/CHF,” David Woo, Bank of America’s head of global rates, FX and EM fixed-income strategy and economics, wrote in a note. “Balance of payments and continued policy divergence between the Fed and Swiss National Bank will likely drive the trade.”
BNP recommends going long dollar-Swiss with a target of 1.04 by mid year, anticipating an almost 5 percent gain for the greenback. It was little changed at 0.9922 francs per dollar as of 1:45 p.m. in New York.
“The market is underpricing the positive impact of higher U.S. cash rates and tax legislation on the USD,” said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy in North America at BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP). “A continued dovish Swiss National Bank outlook combined with declining euro-zone political risk premium should be consistent with continued CHF depreciation.”
The dollar’s one-year risk reversal against the franc, a barometer of positioning, sank to the lowest in more than 12 years last month, making it very cheap to buy insurance against a surging U.S. currency.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Paul Meggyesi said the greenback will be supported by expectations of higher U.S. rates and tax cuts, or what he calls “Trumponomics Lite.”"

432,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 12:17AM ET</span>",Dollar firm with focus on Fed meeting; kiwi edges higher,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held firm near two-week highs versus a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, with traders awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week for fresh catalysts. 
The dollar index, (DXY) which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major peers, inched up 0.1 percent to 93.931. That was within sight of Friday's peak of 94.087, the highest since Nov. 21.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates at its two-day policy meeting that will end on Wednesday and is expected to tighten policy further next year.
Most economists polled by Reuters now expect three more rate rises next year compared with two when surveyed just weeks ago, although the outlook remains clouded by stubbornly subdued inflation.
Since a rate hike this week has been priced in, the dollar could sag initially after the Fed's policy announcement, said Steven Dooley, currency strategist for Western Union Business Solutions in Melbourne.
The Fed, however, will probably sound optimistic about the economic outlook and that is likely to help underpin the greenback, he added. 
""Once the initial flurry of short-term volatility rides out, we're likely to see the U.S. dollar stronger again,"" Dooley said, describing how the dollar could react to the Fed's policy announcement due on Wednesday.
""It seems most likely that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to sound optimistic and certainly continue on the path to raise rates three times next year,"" Dooley said.
Against the yen, the dollar eased 0.1 percent to 113.48 yen , after having risen to as high as 113.69 yen on Monday, the dollar's strongest level in about a month.
The dollar could come under pressure if Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounds less confident that inflation will rise toward the central bank's 2-percent target, in her remarks during a post-meeting news conference, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
Even in that case the market reaction could be limited, however, as investors seek more clarity on the views of incoming Fed chair Jerome Powell, Murata said. The dollar will likely find support at levels around 112.00 yen or so, Murata added.
The euro last changed hands at $1.1771 , having pulled back from Monday's intraday high of $1.1811.
The New Zealand dollar set a fresh two-week high as investors welcomed the appointment of national pension fund chief Adrian Orr, a former central bank official, to head the Reserve Bank of New Zealand from March.
The New Zealand dollar , which had climbed nearly 1.1 percent on Monday following the announcement, extended its gains on Tuesday and rose to $0.6937 at one point, its highest level since Nov. 28. It was last trading at $0.6927, up 0.3 percent on the day.
Investors were relieved by the selection of an official with extensive expertise in monetary policy, and expected he would not veer too far from the status quo as he carries out a new dual mandate. Bitcoin slipped 1.4 percent to around $16,247 (BTC=BTSP) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, having set an all-time high of $17,270 on the exchange on Monday. 

Newly launched bitcoin futures <0#XBT:> on Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets suggested that traders expect the cryptocurrency's blistering price gains to slow in the coming months, even as it blasted above $17,000 on Monday to a fresh record high in the spot market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar retraced most of its early weakness on Monday before the Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates on Wednesday, though concerns about tepid inflation were seen weighing on the greenback.
When the U.S. central bank concludes its two-day December policy meeting, investors will be watching for concern about low inflation from Fed officials and any indications that this may make further rate hikes next year less likely. 
Tepid wage growth in Friday’s jobs report for November added to concerns that inflation will remain benign and complicate the Fed’s ability to execute further rate hikes.
“Markets after last week’s numbers are probably going into the Fed a little bit more cautious, especially if (Yellen) continues to play out the disappointments we’ve seen around inflation and how that may impact the outlook next year,” said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was last down 0.09 percent at 93.82, after earlier falling as low as 93.666.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday will be a key data focus for further clues on price pressures.
The greenback pared losses as U.S. Treasury yields rose back from morning lows, which were reached on safety buying after an explosion rocked one of New York's busiest commuter hubs.
“That played a pretty significant role in the rebound in the dollar,” said Kathy Lien, a managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.
Safe-haven currencies the Japanese yen and Swiss franc had also gained after the explosion at New York’s Port Authority. New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio said it was ""an attempted terrorist attack.""
The dollar was last down 0.01 percent at 113.47 yen  and down 0.22 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.99 francs .
The kiwi  jumped over one percent after the New Zealand government named pension fund chief Adrian Orr as the nation's new central bank governor, as markets bet a radical shake-up of monetary policy will be avoided.
Bitcoin was also in the spotlight, as futures of the cryptocurrency began trading on CBOE Global Markets. 
Bitcoin was up around 12 percent at $16,455 (BTC=BTSP) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, just shy of an all-time high of $16,666.66 hit on the exchange on Friday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was steady in early Asian trade on Monday, underpinned by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates, while bitcoin seized the spotlight as futures of the cryptocurrency began trading.
U.S. employment data on Friday showed a bigger rise in jobs than expected in November, but the dollar's gains were capped by disappointing wage data that analysts said could weigh on the pace of interest rate hikes next year.
Bitcoin was up 1.2 percent at $14,819.05 (BTC=BTSP) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its two-day policy meeting that will end on Wednesday, and is seen as likely to tighten two or three times in 2018. But still-sluggish inflation has clouded the policy outlook.
""There is a consensus that the Fed will hike this week, so what investors are most interested in is any clue as to what it will do next year, and the pace of interest rate increases,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.16% to 93.90.
The Labor Department said Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls rose by 228,000 jobs in November, as the post-hurricane recovery in the labor market continued. That beat economists’ forecasts for 200,000 new jobs. 
Wage growth, however, undershot expectations rising just 0.2% compared to expectations for a 0.3% increase, while wage growth in the previous month was revised downwards dropping to 0.1% 
The subdued wage growth did little to derail expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike its meeting next week. That said, however, market participants warned that ongoing lucklustre wage growth could reduce expectations for a March rate hike.
“Today’s report won’t have any bearing on December, where markets widely expect a 0.25% hike, but if soft prints in wage and price inflation continue the impetus for a March rate hike is likely to fade,” TD securities said. “We expect the Fed to take the next step in rate normalization next week, followed by two more hikes in 2018.”
Also adding to dollar support was a slump in the pound following reports of a “breakthrough” in UK-EU brexit negotiations as the UK is believed to have agreed to pay up €50 billion to settle the so-called Brexit divorce bill. With the divorce bill out the way, the UK-EU negotiations on a trade deal are expected to get underway.

The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the economy created 228,000 in November, beating expectations for an increase of 200,000 jobs.
The unemployment rate held at 4.1% last month, in line with expectations.

For the week, the loonie is on track to fall 1.2 percent, after the Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1 percent on Wednesday, and tempered expectations for a hike in the coming months.
The central bank has insisted its interest rate decisions are data-dependent, yet analysts were puzzled this week when policy makers took a more cautious tone than strong domestic data would suggest.

Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve, with the two-year (CA2YT=RR) flat to yield 1.498 percent and the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) falling 10 Canadian cents to yield 1.868 percent.

The optimism in Bitcoin comes amid expectations that bitcoin exchange-traded-funds will follow the launch of Bitcoin futures, which many believe paves the way for bitcoin to become an established asset class, which would spur institutional demand.
Cboe Global Markets Inc. said on Monday that it will start trading Bitcoin futures on Decemner 10, after receiving the go ahead last week from US futures regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The news came after CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) announced last week that it would launch Bitcoin futures on December 18.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Bitcoin lost almost a fifth of its value in 10 hours on Friday, having surged more than 40 percent in the preceding 48 hours, sparking fears the market may be heading for a price collapse.
In a hectic day on Thursday, bitcoin leapt from below $16,000 to $19,500 in less than an hour on the U.S.-based GDAX, one of the biggest exchanges globally, while it was still changing hands at about $15,900 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp (BTC=BTSP).
Having then climbed to $16,666 on Bitstamp at around 0200 GMT on Friday, it tumbled to $13,482 by around 1200 GMT - a slide of more than 19 percent. 
As of 1320 GMT it had recovered to around $14,400, still down 13 percent on the day.
""This correction is an appropriate one after such frenzied trading,"" said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial consultancy deVere Group, in a note to clients. ""We should expect to see bitcoin see-sawing in coming weeks.""
""Today's digital world needs cryptocurrencies. One or two of the existing ones will succeed. Whether it's bitcoin or not remains to be seen,"" he added.
As bitcoin slumped, other cryptocurrencies climbed. Ethereum the second-biggest, was up almost 6 percent by 1320 GMT, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.
For the week, bitcoin was still up almost a third. Since the start of October, bitcoin has more than tripled in price - its strongest quarterly performance since 2013.
And since the start of the year, it has increased by about 15 times in value - a rise that led to growing concerns the bubble would burst in dramatic fashion.
The rise has drawn in millions of new investors. So far this week, more than half a million new users have opened wallets with retail-focused bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, the firm said, doubling the total number of users to 20 million since last year.
Some market-watchers say the most recent lurch higher in bitcoin can be explained by the coming launch of bitcoin futures on major derivatives exchanges. The Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets exchange will launch a futures contract on Sunday, to be followed by CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and Nasdaq.

""The fact that Cboe, CME and Nasdaq are preparing to launch Bitcoin trading instruments in the near future could be perceived by investors as a further step towards an international acceptance of Bitcoin,"" said Peter Iosif, analyst at currency broker IronFX.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2017 07:06AM ET</span>","U.S. tax cuts to eventually underpin dollar, but may sink in meantime: Reuters poll","By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is set to lose a bit more ground against other major currencies next year, challenging a view among most foreign exchange dealers that aggressive tax cuts just passed by the Senate will have a positive effect on the currency.
The latest monthly Reuters poll, taken Dec 4-6, found a slight majority of currency strategists who answered an extra question thought that if the final bill looks similar, it ought to support the dollar beyond a year from now too.
Still, the forecasts collected this week on how the dollar will perform were notably weaker, with the 12-month euro forecast the strongest in over three years of Reuters polls. 
That suggests any boost to the already-strong U.S. economy the tax cuts may provide remains unclear.
""In terms of the impact of the approved fiscal reform, analysis suggests that, at best, there will be a slightly positive economic impact in the short-run which could help to contain the USD weakening trend seen in most of 2017 against its G10 peers,"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia, strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
The dollar has lost close to 9 percent against a basket of six major currencies this year, on course for its worst calendar year performance in 14 years.
The bill that narrowly made it through the Senate last week is expected to scrap many exemptions and reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. That is likely to increase the budget deficit by about $1 trillion over a decade.
Median forecasts from the poll put the euro  at $1.22 in 12 months. BBVA, who rank in the top third of most accurate forecasters for 12-month euro views over the past year in a sample of nearly 60, holds the median view.
ING Financial Markets, among the top 10 most accurate euro/dollar forecasters on a 12-month horizon over the past year has the highest forecast at $1.30.
The European Central Bank is widely expected to wind down its asset purchase program by the end of next year, which is nudging the euro higher against the dollar.
Over the past year, the path of least resistance for the dollar has been lower. That is despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's campaign, launched two years ago, to gradually lift short-term interest rates.
About a third of the analysts who said the final tax bill will support the greenback beyond a year from now still had forecasts for a weaker dollar over the next 12 months.
Only a month ago, a poll of the same analysts said major tax cut legislation was required to push the dollar higher.
Earlier this year, several currency strategists who had aggressive dollar forecasts - some were even calling for the euro to fall to parity to it - had to quickly sweep away those views as instead the euro bolted higher.
Kit Juckes, market strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), notes that the most recent dollar peak in real terms, struck a year ago, was the lowest of three peaks since 1980. That, he argues, is because real Treasury yields have barely moved up.
""The 1985 dollar peak was associated with 10-year note yields almost 10 percent above inflation. The 2001 peak followed a rise in real yields to 5 percent. So far, the peak in this cycle is a paltry 0.6 percent,"" he wrote in a client note.
""The bond market would need to do a lot better to justify a higher dollar peak,"" he noted. SocGen is forecasting the dollar to slip another 10 percent from current levels.
Currency speculators have raised their net short dollar positions to the highest in over a month, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Until there is more clarity on the final tax bill and when any ensuing stimulus is first likely to take place, downward pressure on the dollar may linger.
""We remain skeptical about the impact on investment and efficiency, which are the economic effects that would increase potential output and have a positive impact on the USD,"" noted BBVA's Garcia.
""Thus, we anticipate a limited impact that could be slightly positive in the very short term and slightly negative in the long run but broadly neutral in terms of long-term projections.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling's outlook is stable over the coming year, but a few currency strategists polled by Reuters expect it to make significant gains if negotiations over Britain's departure from the European Union take a positive turn.
Forecasts from the poll of around 60 foreign exchange specialists, taken Dec 4-6, predict the pound  will be worth $1.33 in a month, $1.32 in six and $1.33 in a year. 
It was trading at $1.34 late on Wednesday and medians were little changed from last month.
The most optimistic forecaster - ING - said the pound would be worth $1.53 in a year, which is the highest forecast provided in Reuters polls taken since the EU membership referendum in June 2016. 
""We believe that sterling markets are underestimating the cyclical economic benefits of a Brexit transition deal. There is more upside to come – especially if a transition deal were to be signed, sealed and delivered in Q1 2018,"" Viraj Patel at ING said. 
""We sniff an opportunity right now for a positive sterling re-rating were we to see further Brexit progress.""
Currency speculators flipped to a net long sterling position for the first time in four weeks in the week to Nov. 28, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
However, investors remain hesitant about chasing the rallying pound higher even as the British government said it was close to an agreement with the European Union on how to move Brexit talks onto trade next year.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Theresa May came under pressure after a Brexit deal collapsed at the last minute and the gloomiest forecast, from NORD/LB, was for cable at $1.20 in a year.
""There will be no 'sufficient progress' to start with negotiations about trade at the beginning of next year. In an environment of uncertainty, economic conditions in the UK will become more and more fragile,"" said Jens Kramer at NORD/LB. 
""Therefore, we do not expect the Bank of England to proceed with another rate hike during the next year. All this will weigh on the exchange rate.""
Last month, the BoE added back the 25 basis points it took off borrowing costs in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, taking Bank Rate back to 0.50 percent, but it won't act again until towards the end of 2018 when it will add another 25 basis points, medians in a recent Reuters poll showed.

The euro zone economy has emerged as a star performer this year, outshining Britain, and the European Central Bank announced in October a cut to monthly bond buying from January. It is expected to wind down its asset purchases next year. 
So against the euro (EURGBP=) the pound was expected to weaken a little. On Wednesday, one euro would get you 88.1 pence and according to the poll it would be worth 88.6p in a month, 90.0p in six and 12 months.
As with cable forecasts, the year-out range was wide, going from 76.7p to 102.0p.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against peers on Thursday, shaking off earlier losses versus the yen, supported by signs that investors' risk appetites were improving again and by optimism on U.S. tax reforms.
The greenback was 0.1 percent higher at 112.380 yen  after dropping by 0.25 percent overnight.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, on optimism about progress on U.S. tax legislation and lawmakers' efforts to avert a U.S. government shutdown on Saturday.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.17 percent at 93.54.
""The dollar is finding some support on expectations that Congress is going to pass tax legislation sometime this year,"" said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives began staking out their positions on final tax legislation on Tuesday, days ahead of talks with the Senate to shape the tax package.
Republicans hope to approve a final bill and deliver it to President Donald Trump's desk before Christmas. If they succeed, it would be the first major U.S. tax overhaul in 31 years and the first big Republican legislative victory since Trump took office in January.
""Also, some of the concerns about a government shutdown have been alleviated,"" Harajli said.
Democratic leaders in Congress on Monday accepted an invitation to meet Trump and Republicans for talks to avert a shutdown, even as the Democrats pressed demands on funding priorities and protecting young immigrants.
The dollar index moved higher after data from a payrolls processor showed U.S. private-sector employment growth eased in November even as the manufacturing sector added the most jobs in at least 15 years.
The dollar was 0.36 percent lower against the Japanese yen.
Mizuho's Harajli attributed some of the dollar's weakness against the yen to worries that Trump's upcoming announcement that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel could threaten stability in the region.
The yen tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption that Japanese investors will repatriate funds should a crisis materialize.
""It's a safe-haven play,"" Harajli said.
Bitcoin extended its eye-popping rally, breaking above $12,000 to a record high despite questions about the cryptocurrency's real value and worries about a bubble.
Sterling extended an earlier decline to hit a one-week low after the Sun newspaper's political editor said on Twitter a Brexit deal is unlikely this week. 
Sterling was 0.42 percent lower against the dollar at $1.3385.

483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 02:30PM ET</span>",Worst Dollar Run in a Decade Set for 2018 Redux on Global Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- A hawkish Federal Reserve, an economy firing on all cylinders, the tentative revival of the “Trump Trade” -- all that won’t be enough to boost the dollar next year, according to a chorus of Wall Street strategists.
The dollar is heading for its worst year in more than a decade, and bearish projections are still piling up. Analysts say the steady unraveling of the greenback’s post-crisis bull run will be confirmed next year as global growth gathers pace and central banks converge on a more hawkish tone.
“Beware of sleeping volcanoes and seriously undervalued currencies,” Kit Juckes, global fixed-income strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, wrote in a report Tuesday. With global “growth becoming more balanced and more synchronized, the dollar looks expensive.”
Traditional valuation models are set to stage a tentative recovery as central banks become more tolerant of currency appreciation, while yields in overseas markets rise, according to analysts.
“We think 2017 was a watershed year for the dollar,” said Ned Rumpeltin, currency strategist at TD Securities Inc. “As long as global growth maintains a steady pace, reflationary tailwinds persist, and U.S. inflation does not unexpectedly -- and uniquely -- surge, the global macro landscape should favor a steady depreciation of the dollar.”
Case in point: The dollar’s underwhelming reaction to legislative progress on U.S. tax reform, which was seen as the linchpin for reflation after Trump was elected.
For greenback bears, the reasoning is simple. The tax plan is unlikely to spark a sudden surge of repatriation, while stronger global growth spurs higher yields overseas and the euro-zone recovery gains more traction.
“Bringing the money back will merely involve an ‘accounting’ shift rather than a withdrawal of offshore dollar liquidity,” George Saravelos, head of foreign-exchange research at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), wrote in a note.
While the first half of next year may deliver more of the same, the dollar will likely be under even more pressure in the second half of next year as interest-rate markets price in less monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank, analysts said.
The Federal Reserve would likely need to deliver a hawkish shock accompanied by much higher real yields to give dollar bulls hope. 
While the U.S. Dollar Index has tumbled 8.6 percent this year, it remains 25 percent above its 2011 low, and, in real terms, the exchange rate is 5 percent above its 20-year average, according to Societe Generale.

What’s the line in the sand to watch for? The yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities doubling to 1 percent, according to Juckes. Even a one percentage-point increase in the federal funds rate is unlikely to juice the U.S. currency given the improving foreign-exchange fundamentals overseas, he said.
Strategists at TD Securities are more bearish, casting the dollar as the most overvalued currency in the Group of 10 nations. Only a global financial shock is likely to rally the greenback, according to TD Securities.
The bank recommends long positions in an equal-weighted basket of the euro, Swedish krona and New Zealand dollar versus the U.S. currency and the Swiss franc.
Societe Generale projects the benchmark U.S. dollar index will drop 4.5 percent by the end of 2018, and is bullish the euro, Australian dollar, the Norwegian krone and a slew of eastern European currencies against the dollar.
“The main theme for major currencies in 2018 will be how long the dollar can continue to trade at historically strong levels following its long bull run since 2011,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin, head of currency strategy at NatWest Markets, wrote in a note last month.

With the Senate and House of Representatives set to get talks underway this week to reconciled their respective bills, investors remained optimistic that the final bill will reach President Donald Trump for approval before year-end.
The tax cuts, widely viewed as inflationary, continued to spur an uptick in the dollar, offsetting economic data showing US services activity in November fell short of expectations.
The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index showed a reading of 57.4 for November compared to 60.1 in October, missing economists' expectations for a reading of 59.
Some market participants warned, however, that markets could behave “irrationally” amid ongoing changes to tax bill.
“Expect the next two or three days for the market to behave irrationally. A lot of changes are being made to the tax bill and it obviously impacts various sectors in different ways,” said Massud Ghaussy, director at Nasdaq Advisory Services.
For the second day in a row, euro weakness supported an uptick in the dollar as the single currency struggled to pare losses despite upbeat services PMI data.
EUR/USD fell 0.42% to $1.1816, while EUR/GBP fell 0.19% to £0.8785.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>","Buy sterling on a 'Brexit breakthrough'? Not yet, say investors","By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling investors remain hesitant about chasing the rallying pound higher even as the British government said it was close to an agreement with the European Union on how to move Brexit talks onto trade next year.
British hopes of securing a deal with the European Union were dashed on Monday by Prime Minister Theresa May's kingmakers in Belfast. The government is holding fresh talks and said on Tuesday it remained confident of reaching an agreement.
After spending most of 2017 on the back foot against a broadly weak dollar, market expectations on sterling have shifted considerably in recent weeks towards betting on a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations with the British currency <GBP=D3> rising to more than a two-month high last Friday.
High-frequency indicators of market positioning and options market hedging have also shifted markedly to show green shoots of optimism emerging.
Speculative bets on sterling, shown in data compiled by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and often seen as a proxy for hedge fund positioning, outweighed those betting on a fall in sterling for the first time since the Bank of England raised interest rates in early November.
Prior to that brief pre rate rise flurry, there had not been a net long position in sterling since October 2015.
What's more the cost of one-month options to buy sterling in the derivatives market exceed that of options to sell it for the first time since October 2017.
But despite sterling's bounce in recent days, investors remain wary about the currency's outlook pointing to the long complicated negotiations before Brexit becomes a reality in 2019 and the underlying weakness of the British economy.
""There is still a lot of work to be done before we get any clarity and to take big positions in this headline-driven market is fraught with dangers,"" said James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.
So despite a cautious return in long sterling bets in the currency markets, the duration of those positions have become shorter, indicating how nervous markets are.
So far, these net sterling long bets are only a week old, compared to in October which remained for a month. The longest duration of long sterling bets was for a year between Sept 2013 to late 2014, according to CFTC data.
At the heart of this nervousness is a view that any Brexit outcome, either ""soft"" or ""hard"", will weigh on the economy at a time when other major world economies such as Europe and the U.S. are firing on all cylinders.
""The key issue for sterling is that from an economic standpoint it looks tough and any bounce after a Brexit talks breakthrough will be a buy-the-rumor and sell-the-fact trade,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investments at Millennium Global Investments Ltd in London.
Annual growth forecasts will average 2.4 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year across the 19-member eurozone currency bloc compared with UK growth of 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.2 percent in 2018, according to OECD forecasts.
TRANSITION DEAL
To be sure, a breakthrough in the talks would lift the fog of uncertainty hanging over British companies, encouraging them to invest more and ultimately lift economic activity in itself.
Despite the breakdown in talks at the last minute on Monday the border issue with Ireland, foreign exchange derivative markets are betting on a breakthrough.
Three-month 'risk reversals' on sterling <GBP3MRR=>, which shows the relative pricing of puts and calls on the pound, have flipped to a bias of more sterling strength in the last week, though they remain below a 2017 high hit in early September.
Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg in London expects a transition deal to materialize by late 2018 an outcome that would boost economic growth to 1.8 percent.
It would also lead to a significant revaluation on sterling which according to SSGA's Binny is trading about 15 percent cheaper against the dollar on a valuation basis.
On a trade-weighted basis (=GBP), sterling is trading at a six-month high and just one percent below a 2017 peak.
WALKING A FINE LINE
But even assuming a successful negotiation of the complex series of Brexit talks, sterling still has considerable headwinds against its two major rivals, namely the dollar and the euro.
Some market participants expect the U.S. may end up raising interest rates by as much as four times over the next 12 months after a landmark tax code overhaul over the weekend.
John Taylor, senior fixed income portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in London said the UK will have to raise rates by two times ""at least to hang on to the coat tails of the Fed.""
""The Bank of England can't afford to not tighten at all as that would weaken the currency a lot and if they hike more they may end up tipping the economy into recession well before Brexit kicks in,"" Taylor said who is underweight duration on UK debt.
Bond markets in the UK only expect one rate hike over the next twelve months. Against Europe, it is more of a differential growth story with growth in the currency bloc expected to pick up steam relative to the UK.
""Sterling movements have become kneejerk and pavlovian depending on the headline of the day and institutional investors are now focusing on the economic data,"" said Marc Ostwald, market strategist at ADM Investor Services.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2017 10:59AM ET</span>",Dollar hits three-week high vs. yen on U.S. tax bill prospects,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against most currencies on Monday, hitting a three-week high versus the yen after the U.S. Senate approved a major tax overhaul over the weekend that aims to cut taxes for businesses, while proposing a mixed package of changes for individual Americans.
""Dollar bulls are pinning their hopes on the sweeping tax deal leading to a more rapid pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve,"" said Jake Spark, U.S. corporate hedging manager at Western Union Business Solutions, in Washington.
The Republican tax legislation would be the largest change to U.S. tax laws since the 1980s. Republicans want to add $1.4 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt to finance changes that they say would further boost the economy.
Talks will begin, likely this week, between the Senate and the House of Representatives, which already approved its own version of the legislation, to reconcile their respective bills.
Some market participants, however, were skeptical about how significant the impact would be on U.S. growth. 
""We are talking in the region of a 0.2 to 0.3 percent growth boost annually to what is already a very elevated trajectory of growth, and we don't expect that to have a major impact on U.S. interest rates,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in London.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose to 113.08 yen , the highest since mid-November, and was last at 112.83, up 0.7 percent.
The euro, meanwhile, also fell against the dollar, down 0.4 percent at $1.1836 , pushing the dollar index to trade up 0.4 percent on the day at 93.255 (DXY)
Investors are also focused this week on a key U.S. non-farm payrolls report, with analysts forecasting a 200,000 jobs gain for November versus 260,000 the previous month.
This would be the last employment report before the Federal Reserve holds its last policy meeting for the year next week and markets have already priced in a rate hike for that meeting. 
However, currency markets expect the Fed to raise rates only slightly more than twice next year and even though U.S. 10-year U.S. yields were higher on Monday, they remain effectively within a 15 basis-point range over the last two months. 

Sterling, meanwhile, was the only major currency that gained against the dollar. It traded 0.3 percent higher at $1.3521  after a member of the European Parliament's Brexit group said there was a ""very good chance"" of a deal on an initial divorce package between Britain and the European Union.

The data showing a surge in jobs in November came ahead of a Bank of Canada interest rate decision on Wednesday.
The central bank is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate steady at 1 percent. But chances of a hike in January have increased to more than 50 percent from 47 percent before Friday's jobs data.

U.S. crude (CLc1) prices were down 1.25 percent at $57.63 a barrel. 
Canada will continue to explore a free trade agreement with China, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, as it weighs its options after the United States threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year (CA2YT=RR) fell 4.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.544 percent and the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) declined 25 Canadian cents to yield 1.939 percent.

509,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2017 11:38PM ET</span>","Dollar rises as US Senate passes tax bill, pound awaits May-Juncker meeting","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was broadly higher on Monday, reaching a 2-1/2-week peak against the yen, lifted after the U.S. Senate approved a tax overhaul at the weekend.
The Senate's approval on Saturday moves Republicans and President Donald Trump a big step closer to their goal of slashing taxes in what would be the largest change to U.S. tax laws since the 1980s.
The dollar has drawn support on expectations that tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy would stimulate the U.S. economy, and also drive Treasury yields higher, as the government becomes more dependent on debt due to reduced tax income.
Talks will begin, likely this week, between the Senate and the House, which already has approved its own version of the legislation, to reconcile their respective bills.
""From a technical perspective the dollar is positioned to extend its gains. But fundamentally it will need progress between the Senate and the House on the tax agenda and also an upbeat reading from Friday's employment data,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The dollar still has to contend with potential negative pressure from the ongoing Russia probe, especially if investigations affect President (Donald) Trump's inner circle.""
The greenback took a knock on Friday after former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
For now, the dollar was on the front foot, up 0.4 percent at 112.735 yen  after rising to 112.985, its highest since Nov. 17.
The euro slipped 0.25 percent to $1.1871 , while the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies added 0.25 percent to 93.110 (DXY).
The U.S. currency was supported as Treasury yields rose. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) climbed about 4 basis points to 2.404 percent in response to the U.S. Senate's approval of the tax bills.
Treasury yields rose along with U.S. equities futures (ESc1), which pointed to a higher open for Wall Street shares later in the session. U.S. stocks have recently surged to record highs, supported by the prospect of the U.S. tax cut bill being passed.
""The dollar is only making measured gains and this reflects the still remaining caution in the currency market towards U.S. tax reforms,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""While not yet as optimistic as the equity market, the currency market is likely to further warm to the idea of the tax bill's eventual passage."" 
Other currencies slipped against the dollar but the pound got away relatively unscathed thanks to the prospect of Britain's divorce talks with the European Union making further progress.
In focus was a meeting between British Prime Minister Theresa May, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, which will mark the ""absolute deadline"" for London to deliver ""sufficient progress"" in its divorce offer as set by European Council President Donald Tusk.
Sterling was 0.05 percent lower at $1.3472  but still in reach of a two-month high of $1.3550 scaled on Friday.

The Australian dollar slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7602  and the New Zealand dollar was down 0.4 percent at $0.6863 .

513,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2017 04:30PM ET</span>",36-Year-Old Makes $62 Million With Instant Online Flea Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Yusuke Mitsumoto had a hunch: what if you paid people instantly for their used goods over the internet, with no guarantee that they would hand them over?
The 36 year-old e-commerce entrepreneur launched an app in June to test the idea. It worked better than he imagined; after 16 hours, he was stunned to discover he was on the hook for 3.6 billion yen ($32 million) and shut the service down. A day later, truckloads of clothes and electronics gadgets started to arrive, with his startup’s employees forming a bucket line to move packages into his company’s tiny office in Tokyo.
All told, less than 1 in 10 second-hand-goods sellers didn’t deliver as promised. That was good enough for Mitsumoto, who relaunched the service, called Cash, in August as a new way to gather inventory for an online flea market. Total daily purchases are capped at 10 million yen, and are limited to smartphones, luxury handbags, watches, clothing and other specific items from a list of several thousand. Customers take a photo and are given a non-negotiable offer. Prices are set automatically based on data gleaned from other second-hand marketplaces and Cash makes money by reselling the goods.
“It was a social experiment,” said Mitsumoto, who started selling goods on the web in 1996. He later launched Stores.jp, Japan’s version of Shopify, which he sold and then bought back. “Of course, I believed that good people would outnumber the bad, but the question was by how much. That’s not something you can find out without trying.”
Second-hand sales are a big business in Japan and a market worth 1.6 trillion yen, according to the Reuse Business Journal. Bookoff Corp. has hundreds of stores that buy and sell everything from used books to video games and electronics. Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan Corp. operates the country’s biggest online auction site. Mercari Inc. became Japan’s first startup to be valued at more than $1 billion with a smartphone app that made it easy for people to sell unwanted things to each other.
What Mitsumoto discovered was a way to remove the last bit of friction for sellers to get rid of stuff, unlocking value wasting away in people’s closets. He tapped into a market of people who lacked either the time or the patience to take nice pictures, write product descriptions and haggle with buyers.
He also knew that it was only a matter of time before bigger rivals followed with similar offerings. So when Mitsumoto got a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message on Oct. 4 at 1:58 a.m., “Hi! This is Kameyama~! Sell Cash to me~! No?” he saw a way to stay ahead of the competition.
Keishi Kameyama is one of Japan’s richest people and the founder of DMM.com, a media and technology empire with $1.6 billion in revenue. Kameyama started with pornography but has grown his company into a vast collection of enterprises that spans a currency trading platform, video games, an online English school and solar farms. Mitsumoto agreed to sell Cash to DMM for 7 billion yen and continue running the business.
“For people doing internet businesses in Japan, DMM is a scary presence,” Mitsumoto said. “You never know when they may launch their own business and become a tough rival. I figured it’s best to at least meet.”
Indeed, a week after the deal was announced, Mercari launched an identical offering.
Kameyama said his team recognized the potential of the market uncovered by Mitsumoto, but admits that the eye-popping valuation for a company of six people that’s not even one year old was also partly an ""acquihire"" —an acquisition based on hiring.
“Doing business on the internet is not all capital and equipment, you need a certain intuition, a design sense and ability to get a service going, ” Kameyama, 56, said in an interview. “I can also appreciate a bold play. There aren’t that many audacious people in this world.”"

519,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2017 06:20AM ET</span>","China, France pledge fair trade, 'reciprocal' benefits","By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China and France agreed on Friday to support free and fair trade, and for the first time pledged ""reciprocal"" treatment in their trade relations, they said after ministerial economic talks.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said progress had been made in the food, aerospace, nuclear and finance sectors, while China recognized that government subsidies can lead to overcapacity in the steel sector.
""We discussed (reciprocity) for a long time, and I think we managed to make China see the importance of this notion and its importance in commercial ties"", Le Maire told a news conference in Beijing, adding that it was the first time the term was included in a statement after the meetings. 
The two sides said they ""reiterate their support for free and fair trade, based on principles of reciprocal and mutual benefits and non-discrimination"", according to the joint statement after the China-France High-Level Economic and Financial Dialogue in Beijing.
China this year has pledged to further open its economy to foreign firms as it looks to kickstart new growth areas and amid complaints from foreign businesses about market access, with the idea of reciprocity of benefits becoming a focus of trade discussions.
""Protectionism develops when there is no fair trade and no rules of reciprocity. That's why France insists on global commerce being based on rules of reciprocity,"" Le Maire said. 
Chinese vice finance minister Shi Yaobin said reciprocity was a relative concept, not an absolute. 
""Different countries have different levels of development, so in the process of opening up, achieving absolute reciprocity ... can't be achieved. In the whole world it doesn't exist,"" Shi told reporters. 
Chinese vice premier Ma Kai made similar comments in opening remarks, noting that the Chinese economy was developing in a stable way but developed and emerging economies had differences.
He also said that protectionism and terrorism were uncertainties for the recovery of the global economy. 
The two sides said they would work to eliminate trade distortions, increase communication on trade barriers, and increase trade in the tech-tech sector, according to the statement. 
China, the world's top consumer of pork, is set to approve more imports of French pork, processed meat and infant formula after passing inspections, Le Maire said.
""In the sectors of infant formula, pork, and charcuterie products, the publication of audit results that we were waiting for will allow us to export more easily these products as well as beef,"" Le Maire said. 
The two sides will encourage Chinese and French firms to issue yuan bonds in both countries, while China agreed to increase France's Renminbi Foreign Institutional Investor quota at an appropriate time, they said in their joint statement. 
China recently pledged wider access to its massive financial services sector by raising the limit on foreign ownership in banks, securities and insurance firms, though some of the changes will not take effect for several years.
""We would always like things to go faster, but the key thing is the direction, and the direction that came out of this dialogue is the right one,"" said Le Maire.

551,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 05:00PM ET</span>","North Korea Launches ICBM Near Japan, Ending Two-Month Lull (3)","(Bloomberg) -- North Korea shattered a two-month period of relative quiet by firing an intercontinental ballistic missile, in its first provocation since U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision this month to label the country a state sponsor of terrorism.
The U.S. and Japan said the projectile was fired early Wednesday Japan time from North Korea’s west coast at a lofted trajectory before landing in the Sea of Japan. South Korea’s military said it staged a “precision strike” missile exercise within minutes of the launch.
""I will only tell you that we will take care of it,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Wednesday he will request an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis said that the missile flew higher than any previous North Korean launch. He said the missile went higher than any previous test, and the South Korean response “made certain that North Korea understands they could be taken under fire by our ally.”
‘Ironclad’ Commitment
“Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad,” according to the Pentagon statement. “We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation.”
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert separately said that “diplomatic options remain viable and open for now.”
The yen fell as much as 0.5 percent, then pared losses to trade at 111.46 per dollar as of 5:55 a.m. in Tokyo, close to levels seen during earlier trading.
“People have got somewhat conditioned to some of these tests that we’ve seen,” said Mark Lister, head of private wealth research at Craigs Investment Partners in Wellington, which manages about $7 billion. “It’s good that no one is panicking and the world isn’t hanging off every development, but on the other hand maybe we’re all a little bit complacent.”
Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said that the ICBM may have reached an altitude of 4,000 kilometers (about 2,500 miles). The Pentagon said in a statement that it traveled about 1,000 kilometers before splashing down in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, which extends about 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) off the coast.
The missile could have more than enough range to hit any part of the continental U.S., wrote David Wright, the co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists Global Security Program.
Lull Over
“If these numbers are correct, then if flown on a standard trajectory rather than this lofted trajectory, this missile would have a range of more than 13,000 km (8,100 miles),” he wrote on his All Things Nuclear blog.
The launch ends a lull in test activity by the Kim regime. North Korea’s last provocation was on Sept. 15 when it fired a second missile over Japan in as many months.
The pause in provocations had led to a softer tone toward the country from top U.S. officials including Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. In an interview earlier this month, Tillerson said he could envision talks with Kim Jong Un’s regime as a precursor to formal negotiations.
“Eventually we’re going to have one of those days where we’re both going to say, ‘OK, maybe it’s a good time to have that first conversation,’” Tillerson said during a trip to Asia, adding a caution: “Now, Kim could surprise us tomorrow with another missile launch.”
Terrorism Label
Earlier on the trip, Trump called on North Korea to “come to the table” to make a deal to end its nuclear program, and aides later said the president was genuinely interested in talks toward an agreement.
The launch follows Trump’s Nov. 20 decision to label North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism because of its threats of nuclear devastation and support of terrorist acts including assassinations on foreign soil. North Korea responded by saying the designation reminds the country it should keep hold of its ""precious nuclear sword.""
Kim’s regime conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, and has launched more than a dozen missiles this year as Kim seeks the capability to hit the continental U.S. with a nuclear weapon. The United Nations has imposed stringent sanctions on North Korea for its weapons tests.
On Nov. 14, the U.S. wrapped up strike force drills in the Western Pacific using three aircraft carriers -- the first such exercise in a decade. North Korea routinely complains about U.S. drills in the region, using them as justification to ratchet up its own weapons program.
(Updates with Trump, Mattis comments. An earlier version corrected a Pentagon quote in fourth paragraph to say ‘North America’, not ‘North Korea’.)

571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 11:10PM ET</span>","Efforts to hurt Qatar's riyal may backfire on region, central banker says","By Andrew Torchia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Some Arab states are trying to destabilize Qatar's riyal but efforts to drive down its value could backfire by hurting other dollar-linked currencies in the region, a Qatari central banker said.
Khalid Alkhater, currently in Britain on leave from the central bank, was commenting on moves by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to isolate Qatar. Doha's rivals say it supports terrorism, which it denies.
""It's deliberate economic warfare, a strategy to cause fear or panic among the public and investors to destabilize the economy,"" Alkhater told Reuters in a telephone interview, saying he was giving his personal views.
Saudi Arabia, the United Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in June. Most independent analysts think its economy, with huge gas and financial reserves, can weather the storm and do not see any serious risk of a devaluation of the riyal, whose dollar peg of 3.64 riyals has been enshrined in law since 2001.
Alkhater, architect of Qatar's monetary policy in the 2008 global financial crisis, said part of the strategy to undermine the riyal involved trading Qatar government bonds at artificially low prices to suggest the economy was in trouble.
This failed because the market in Qatari bonds was illiquid so trading in high volumes was difficult and because Qatar had taken precautionary steps, said Alkhater, on sabbatical leave doing research at Britain's University of Cambridge. He did not identify the measures.
Alkhater blamed low quotes for Qatar's riyal in the offshore market on some banks - which he said were from nations boycotting Qatar, without naming the institutions - seeking to manipulate the market by exchanging the currency at weaker levels than on the onshore market. He did not provide evidence.
The riyal changed hands onshore last week very close to its official peg of 3.64 to the U.S. dollar, but it traded as low as 3.8950 offshore on the Reuters conversational dealing platform.
Equity index compiler MSCI cited this gap last week when it said it might use offshore foreign exchange rates to value Qatar's stock market, potentially changing the weighting of Qatari equities in MSCI's emerging market index.
Qatar's central bank responded by saying it would provide currency needs to all investors and was working with banks to ensure transactions could be conducted normally.
Central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani, in office since 2006, said last month that the government and the central bank could support the banking system with both state reserves and the holdings of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.
Alkhater said Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, could in future consider other steps to bolster the riyal if needed, such as taking payments for LNG exports in riyals rather than dollars, which would create global demand for its currency.
But he said there was a risk that efforts to undermine the riyal could shake confidence in dollar-linked currencies of other oil-reliant Gulf Arab states.
""It could spark contagion across a region which is tied to the U.S. through dollar pegs, and which is already suffering from financial distress and economic difficulties due to low oil prices,"" he said, calling attacks on Qatar's riyal ""a weapon of mutual destruction"".
Any increase of pressure on the currency of Bahrain, whose debt is rated junk, could cause Manama to seek support from Saudi Arabia, whose own economy is battling a big state budget deficit due to three years of weak oil prices, Alkhater said.
He added that the boycott was forcing Qatar to be more self-sufficient in agriculture, food processing and light manufacturing, accelerating a long-term goal to diversify the economy. ""Now Qatar has to expedite it out of necessity.""

572,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 11:05PM ET</span>","Euro at two-month high on upbeat German sentiment data, political hopes","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high versus the dollar and held firm against other major currencies on Monday thanks to strong German business confidence and reduced anxiety about political instability in Europe's biggest economy.
The euro fetched $1.1929 , little changed from late U.S. levels last week after having hit a high of $1.1946, its highest level in two months. 
The common currency now faces a test at $1.1965. That level is the 76.4 percent retracement of its decline from a 2 1/2-year peak of $1.2092 touched on Sept 8 to a 3-1/2-month low of $1.1553 set on Nov 7. It has gained 3.2 percent from that low.
The euro rose to 133.24 yen (EURJPY=R), its highest since Nov 16 and it firmed on the British pound to 0.8978 pound (EURGBP=D4), edging to near this month's peak of 0.9014.
The German business confidence index compiled by the Ifo economic institute hit a record high in November, in another sign of strong growth in the euro zone's largest economy.
The upbeat data was followed by positive political developments after German Chancellor Angela Merkel - whose chances for a fourth term were plunged into doubt a week ago when three-way coalition talks with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens collapsed - was handed a political lifeline by the Social Democrats (SDP).
That helped ease worries about political instability in the country as Leaders Merkel's conservative party agreed on Sunday to pursue a ""grand coalition"" with the SPD.
In contrast, the dollar lacked momentum of its own as persistently low inflation is seen as undermining the case for the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
Market players are looking to the Congressional hearing on Fed Chair nominee Jerome Powell on Tuesday.
President Donald Trump's tax reform plan is also in focus. Trump is due to meet Senate Republicans on Tuesday to discuss the party's efforts to pass tax reform legislation.
""First the Republicans have to agree on a plan between the Senate and the House of Representatives. Then that plan would need to be approved by the both chambers. That would need considerable time and effort,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The dollar index (DXY) (=USD) stood flat at 92.801, near two-month low of 92.675 touched on Friday.
Sterling fetched $1.3325 , holding near Friday's two-month peak of $1.3360.
Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.15 percent to 111.35 yen , edging towards Thursday's two-month low of 111.07, as the yen was aided by softness in Chinese and Asian shares.
Because the yen is often used as a funding currency for investment in riskier assets, it tends to be bought back when risk sentiment sours.
The yen's gains were more noticeable against the risk-sensitive Australian dollar, which fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 84.60 yen (AUDJPY=R), threatening to fall below a five-month low of 84.51 touched a week ago.
The Aussie dollar shed 0.25 percent against the U.S. dollar to $0.7600 .
Elsewhere, the South African rand bounced back 0.6 percent to 14.070 to the dollar , after a 2.0 percent fall on Friday.
S&P Global Ratings downgraded South African local currency debt to ""junk"" territory on Friday, citing a further deterioration in the country's economic outlook and public finances, sending the rand tumbling.

But Moody's decision to only place South Africa on review for a downgrade, rather than a cut, cushioned the blow, helping the rand to recoup some of Friday's losses.

A weaker dollar last week also helped spur demand.
Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.11% to $1,288.70 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Copper for December delivery fell 0.70% to $3.169 a pound.
U.S data on personal income and spending, which includes the personal consumption expenditures inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation, will also be closely watched.
Last week, gold prices slid lower on Friday as some investors took profits at the end of the week, but losses were held in check by the weaker dollar.
A weaker dollar typically tends to support gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes more affordable to foreign buyers when the dollar declines.
The dollar remained on the back foot after Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s November meeting showed that some officials were concerned inflation would stay below the bank's 2% target for longer than expected.
The minutes echoed comments by Fed Chair Janet Yellen earlier in the week that she was uncertain about the inflation outlook.
While a rate hike in December is still almost fully priced in, investors pared back expectations for further rate hikes in 2018, sending the dollar lower.
A weaker dollar and a pickup in global growth have pushed copper prices up almost 27% this year.
Along with new leadership at the Fed, investors await comments from a number of Fed speakers, including both the current chair and next head of the U.S. central bank.

574,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 08:43PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Mixed With All Eyes On OPEC Meeting,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices were mixed in Asia on Monday as the market turned cautious ahead of a key OPEC meeting near the end of the week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dipped 0.42% to $58.70 a barrel. ICE Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., rose 0.47% to $63.77 a barrel.
This week, market participants will focus on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries highly-anticipated meeting on Thursday to see whether major producers plan to extend their current production-cut agreement.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until the end of next year in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Energy traders will also eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Last week, crude oil prices finished higher in an abbreviated session on Friday, with the U.S. benchmark surging to its best level since July 2015, as the shutdown at North America's Keystone pipeline continued to cut deliveries to storage facilities.
For the week, WTI gained about 4.2%, while Brent marked a climb of about 1.8%.
The disruption to the Keystone pipeline connecting Canada’s Alberta oil sands to U.S. refineries has reduced the usual 590,000 barrel-per-day flow to U.S. refineries, driving down inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.
Flow from the pipeline, which was shut on Nov. 16 following a 5,000-barrel spill in South Dakota, was expected to be reduced by 85% through the end of November, according to line operator TransCanada.
Crude prices were further supported by growing signals that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies will agree to prolong supply curbs when producers meet in Vienna at the end of the month.
Russia said on Friday it is ready to support extending a deal among oil producers on cutting output, but made no mention of how long this should last beyond its March expiry.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day for the first six months of 2017. The agreement was then extended back in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude markets are well underway.

581,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 24, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",U.K. Labour Consults $57 Billion Hedge Fund Shorting Pound,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. Labour Party is consulting a hedge fund that is betting against Britain’s currency and says the economy may need an International Monetary Fund bailout.
BlueBay Asset Management LLP, which manages $57 billion of assets and is among investors that are speaking to the opposition party, is planning to meet its self-styled radical finance chief, John McDonnell, next week, according to people familiar with the matter.
“We’re not giving a political endorsement to a political party here, but as macro investors we actively engage in dialogue with policymakers across the spectrum,” said Mark Dowding, a senior portfolio manager at the firm. “There are elements of what Labour stands for that we find interesting and there may be elements that we disagree with.” He declined to comment on the meeting. Spokespeople for McDonnell also declined to comment.
Bridge building between the financial elite and a party led by long-time critics of business -- McDonnell calls himself a fan of Karl Marx -- reflects preparations by U.K. Plc for the demise of Theresa May’s Conservative government. She lost her majority in a stunning June election result that, combined with Cabinet infighting and fumbling over Brexit, have undermined her standing.
With gaining power now a realistic outcome for old-school Socialists like McDonnell and party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour is taking “advice and assistance” from asset managers to build an informal partnership with business leaders, McDonnell said in a BBC interview Wednesday. He said he didn’t want to “draw them into the politics” by naming them.
Corbyn Means Business: Investor Guide to Labour’s Plan for U.K.
BlueBay, owned by Royal Bank of Canada, is based in London’s Mayfair district and has offices across Europe and the U.S. It manages money for institutional investors and invests mainly in fixed-income securities. Its funds are shorting the pound and U.K. government bonds, meaning they will gain from a selloff, according to BlueBay’s Dowding.
The U.K. economy is so weak it may require a bailout from the IMF, as in 1976, Dowding warned in July.
Even McDonnell, who would be finance minister in a Labour government, has had his doubts. While a run on the pound is unlikely if Labour takes power, “you never know,” he said in September. Labour is “going to be a radical government,” he said. The party has pledged to take into state ownership the railways, water companies and  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) Plc, as well as some energy companies.
The pound declined about 17 percent against the dollar from the June 2016 vote to pull Britain out of the European Union until the start of 2017. It has recovered about half those losses this year. The currency is trading at about $1.33 now; at its 2017 low, it slipped under $1.20.
BlueBay first starting talking to Labour officials late in 2016, according to one of the people. At that time the firm’s predictions defied political consensus, with Dowding writing in a company blog post that an election was possible in 2017 “which we believe would lead to Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street.” BlueBay then requested a meeting with McDonnell soon after the June 2017 election, the person said.
BlueBay’s Labour point man is portfolio manager Mark Bathgate, 43. He joined the firm in 2016 following stints at banks including UBS Group AG and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Bathgate, whose job at BlueBay includes meeting politicians and regulators, correctly predicted the surprise outcome of the U.K. general election on June 8, according to a report published by the Legatum Institute think tank last month.
“It’s not a surprise there is a swing toward redistributionist policy” because living standards in the U.K. have fallen, Bathgate said by phone. “Whether it’s good or bad is not for us to decide. We’re making sure we engage with a prospective government.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hit a six-week high against the dollar on Friday, with investors optimistic about the strength of the euro zone's recovery after strong economic data this week. 
The single currency is up around 0.7 percent since Monday , putting it on course for a third straight week of gains against the dollar - its best run since July.
The euro had started the week on the back foot, knocked by political uncertainty in Germany after coalition talks failed, but it recovered quickly as investors focused on a robust growth outlook for Europe, and as the dollar weakened broadly. 
Minutes from the European Central Bank's latest policy meeting, released on Thursday, showed policymakers had broadly agreed on extending their quantitative easing (QE) scheme, albeit at a lower level, though a decision to keep the asset purchases open-ended appeared to generate fiercer debate.
""Without the ECB's recent commitment to maintain QE purchases until the end of September of next year, the euro would likely be trading at even stronger levels at the current juncture,"" said MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman, in London. 
""While there is still a risk that ongoing political developments could potentially trigger another knee jerk euro sell off in the coming weeks or months, any bouts of euro weakness should remain both temporary and limited,"" he added.
The euro traded at $1.1865 in London trade, its strongest since Oct. 13, having been given a boost by better-than-expected services and manufacturing industry surveys on Thursday that pointed to a strengthening growth outlook in Europe. 
The dollar hit a five-week low against a basket of currencies (DXY), with trade thinned this week the North American Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, which was also a national holiday in Japan.
The dollar skidded on Wednesday after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed some policymakers fretting over stubbornly weak inflation. That led some to question expectations of hikes in 2018. 
The core personal consumption expenditures price index has consistently fallen short of the central bank's 2 percent target for over five years, even as the Fed has moved toward normalizing policy.
""Hedge funds that close their books this month have been taking profits on their dollar-long positions,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign-exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.
""This has kept the dollar under pressure, and combined with thin liquidity from the holiday, it would be hard for it to climb this session,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose for a third consecutive day on Thursday after breaking through a key technical level when a flurry of European business surveys pointed to a strengthening growth outlook for the region.
Surveys covering both the services and manufacturing industries in Europe outshone even the most optimistic forecasters in Reuters polls, indicating growth is broad-based.
The euro  was up 0.2 percent on the day at $1.1850 against the dollar and not far from a one-month high of $1.1862 set last week in a holiday-shortened week. 
Trading conditions were thinner than usual on Thursday, with Japanese financial markets shut for a public holiday and U.S. markets closed for Thanksgiving.
""The economy seems to be on autopilot for now, not dependent on reform or leadership to the same extent as in 2003-04, when the euro zone required reforms and thus strong leadership,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said in a note.

""There is a general trend of euro-positive sentiment going through the markets and that is keeping the euro firmly supported and the ECB minutes were along expected lines,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.
The minutes of the European Central Bank for its October meeting didn't yield anything new, with policymakers broadly agreeing last month on extending its asset purchase scheme. 
It also chalked up steady gains against the Swiss franc (EURCHF=) and the British pound (EURGBP=), respectively.
Meanwhile the dollar nursed losses after posting its biggest loss in five months on Wednesday as investors trimmed bets on the outlook for U.S. interest rate hikes next year, based on minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.
With Chinese stocks down between 2-3 percent in Asian trade, low yielding currencies such as the Japanese yen  and the Swiss franc  remain firmly supported against the greenback as investors shied away from taking positions in a holiday-shortened week.
The Fed minutes, however, also highlighted concern among some of the members over the inflation outlook, with the emphasis placed on economic data in determining the timing of future rate rises.
The dollar (DXY) edged 0.1 percent lower against a broad trade-weighted basket of currencies on Thursday to 93.15 after falling 0.8 percent in the previous session, its biggest daily percentage fall since June.
Chinese shares took a sharp hit in the Asian session with mainland indexes down between 2-3 percent, exacerbating investor caution and dampening risk appetite. 
Reflecting the growing uncertainty about the future outlook for U.S. interest rates, an overnight rally in June futures contracts  meant that markets were pricing in a U.S. Fed funds target rate of 1.58 percent by then, implying only 2 more rate hikes, below market consensus.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2017 06:40AM ET</span>",Sterling seismograph eerily calm on EU summit,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - For a currency that has seen some of its biggest ever one-day moves on the back of Brexit, there is a peculiar calm in sterling hedging prices surrounding December's critical European Union summit. 
For many, the Dec. 13-14 get-together marks a critical juncture in the process of Britain leaving the bloc, with some market analysts seeing it as a potential make-or-break moment for the pound.
At stake is whether Prime Minister Theresa May can satisfy other EU leaders that Britain has made enough commitments on issues like a final settlement bill and the Irish border to quickly start trade negotiations next year as the clock ticks down. Otherwise, the risk of economically-damaging 'no deal' Brexit rises dramatically.
Yet, even with so much at stake, options markets that reflect expected volatility around next month's event and data on speculative sterling positioning appear largely neutral.
In fact, one-month implied volatility in sterling against the U.S. dollar is currently less than its 8.6 percent average of the past 20 years.
Traders still think the pound will be more volatile than other major currencies such as the euro and Swiss franc, though, and say the indication of calm is more reflective of the subdued price action of the most recent period, rather than of what could be in store.
""Sterling volatility has tended to remain higher even as FX volatility has declined, which suggests markets have a greater capacity to discount negative headlines,"" said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets.
Implied volatility for sterling for one month against the dollar  is higher than three-month rates and stands at a chunky 8 percent. Sterling volatility against currencies such as the Japanese yen  and the Australian dollar  is even higher.
In comparison, three-month implied volatility for the euro against the dollar stands at a relatively tame 6 percent  while overall stock market volatility is within touching distance of a record low of 9 percent hit this month.
One factor making traders wary of translating signals from derivatives into trades in the cash market is that the former have thrown up some conflicting signals in recent weeks.
For example, three-month 'risk reversals' on sterling , which shows the relative pricing of puts and calls on the pound, consistently indicated a bias to further sterling weakness throughout the year even as the pound gained ground against the dollar. It is up 10 percent to date in 2017.
""As a result, betting on sterling via the options markets has been a bit of a money losing trade this year,"" said a trader at a global macro hedge fund in London.
Still, that hasn't stopped directional bets and the cost of buying sterling puts - options to sell - remain more expensive than calls - options to buy - and show some traders at least are assuming the outcome of the EU summit will be sterling negative.
Underlying structural factors for sterling have also worsened markedly in recent months, such as a widening current account deficit, prompting some money managers to call for the British pound to be traded like an emerging market currency at a Reuters Investment Summit last week.

GHOSTS OF BREXIT PAST
With few if any precedents for an event like Brexit to guide traders through the next month, large investors are harking back to trading patterns leading up to the referendum vote last year.
""The problem for investors is there are no historical references to form an expectation on something such as Brexit with a long agenda of negotiations leading up to it,"" Pascal Blanque, who oversees 1.4 trillion euros at Europe's largest asset manager Amundi told the Reuters Global Investment Summit.
As a result, some traders are taking recourse in the options markets, although expiries around the summit are less about taking directional bets and more about guarding against spikes in volatility.
What's more, the one-month options that surround the crucial EU summit also capture key central bank policy decisions in both the United States and Britain. 
""It is very difficult for investors to take a directional view given the mixed messages from politicians on the negotiation progress, therefore long volatility positions such as straddles are a good choice over outright cash bets,"" said Jordan Rochester, an FX strategist at Nomura in London. 
As a result, speculative bets on sterling are broadly flat, unlike before the Brexit vote, while institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are broadly underweight the British currency in their portfolios. 
With expectations for a major breakthrough in policy talks low, buying so-called ""option straddles"" which involves simultaneously selling and buying currency derivatives on either side of the summit have gained popularity.
A survey by Nomura showed that only 31 percent of its clients expected a Brexit transition deal to be agreed by January 2018, although a majority still think Brexit will go ahead.
But unlike the sharp run-up in volatility gauges in May-June last year, implied volatility on sterling remains a fraction of what it was in the final days before the Brexit vote suggesting some market participants are toning down their expectations for next month's summit.
""Unlike the hard binary event Brexit vote last June, this is a summit and so markets are not getting too worried about this,"" said SSGM's Graf.

With outgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen not offering any firm clues on where monetary policy in the world's biggest economy is headed, the dollar's near-term outlook remained uncertain.
Yellen stuck by her prediction that U.S. inflation will soon rebound but offered on Tuesday an unusually strong caveat: she is ""very uncertain"" about this and is open to the possibility that prices could remain low for years to come. 
""The monetary policy side of things is unlikely to provide any momentum for the dollar exchange rates until year-end,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists said in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Tuesday after registering its biggest daily fall in the previous session as investors looked beyond Germany's political impasse to focus on the euro zone's still robust economy.
With major currencies closeted in tight trading ranges in a lackluster session in a holiday-shortened week, traders were wary of taking big bets.
""The worst case scenario is that the German political process will take a little more time to resolve but markets are not expecting anything extraordinary to come out of this and the bigger picture is that the economy is performing well,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the prospect on Monday of a new election after talks on forming a three-way coalition collapsed. 
But two of her veteran allies urged parties on Tuesday to make compromises and form a stable government.
The single currency  was flat at $1.1725 after falling half a percent on Monday, its biggest daily fall since Oct. 26. 
With growth from the bloc exceeding the United States in the third quarter, led by largest economy Germany, the single currency has recovered from earlier lows and investors were becoming more comfortable in holding European assets.
TD strategists said a snap election would not necessarily be a negative for the euro in the medium term and they continued to believe that the growth dynamics should outweigh any flare-up in political uncertainty.
Derivatives markets pointed to further upside for the euro with risk reversals still at elevated levels while implied volatility gauges held near 2017 lows.
Elsewhere, the dollar gave back some of its gains in Asian trading but stuck close to a one-week high against a basket of currencies .
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was broadly flat at 94.08 (DXY), but was still within sight of its overnight peak of 94.104, its highest since Nov. 14.

623,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2017 04:31PM ET</span>",Euro Reverses Losses as Merkel Weighs Government Options,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro reversed early losses as investors saw the failure of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition talks as most likely paving the way to a minority government, rather than fresh elections.
The common currency snapped earlier declines seen during the Asian session on Monday, after the pro-business Free Democrats, which earlier walked out on talks, told the German newspaper Bild that it would support a minority government. That makes the possibility of a Christian Democratic-led bloc more likely, and assuages pressure on Merkel.
Before the latest setback, investors had remained confident that Merkel would be able to seal a deal before the end of a self-imposed deadline. She can either now pursue a minority-led government or request new elections from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier -- both of which are unprecedented in the federal republic’s 68-year history. Still, the market impact may be muted as the developments are unlikely to harm growth or inflation in the euro area.
A minority government is “probably the path of least resistance at this point,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank in London. “While this creates some near-term uncertainty, we downplay the risks that this will turn into anything more than a minor bump in the road.”
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.1800 as of 9:36 a.m. in London, after dropping as much as 0.6 percent, the most in three weeks. German 10-year government bond yields were steady at 0.36 percent after opening down one basis point.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2017 04:35AM ET</span>",Euro rebounds from earlier lows as traders brush off Germany worries,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro recovered from a two-month low against the yen touched in Asian trade on Monday, with investors brushing off the broader political risks of a failure of German Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a three-way coalition government.
Merkel, whose conservatives were weakened after they won an election in September with a reduced number of seats, said she would inform the German president that she could not form a coalition, after the pro-business Free Democrats withdrew from negotiations. 
The development thrust Germany into a political crisis that raised worries among investors of a new election if Merkel cannot form a minority government. 
The main fear in that scenario would be that the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could add to the 13 percent of votes it secured in September. But the parliamentary process required to get through another election is considered to be quite difficult, involving more than one vote in the German parliament. 
After selling off sharply in early deals in Asia, trading down as much as 0.8 percent to hit 131.16 yen (EURJPY=EBS), its weakest since Sept. 15, the euro rebounded as much as 1 percent to trade slightly higher on the day, at 132.33 yen. 
""There was a substantial move in Asia, but what I think is more relevant is the European trading hours, and we can already see a slight recovery,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.
""So there’s no panic in the market at all – it’s really a European story,"" she added. ""We’re not seeing a broad risk-off move here."" 
The dollar had also sold off against the yen - generally sought at times of uncertainty - in Asian trading, dipping to a one-month low . But it turned slightly higher against the Japanese currency in European trading, at 112.05 yen. 
The euro fell as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading to $1.1722 , pulling away from a one-month high of $1.1862 set on Wednesday last week. But it recovered to trade up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1802 in London trade. 
""Maybe what markets are saying overall is that minority government or further coalition talks are fine, as long as the economy is growing,"" wrote  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) macro strategist Kit Juckes, in London.

President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that Senator Jeff Flake will oppose the Republican tax bill, but the senator's office said he has not yet made up his mind.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.27% to 93.59.
The greenback struggled to pare losses despite data showing October housing starts rose to their highest since Oct 2016, pointing to underlying strength in the US economy. 
Housing starts surged 13.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. 
The housing sector has showed a strong recovery in the South after disruptions from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. A rebound in the South, however, was not the main reason for the upbeat housing data as analysts noted that non-hurricane hit areas such as the Northeast and Midwest showed strong housing sector growth for the month.
The upbeat housing data failed to offset negative sentiment on the greenback which followed reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was set to issue fresh subpoenas for the Trump campaign, probing possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Losses in the greenback, however, were limited as the Canadian dollar came under pressure following data showing domestic inflation remained subdued in October, reducing expectations of further monetary policy action from the Bank of Canada.
The euro, meanwhile, traded higher against the greenback shrugging off dovish comments from European Central president Mario Draghi.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower against a basket of other major currencies on Friday, as investors remained skeptical of U.S. Republicans' efforts to pass tax cuts after a barren first year for the Trump administration in Congress.
Congressional Republicans took important steps on Thursday toward the biggest U.S. tax code overhaul since the 1980s, with the House of Representatives approving a broad package of tax cuts and a Senate panel advancing its own version of the legislation sought by senior lawmakers and President Donald Trump.
The House vote shifted the tax debate to the Senate, where a tax-writing panel finished debating and approved a bill late on Thursday. That measure has already encountered resistance from some within the Republicans ranks. 
Full Senate action is expected after next week's Thanksgiving holiday.
""Traders are not jumping the gun here. They're looking to see what happens as the political sausage-making process runs its course,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
""The saying to think of here is politicians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity,"" he said, adding that while any potential benefits to the dollar may be priced in, any disappointment could hurt the greenback.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was down 0.14 percent to 93.805. For the week, the index was down 0.6 percent.
The dollar was also pressured by a report on Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators probing possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election had subpoenaed Trump's election campaign for documents.
""This is unquestioningly going to weigh on the administration's ability to pass tax reform and enact any other fiscal reform measures that would support the economy,"" Schamotta said.
The dollar firmed briefly after data showed U.S. homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October.
The euro  was up 0.16 percent to $1.1788. The greenback was down 0.54 percent against the Japanese yen.
The Canadian dollar weakened to a 10-day low against its U.S. counterpart after data showing subdued domestic inflation reduced expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada through the first quarter of next year.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars both headed for sizable weekly falls as their yield buffers over the U.S. dollar shrank to the smallest in over 17 years, undermining their appeal as carry trades.

The greenback was up 0.59 against the Australian dollar, and the kiwi was down 0.8 percent.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday as data showing a surprise rise in domestic manufacturing sales in September offset lower oil prices.
The 0.5 percent increase in manufacturing sales topped economists' forecasts for a 0.3 percent decline, while volumes rose 0.7 percent.
The data was ""modestly positive for the Canadian dollar,"" Nick Exarhos, an economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a research report. ""But the narrow scope of the increase and the still troubling trend in export volumes continues to point to reasons for concern ahead.""
Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, dipped on rising U.S. crude production and inventories.
U.S. crude (CLc1) prices were down 0.27 percent at $55.18 a barrel.
Investors have also been focusing this week on the resumption of North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiations. NAFTA working groups began meeting on Wednesday in Mexico. Talks will begin on Friday and continue through Nov. 21. 
A cautious approach to monetary policy may be prudent during times of uncertainty like today, but caution has its limits because the trade-off can be financial instability, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said on Wednesday.
At 9:20 a.m. ET (1420 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was trading at C$1.2750 to the greenback, or 78.43 U.S. cents, up 0.1 percent.
The currency traded in a narrow range of C$1.2742 to C$1.2785.
Canadian companies cut 5,700 workers from their payrolls in October, with the loss concentrated in the goods-producing sector, according to a new employment report from ADP.
Foreign investors bought a net C$16.81 billion in Canadian securities in September, led by Canadian bonds, following a revised C$9.77 billion acquisition in August, Statistics Canada said.
Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries as global markets regained some of their risk appetite after a sharp sell-off in stocks over the past week.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from four-week lows against the yen on Thursday, as global markets regained some of their risk appetite after a sharp sell-off in stocks and the greenback - and heavy flows into safe-haven assets - over the past week. 
With share prices rebounding across Asia and Europe and Wall Street also set to open higher, the dollar climbed around a third of a percent to 113.17 yen , up from lows of 112.47 yen on Wednesday plumbed as a risk-off mood took hold. 
Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was 0.2 percent higher (DXY), having fallen to its lowest in almost four weeks on Wednesday - a severe correction from the uptrend that began in early September on hopes of a tax cut deal. 
Investors say they do not expect any risk-off moves to be lasting, because of a robust growth backdrop. 
""We do not currently expect risk-aversion to rise sustainably because global growth expectations are strong enough to compensate for adverse developments’ dampening impact on sentiment,"" said  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) currency strategist Manuel Oliveri, in London. 
Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, also in London, said hawkish comments late on Wednesday from Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren, who said the Fed should continue to raise interest rates and should do so next month, had also helped the dollar.
But concerns over U.S. tax reform plans were keeping a lid on any dollar gains. 
The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress was approaching a major test on Thursday of its ability to overhaul the federal tax code, as lawmakers prepared for their first full-scale vote on sweeping tax legislation.
""For the moment, the U.S. tax cuts will be the main theme of the markets. I would expect negotiation to drag on beyond the year-end but by the first quarter of next year, there will be a deal,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
With the dollar recovering, the euro slipped quarter of a percent to $1.1764 , having reached as high as $1.1862 on Wednesday, its best level in over one month.
The Australian dollar bounced from near five-month lows as a mostly upbeat local employment report triggered a round of short-covering.
The Aussie traded flat percent at $0.7584, having plumbed a low of $0.7567 , a trough last seen in late June.

The Global Foreign Exchange Committee said on Wednesday it had concluded that traders should not undertake trading activity that uses information from a customer's trading request during the ""last look"" window.
""Last look"" refers to the ability of dealers to reject a trade at the last minute. Critics say traders could potentially abuse this by using the market intelligence gained to influence other trades.
The committee said the decision would be reflected in a revised version of its code that was launched in May in response to banks being fined billions of dollars for rigging currency benchmarks.
The committee said it had also agreed to clarify conditions under which certain trading arrangements could be distinguished from ""last look"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro remained close to 2-1/2 week highs in early Asian trading on Wednesday, getting a boost from upbeat German economic data as investors awaited U.S. consumer inflation data later in the global session. 
The common currency edged down slightly to $1.1791  after jumping more than 1 percent in the previous session. It moved well away from a 3-1/2-month low of $1.1553 plumbed last week.
The euro's ascent pushed down the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals. It was steady on the day at 93.856 (DXY), wallowing at its lowest levels since late October and well below its overnight high of 94.542. 
Germany's seasonally adjusted gross domestic product rose by 0.8 percent on the quarter, beating a Reuters poll forecast of 0.6 percent.
Investors awaited U.S. consumer inflation data for October later on Wednesday, which is expected to show a marginal increase in consumer prices.
""If it is weaker, then that may push down the probability of a Fed rate hike in December,"" said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
""Right now, Fed fund futures are pricing in around 80 percent, but it could go down to like 50-50,"" he said. ""And if we do get a weak number, then I would think the euro would continue to strengthen, versus the dollar.""
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. producer prices rose a more-than-expected 0.4 percent last month, boosting the PPI 2.8 percent in the 12 months through October for the biggest annual increase in wholesale inflation in more than 5-1/2 years.
But economists said the strong producer price readings probably did not translate into higher consumer prices in October because the correlation between the PPI and consumer price index has weakened.
Against the yen, the greenback inched slightly lower to 113.43 , remaining well below its eight-month high of 114.735 hit last week.
Data released earlier on Wednesday showed Japan's economy posted its longest period of uninterrupted growth in more than a decade, expanding at a 1.4 percent annualised rate in the July-September quarter. That was slightly above the median estimate for annualised growth of 1.3 percent.

The consumer price index remained steady at 3.0% in October, matching September’s figure the Office for National Statistics reported. Economists had expected an increase to 3.1%.
The ONS said food prices jumped across “all main classes of product” including dairy products, which have seen recent wholesale shortages. Rising food prices offset a fall in the cost of fuel.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar got support from higher U.S. Treasury yields in early Asian trading on Tuesday, while sterling arrested a recent slide, which followed concerns about Theresa May's ability to stay on as British prime minister.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was steady on the day at 94.499 (DXY).
Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar inched 0.1 percent higher to 113.70 yen , but remained below its eight-month high of 114.735 hit last week.
""The dollar is getting support from U.S. yields, but I am actually surprised that it did not go higher, so perhaps the correlation between yields and the dollar is breaking down,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""But with the Fed expected to hike rates in December, the dollar could go higher"" in the coming weeks, he said.
The yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes scaled a nine-year peak on Monday, as the yield curve resumed its flattening and investors priced in a 25-basis-point interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month. [US/]

The euro was steady at $1.1670 , holding well above last week's a 3-1/2-month low of $1.1553.
Sterling edged up 0.1 percent to $1.3122 after coming under pressure from political turmoil ahead of this week's debate by British lawmakers about the government's plan to leave the European Union.

The index had ended the previous week on a loss of 0.6 percent amid investor disappointment that a proposed U.S. corporate tax cut could be delayed until 2019 instead of being implemented in 2018.
""The sharp rise by Treasury yields certainly is not hurting the dollar. But the yield rise appears mostly technical in nature - the recent flattening trend is being unwound - so the positive impact on the dollar is limited,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
Bond traders had favored longer-dated Treasuries over shorter-dated issues the past two weeks on concerns about the tax overhaul and a diminished likelihood of an introduction of a Treasury bond that matures beyond 30 years. [US/]
As a result, the spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields reached its lowest since 2007 last week, before rising slightly.
""In my view, the U.S. tax reform talks are proceeding roughly according to schedule. It cannot get much worse, and this is a supportive factor for the dollar,"" Yamamoto at Mizuho Securities said.

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar lost 0.05 percent to $0.7655  to edge back towards a 3-1/2-month low of $0.7625 marked at the end of October. The currency has come under pressure with its yield buffer over the greenback shrinking to its narrowest since 2001.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.11% to $56.80 a barrel. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., fell 0.14% to $63.58 a barrel.
Helping oil rebound some in Asia this morning is an explosion at a Saudi-Bahraini pipeline and the prospect that a large earthquake in Iraq and Iran could have damaged oil infrastructure there, notes OM Financial's Stuart Ive.
In the week ahead, monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties on Monday and the International Energy Agency on Tuesday will be closely-watched to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
Last week, oil prices settled a bit lower on Friday, with a recent rally finally showing signs of slowing after closely-watched data showed an uptick in U.S. drilling activity.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by nine to 738 last week, underlining worries that U.S. producers will ramp up output with prices holding near 28-month highs.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
Oil's rally, which began in early October, has been largely driven by expectations that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
Prices received another boost amid ongoing unrest in the Middle East as well as escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s top producers of oil and OPEC’s most influential member.

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, showed consumer confidence in the economy cooled, as the index showed a preliminary reading for November of 97.8, missing expectations for reading of 100.7.
Meanwhile, fears of delays to corporate tax cuts until 2019 continued to weigh on the greenback after U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that was significantly different from the House of Representatives’ version.
Senators said that they wanted to slash the corporate rate to 20% from 35%, but in 2019, which differs from the GOP plan to slash the corporate rate immediately.

Sterling climbed to its highest since last week’s Bank of England interest-rate increase after Brexit secretary David Davis and his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier said they would work with the goal of moving talks on to trade next month. The currency was also supported on Friday by better-than-forecast industrial data, and an estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that suggested economic growth had accelerated in October. Benchmark 10-year gilt yields rose to the highest in a week.
With the negotiations between Britain and the EU previously described as deadlocked, traders were relieved that Friday’s comments from Davis and Barnier appeared less negative than feared, according to  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV currency strategist Viraj Patel.
“Negativity is now embedded into these talks, it’s the norm,” Patel said. “Maybe the two-week deadline gives some people a glimmer of hope that we get the answer to the big ‘deal or no deal’ question.”
With time running out to resolve differences over the U.K.’s exit bill before a crucial December summit, the Financial Times reported on Thursday that Britain was prepared to put forward a higher offer. While the U.K.’s Davis said on Friday that the talks were making progress, he added that the financial settlement still needed to be worked on.
The pound rose 0.6 percent to $1.3218 as of 4:03 p.m. in London, taking its weekly gain to 1.1 percent. Sterling strengthened 0.4 percent to 88.23 pence per euro. The yield on U.K. 10-year gilts rose seven basis points to 1.34 percent, the highest level since Nov. 2.

Adding fuel to the bears, consumer sentiment took a hit in November, according to preliminary data released on Friday.
Specifically, preliminary publication of the data for this month from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment fell to 97.8 when forecasts had suggested the index would remain unchanged at 100.7, while readings for current conditions and expectations also missed expectations.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, lost 0.07% at 94.34 by 11:17AM ET (16:17GMT), just off a one-week low of 94.16 hit earlier on Friday.

Year-on-year, manufacturing production increased more than expected by 2.7% in September, while industrial production advanced by 2.5%.

Australia's central bank has cut its forecasts for core inflation which it no longer expects to reach the floor of its 2%-3% target band until early 2019, a strong signal that rates won't rise for a long time to come.
""Inflation and wage growth remain low. Both are expected to increase only gradually over time,"" Governor Phil Lowe said.
""Important uncertainties influencing the outlook for inflation include questions of how much wage growth might pick up as the labour market tightens, and how quickly the resulting increase in labour costs might feed into inflation.""

Senate Republicans on Thursday plan to propose delaying a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% until 2019, The Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing four people briefed on the planning.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar licked its wounds on Friday, on track for weekly losses after dropping on disappointment with a tax bill put forth by U.S. Senate Republicans that would delay expected corporate tax cuts. 
The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly flat on the day at 94.483 (DXY) after skidding 0.36 percent in the previous session, down 0.5 percent for the week. 
The Senate Republicans' bill to rewrite the tax code differed from their House counterparts' plan. Like the House version, the Senate's proposal would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, but the Senate plan would delay implementation until 2019.
Both plans call for a tax on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals. The Senate wants that tax to be 12 percent for cash and liquid assets, and 5 percent for non-liquid assets. The House amended its bill on Thursday, going to 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
Both bills would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the U.S. budget deficit and national debt, which in the past would likely have faced criticism from Republicans.
The dollar inched 0.1 percent lower to 113.40 yen , down 0.6 percent for the week and well below its eight-month high of 114.737 logged on Monday.
""I've been warning that November is a dangerous month for the dollar,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign-exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.
Funds that close their books this month could take profits on dollar-long positions, as well as their holdings of U.S. stocks, he said, adding that U.S. tax plan details could offer them excuses to sell. 
Higher U.S. yields underpinned the dollar, with the 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) at 2.338 percent, compared with its U.S. close on Thursday of 2.331 percent. While yields fell amid uncertainty about tax reform, they rose again as prices were pressured by this week's government and corporate debt supply. [US/]

The move to delay corporate tax represents a significant shift from President Donald Trump’s view that immediate tax cuts are needed to stimulate the economy.
Also weighing on the dollar was a report showing weakness in the labor market after initial jobless claims rose more than expected last week.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Nov. 4, above forecasts of a 2,000 increase to 232,000.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2017 12:18PM ET</span>",Dollar on back foot ahead of Senate tax-cut bill,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to its lowest against the yen this month on Thursday, and remained weak against a basket of major currencies, ahead of the expected release of a tax-cut bill by Senate Republicans.
The Senate tax-cut bill differs from one in the House of Representatives and could complicate a Republican tax overhaul push, increasing skepticism on Wall Street about the effort.
The dollar was 0.32 percent lower against the Japanese currency to 113.49 yen. It fell to a low of 113.86 yen, its lowest since Oct. 31, earlier in the session. 
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.22 percent at 94.656.
""There is something of a risk-off undertone that may prevail in the market until we get some clarification on the tax cut plan we are expecting to get from the Senate,"" said Shaun Osborne, currency strategist at Scotia Bank in Toronto.
Any potential delay in the implementation of tax cuts, or the possibility of proposed reforms being watered down, would tend to work against the dollar, analysts said.
Traders also pointed to a sudden fall in Japanese equities from multi-decade peaks on dampening risk sentiment in Asian trade, a mood that continued into London trading hours with European stocks also falling. 
The dollar index was little changed after data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, suggesting that claims processing disrupted by recent hurricanes has begun to improve.
""Essentially they are still at extremely positive levels,"" said Osborne.
""We know we have a very tight labor market in the U.S. but that’s not yet translating to significantly higher wages. That's still the caveat to the labor market story.""
Euro zone government bond yields jumped on Thursday, kicking recent sharp falls into reverse, and the euro climbed to a six-day high. The common currency was up 0.3 percent against the greenback.

Britain's sterling was little changed on the day as expectations for a gradual tightening of policy from the Bank of England protected the pound from the political turmoil engulfing Prime Minister Theresa May's government.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin hit a record high just shy of $8,000 on Wednesday after a coalition of developers and investors suspended a software upgrade planned for next Thursday that could have split the digital currency in two.
In an email on Wednesday, the lead developer of the team planning to carry out the upgrade said ""Segwit2x"" would be scrapped for now as it could ""divide the community."" The email by Mike Belshe, chief executive of blockchain security firm BitGo, was also signed by some of the biggest names in the bitcoin world.
SegWit2x is an agreement among high-profile figures in the bitcoin world aimed at upgrading the bitcoin network's capacity. It received significant support when it was announced in May but many bitcoin developers had withdrawn support for the upgrade over the last few months, analysts said.
The software upgrade would have attempted to address the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. The network has not kept pace with growth and is unable to process transactions fast enough.
The upgrade would have changed bitcoin's rules leading to a so-called fork, effectively cloning the existing bitcoin to create another crypto-currency. 
Segwit2x was supposed to be the second step in a broad two-step process to enhance transaction capacity. The first step occurred over the summer. 
""Indefinitely postponing the fork is a healthy move for crypto assets,"" said Guy Zyskind, CEO and co-founder of Enigma, a data-driven, crypto-investment platform.
""The ability of the bitcoin community to self-correct and avoid a contentious fork inspires confidence and shows how the ecosystem is entering a more mature phase,"" he added.
Bitcoin surged to a record high of $7,888 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange in the 20 minutes that followed the statement. It was last traded up 3 percent on the day at $7,354.10 (BTC=BTSP).
""Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for bitcoin,"" BitGo's Belshe said in his email. ""Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together.""

Charlie Lee, creator of the Litecoin crypto-currency and a leading industry expert, said in a post on Twitter the bitcoin community may need to implement Segwit2x in the future anyway, but it should be done when there is consensus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar sagged on Tuesday, knocked away from an eight-month highs versus the yen down as Treasury yields slipped on uncertainty over whether the Republicans can pass their tax bill in a timely manner.
The dollar was little changed at 113.780 yen , having pulled back from 114.735 struck the previous day, its highest since mid-March.
The euro was steady at $1.1612  following its descent to a 10-day trough of $1.1580 overnight.
The greenback had been on the front foot after strong U.S. services and factory data issued just before the weekend backed expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month and tighten further in 2018.
But the currency sagged as such expectations failed to lift Treasury yields, which has seen the benchmark 10-year yield (US10YT=RR) slip steadily toward 2.30 percent after peaking at a seven-month high of 2.47 percent in late October.
""The dollar is lacking support from Treasury yields which have been declining on uncertainty over the U.S. tax bill and expectations that any rise in inflation would be slow,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""For the dollar to sustain its gains it will need the speedy passage of the tax bill before Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 23) to put a floor under Treasury yields.""
Doubts over whether U.S. Republicans could pass their tax plan has helped bring down long-term Treasury yields as the uncertainty dims hopes for faster economic growth, and there are worries about the scale of borrowing needed to finance it.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 94.726 (DXY), slipping slightly from a 10-day peak of 95.077 reached on Monday.
The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.7688  after gaining about 0.5 percent the previous day against the broadly weaker dollar.
Immediate focus was on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy decision at 0330 GMT.
Of the 48 economists polled by Reuters, 47 expect the central bank to stand pat and keep its cash rate at a record low of 1.5 percent.
The RBA eased twice last year but has since held steady as it balances the risk of fuelling further borrowing in the country's red-hot property market against tepid inflation.

The New Zealand dollar was nearly flat at $0.6941  after gaining nearly 0.6 percent overnight to pull further away from a five-month low of $0.6818 reached at the end of October on political uncertainty.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held steady versus a basket of currencies on Friday, as investors shifted their focus to U.S. jobs data, with President Donald Trump's nomination of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be the next Fed chair coming as no surprise. 
Trump on Thursday tapped Powell to lead the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying incumbent Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. 
Trump's decision was in line with what market participants had been expecting, and the dollar showed limited reaction after the news. 
The dollar index last stood at 94.684 (DXY), having pulled up from a one-week low of 94.411 set on Thursday. 
The greenback had slipped on Thursday after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives released proposals to overhaul the tax code.
Republicans called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on companies' foreign profits and on individuals and families.
Congressional passage of the legislation, however, was far from certain.
While the contents of the tax reforms seem positive for the dollar, there is still uncertainty over how quickly it can be implemented, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore. 
""This could be quite a drawn out process,"" Innes said.
Later on Friday, the dollar could take its cues from U.S. economic data, including jobs data for October and the Institute for Supply Management's gauge of services sector activity. 
U.S. job growth likely rebounded sharply in October after hurricane-related disruptions depressed employment in September. A strong jump could seal the case for the Fed to raise interest rates in December even as wage growth probably slowed. 
Against the yen, the dollar eased 0.1 percent to 114.00 yen , trading below a 3-1/2 month high of 114.45 yen that had been set last Friday. Trading volumes were thinner than usual with Japanese markets closed for a public holiday. 
While the generally positive risk sentiment is likely to support the dollar against the yen, dollar-selling interest among Japanese exporters could temper any gains in the greenback, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
The euro held steady at $1.1659 .
Sterling nursed its losses after suffering its biggest one-day fall against the dollar since June on Thursday, after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade but said it sees only gradual rises ahead.
Sterling inched up 0.1 percent to $1.3070 , after having tumbled 1.4 percent on Thursday. The BoE voted 7-2 to increase its benchmark Bank Rate to0.50 percent from 0.25 percent.

The Australian dollar slipped 0.4 percent to $0.7687 , coming under pressure after data showed that retail sales were flat in September. That was below market expectations for a rise of 0.4 percent on the month.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2017 06:27PM ET</span>",Powell-led Fed could be U.S. dollar-positive in long term,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell, who has voted to support Fed Chair Janet Yellen's low interest rate policies, may not be as negative for the U.S. dollar in the long term as originally thought, investors and analysts said on Thursday.
Earlier on Thursday President Donald Trump tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. 
Financial markets have typically viewed Powell as bearish for the dollar because he has supported gradual interest rate rises, rather than more aggressive moves. The dollar has consequently sold off on reports that he will be the next chair. However, some believe that Powell would be a net positive for the greenback.
""The dollar is more likely to turn up under Powell because the economic trajectory in the U.S. is going up,"" said Richard Benson, managing director and co-head of portfolio investments at Millennium Global in London.
Some candidates that had been floated as potential chairs had more hawkish views on monetary policy, indicating a more aggressive pace of interest rate increases which could have benefited the dollar more. 
Still, Powell's nomination by President Donald Trump ensures continuity in the Fed's monetary policy. That should mean the Fed is on track to raise interest rates multiple times and that the unwinding of the balance sheet remains on track. 
Higher interest rates boost the yield of dollar assets, making them more attractive to investors. In the same vein, shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, by not re-investing the proceeds of its earlier bond purchases as they mature, is also good for the dollar because it means lower bond purchases by the U.S. central bank. 
Analysts say this will be a bright spot for a dollar that has struggled for most of the year as the Trump administration stumbled early on with respect to its promise of significant tax reform and fiscal stimulus. 
The dollar is down 7.3 percent against a basket of currencies so far this year, but over the last two months, it has gained 1.7 percent, helped by better economic data and recent progress on the Republican party U.S. tax reform plan which should strengthen the dollar's outlook.
On top of that, the European Central Bank has backtracked on its own stimulus by extending its own asset-buying program, which has stalled the euro and elevated the dollar.
Some investors view Powell as slightly more hawkish on monetary policy than Yellen and that could support the dollar more than Yellen's policies. 
""The fact that Powell voted with Yellen doesn't mean he's going to be as dovish as Yellen,"" said Jason Lejonvarn, global investment strategist at Mellon Capital in London.
In fact, Powell's previous comments suggested he was not in favor of further accommodation for the U.S. economy, Lejonvarn said. 
In September, Powell voted to start winding down the Fed's balance sheet. In February, he said a new round of asset purchases should be an option ""only in extraordinary circumstances.""
Investors say as long as the Fed stays the course on monetary policy, the dollar should continue to do well.
""At the end of the day, whoever is the Fed chair, the U.S. economy is going to do well and so is the dollar,"" said Millennium Global's Benson.

764,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 02, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Next Fed Chief Can All But Ignore Emerging-Market Currencies,"(Bloomberg) -- Of all the global challenges that may confront the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, here’s one major asset class where he can rest easy: emerging-market currencies.
History shows that developing-nation rates have been less volatile when the Fed is raising rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. During nine U.S. central bank policy cycles since 2000, turbulence was at its lowest during three periods of rising rates and at its highest when they were being slashed, according to the JP Morgan Emerging Market Volatility Index.
That’s good news for Fed Governor Jerome Powell, whom President Donald Trump said today he would nominate to lead the Fed. In an Oct. 12 speech, Powell said that the biggest concern now is that any policy decisions it makes could cause volatility in emerging markets.
“Market tantrums pose complex economic and financial challenges, and such episodes carry a significant risk of snowballing into something bigger that more substantially threatens the economic expansion,” he said, citing the so-called taper tantrum of 2013.
During periods identified as hiking cycles, average volatility was 9.5 percent. That’s a full two points lower than the average during dovish periods and a point lower than when the federal funds rate is idling.
This makes sense. Higher interest rates in the developed world will bring back capital that fled to emerging markets in search of yield, but rate hikes don’t happen in isolation. They happen, in Powell’s words, in the “context of a solid U.S. economic recovery, which should benefit all economies around the world.”
It’s no coincidence, then, that the highest volatility periods in developing-nation currencies occurred around major market routs in the U.S.
So far, theJPMorgan Volatility Index is down 28.5 percent this year. Powell did note that low levels of volatility could exacerbate the probability and harshness of any adjustment. But if history is our guide, volatility in emerging-market currencies is likely to remain subdued.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index rose 0.2 percent at 3:21 p.m. in New York, extending a four-day rally.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2017 11:41PM ET</span>",People's Bank of China seen supporting yuan around Trump visit,"By Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is leaving nothing to chance during next week's visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, and will likely fortify the value of the yuan - a regular target of attack during last year's campaign for the White House.
Trump promised while campaigning that if elected he would name China a ""currency manipulator"" for artificially depressing the value of the yuan to make its exports more competitive.Since he took office, though, the Treasury Department has twice declined to do so because China has not met the necessary criteria.
Beijing has allowed the yuan  to rise more than 5 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year, after it plunged around 6.5 percent in 2016, thanks to tighter management of capital outflows and broad weakness in the greenback.
Still, currency strategists and traders say that in the days around Trump's Nov. 8-10 Beijing visit they expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which controls the exchange rate, to prop up the yuan.
Some believe the currency will be made slightly stronger while others said they think it may move in either direction, but with the downside limited.
Gao Qi, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore, said the yuan is likely to see ""a strengthening bias"" against the dollar in the run up to Trump's trip.
""It will be a friendly sentiment,"" Gao said.
China has not been cited as a ""currency manipulator"" since 1994, but the Chinese government is unwilling to leave anything to chance around major political events.
Beijing is ""apt to appease Trump ... with currency appreciation to avoid being criticized for engaging in competitive devaluation for the purposes of boosting exports,"" said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong.
The yuan has been a persistent point of contention in U.S.-China relations.
From 2005, the year Beijing revalued the yuan and eliminated its peg to the dollar, China has hosted five state visits by U.S. presidents. During these periods, the yuan was kept basically flat against the dollar.
The PBOC limits daily the movement of the yuan to within 2 percent above or below a reference rate it sets each morning. It says it has taken steps in recent months to make the reference rate more market-driven, but it retains ultimate control over the value of that rate – and by extension the currency.
A closely related issue - the China-U.S. trade imbalance - is likely to figure prominently in discussions when Trump visits. The United States believes progress with China on a range of trade issues has become more difficult and Beijing appears on a ""trajectory of retrenchment"", according to a senior administration official.
""Keeping the Chinese currency stable would benefit the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China,"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. Cheung expects the yuan to rangebound between 6.5 and 6.7 per dollar.
Analysts expect downward pressure on the yuan to resume through the end of the year with the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates and financial markets in China looking less sure-footed.

If the authorities do act to shore up the yuan when Trump is in town, traders believe the central bank would be more likely to do so by tweaking the official reference rate  than by intervening in the spot yuan market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Wednesday, nearing a 3 1/2-month high against the yen, as investor optimism about the greenback rose ahead of major announcements on U.S. fiscal and monetary policy after strong economic data.
The Federal Reserve kept U.S. overnight interest rates unchanged and highlighted ""solid"" economic growth at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Analysts said the Fed's statement indicated that a rate hike next month is overwhelmingly likely.
Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy at BK Asset Management, said the statement was the Fed's latest clue to the market that it planned to begin a cycle of interest rate increases rather than just a ""one-and-done"" hike.
""As that begins to disseminate to the market, that’s going to be dollar positive,"" he said.
The Fed's decision followed strong data releases on the U.S. economy. The ADP National Employment survey showed private employers added 235,000 jobs in October, surpassing estimates for 200,000 and setting up expectations for a strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.
The ADP number was the latest in a string of strong data releases on the U.S. economy that have backed the Federal Reserve's stance that weakness in reports earlier this year was transitory.
""There’s a lot of positivity in the air,"" said Juan Perez, a currency strategist at foreign exchange company Tempus Inc in Washington. 
Perez pointed to recent positive readings on U.S. gross domestic product, consumer confidence, housing prices and inflation data. Additionally, no other central bank is seen as likely to raise rates in the near term, except for the Bank of England, an expectation which has already been priced into the market.
The market also is focused on President Donald Trump's tax reform plans, which are expected to be revealed soon, and his pick for Fed chair, slated for Thursday.

The greenback rose 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc , nearing its highest since mid-May.

795,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",Pound Bears Smell Opportunity in One-And-Done BOE Rate Hike,"(Bloomberg) -- Bears are closing in on the pound ahead of the Bank of England’s meeting this week.
While the central bank is widely expected to raise borrowing costs on Thursday, most economists say Governor Mark Carney won’t be in any hurry to raise interest rates subsequently. That means the pound is vulnerable to a drop of more than 1 percent from current levels, strategists say.
The currency could slide to $1.30, from about $1.32 on Tuesday, on indications of a ‘one and done’ interest-rate increase from the BOE, according to the median forecast of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey. In contrast, if the central bank indicates that a November move is the first step in a hiking cycle, either through its language or through the number voting for an increase on Thursday, the pound could rise about 1 percent to $1.33.
A shift in the BOE’s rhetoric in recent months has sent expectations surging for the first rate hike in a decade, with traders now pricing in an 88 percent chance of an increase. However, market positioning also signals a split in what that means for the currency, with asset managers short on the pound and hedge funds long, according to CFTC data as of Oct. 24.
“We do not expect the BOE to embrace a sustained pace of tightening,” said Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA’s head of Group-of-10 strategy Roberto Cobo Garcia. “As a result, any knee-jerk strengthening in the pound could turn out to be very much short-lived as uncertainties still loom too large to be dismissed by the pound yet.”
If the bank doesn’t hike at all, the market reaction would be dramatic. The pound could tumble more than 2 percent to $1.29, according to the median in the survey, while the yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds may also drop. It would take a hawkish hike to drive up yields, Scotiabank’s Alan Clarke said.
Here is a summary of some of the market moves analysts are predicting in each scenario:
Hawkish Hike
This scenario is based on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voting dramatically in favor of a hike, and a communication from Carney that this is the start of a tightening cycle:
Dovish Hike
This would come from a far closer vote among the MPC, and language in the minutes and press conference that emphasizes a gradual path higher for rates. It may even push back against the market’s current pricing of another hike by November next year:
No Hike:
BOE shocks the market by keeping rates on hold:

798,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 05:02AM ET</span>",Dollar slips versus yen as Russia probe turns investors cautious,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to an 11-day low against the yen on Tuesday, with investors turning cautious after news that investigators probing Russian interference in last year's U.S. elections had charged President Donald Trump's former campaign manager.
The greenback, which had strengthened to a 3 1/2-month high versus the Japanese currency on Friday, dipped briefly below 113 yen . 
Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar also slipped (DXY), having fallen from its highest in three months at the end of last week on talk that the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve could steer policy in a more hawkish direction and on hopes that Trump could push through tax reform. 
But the latest developments, which saw Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and another aide, Rick Gates, charged with money laundering on Monday, turned investor attention back to U.S. political risks.
Some analysts said speculation that Fed Governor Jerome Powell was likely to become the next Fed chair - rather than economist John Taylor, who is considered the most hawkish of the candidates - was also weighing.
But  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes, in London, said the key restraint on further strength in the U.S. currency was Treasury yields. 
""This is almost gravity reasserting itself,"" he said. ""Maybe I can take politics as the excuse, or Jerome Powell being favorite rather than John Taylor to run the Fed, but through all of it the underlying story is that bond yields are capped by a very low rate cycle and a lack of inflation."" 
The yen showed limited reaction after the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy steady on Tuesday, as widely expected, while slightly lowering its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year.
The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1644 , close to a three-month low of $1.1574 touched on Friday. Investors were eyeing euro zone inflation data due at 1000 GMT after a weaker-than-expected set of price growth data from Germany on Monday. 
""The downward surprise would have to be quite significant for euro exchange rates to budge at all,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists wrote in a note to clients. 
""The rate outlook is likely to only become relevant again for the euro once we see a significant upward inflation dynamic bringing rate hike expectations forward. As we however expect price pressures in the euro zone to ease further in the near term, the euro is likely to pretty much remain stuck.""
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was weighed down after China's official factory PMI showed manufacturing growth cooled more than expected in October.

The Aussie, which is sensitive to Chinese economic data because of Australia's strong trade ties to China, was down 0.2 percent on the day at $0.7675 .

810,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 08:36AM ET</span>",Dollar consolidates gains as economic outlook brightens,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Monday after posting its biggest weekly rise this year as investors took profits before data this week that will show whether the world's biggest economy is gaining momentum.
While financial markets do not expect U.S. policymakers to raise interest rates at a scheduled meeting this week, expectations are that one more rate hike before the end of the year is virtually a done deal after some recent strong data.
""The dollar is gaining some momentum and if we see more evidence of that from economic data this week, there will be more upside for the dollar, particularly against the euro,"" said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
Net short bets on the dollar fell to their smallest in nearly three months, about $8 billion, roughly half of what they were a month ago, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released last week.
The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, dipped 0.3 percent to 94.69 (DXY) but remained not far from Friday's three-month high of 95.150.
Friday’s release of third quarter GDP data showed the economy expanded by 3.0 percent, beating forecasts, and the first time since 2014 that the U.S. economy has experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two quarters in a row. 
U.S. jobs data and PMI data is due this week.
But despite the combination of strong data, expectations of more U.S. rate hikes and unwinding of excessive short bets against the greenback, some investors such as UBS are cautious about the dollar's outlook on concerns that a pickup in global growth would be a dollar negative story.
UBS reckons a pick up in global growth would mean investors will look for attractive investment opportunities in all major and emerging markets and show only a marginal interest in the slightly higher U.S. yields. 
Meanwhile, the euro  climbed 0.20 percent to $1.1630, erasing some of last week's losses following a drop in Spain's borrowing costs as nerves settled after a weekend poll showed Catalan secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December.
The euro, one of the best performing currencies this year, has been hit in recent weeks as a dovish European Central Bank combined with unrest in Catalonia has prompted some investors to take profits.
Elsewhere, the dollar was broadly flat against the yen to 113.66 , after a three-month high of 114.45 yen on Friday.
At its two-day meeting ending on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is set to keep intact a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield around zero percent.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's victory in a lower house election this month heightened expectations the BOJ's ultra-loose policy - a key pillar of his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies - will continue, as inflation remains well short of the central bank's target. Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent year-on-year in September.

812,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 05:30AM ET</span>",BOE Rate Increase May Not Be Enough to Revive Brexit-Vexed Pound,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England may increase interest rates this week for the first time in more than a decade, but that won’t be enough to buoy the pound, according to strategists.
Markets almost fully price in a 25-basis-point increase in the BOE’s key rate on Thursday, meaning investors are ill-prepared for a disappointment. Should Governor Mark Carney and fellow policy makers keep policy on hold, or deliver a one-time hike that merely reverses the emergency cut after the Brexit vote, sterling could add to the last two weeks’ declines, according to Ross Walker, an economist at NatWest Markets.
The U.K. currency has declined 1.8 percent against the dollar during October as concerns about the lack of progress in Brexit negotiations weighed on investor sentiment. It snapped a two-day decline on Monday, gaining 0.3 percent to $1.3161 as of 9:11 a.m. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds fell 1 basis point to 1.34 percent.
“Sterling needs a hawkish hike in order to rally,” said Walker. “The pound could come under pressure” otherwise, he said.
While money-market pricing suggests an 89 percent probability that the Monetary Police Committee will tighten on Thursday, banks including Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc expect a “one-and-done” move. Investors will look to the language of the MPC minutes, vote split and the quarterly Inflation Report to gauge the policy outlook further ahead.
“I’d prefer to go into the meeting” with a short position on sterling, said Steven Barrow, head of currency strategy in London at Standard Bank. “There is a reasonable enough chance they don’t raise rates. We’ll have to see what comes out from the statement the bank puts out.”

The upbeat growth comes amid reports suggesting that Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor are President Trump's favoured candidates to replace Fed chair Janet Yellen when her term ends in February, Politico reported Thursday, citing a source.
Trump is expected to announce his candidate before a trip to Asia in early November.

Benchmark U.S. 10-Year yeilds fell four basis points to 2.42 percent, and the Bloomberg dollar index pared gains. Yields touched the highest since March on Friday as speculation percolated that Trump might still choose economist John Taylor, who’s seen as more hawkish than current Chair Janet Yellen.
Powell, however, is seen as likely to maintain Yellen’s gradual approach to lifting rates and unwinding the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Policy makers’ latest projections point to a hike in December and three more by the end of 2018.
“It’s almost more about John Taylor than it is about Powell, reversing some of the likelihood that Taylor would be taking the reins,” said Michael Lorizio, a senior trader at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $370 billion. “Powell, while he may differ from Yellen a bit in terms of regulation, in terms of the forward guidance, they would be taking a similar path.”

825,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2017 11:17PM ET</span>",Dollar buoyant after ECB sends euro to three-month lows,"By Lisa Twaronite and Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall on Friday, on track for weekly gains, while the euro slumped to three-month lows after the European Central Bank extended its bond purchases and reduced the chances that it would hike interest rates in 2018.
The ECB prolonged its bond buying program by nine months to September 2018, and left the door open to keep buying after that. It said it would begin paring its monthly purchases by half to 30 billion euros ($34.90 billion) starting in January.
ECB chief Mario Draghi said ""an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary"", as inflation has yet to show signs of a sustained upward trend.
The euro was down 0.15 percent at $1.1633  after touching $1.1624, its lowest level since July 26. It was down 1.3 percent for the week.
The common currency slumped against the greenback as the ECB's cautious approach highlighted the difference between the Federal Reserve, which is poised to raise rates in December as it continues to normalize monetary policy.
""The ECB's decision appears like a limited deal, in which it restricted itself to curbing the amount of its bond purchases,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""This is in sharp contrast to the Fed, which is moving steadily as scheduled toward the normalization of policy. The euro looks headed for further losses under such conditions."" 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, added 0.2 percent to 94.800 (DXY), trading at three-month highs and on track for a weekly gain of 1.1 percent.
""The concept of tapering would be removal of accommodation, so it wasn't exactly what the market was expecting - it was a dovish form of tapering, as there was both an extension and a reduction,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana.
The ECB's extension pushes ""any potential rate hike to 2019"", he said.
Also underpinning the dollar, the U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to clear a procedural path for a Republican tax bill.
""We did see some additional progress toward tax cuts,"" Northey said. ""As we move into 2018, the likelihood that something will pass increases.""
Investor attention remains on candidates to head the U.S. Federal Reserve when current chief Janet Yellen's term expires in February.
Trump's search for the next central bank chair has come down to Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor, Politico on Thursday cited one source as saying, while another counseled caution. But a White House official told Reuters that no final decision has been made.
Trump is expected to announce his candidate before his upcoming trip to Asia in early November.
The dollar gained 0.15 percent to 114.155 yen , within sight of this week's three-month high of 114.245 touched on Wednesday. It was up 0.5 percent for the week.
The greenback's rise against the yen was limited as the Japanese currency rallied against the euro.
The euro fetched 132.840 yen (EURJPY=) after going as low at 132.590, its weakest in eight days. The common currency dropped 1.2 percent against the yen overnight.
The yen showed little reaction to Friday's data revealing Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in September from a year earlier to mark a ninth straight rising month.
Sterling slipped 0.3 percent to $1.3124 ,with investors focused on whether the Bank of England will proceed with its first interest rate increase in more than a decade after its next meeting on Nov. 2.

Overnight, the dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Thursday benefitting from a slump in the euro after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi indicated that the central bank’s bond-purchasing program could be extended beyond September 2018.
The European Central Bank announced its intention to rein in monetary stimulus, reducing its monthly purchases of bonds to €30 billion while extending its bond purchasing programme for a period of nine months through September 2018.
The reduction in the amount of bond purchases was widely expected but investors were surprised by somewhat dovish comments from ECB president Mario Draghi.
Draghi insisted that the central bank’s bond buying programme is “open ended”, dashing investor expectations that the onset of quantitative tightening would inch the central bank closer to consider an end date for its massive bond-buying programme.
“The decision today is for an open-ended program ... it’s not going to stop suddenly. The large majority of the Governing Council expresses a preference for keeping it open-ended,” Draghi said at press conference. The plunge in the euro helped the dollar surge to a more-than-three-month high amid the release of mixed economic data.
The pound has also drifted weaker as the British government said on Thursday its key piece of Brexit legislation would be debated in parliament on Nov. 14 and 15, the next stage in what is expected to be a tortuous lawmaking process that will test Prime Minister Theresa May's authority.

829,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2017 01:30PM ET</span>",Beware Quick Drop in Local-Currency Emerging-Market Debt: Gadfly,"(Bloomberg Gadfly) -- One of this year’s biggest debt-market winners is facing a big test.
Local-currency debt of developing nations has hit a rough spot after gaining nearly 12 percent during the first nine months of the year. It has fallen nearly 3 percent since Sept. 8 even as other riskier assets such as U.S. high-yield bonds and stocks gained value.
The most obvious reason is that the U.S. dollar has strengthened a bit since then, with emerging-market currencies falling nearly 2 percent.
The  Mexican peso and Turkish lira, for example, have fallen by more than 8 percent in the period. This is a marked shift from earlier in the year, when emerging-market currencies collectively gained nearly 10 percent against the dollar.
These recent losses are relatively small in the scheme of things. But they present an important reality check to credit buyers, who have piled eagerly into these securities throughout the year, often through broad index funds.
They've been alluring for their higher yields and currency-related gains. They are often viewed as largely a credit investment. But these securities are ultimately a leveraged dollar bet with some credit risk thrown in.
So the question is, just how much value does this debt have to lose before tourist investors stampede out the door? So far, the losses haven't been that big, and the biggest exchange-traded fund that invests in these bonds has continued to receive inflows.
At a certain point, however, if the dollar keeps strengthening, these bonds are going to lose enough value to push away some foreign investors, especially those who plowed in through index funds simply to generate higher returns. 
Asset managers have argued that developing economies are stronger and more independent from the whims of U.S. markets than ever before. This could very well be true.
But that won't prevent a painful, dollar-driven selloff in local-currency emerging-market debt. If investors respond to losses by yanking cash from broad index funds, this could get ugly.

The country’s Public Investment Fund will invest in Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Co. and Virgin Orbit and holds an option to invest an additional $480 million in space services, according to a statement on Thursday. Saudi Arabia plans to support the ventures’ plans for human spaceflight and launching satellites into orbit and may cooperate with Virgin to create a “space-centric entertainment industry” in the country.
“We are delighted to welcome the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as our new partners,” Richard Branson, Virgin Group’s founder, said in the statement. “This investment will enable us to develop the next generation of satellite launches and accelerate our program for point-to-point supersonic space travel,” he said, adding that Virgin Galactic is “months away” from taking people into space.
Saudi Arabia will acquire a “significant stake” in the ventures, alongside Virgin Group and Abu Dhabi’s Aabar Investments, the fund said, without providing details. The investment is subject to regulatory approval. 
The PIF has previously invested in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc., Dubai-based business-tycoon Mohamed Alabbar’s e-commerce firm Noon and Saudi Telecom Co. The sovereign-wealth fund will borrow to boost returns from its investments as it seeks to diversify the kingdom’s oil-dependent economy, Managing Director Yasir Al-Rumayyan said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
“This partnership with Virgin Group reflects the great strides the kingdom is making towards our vision for a diversified, knowledge-based economy,” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Al Saud said in the statement. “We will make active contributions to those sectors and technologies that are driving progress on a global scale.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro held near a one-week high on Thursday before a European Central Bank meeting where policymakers are expected to outline a scaling back of bond-purchase, with analysts expecting a pause in the euro's rally in the absence of any hawkish surprises.
With the ECB likely to announce that it will start trimming its asset purchases to half from its current 60 billion euros from January, markets will look for any tweak in language or forward guidance to push the euro higher.
""In the current environment, it will take a surprising shift in policy stance to push the euro higher from these levels even though we remain constructive of the currency's outlook in 2018,"" said Christin Tuxen, an FX strategist at Danske Bank.
The euro climbed 0.1 percent against the dollar on Thursday  to $1.1825, holding near its highest levels since last Friday.
Long euro/dollar has been among the best performing currency trades this year with the pair up nearly 13 percent so far this year though the single currency has come under some pressure in recent weeks on concerns interest rates in the ECB will remain at record lows far longer than the U.S.
Latest CFTC positioning data shows that net euro longs have retreated from their record highs though still remain near multi-year highs at above $13 billion. 
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategists say the distribution of various ECB decision scenarios point to euro downside as its positioning indicator suggests that market positioning remains quite stretched in favor of euros.
""The ECB meeting could thus represent a Q4 high water mark for the euro,"" they said in a daily note.
The dollar took a breather after having rallied over the past week on optimism over the prospects for U.S. tax reforms, as well as speculation that the next chair of the Federal Reserve could steer policy in a more hawkish direction.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.1 percent to 93.612 (DXY), edging away from a two-week high of 94.017 set on Monday.
The dollar has been bolstered recently by optimism about the prospects for a tax-cut plan, and as investors pondered the possibility that Stanford University economist John Taylor could become the next Fed chief.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce his Fed chair candidate before his Asian trip in early November.
Against the yen, the dollar was broadly flat at 113.67 yen .

Also supporting sentiment on the dollar was growing expectations that a less dovish Fed chair would be appointed amid several reports suggesting that Stanford University economist John Taylor impressed U.S. President Donald Trump in his interview to lead the Fed.
Taylor favors a rule-based approach to monetary policy, which given the current level of both inflation and economic growth implies that rates should be higher than they are now.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 04:58PM ET</span>","Dollar stalls despite upbeat U.S. data, Fed chair talk","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Wednesday against a basket of currencies, struggling to post further gains tied to speculation the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve will steer policy in a more hawkish direction.
A pullback in U.S. bond yields, with two-year Treasury yields (US2YT=RR) retreating from a near nine-year peak, also stoked some selling in the dollar.
""There's nothing concrete so that encouraged some profit-taking,"" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset management in New York said of President Donald Trump's nominee for Fed chief.
Profit-taking on the greenback occurred even in the wake of surprisingly strong data on durable goods orders and new home sales in September, analysts said.
New orders for U.S. capital goods rose more than forecast by 2.2 percent last month, while new home sales unexpectedly jumped to a near 10-year high in September. 
Among other major currencies, sterling climbed almost 1 percent to an eight-day high of $1.3271  after stronger-than-expected U.K. growth data cemented expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week.
The Canadian dollar tumbled to C$1.2816 to the greenback , its weakest since July 12, after the Bank of Canada as expected left key overnight rates unchanged.
Despite Wednesday's pullback, the dollar index has gained 0.6 percent in the past week on hopes for a tax-cut plan and in the aftermath of reports that Stanford University economist John Taylor impressed Trump in his interview for the Fed's top post.
Taylor favors a rule-based approach to setting interest rates and is seen as someone who may put the Fed on a path of faster rate hikes compared with Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.
Trump's other possible nominees to head the Fed include Yellen, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, his economic adviser Gary Cohn and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
On Wednesday, a senior administration official said Trump was not likely to pick Cohn due to his key role on tax reform, while Trump told Fox Business Network that he thinks Yellen is ""terrific"" but suggested he would like make his ""own mark"" for a Fed chair.
Trump is expected to announce his Fed chair candidate before his Asian trip in early November.
The index tracking the greenback versus six currencies (DXY) was down 0.1 percent at 93.696, holding below a 2-1/2 week high of 94.017 set on Monday.
The dollar climbed to 114.245 yen, its highest since July 11 , following Sunday's victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose ultra-loose monetary policy should keep pressure on the yen. It was down 0.2 percent at 113.70 yen in late trading. 
The euro gained 0.4 percent at $1.181  before Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting, prompted by expectations it would announce the start of trimming its monthly asset purchases to 40 billion euros from 60 billion euros in January.

Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ) didn’t identify the new customer beyond calling it a “Tier 1 bank,” according to a statement Wednesday. The bank will use Nasdaq’s matching technology, the software that pairs up buyers and sellers.
More than 100 clients use that Nasdaq technology, including exchanges in Hong Kong, Japan, Turkey and Colombia. This is the first time a bank is using it for foreign exchange, but it’s not Nasdaq’s only technology deal with a bank. When  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). recently revamped its dark pool, dubbed Sigma X-Squared, it turned to Nasdaq.
“One thing we always say about our market technology is we can trade and clear and now settle any asset class on the planet,” Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said during a phone interview Wednesday.
Old school banks are seeking help to keep up with fast-paced modern markets. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). struck a deal last year with high-speed trader Virtu Financial Inc. for Treasuries trading technology.

Nasdaq’s market technology division brought in 13 percent of the company’s total third-quarter net revenue. It’s still dwarfed by its business of running markets in equity and fixed income and clearing trades, which hauled in 36 percent of net revenue.
Nasdaq also reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.06 a share on Wednesday, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.02 a share. Net revenue was up 4 percent from the same period a year earlier. Shares of the company fell 1.1 percent at 11:12 a.m. in New York.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar edged down on Tuesday, stepping back from recent highs as market attention turns to who will be the next head of the U.S. central bank.
President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday he is ""very, very close"" to deciding who should chair the Federal Reserve after interviewing five candidates for the position.
These include current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, as well as Fed Governor Jerome Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor, Trump's chief economic advisor Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
""It's a big question for the markets. It's one thing to speculate about it, but it's another to take an FX position,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo.
""Still, the rumors trigger some selling and buying, on perceptions of who might be more dovish or more hawkish,"" he said.
Investors are also following U.S. tax reform developments. The Senate's approval of a budget resolution on Friday raised hopes that Trump's tax plans would move forward this year.

The policies were seen as unfriendly to foreign investment and immigration, and could weigh on the currency given the country runs a current account deficit.

863,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2017 03:58AM ET</span>",Dollar hits three-month high vs. yen on Abe election victory,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar touched a three-month high against the yen on Monday, with investors betting that an emphatic election victory for Japan's ruling party would see a continuation of the ultra-loose ""Abenomics"" policy that have kept downward pressure on the yen. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling bloc scored a big win in Sunday's election, with his Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition winning a combined 312 seats, keeping its two-thirds ""super majority"" in the lower house, according to media reports.
Abe's victory eased fears that the economic steps implemented under his leadership, including an expansive asset-purchase program by the Bank of Japan, would be disrupted and would halt the yen's depreciation against the dollar.
The dollar gained as much as half a percent to reach 114.10 yen after the results, its strongest since July 11. It came off those highs in early dealing in London but was still up 0.3 percent on the day. 
""The relatively muted rise in dollar/yen following Abe's election win is consistent with the fact that this was very much the most expected result,"" said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown. 
""The outcome should be consistent with the market continuing to price static and dovish policy from the BOJ, even in the context of (BOJ Governor Haruhiko) Kuroda's term coming to an end in April of next year.""
Some analysts said Abe's emphatic win increased the chances that Kuroda, who is widely considered a policy dove, would be reappointed when his term ends. 
""Overcoming deflation with the BOJ easing is at the crux of the Abe administration's policies and this will now be allowed to continue indefinitely,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
""It's relief over the BOJ policies, rather than hopes for fresh fiscal stimulus, that is weakening the yen.""
The greenback had already gained about 0.9 percent against the Japanese currency on Friday, after the U.S. Senate approved a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, clearing a critical hurdle for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support.
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar touched a 2-1/2-week high, having recorded its best day in a month on Friday. 
Another focal point for the dollar was who U.S. President Donald Trump would appoint as the next Federal Reserve chief.
The euro was 0.3 percent lower at $1.1754, extending losses from Friday when it lost 0.6 percent.
The common currency has drifted lower from a 2-1/2-year peak of $1.2092 scaled on Sept. 8, as hopes for the European Central Bank to take a more hawkish stance have been tempered by speculation that it is not be in a hurry to taper its easy policy.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday, on track for its biggest daily gain in more than two weeks, as progress on U.S. tax reforms raised prospects of a fiscal lift to the economy, though a lack of broad inflationary pressures checked gains.
Enhanced risk appetite helped boost European stock markets and the euro hit a 2-1/2-year high against the Swiss franc  in Asian trade. [MKTS/GLOB]
""Today's story has been all about the boost to the dollar from increased expectations of significant tax reforms and that is prompting investors to be cautious on the euro/dollar exchange rate before the ECB meeting next week,"" said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm. 
The dollar climbed 0.3 percent to 93.58 (DXY) against a basket of currencies, its biggest daily rise since Oct. 5.
Senate approval on Thursday of a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year revived expectations that tax cuts are on the way, though analysts cautioned against reading too much into the headlines.
The dollar has been supported this week and U.S. Treasury yields have risen -- with 10-year maturities hitting a 1-1/2 week high of 2.37 percent -- as investors bet a fiscal boost may push up inflation. 
While 30-day correlations between the dollar index and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are trading on the upper end of ranges, 90-day correlations are still at a low 0.2 percent.
Investors expect a fiscal boost to push up inflation, adding pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, known as the ""Trumpflation"" trade.
""We have the Trumpflation trade story coming back overnight but we would be wary of buying the dollar solely on this move until we get more clarity, though we expect some general dollar strength going into the final quarter,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Price pressures remain subdued in the United States despite tight labor markets with core PCE inflation, one of the U.S. Federal Reserve's favorite measures, at a one-year low of 1.3 percent in August.
Analysts do not expect a rebound in price pressures, with CLSA strategists saying inflation has probably peaked in this cycle.
The dollar rose 0.8 percent on the day to of 113.30 yen .
Ahead of national elections in Japan on Sunday, surveys suggest Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds ""super majority"" it held in parliament's lower house before the snap vote was called.
The New Zealand dollar sank to a five-month low on concerns the new Labour coalition will take a harder stance on immigration and foreign investment than the outgoing center-right government.
The dollar's rebound dragged the euro  down half a percent to $1.1791 before a European Central Bank meeting next week where policymakers are seen cutting bond purchases but vote for an extension in stimulus.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2017 12:56AM ET</span>","NZ Prime Minister-elect Ardern focuses on final touches in coalition deal, NZ dollar sinks","By Charlotte Greenfield and Ana Nicolaci da Costa
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said she would spend Friday ironing out issues and ministerial posts with coalition partner New Zealand First, a day after becoming the Pacific nation's youngest leader in recent times.
The previous night's highly anticipated announcement by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters that he would support 37-year-old Ardern's Labour Party had ended a decade of center-right National rule and spelt big changes for the country's economy.
The New Zealand dollar - the world's 11th-most traded currency - fell to five-month lows as investors grappled with heightened uncertainty and a more protectionist agenda. 
""When you are a hands off government, when you simply allow markets to decide the fate of your people, then that does not serve a country or it's people well,"" Ardern told reporters in Wellington.
""You will see a proactive government by Labour.""
Labour has released the names of the people who would be in the cabinet, saying it would announce their portfolios next week.
The include Grant Robertson, Labour's spokesman for finance, and David Parker, spokesman for trade. 
Ardern said on Thursday she had offered the role of deputy prime minister to Peters, who on Thursday gave his backing to Labour after inconclusive Sept.23 elections, and he was considering it.
On Thursday evening, Labour said it would also stick to its promises to change the central bank's mandate and seek to renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deals. 
PROTECTIONISM
Concerns about a more protectionist agenda weighed on the currency and stock markets on Friday. 
The New Zealand dollar fell to five month-lows of $0.6971 against the U.S. dollar, after posting its biggest daily fall in more than a year on Thursday. 
""The sentiment has now shifted toward more protectionist measures,"" said Christina Leung, economist at New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.
""Generally, financial markets don't like change, there is uncertainty over what this all means ... in the meantime that is reducing demand for New Zealand assets, and that's why we are seeing the decline in the New Zealand dollar.""
The stock market was down 1.1 percent at the Friday open, but later recouped losses to stand in positive territory.
Ardern told radio earlier that most of the party's flagship policies, including a ban on some foreign ownership of housing, had survived the negotiations with Peters in recent weeks.
""With New Zealand First we've got a few more details to iron out,"" Ardern said. ""Our plan remains, with a few minor changes ... we're finalizing in the next 24 hours the detail."" 
The election thrust the country into political limbo for almost a month with neither major party winning enough seats to form a majority and giving New Zealand First the balance of power. 
New Zealand First and Labour also needed support from the progressive Green Party, which said it would strike a ""confidence and supply"" agreement, meaning it was officially outside government but would hold ministerial posts and vote on key pieces of legislation like the budget.

Ardern said the parties would release their agreements early next week and an announcement on ministerial posts would come later in the week.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar hit its highest in about two weeks against the yen on Thursday, supported by this week's rise in U.S. bond yields, with the market's attention turning to who will next lead the Federal Reserve and this weekend's Japanese election. 
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly higher on the day at 93.389 (DXY).
The dollar rose as high as 113.095 yen  in early Asian trade, its strongest level since Oct. 6. The dollar last changed hands at 112.97 yen, steady from late U.S. trade on Wednesday.
This week's rise in U.S. bond yields helped lend support to the greenback. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield (US2YT=RR) rose to its highest since November 2008 on Wednesday on the back of expectations for tighter global monetary policy. 
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) touched a one-week high of 2.352 percent on Wednesday, and last stood at 2.342 percent, having risen six basis points so far this week.
""In order for expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy to increase, we will need to see more evidence to confirm that U.S. inflation is rising,"" said Kumiko Ishikawa, FX analyst at Sony Financial Holdings in Tokyo.
The dollar's rise against the yen was likely to be capped by uncertainty ahead of this weekend's election in Japan. 
Most polls show Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's coalition on track to secure a roughly two-thirds majority in Sunday's general election, ushering in continued political and monetary stability.
""To be sure, the chances of an election surprise in Japan are indeed very small. But investors remember last year's Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election, so there is greater uneasiness around elections now,"" Ishikawa said.
With the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year in December, markets are now looking for clarity on who will lead the U.S. central bank after Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term expires next February.
President Donald Trump will announce his decision on who will be the chair of the Federal Reserve in the ""coming days,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday.
Trump has an interview scheduled on Thursday with current Chair Yellen. She is one of five candidates Trump is considering for the job.
The dollar has gained a boost this week after Stanford University economist John Taylor emerged as a major candidate for the next Fed chair.
""If it turns out to be Taylor, that is likely to trigger selling of (U.S.) bonds, at least initially,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
The dollar could edge higher against the yen under that scenario, Okagawa added. 
Taylor is known as a proponent of a rule-based monetary policy and according to his formula, known as the Taylor rule, the Fed funds rate needs to be much higher than the current target of 1.0-1.25 percent.
Thus there is speculation that the Fed may start raising interest rates at a faster pace, if Taylor becomes the Fed chief.
The euro edged up percent to $1.1799 . 
One focus for the euro is the European Central Bank's policy meeting coming up nex0.1t week.
France's central bank governor called on Wednesday for a reduction in the ECB's bond purchases towards ""their possible end"" in light of stronger inflation, while saying monetary policy should stay easy.
Easy monetary policy gives euro zone governments a window of opportunity to enact the reforms needed to boost growth once interest rates have to rise, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Wednesday. 
The Australian dollar edged higher after Australian jobs data for September came in stronger than expected.
The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $0.7850 , pulling away from Wednesday's intraday low of $0.7819. 
Against the yen, the Australian dollar rose to 88.87 yen (AUDJPY=R) at one point, its highest level since late September.
Economic data from China was largely in line with expectations. The Australian currency is sensitive to China developments because of the two countries' massive trade relations.
China's economic growth slowed slightly as expected in the third quarter as the government's efforts to rein in the property market and debt risks tempered activity in the world's second-largest economy. 
In other data, China's industrial output rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in September from a year earlier, while retail sales also outperformed, though investment growth eased more than expected and property sales fell for the first time in more than two years.

""The overnight news of progress in negotiations over the new U.S. tax plan seems to be dollar-positive but we have to see some strong economic data before the dollar breaks higher,"" said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank.
U.S. Senate Republicans on Monday gained crucial support for a vote on a budget resolution that is vital to President Donald Trump's hopes of signing tax reform legislation into law before January.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists noted the reforms may come at a time when the U.S. has used up all its spare capacity.
Investors will also focus on U.S. Beige Book data later in the day, with some likely to be wary of buying dollars aggressively after disappointing U.S. inflation data. 
With the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year in December, markets are looking to who will replace Janet Yellen as chair when her term expires in February.
Trump has a pool of five candidates to choose from and is likely to announce his choice before going to Asia in early November, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.
The euro held in a tiny range and was  flat against the dollar at $1.1757.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a one-week high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday on speculation that U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning towards nominating a Federal Reserve head who would be more inclined to raise interest rates at a faster pace. 
The greenback was also supported by U.S. two-year Treasury yields (US2YT=RR) hitting nine-year highs on Tuesday. Yields climbed as well on growing expectations that Trump favored Stanford economist John Taylor to head the U.S. central bank. 
""Taylor is perceived as more hawkish than Ms.(Janet) Yellen so under his potential tutelage, the central bank might lift borrowing rates more aggressively, which would bolster the dollar's allure,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior marker analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major peers, hit a one-week high of 93.729 (DXY). 
The index was last up 0.2 percent at 93.488.
Interest rates futures implied traders saw a 93 percent chance the Fed would raise rates in December  , CME Group's FedWatch program showed. 
MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London, said the bank would ""not be surprised"" to see an initial jump in the dollar of between 3 percent and 5 percent should Taylor be chosen.
Bloomberg reported on Monday that Trump was impressed with Taylor after meeting with him last week. 
Trump's shortlist also includes Jerome Powell, a Fed governor; Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn; Yellen, whose term expires in February; and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, sources have said, though investors say the chances of Warsh being selected have fallen.
Trump is expected to announce his pick before going to Asia in early November.

The euro did not budge on German ZEW economic sentiment data that fell short of forecast by coming at 17.6 points, below an expected 20.1 points. 
Markets are wary of chasing the euro lower before a European Central Bank policy meeting next week.
Sterling  dropped below $1.32 for the first time since Thursday, after comments by Bank of England policymakers were interpreted by markets as broadly dovish.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - London-based currency manager Adrian Lee & Partners said on Tuesday the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation had awarded it a mandate to manage $2 billion of international foreign exchange exposure.
The Alaska Fund, which manages roughly $62 billion in assets, posted a return of 2.05 percent as of Aug. 31, outperforming a target return 1.04 percent for the same period, according to its website. 
Its long-term investment goal is to achieve an average real rate of return of 5 percent per year, the fund said. 
The U.S. fund, however, was not available to comment.
In an interview with Reuters, Adrian Lee said mandates like that of Alaska's do not happen overnight, noting that it usually takes 18 months to get the deal done.
""It is not dependent on the short-term appetite for the dollar,"" Lee said.
The contract from Alaska pushed Adrian Lee & Partners' assets to $12.7 billion. Lee said the firm's assets have grown 35 percent over the last year.
""There is an expectation that the dollar is expected to rally more cyclically because of all the things coming out of the administration,"" Lee said, citing possible tax reform under U.S. President Donald Trump.
A strong dollar tends to deflate U.S. portfolio returns with international exposure because holdings of foreign assets are worth less when converted into the U.S. unit. U.S. pensions in general invest in stocks and bonds, both locally and internationally. 
The international exposure has made them vulnerable to currency fluctuations, creating the need to hedge when the dollar is strong.  
""Certainly in 2014, people had huge losses (because of the strong dollar), they're trying to catch up and they don't want to be on the wrong side of that this time around,"" Lee said.

Rising food and housing costs were the biggest factors driving the cost of living up, the ONS said, partly due to utility bills.
The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, rose by 3.9% in September.

But the Bank of England has indicated that it expects to raise interest rates in the coming months so long as price pressures continue to increase and growth continues.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",Unhedged debt stock could supercharge euro rise,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone investors who have snapped up over a trillion euros worth of foreign debt without protecting the foreign exchange risk are rethinking that vulnerability because of the currency's hefty rally this year.
The move entails buying euros to hedge, which turbo charges the rally even further - creating a headwind for the European Central Bank.
The ECB is widely expected to start laying out its plans for scaling back monetary stimulus at next week's policy meeting, but a strong euro complicates this since it puts downward pressure on inflation which is already running below target.
One reason for the euro's resilience is some 1.16 trillion euros ($1.37 trillion) of foreign bonds that have been purchased by European investors since the ECB launched its quantitative easing programme in March 2015, according to estimates from investors based on official data.
They have been forced to buy non-euro debt because the ECB has been taking up much of the domestic pool of bonds.
The bulk of the non-euro purchases were bought on a currency-unhedged basis because euro weakness during the bulk of ECB asset purchases meant that returns from overseas investments would be higher when accounting for exchange rates.
While those investments flattered returns in the three consecutive years until last year when the euro posted annual losses against its major rivals, 2017 has prompted a sharp reversal in those bets. 
The currency has risen more than 13 percent against the dollar so far this year .

So investors have rushed to cover their currency exposure as the euro has gained, notably after the French elections in April and again in July.
Even with this, though, investors say a large chunk of foreign debt investments remain unhedged, indicating hedging-related purchases are likely to resurface if the euro renews its climb.
""If the euro starts to rise again, these investors are going to have to come back and start buying euros again and you could see euro/dollar topside continue,"" said Michael Sneyd, global head of currency strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London.
The euro traded at $1.1786 on Monday, not far off a 2-1/2 year high of $1.21 tested in early September.
BlackRock strategists recommend hedging currency risk fully for an international bond portfolio but market watchers estimate that only about 60-70 percent of these international debt investments by European investors are currently hedged. 
Sneyd estimates that every 1 percent rise in overall hedge ratios translates into roughly $10 billion buying of euros, a sizeable chunk for even the euro/dollar exchange rate which is the most liquid in the world and has an average daily trading volume of nearly $700 billion.

STABLE EURO
Opportunistic demand for euros from bond holders when there is any sign of currency weakness, explains the euro's recent resilience during the conflict between the Spanish region of Catalonia and the central government, as well as unexpected German election results.
The euro has remained stable against the dollar and has gained against some other rivals such as the British pound (EURGBP=) and the Australian dollar (EURAUD=) since the start of the month.
That stability has puzzled some investors given that the euro was hurt early this year when the popularity of the anti-euro far-right in France ahead of elections sparked fears about the future of the currency bloc.
""We have seen a raft of dollar positive news and euro negative news but the currency has remained in a tight range, indicating some purchasing activity by either bond holders, reserve managers or some large institutional players,"" said Borut Miklavcic, managing partner at Lindengrove Capital.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the euro  to trade around current levels in three months, indicating that markets still underprice the extent of which this unhedged stock of bonds could boost the currency. 
The euro is being watched closely by the ECB as it debates the future of its 2.3 trillion euro stimulus scheme.
A solid recovery provides a favorable backdrop for the ECB to roll back the scheme and which faces a scarcity of eligible bonds for the scheme. But a further rapid rise in the euro could delay that process.
""A high currency should lead to lower inflation pressures and in an area where inflation has been stable but relatively benign it has led some to believe that the ECB may potentially delay removing its stimulus,"" said Shaughn Wilkie, bond portfolio manager at Macquarie Investment Management. 
But it's not only the ECB that are likely to be concerned about a stronger euro give the vulnerability of unhedged positions.

    ""We still think this is a Damocles sword dangling over euro investors,"" said BNP Paribas' Sneyd.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 03:38AM ET</span>",Euro falters after biggest weekly rise in a month as Catalonia deadline looms,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday after posting its biggest weekly rise in a month as traders took profits, though markets were wary of chasing the currency lower before an European Central Bank policy meeting next week.
With some political uncertainty in the form of an approaching deadline over Catalonia's bid for independence and Austria's election outcome, investors moved to the sidelines.
""ECB expectations will be the main driver for the euro and we see the overall trajectory of the euro higher, though there may be some consolidation after the heavy buying in recent weeks,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) in London.
The single currency  fell 0.3 percent to $1.1780 in early trades. It rose 0.8 percent last week, its biggest weekly rise in a month, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has until 10:00 a.m. local (0800 GMT) on Monday to clarify whether he is calling for the region's independence from Spain, with Madrid threatening a return to direct rule if his stance remains ambiguous.
Austria's young conservative star Sebastian Kurz is on track to become the country's next leader after an election on Sunday. He will likely seek a coalition with the resurgent far right as his party is far short of a majority.
Five people with direct knowledge of discussions told Reuters last week the ECB is homing in on extending its stimulus for nine months at the next meeting, while scaling it back. 
But the euro's losses have been limited thanks to a broadly muted dollar as subdued inflation data raised expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will not strike an overtly hawkish tone at its policy meeting at the end of the month.
Although U.S. consumer prices rose the most in eight months in September, as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related refinery disruptions, underlying inflation remained muted.
The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.1 percent to 93.21, lacking momentum after falling last week.

""If you are going to have an inflation target you should defend it. If you say you are going to hit the inflation target then you should try to hit it and maintain credibility,"" Bullard said in an interview with Reuters.
Some analysts, however, were quick to downplay the softer inflation data in the wake of recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
“What’s weighing on the dollar is the softer core inflation data,” said Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING, adding that the headline data were expected to be distorted by the effect of the hurricanes that hit the U.S. in September.
Meanwhile, retail sales rose 1.6%, their biggest gain since 2015, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Economists had expected a 1.7% increase.
Also weighing on the dollar was a surge in the pound to a nearly two-week high following a slump in the previous session after Brexit negotiators declared talks between the UK and the European Union had reached a deadlock.
GBP/USD rose 0.29% to $1.3302.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on Friday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in September, pointing to muted inflation that could worry Federal Reserve officials.
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index jumped 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.6 percent increase.
September's increase was the biggest in eight months, but it stemmed mostly from soaring gasoline prices after hurricane-related production disruptions at Gulf Coast area oil refineries. Underlying inflation remained muted.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.19 percent at 92.883 after falling to a more than two-week low of 92.749. 
The dollar fell to 111.7 Japanese yen, its lowest since Sept. 26.
The Fed has raised its benchmark rate twice this year and signaled a third hike later this year.
Financial markets are pricing a roughly 88 percent probability of a rate increase in December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. 
The disappointing consumer price data ""basically puts more pressure on the Fed to look at inflation,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at Oanda in Toronto. ""It puts the December rate hike more into question.""
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers had a prolonged debate about the prospects of a pickup in inflation and slowing the path of future interest rate rises if it did not.
Policymakers could, however, find solace from another report indicating the economy was recovering swiftly from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.
The weaker dollar helped buoy Britain's pound to a nearly two-week high against the dollar.
Sterling, which earlier skidded as Germany told Britain ""time is running out"" to get the deal it wants on Brexit, rebounded to trade up 0.32 percent at $1.3302.
The euro hit a session high of $1.1855 against the dollar and was up 0.22 percent. 

The common currency was on pace for its biggest weekly rise in a month as investors put political concerns on the back burner and focused on expectations that the European Central Bank would outline plans to unwind its huge stimulus program.

However, a separate report showed that U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in September, both on a monthly and annual basis.

Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Thursday that the central bank's timeline for interest rate hikes could be implemented better if the Fed were to wait until inflation rises above its target.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",Sterling long bets under pressure as Brexit noises grow,"By Fanny Potkin
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound steadied on Wednesday, holding just above a one-month low hit as investors grew concerned on whether entrenched expectations of higher UK interest rates were reasonable given a backdrop of uncertain Brexit negotiations.
Noises around Brexit negotiations grew louder after finance minister Philip Hammond declared the government was planning for all possibilities, including Britain's leaving with no agreement on the terms of its departure. 
However, that had little impact on sterling with the currency hemmed in tight trading ranges as investors worried that a sharp turnaround in sterling in the currency markets to net long positions may come under pressure.
David Cheetham, the chief market analyst for XTB trading, warned that the high levels of speculative positioning risked weakening the pound.
""Recent events are unlikely to cause major downside for sterling on their own but they are weighing on the pound, and the alarming frequency with which they are occurring only increases the chances of another major political blow for the market,"" he said.
Sterling  was broadly flat at $1.3195 after two sessions of gains. It briefly hit a day's low of $1.3176 after Hammond's comments.
Strategists said the speech had only minimal impact with markets more focused on the strong data this week and broad expectations of interest rate hikes baked into the currency markets.
""I don't think Hammond’s speech about a 'no deal' is a major factor. Actions speak louder than words to the market. There has been virtually no practical preparation of a 'no deal' scenario,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (PA:SOGN).
Despite falling projections for British economic growth, futures markets are pricing in 50 basis points of Bank of England rate increases over the next year , the most in the developed world apart from Canada.
But the outlook appeared fragile, with some market watchers including such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) preferring to sell sterling on rallies on Brexit worries.

""Should the start of the UK-EU (post-Brexit) trade deal be postponed, UK inward investment may suffer,"" analysts at the investment bank said in a note.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2017 03:54AM ET</span>",Catalonia relief sends euro to two-week high,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a two-week high against a broadly weaker dollar on Wednesday on relief that Catalonia had stopped short of formally declaring independence from the rest of Spain. 
In a much-anticipated speech to the Catalan parliament late on Tuesday, regional leader Carles Puigdemont made only a symbolic declaration of independence, calling for talks with Madrid in a gesture that eased fears of immediate unrest in the heart of the euro zone.
Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said on Wednesday that there was room for negotiations within the framework the country's existing constitution, although he said the Calatan leader's speech had been a ""trick"".
The euro climbed to as high as $1.18345 in early trade on Wednesday, its strongest since Sept. 26. 
""We are in a negotiation stage, and from that point of view that's a calming-down of the tensions that were there earlier in the week. But the situation is still potentially incidiary,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, in London. 
Foley added that any moves higher in the euro were likely to be limited, given the extent to which it has already appreciated against the dollar - over 12 percent so far this year. 
The euro was also helped by strong economic data out of Germany on Tuesday as well as broad weakness in the dollar.
U.S. President Donald Trump's public feud with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, an influential fellow Republican, has raised concern that his push for a tax-code overhaul could be harmed.
""Squabbles surrounding Trump's efforts come as no surprise, but it is still not helping the dollar,"" said Yukio Izhizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 
The dollar index - which measures the greenback against six major rivals - slipped 0.1 percent to 93.175, having hit a 10-week high last week. 
Stronger-than-expected U.S. wages had helped the greenback rise to a three-month high of 113.440 yen on Friday, but the latest flare-up in tensions with North Korea reduced the gains.
Investors were awaiting the release of minutes of the September Federal Reserve policy meeting later in the session. The Fed had signaled at the meeting that it may raise interest rates for a third time this year even with inflation staying below its 2 percent goal.
But with the Fed funds futures almost fully pricing in the likelihood of a rate hike in December and the recent spike in Treasury yields losing momentum, analysts said fresh factors could be needed for the dollar to renew its advance.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hopped to a one-week high on Tuesday as investors added positions on hawkish overnight comments by a policymaker that reaffirmed bets the euro zone economy's outlook remains robust.
The currency's rise this year has lost some momentum in recent days as political concerns - notably Spain's Catalan crisis - have grown pushing the euro down against the dollar more than 3 percent over the last month.
But on Tuesday, it bounced nearly 0.4 percent to $1.1789, its highest since Oct. 2, after overnight comments from Sabine Lautenschlaeger, a member of the European Central Bank executive board, calling for the ECB to roll back asset purchases in 2018.
""Her hawkish comments also appear supportive for the euro but the political overhang has taken the air out of the euro balloon, and this ongoing political uncertainty will most certainly cap any near-term rallies,"" said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at OANDA.
Also helping sentiment was strong data from Germany. Industrial output posted its biggest monthly rise in more than six years in August, data showed on Monday. Data from France and Britain are due later in the day.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Chinese firms rush to hedge as yuan swings begin to sting,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Hobbled by the yuan's unexpected surge this year, more Chinese companies are trading currency derivatives to hedge risks, although many mainland firms remain exposed to swings in China's increasingly volatile currency.
Companies in China have for years been accustomed to a stable yuan that moved in one direction for long periods of time. Yuan hedging markets are still in their infancy, stymied by the central bank's stringent requirements for hedging and the limited participation of speculators and large state-owned firms, which could make markets more liquid.
But that is changing. Volatility has risen steadily since 2015 after the People's Bank of China decided to let market forces have a bigger sway in the yuan's direction, clamped down on capital flows and, more recently, introduced more opacity in the way it sets the currency's value.
The yuan slumped 6.5 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2016, but has unexpectedly reversed course this year, surging 5.3 percent so far.
More than 70 China-listed companies have announced plans this year to use derivatives for risk-hedging, according to Reuters' calculations based on exchange filings. Among them, 27 firms are trading yuan forwards, swaps or options for the first time.
""Last year, when the yuan was falling, there was no need to hedge, because depreciation was on our side,"" Jiang Tao, an investor relations official at Shenzhen Yuto Packaging Technology Co, told Reuters.
The Chinese exporter of gift boxes and stickers is one of the 70 companies reviewed and generates over 60 percent of its revenue overseas. In the first half of this year, it posted a 47.5 million yuan currency loss due to a stronger yuan.
It says the less predictable currency trends have prompted it to use derivatives this year to hedge risks.
Although Reuters' calculations are not exhaustive, with some companies not disclosing their use of derivatives, it nonetheless shows a rising interest in hedging currency risks. Between 2012 and 2014, only about 30 companies each year announced hedging plans, but that number jumped to 68 last year.
""It's more about mentality, than about competence,"" said Oliver Rui, Professor of Finance and Accounting at business school CEIBS.
Rui, who sits on the boards of several Chinese companies as an independent director, said most firms are not used to hedging because the yuan has only become more volatile in recent years.
Corporate China's still evolving risk-management culture, however, poses a dilemma for Beijing, which has been under international pressure to liberalize the yuan while also seeking to prevent destabilizing currency swings.
EXPORTER COMPLACENCY
China has seen a rise in foreign exchange transaction volumes between banks and clients, a barometer of companies' hedging activities, which has tracked increasing volatility in the yuan over the past six months.
But that monthly turnover of around $500 million is tiny for the world's second biggest economy, which has an annual trade turnover of $3.7 trillion yuan, as well as increasing offshore financing and investment activities. Several local companies have turned to overseas derivatives market, such as Hong Kong's yuan futures, or non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).
A lack of participation by China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the derivatives market has also kept volumes low. Many such firms were barred from being too active in the onshore yuan market after incurring losses in overseas derivatives during the 2007-08 global financial crisis.
For export-oriented manufacturers such as Shenzhen Yuto Packaging Technology Co., a strong yuan has meant weaker dollar income.
According to an estimate by brokerage Minsheng Securities, China's listed manufacturers recorded currency losses totaling 8 billion yuan ($1.20 billion) during the first six months, equivalent to 1 percent of their combined net profit. Nearly 1,400 listed firms in the sector said they suffered.
Shandong Laiwu Jinlei Wind Power Technology Co is another firm making its debut in the currency derivatives market. It last month announced plans to conduct hedging worth up to $40 million for 2017.
Others, such as Kingclean Electric, have been stung by unhedged positions. The home appliance maker, dubbed ""the King of Cleanliness"", booked a 62.9 million yuan currency loss in the first half and as a result posted a meager 2 percent net profit gain despite a 37 percent surge in sales.
Liu Zheng, an analyst at Zheshang Securities Co, pointed to Kingclean's U.S. dollar cash pile, worth more than $400 million at the end of June, which he says was unhedged. The company didn't return emailed requests for comments.

""Apparently, the company was betting that yuan would depreciate further, following last year's tumble,"" Liu said.

Geopolitical uncertainty resurfaced after U.S. President Donald trump tweeted over the weekend that years of talks with North Korea over its nuclear buildup have failed, and “only one thing will work” to curb the isolated nation’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons.



Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday urged military leaders ""to be ready"" with military options for President Donald Trump to deal with North Korea should diplomacy fail.
""Right now it is a diplomatically led, economic sanctions-buttressed effort to try to turn North Korea off this path,” Mattis said. “Now, what does the future hold? Neither you nor I can say, so there’s one thing the U.S. Army can do, and that is we have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our president can employ if needed.”
The remarks come ahead of the annual celebration of the founding of North Korea's ruling communist party slated for Tuesday, at which Pyongyang could demonstrate some show of military strength to mark the anniversary.

980,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2017 09:00AM ET</span>","Pound Snaps Losing Streak as Labor Costs Climb, May Holds Ground","(Bloomberg) -- The pound strengthened for the first time in seven days versus the euro as U.K. employment data signaled that the Bank of England might have to tighten policy at a faster pace than previously thought.
Sterling snapped two days of losses against the dollar and climbed against all of its major peers as the Office of National Statistics corrected second-quarter unit labor costs to 2.4 percent year-on-year, up from the 1.6 percent it announced on Friday. The currency was also helped by talk that Prime Minister Theresa May could demote her rebellious Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to thwart attempts to oust her.
The jump in sterling on the ONS news was likely a “knee-jerk response” said Stuart Bennett, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Banco Santander (MC:SAN) SA. While a November BOE rate hike is already priced in by markets, the news was “probably enough to convince U.K.-based traders to buy.” May’s survival as PM also helped the pound “as FX markets loathe political uncertainty over almost everything else,” Bennett said.
The pound gained 0.4 percent to 89.47 pence per euro as of 9:12 a.m. in London, having fallen around 2.4 percent in the past six days. Sterling also rose 0.4 percent to $1.3112, recovering from a drop on Friday to a one-month low. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds was little changed at 1.36 percent.
Pound Volatility
Volatility in sterling showed the BOE is increasingly in traders’ focus amid Brexit uncertainty. The implied probability of a 25-basis-point rate hike by the BOE in its November meeting was 85 percent, according to MPC-dated SONIA.
“Given that the markets are anticipating a rate hike already, it remains to be seen whether this could be a game changer for sterling,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency research at Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) SA’s corporate and investment-banking unit in London, referring to the ONS error. “Our expectation is that sterling will remain close to recent lows against the dollar and the euro and recover on a more sustained basis only over the long-term.”

981,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2017 08:59AM ET</span>",Dollar near 10-week highs on Fed hike bets; sterling rebounds,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied close to its highest level in ten weeks on Monday, with strong U.S. wages data at the end of last week giving investors confidence that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December.
Sterling was the biggest mover among developed-market currencies, recovering as much as 0.9 percent  on signs that a plot to topple Prime Minister Theresa May would not be successful, easing political uncertainty a touch. 
The greenback reached 14-year highs at the start of 2017, but it had spent most of the rest of the year weakening, as weak economic data as well as doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to push through tax reforms weighed on the currency. 
Since then, though, the dollar has recovered almost 3 percent against a basket of major currencies (DXY), on signs that Trump's tax reform plans could be back on track, and on a firming-up of bets that the Fed will in December hike rates for the third time this year. 
The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed the first fall in U.S. employment in seven years, but investors reckoned that was down to the temporary effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and focused on the largest gain in U.S. wages since December. 
Some strategists, though, said the numbers were not enough to materially shift expectations for the Fed's tightening path. 
""Friday's wage data were promising but the report was so distorted, I'm not sure investors can take too much from them,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt. 
""I don't think the market is looking further than the December meeting ... I think we'll stay around these levels for the time being,"" she added.
Data on Friday showed speculators cut their bearish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week up to last Tuesday. 
The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies - hit its highest since late July on the numbers, at 94.267 (DXY). It traded close to that level on Monday, inching down 0.1 percent to 93.701. 
Investors were focused on U.S. inflation and retail sales due later in the week, as well as minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting. 
""The gradual firming of earnings growth supports the Fed’s plans to continue raising rates gradually, although it remains a concern that underlying inflation pressures have slowed this year,"" wrote MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman in a note to clients. 
Trade was thinned by public holidays in Japan, South Korea and the United States.

991,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",Pound Could Go From Bad to Worse as May Drama Dominates Mood,"(Bloomberg) -- There may be no respite for the pound after its worst weekly performance in a year.
Sterling fell almost 3 percent last week, after a chaotic Conservative party conference cast the premiership of Theresa May in doubt. With political intrigue set to continue, the Brexit talks restarting and manufacturing data due, strategists anticipate another volatile week and investors in the options market have turned bearish. Meanwhile, May could be planning an overhaul of her team of top ministers soon, the Sunday Times reported.
""Theresa May’s position as prime minister is clearly foremost in the market’s mind,” said Jane Foley, Rabobank’s head of currency strategy. ""If she goes, investors are going to be fearful that’s going to open up a catalog of events which will lead to a Labour government.”
On Friday, Theresa May told reporters that she had the ""full support” of her cabinet. Although ex-Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said 30 members of the party were willing to sign a letter calling for her to resign, this falls short of the 48 signatures needed to launch a leadership challenge.
May will reshuffle her cabinet after an Oct. 19-20 summit in Brussels, the Sunday Times reported, citing unidentified party sources.
Sterling will ""recover its latest Tory-related losses should May cling on and domestic political risks meaningfully ease,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING Groep (AS:INGA) NV.
With Brexit talks due to start again this week, one-week volatility on the pound is higher than one- and three-month gauges. That suggests investors see more dramatic moves for sterling in the near term. Meanwhile, one-week risk reversals have turned bearish on the currency.
The market will also be awaiting any further clarity on the Bank of England’s thinking, having priced in an interest-rate hike in November. This week’s data will provide investors with the latest evidence of both how likely the bank is to tighten policy and whether it would be right to do so, said Foley, with industrial production and house prices key.
""We’ve had a number of warnings in the past that a rate hike was very possible only to see no action,” said Standard Bank’s head of currency strategy Steven Barrow. ""Another episode of this in coming months might not just set the pound back but could also limit the extent that sterling can rise whenever the bank makes similar warnings in the future.”

Optimism over the strength of the economy was intact after the release of a mixed U.S. employment report on Friday, as markets seemed to solely focus on encouraging wage growth.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.
The data seemed to support expectations for a December rate hike by the Fed, which has been boosting the U.S. dollar in recent sessions.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 09:43AM ET</span>",Dollar jumps as rising wages stoke inflation expectations,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar jumped to more than two-month highs against the yen and seven-week highs against the euro on Friday after the government’s jobs report for September showed rising wages.
Average hourly earnings increased 12 cents or 0.5 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August. The gains came as nonfarm payrolls fell by 33,000 jobs last month after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring.
“I think most people realized going in that the headline numbers would be distorted because of the storms, but the surprise was the average hourly earnings,” said Win Thin, head of emerging markets currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
“This is the missing piece in the Fed’s puzzle,” Thin added. “I think the dollar rally is back on track and should continue next week.”

Improving U.S. data along with the prospect of U.S. tax cuts and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December have boosted the U.S. currency in recent weeks.

The USD/CAD rose 13% to 1.2582 after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 in September, compared to the rise of 169,000 a month earlier that was revised up from the initial increase of 156,000.
The loss was short of the 90,000 jobs economists expected. It was an unexpected end of what had been a week of data pointing to a strengthening U.S. economy.
The jobless rate ticked down to 4.2% last month, while average hourly earnings rose month-to-month by 0.5%, beating analysts’ expectations. The increase in wages is closely watched by the Federal Reserve for signs of inflation and slack in the labor market.
In Canada, the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% in September as the economy created 10,000 jobs compared to 22,000 the month prior. Analysts had expected 14,500 jobs.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.19% to 93.95.
The move weakened both the sterling and the euro, which were both weighed down by Brexit and Catalan independence uncertainty.

Optimism over the strength of the economy did not waver despite the mixed U.S. employment report as markets seemed to solely focus on wage growth.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 02:30AM ET</span>",Dollar lower or steady at best over the coming year: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Most major currencies will hold on to their gains made in 2017 against the dollar over the coming year, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists who were not entirely convinced of the U.S. administration's ability to pass through tax cuts.
A raft of robust data out of the United States and new general plans on tax reform from the White House sent the dollar (DXY) to a seven-week high on Tuesday and up almost 3 percent last month.
But the latest poll of over 60 strategists taken this week showed the greenback will at best be where it is now in three, six, and 12 months as predictions were largely unchanged, suggesting the current rally will mostly be short-lived.
That was also partially reflected in predictions for dollar positioning at the end of October. Speculators' net short bets on the dollar are at their highest since late September 2012, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
A touch more than half of 38 respondents who answered an extra question said those bets will decrease by the end of the month, while 10 said they will remain the same.
While only two strategists said bets against the dollar will increase, just six of them said there will be a reversal in positioning in favor of the greenback.
""The USD's multi-year record net-short positioning should remain at high levels in October in the absence of any major drivers from the monetary and fiscal sides,"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
""But expectations about fiscal expansion and additional monetary tightening should prevent speculators from hoarding additional USD short positions.""
Expectations have been weighed lower for the dollar on the lack of belief the U.S administration will be able push through any form of tax reforms.
Indeed a simple majority of strategists, 24 of 43, who answered an extra question said they do not expect tax cuts will make it through Congress this year. The remaining 19 respondents said they will.
Strategists' hesitation in calling for a stronger dollar has also been driven by muted expectations now of higher interest rates in the United States and already mostly priced-in, than the shift in central bank policy in other developed markets.
""The current external environment is less favorable for the dollar, with the global economy strengthening and other major central banks as well moving to tighten policy,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG. 
""It basically is diminishing the relative appeal of the dollar. One of the key assumptions is that, we don't think the Fed will be speeding up the pace of rate hikes. Going forward, it is more likely that they could slow the pace of rate hikes.""
ECB EDGY ON EURO STRENGTH
The euro has gained ground - up almost 12 percent against the dollar - this year on solid economic momentum in the currency bloc and on expectations the European Central Bank will scale back its massive stimulus starting next year.
The minutes of the ECB's September policy meeting released on Thursday showed policymakers debated the trade-off between various options for extending its asset buying and a reduction.
But policymakers also expressed concern and mentioned the potentially negative aspects of a strong euro and its impact on inflation at the meeting.
The single currency is now forecast to stay around the $1.18 it was last trading on Thursday in a month, and over the next 3-6 months. It is then expected to add about 2 percent to $1.20 in a year. 
If those predictions for end 2017 are realized, it will mark the first year of gains for the euro since 2013.
While expectations are for currency markets to trade in ranges, forecasts were more in favor of the euro in a year's time, with higher highs and higher lows.
ABE FAVORED
Market expectations are that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will prevail in a snap election he called for Oct. 22, seeking a mandate to stick to his tough stance toward a volatile North Korea and rebalance the social security system.
In support of his political and economic agenda, the consensus of responses for an extra question was for the yen to be unchanged in the immediate aftermath of that election if Abe-led Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) wins a decisive or even a simple majority.
That is also in line with the broader poll expectations for the yen to trade around the current 112 per dollar in a month and weaken only slightly to 114 in a year.
""I think a lot of what has been done has already altered the (yen's) price,"" added Hardman.
""Monetary policy is already very aggressively loosened and if anything it looks more likely that monetary policy could be kind of reaching its limits in terms of how aggressive the BoJ is willing to be at this point in time.""

Investors' confidence in the U.S. economy was boosted after the Department of Labor reported on Thursday that initial jobless claims fell more than expected to 260,000 last week.

The dollar also strengthened after the U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 spending bill, which was seen as an important step to advance an eventual tax reform plan.
Hopes for higher U.S. interest rates also boosted the greenback after Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said on Thursday that he is still planning on one more rate hike this year and three next year.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Asian currencies, on an upswing since the start of the year, are unlikely to trade higher than they are now in a year, held back as the U.S. Federal Reserve presses on with further interest rate rises, a Reuters poll found.
Having made inroads thanks to growing doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to pass sweeping tax cuts, the regional currencies are forecast to broadly hold their ground, the poll of more than 50 foreign exchange strategists showed.
The Thai baht - among the best performers in Asia - has gained nearly 7 percent against the dollar while the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Taiwan dollar have all appreciated over 4 percent.
In contrast, the dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, has lost about 8 percent so far this year.
It rose over 1 percent after the Fed announced it would start to shrink its more than $4 trillion bond portfolio this month and hinted a December hike was on the cards.
The average of the survey results of 11 major Asian currencies predicted almost no change over the next 12 months from current levels.
Strategists at UniCredit expect emerging market currencies to do well over the medium-term but say they are cautious.
""First, EMFX positioning remains quite extended, with CFTC futures positioning for the Mexican peso – a decent proxy for EMFX given the peso's high liquidity and significant representation in investor portfolios, which is still quite elevated - near multi-year highs,"" they said.
""In the past, we have always maintained that factors like EM - and Chinese - growth and commodities are more influential for EMFX prospects than movements in U.S. yields...Accordingly, we prefer to stay away from taking directional USD-EM exposure at the moment and focus on relative-value ideas."" 
A separate Reuters poll published this week showed East Asia's stock market bull run is expected to extend into 2018, driven by optimism about economic growth and better company earnings.
China's yuan is forecast to hover around current levels of 6.64 per dollar in six months and depreciate slightly to 6.70 in a year, the poll showed.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) allowed the yuan mid-point reference rate to depreciate about 2 percent over the past two weeks.
""Part of it is a recent slight bounce in the USD, and much of it is the PBoC - yet again! - ensuring that what had been appreciation pressure from end-May to that early September low did not run too far ahead of where the central bank wants the currency to be,"" said Rabobank senior Asia-Pacific strategist Michael Every.
Financial risks associated with a debt boom in the world's second-largest economy prompted Standard & Poor's to downgrade its long-term sovereign credit rating last month, which dragged down the yuan about a percent against the dollar.
Broad policy considerations will be key for the yuan's outlook.
Political and economic policies will be front and center at the once-every-five-years China Communist Party meeting, starting from Oct. 18, at which President Xi Jinping will look to further stamp his authority on the party.
India's rupee is forecast to appreciate marginally to 64.95 per dollar in six months and 65.00 in a year, compared with Wednesday's close of 65.02. But markets have turned bearish on the rupee for the first time in nearly nine months, suggesting the optimism surrounding sweeping economic reforms is fading. [ASIA/FXP]
""The current combination of external risks from developed market policy normalization, local negatives from fiscal and current account deficits and slower growth keep us on the sidelines with respect to (the) INR,"" wrote Craig Chan, research analyst at Nomura, in a note.
Economic growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to lower its growth projection to 6.7 percent for fiscal year 2017-18, down from previous forecast of 7.3 percent. It kept policy steady at the October meeting, after cutting its main rate in August to the lowest since November 2010.

Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States are due to begin a fourth round of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Washington next week.
Senators from President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said they would oppose any deal that included proposals such as setting a national quota for U.S.-made auto parts and increasing controls over the trade in fresh produce, people close to the talks said. 
""We are deeply worried by what the U.S. has added recently in the free-trade negotiations,"" said Senator Marcela Guerra, who heads Mexico's Senate committee on North American affairs.
U.S. President Donald Trump argues that NAFTA has hollowed out U.S. manufacturing, sending jobs to Mexico and fueling a U.S. goods trade deficit of more than $60 billion with its southern neighbor. 
Senator Ricardo Urzua said such proposals would hurt consumers who have enjoyed lower prices under NAFTA.
""Far from trying to favor certain U.S. labor sectors, this would hurt millions of consumers in the United States, Canada and Mexico,"" Urzua said.
A lack of substantive progress in three rounds of NAFTA talks since August and concerns about the hardline U.S. positions has added to market jitters in recent days. 
The peso currency closed down 1.29 percent at 18.4995 per dollar on Thursday, the lowest since June 5. Also weighing, solid U.S. economic data broadly lifted the dollar as investors bet the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. 
Guerra mentioned six so-called red lines for Mexico, including a proposal by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to incorporate a ""sunset clause"" that would automatically kill NAFTA unless it was renegotiated every five years. 
Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo accused Trump of seeking a ""protectionist war"" that would unravel the treaty that has helped expand annual trade to $1 trillion between the three nations.
In an interview published in the El Economista daily on Thursday, Guajardo, who leads the negotiations for Mexico, said the United States was considering trying to impose restrictions on companies that do business with state-owned entities.
Ending state oil firm Pemex's 75-year monopoly, Mexico opened up its oil and gas sector to private investment with a 2013-14 reform, attracting investment from around the world.
Some critics believe state-run companies are subsidized, creating an unlevel playing field. However, Guajardo said it would be unacceptable for NAFTA to change the rules for companies doing business with Pemex under the reform.
""Imagine what Exxon and all those who have bet on the reform and have established joint investments are going to think,"" Guajardo said in the interview.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) plans to operate a network of gas stations in Mexico, a strategy made possible by the energy reform.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2017 03:19PM ET</span>",EM fund managers move to more exotic currencies as dollar hits lows,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of 2017’s top-performing emerging market fund managers are reshuffling their currency holdings, paring back bets on some of the asset class' big names and shifting to more exotic currencies like the Czech koruna, Uruguayan peso and the Egyptian pound.
The dollar's bounceback in September, including its best week of the year to close the month, has not changed managers' underlying bearishness on the currency. The shift represents a sense that the greenback’s remarkable slide against rivals like the Mexican peso and Brazilian real may stall - the dollar bounced to a three-month high versus the peso on Thursday - while other currencies are due for a rally. 
Fund managers’ embrace of these lesser known and less liquid currencies is a sign that even within emerging markets, long considered an exotic and volatile area to begin with, investors are pushing out their risk profile. That could represent either a savvy wager or irrational exuberance.

Data from research firm eVestment shows that local currency bond and outright currency exposure to Uruguay more than doubled from the second quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017, long positions in the Czech Republic's local currency bonds have surged to 44.9 percent from 11.4 percent during that period and the proportion of investors with currency exposure to the Czech koruna has soared to 68.0 percent from 12.7 percent. 
Investors with currency exposure to Egypt have grown from 2.53 percent in the second quarter of 2016 to 45.3 percent in the same quarter this year.
EVestment tracks the number of investors in its emerging markets local currency universe who report they own the bonds or have long exposure to the currency of the specified country.
Fund managers who spoke to Reuters described a range of investment instruments including currency forwards, local currency bonds and some government T-bills. 
Leah Traub, partner and portfolio manager at Lord Abbett, said her emerging market funds have recently entered positions, ""into some off-market names"" or currencies outside the JP Morgan emerging market diversified global bond index that she uses as a benchmark, including Uruguay, Egypt and India.
Her funds have rotated some exposure out of currencies correlated to the euro in emerging Europe, such as Hungary and Poland, and Traub said she is looking for emerging market currencies with lower levels of correlation to developed market currencies.
""If there was any theme to it it's just that the much better global backdrop allows some of these more idiosyncratic stories to really unfold,"" she said in a phone interview last week. 
Andy Keirle, who manages T Rowe Price's EM local currency bond fund, has also added positions in Egypt as well as the Sri Lankan rupee. At the same time, he reduced a long position in the Mexican peso he took ahead of the U.S. election.
Egypt has been favored by investors following the country's decision to float its currency, adopt a value-added tax and cut energy subsidies as part of a loan package from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has called Egypt's reforms ""bold"" and said the North African nation is ""gathering strength"" as the fund prepares to issue a $12 billion loan, its third tranche in the package.
Jean-Dominique Bütikofer, Voya Investment Management's head of emerging markets fixed income, said he is now looking for relative value trades, such as taking long positions on the Turkish lira against the South African rand. 
""When it comes to the market cycle, we don’t expect the market to sell off, but we have peaked,"" Bütikofer said. ""You can stay at a high level and you can plateau for a long time. The beauty of fixed income, including local currency and local rates, is you have a decent coupon. So going defensive too early might cost you a lot of money.""
Bütikofer and others said they will be closely watching next week's IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington for clues about the next potential catalyst for global fund flows.
While fund managers are diversifying - and some said they are taking a bit of risk off the table after a profitable 2017 so far - none of the 13 interviewed said they expect to see emerging market currencies bull run come to an end soon. 
""Historically since the 1970s, dollar cycles have traveled in multi-year paths, so it wouldn’t be surprising to be in a three-year, four-year cycle,"" said Jim Barrineau, portfolio manager and head of emerging markets debt for  Schroders  (LON:SDR). 
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currency rivals, has sunk from a high of 103.82 on Jan. 2 to a 2017 low of 91.15. But the index had been as low as 79.52 as recently as 2014.

In what was a busy day on the economic calendar for top-tier data investors cheered upbeat initial jobless claims and trade balance data pointing to strength in the U.S. economy.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 60,000 for the week ended Sept. 30, beating forecasts of a 7,000 decline.
The trade deficit — which measures the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — narrowed to $42.4 billion in August, down $1.2 billion from July. Exports in the August were $195.3 billion, while imports came to $237.7 billion.
The duo of reports come ahead of a nonfarm payrolls update due Friday, expected to show the U.S. economy created 90,000 jobs in September. It is the first time since December 2012 that economists’ forecasts for job creation fell below 100,000 amid concerns that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted labour market activity.
The Federal Reserve closely monitors both labor market growth and the pace of inflation when it considers monetary policy decisions. The Federal Reserve signalled at its previous policy meeting that the majority of its members support an additional rate hike this year.
San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Wednesday he does not need to see inflation move higher to support another interest rate increase this year as long as other economic data points to continued economic strength.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained on Thursday as data pointed to solid U.S. growth, though the dollar index held under seven-week highs due to caution over how much Friday’s employment report for September will be impacted by recent hurricanes.
The U.S. trade deficit fell in August as exports of goods and services rose to the highest level in more than 2-1/2 years, while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.
New orders for U.S.-made goods rose in August and orders for core capital goods were stronger than previously reported, suggesting robust business spending could help offset some of the economic drag of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
“There’s been positive data in the U.S. this morning, that’s been supportive of the dollar,” Sireen Harajli, foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho in New York, said.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies rose as high as 93.851, but held below the seven-week high of 93.92 reached on Tuesday as traders waited for Friday’s payrolls.
“There is a little bit of a sense of caution, markets are looking for a very low number,” Harajli said. “I think we will probably see a stronger reaction if we get a better-than-expected number because it will firm up expectations that the FOMC will go ahead and tighten policy in December and beyond.”
Improving U.S. data along with the prospect of U.S. tax cuts and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December have boosted the U.S. currency in recent weeks.
Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in an 84 percent likelihood of a December rate hike, up from 78 percent a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
The euro also fell after European Central Bank meeting minutes were interpreted as slightly dovish. 
ECB policymakers last month debated the trade-off between various options for extending its asset buying, with some arguing that a reduction was warranted in any scenario.

The single currency  was last down 0.30 percent against the greenback at $1.1725.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened on Wednesday as investors repositioned ahead of Friday's highly anticipated jobs report, but pared losses on a strong non-manufacturing report.
Improving U.S. data along with the prospect of U.S. tax cuts and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December have boosted the U.S. currency in recent weeks.
Traders have been cautious this week on the greenback, however, on concerns that recent hurricanes may hurt last month's hiring report.
""People were afraid of the impact of hurricanes on payrolls,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management.
The dollar index (DXY) was last down 0.7 percent at 93.479, after earlier falling as low as 93.259.
The dollar pared losses after the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index rose to its highest level since August 2005 in September and the prices paid index reached its highest level since February 2012.
""The data seems to be supportive all the way across the board for a Fed hike in December,"" said Schlossberg.
Other data showed that U.S. private employers added 135,000 jobs in September, topping economists' expectations even as Hurricane Harvey and Irma ""significantly impacted smaller retailers.""
Fed Chair Janet Yellen did not comment on the economy or monetary policy in prepared remarks at a community banking conference on Wednesday.
Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in an 83 percent likelihood of a December rate increase, up from 78 percent on Tuesday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
Investors are also adjusting for the likelihood that U.S. President Donald Trump will appoint a less hawkish head of the Federal Reserve than previously expected.
Politico reported on Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favors the appointment of Fed Governor Jerome Powell as Fed Chair over former governor Kevin Warsh, who is seen as more hawkish. 
Several news reports on Wednesday also showed opposition to Warsh's candidacy.
""Only a couple of days ago everyone was going for Warsh as successor, who the market saw as standing for a much tighter U.S. policy,"" said Commerzbank's head of currency research in Frankfurt, Ulrich Leuchtmann. 

""Now everyone is thinking that Powell is the more likely choice and thinking of Powell as someone who will do very, very gradual policy incrementations,"" Leuchtmann said.

GBP/USD was up 0.29% to 1.3269 by 05:02 AM ET (09:02 GMT) from around 1.3254 earlier.
Financial data firm Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.6 in September, up from 53.2 in August. Economists had expected an unchanged reading.
Subdued domestic demand acted as a drag on growth and the increase in new work orders was the slowest in 13 months.
Firms also remained under pressure from rising prices, with input cost inflation hitting a seven month high.
That was due to rising costs for food, energy and fuel bills, alongside increased prices for imported items and greater staff salaries, the report said.
The report came after similar data earlier in the week showing that factory growth slowed and construction activity contracted in September.
“The three PMI surveys put the economy on course for another subdued 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter could see even slower growth,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler Markit.
“The surveys therefore portray an economy struggling with the unwelcome combination of sluggish growth and rising prices, presenting a dilemma for policymakers.”

Sentiment on the dollar was dented following reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favors Fed Governor Jerome Powell over former governor Kevin Warsh to lead the central bank.
Last week the Trump administration interviewed both Warsh and Powell about replacing current Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires early next year.
Powell is seen as more dovish that Warsh, who has been critical of the Fed’s stimulus program in the past.
Investors were also looking ahead to Friday’s U.S. employment report for September. Signs of solid job growth would reinforce the case for a rate hike by the Fed in December.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.2% to 93.23 by 03:10 AM ET (07:10 GMT), pulling back from Tuesday’s one-and-a-half month high of 98.78.
Sentiment on the dollar was dented following reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favors Fed Governor Jerome Powell over former governor Kevin Warsh to lead the central bank.
Last week the Trump administration interviewed both Warsh and Powell about replacing current Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires early next year. Powell is seen as more dovish that Warsh, who has been critical of the Fed’s stimulus program in the past.
Investors were also looking ahead to Friday’s U.S. employment report for September. Signs of solid job growth would reinforce the case for a rate hike by the Fed in December.
Expectations that rates will rise help support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.

1023,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2017 02:30AM ET</span>",Dollar Skeptics Defy Rally as $1 Trillion Fund Prefers Euro,"(Bloomberg) -- Dollar skeptics are extending their bets outside the U.S., even as the greenback rallies.
Amundi SA, which oversees more than $1.1 trillion, prefers to wager on European currencies including the euro, while Schroder Investment Management Ltd. is putting its money into emerging markets. Eaton Vance Corp. in Boston says improving growth outside the U.S. could see the dollar resume weakening as it has for most of the year.
The U.S. currency rose for the first time in seven months in September as the Federal Reserve said an interest-rate increase in December was still on the table and President Donald Trump announced a plan to cut taxes. The greenback’s recovery has been closely correlated with Treasury yields, which have risen for the past three weeks.
“We expect U.S. 10-year yields to drift higher but not to move up sharply,” said Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment in Singapore. “If other countries, especially the growth-sensitive emerging economies, continue to benefit from the stronger global economy, the U.S. dollar should be weaker against them.”
At the heart of the debate over the dollar is lingering doubt over the Fed’s ability to keep raising rates into 2018 and investors’ preference for emerging markets and Europe over the U.S. as global growth gathers momentum. Hedge funds are skeptical about the greenback, with net short positions climbing to the highest since January 2013 at the end of last month, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
While Treasury 10 year yields are set to climb to a range of 2.40 percent to 2.60 percent in the next 12 months, a global synchronized economic recovery will also boost bond yields elsewhere, making local currencies more attractive, said James Kwok, head of currency management at Amundi in London.
The company is neutral on the dollar, preferring to wager on gains in the euro, Sweden’s krona and Norway’s krone against Asian currencies, he said.
The Fed is likely to be more gradual in raising rates in 2018 than the pace indicated by its so-called “dot plot,” although it’s difficult to estimate what it will do given a number of Federal Open Market Committee members will be changed and it’s unclear if Chair Janet Yellen will be replaced, Schroder’s De Mello said.
Emerging-market currencies such as the Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee are a better bet as they have high yields and will benefit from an improving global economy, he said.
The dollar isn’t going anywhere in a hurry, according to analysts’ forecasts. The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, will end the year at 93.1, little changed from current levels, according to the median estimate of a Bloomberg survey.
For Macquarie Bank Ltd., the increase in dollar short positions may be paving the way for the dollar to extend gains, at least for the time being.
“The capitulation of dollar longs a month ago gives us a clean slate, and creates a backdrop that’s conducive to a new dollar rally,” said Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange and rates strategist in Singapore. “But once central banks elsewhere become more hawkish in 2018, this will eat into the Fed’s lead, and should bring the dollar back to earth.”
Temporary ‘Correction’
Most of NatWest Markets’ clients in London see a year-end dollar rally as just a “correction in a longer-term downtrend,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, head of currency strategy in Singapore, who visited them last week.
Fund managers, including those who had been short dollars this year against the euro, expect a likely December Fed rate increase to signal the top for the U.S. currency this quarter, he said. Mohi-uddin sees the dollar staying in a range of $1.10 to $1.20 per euro for the first half of 2018.
Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance, says the prospect of stronger economic growth around the world undermines the attraction of the greenback. The manager is betting on the Australian dollar’s advance versus its New Zealand counterpart.
“The story of the growth prospects outside the U.S. improving more than that of the U.S. could keep the dollar weakening, as it has for most of the year, although a change in U.S. fiscal or monetary policy could lead to dollar strength,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was slightly weaker against the euro on Tuesday as investors squared positions after a three week greenback rally, and before three days of heavy data culminating in Friday's employment report for September.
Stronger U.S. data along with the prospect of U.S. tax cuts and the likelihood of a further interest rate hike in December have boosted the U.S. currency in recent weeks.
""We have seen three consecutive weeks of rallies in the broader dollar index so I do think that markets are squaring up a little bit ahead of a pretty heavy data calendar,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.

The euro slid against all of its major peers barring the pound on Monday after Catalan secessionist leaders in Barcelona signaled they may unilaterally declare independence within days. The spread between 10-year Spanish and German bond yields reached the widest since June.
“Spain is potentially facing a constitutional crisis, but it’s not something that threatens the degree of integration for the euro zone,” Vasileios Gkionakis, co-head of strategy research at UniCredit Bank SpA, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The political risk “is nowhere near as steep or troublesome as it was a couple of years ago,” he said, adding that he remains bullish on the euro.
Here’s a roundup of some analysts’ views for the euro and bonds:

""The bottom line for FX markets is that dollar-yen should tend to be negatively correlated with polling results for Hope, at least until the party’s views on monetary policy become clearer,"" Goldman analysts Zach Pandl and Kamakshya Trivedi wrote in a note dated Oct. 2. ""Hope"" refers to Koike’s Party of Hope, which is gaining interest in the run-up to the Oct. 22 general election.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is still most likely to win the ballot in Goldman’s view, has overseen a policy program that revamped leadership at the Bank of Japan. That unleashed unprecedented monetary stimulus, weakening the yen. At stake in the election is the chance to nominate BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for another term starting in April, or choose a new candidate.
""Given their change/reset campaign message, we believe a victory would call into question the sustainability of the BOJ’s easy stance, and open the field of candidates"" for BOJ chief, the Goldman analysts wrote. The Koike group has a ""fighting chance of making substantial inroads"" in the vote, they wrote.

The greenback was boosted after data on Monday showed that activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector accelerated in September.
The U.S. dollar was already broadly supported after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated last week that the central bank was sticking to plans for a third rate hike this year.
The dollar was also underpinned by fresh hopes for U.S. tax reform after the Trump administration outlined plans for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code last Wednesday.

Earlier Monday, data showed that confidence among Japan's manufacturers hit the highest level in ten years in September, helped by the weaker yen and strong global demand.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.54% to 1.1754 after Catalans voted for independence in a contested referendum on Sunday that ended in violence when police cracked down on polling booths, injuring hundreds of people.
Despite Spanish police measures to disrupt the referendum, which was declared unconstitutional by Madrid, the Catalan government said that 90% of the people votedin favour of breaking away, with a turnout of about 42%.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2017 07:18AM ET</span>",Catalonia worries knock euro against stronger dollar,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday after a violence-marred independence vote in Spain's Catalonia region fueled anxiety over political risk in the euro zone, and as a renewal of the ""Trumpflation trade"" lifted the dollar across the board.
Data showing factories across the euro zone enjoyed their most productive month since early 2011 in September could provide no support to the single currency, which slipped 0.7 percent to $1.1730 , close to its lowest in six weeks.
Investors were watching the political situation in Spain nervously, after police used batons and rubber bullets to try to prevent Sunday's banned vote in a show of force that left hundreds injured.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy now faces the country's biggest constitutional crisis in decades, with newspaper editorials saying the ballot - in which Catalan officials said 90 percent of voters had chosen to leave Spain - had set the stage for a decisive clash with Madrid.
""After the French election, a lot of risk premium was priced out of Europe... but now we have another against-the-status-quo European vote, so for financial markets, political risks in Europe have increased,"" said UBS currency strategist Constantin Bolz, in Zurich. 
""There will be a little bit of noise going through the week, but overall our expectation is that it will not have a dramatic, long-lasting impact,"" he added. 
Against the Swiss franc, often bought at times of uncertainty, the euro dipped to its weakest in three weeks at 1.13885 francs per euro (EURCHF=). 
U.S. FISCAL STIMULUS HOPES
Data on Friday showed speculators' net short bets on the dollar rose to their largest since late September 2012. [IMM/FX] 
But the dollar last week recorded its strongest weekly performance of 2017, lifted by a renewed expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump would deliver the fiscal stimulus he had promised. 
The greenback has also been boosted by the view that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates again before the end of the year, and might be turning more hawkish. 
The index that tracks the dollar against a basket of six major currencies added 0.6 percent to 93.588 (DXY).
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 112.84 .
Data released earlier on Monday showed Japan's big manufacturers were the most confident about the business outlook in a decade in the last quarter, in a sign the country's economic recovery may be gathering steam.
The figures could also help Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he tries to convince voters in an Oct. 22 election that his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies have improved their livelihoods, analysts say.
""If the results are perceived as a bad outcome for Abe's party, then some investors might view it as the beginning of the end of his 'Abenomics,' meaning the end of the yen-weakening trend,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.

""But there is another possibility as well, with both parties calling for stimulus steps, which some people think might lead to 'helicopter money,' so then they might sell yen.""

At the weekend, China's central bank on Saturday cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves for the first time since February 2016 in a bid to encourage more lending to struggling smaller firms and energize its lackluster private sector.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for some banks that meet certain requirements for lending to small business and the agricultural sector.
The PBOC also said said it will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy and use multiple monetary policy tools to keep liquidity basically stable. The PBOC will continue with interest rate and exchange rate reform while keeping the yuan basically stable, the bank said in comments on its website following a quarterly meeting of its monetary policy committee.

At the weekend, China's central bank on Saturday cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves for the first time since February 2016 in a bid to encourage more lending to struggling smaller firms and energize its lackluster private sector.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for some banks that meet certain requirements for lending to small business and the agricultural sector.
The PBOC also said said it will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy and use multiple monetary policy tools to keep liquidity basically stable. The PBOC will continue with interest rate and exchange rate reform while keeping the yuan basically stable, the bank said in comments on its website following a quarterly meeting of its monetary policy committee.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net short bets on the U.S. dollar rose to their largest since late September 2012, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the dollar's net short position was $17.36 billion in the week to Sept. 29, up from net shorts of $13.19 billion the previous week. Speculators have been net short the dollar for 11 straight weeks.
The dollar's net positioning was derived from net futures contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position valued at $21.13 billion, up from $16.65 billion a week earlier.
The dollar overall has been rebounding from multi-year lows since early September, and has extended that recovery after more hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve during its last monetary policy meeting that raised prospects for a rate increase in December.
The greenback has also been supported by new plans regarding U.S. tax reform from the White House, analysts said.
But James Chen, head of research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey noted that Fed Chair Janet Yellen has lately given some mixed signals. 
This week, Yellen said the Fed may have ""misspecified"" its models for inflation, and ""misjudged"" key facts such as the underlying strength of the labor market and whether inflation expectations are as stable as they seem, and central bankers need to remain open to that possibility as they decide on policy.

That said, Forex.com's Chen pointed out that expectations of a December rate increase remain high for now, and the U.S. dollar has remained supported in its recovery.

1057,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 29, 2017 01:02PM ET</span>",Dollar Set to Snap 6-Month Losing Streak; GBP/USD slumps on Weak UK GDP Data,"Investing.com – The dollar was roughly unchanged against a basket of major currencies as data showed the trend of slowing inflation continued in August but losses in the greenback were capped by a slump in the pound after UK second-quarter economic growth undershot expectations.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.08% to 93.01. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1% last month. The commerce department said Friday. 
Inflation, however remained subdued, as the core personal consumption expenditures price index slowed to 1.3% in August from 1.4% in July. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and has a 2 percent target.
The week inflation data weighed on the dollar, which remained on track to post a third-straight quarterly loss despite rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike rate later this year. 
The reports come amid speculation surrounding the future of Janet Yellen’s position as Federal Reserve chair after both President Donald Trump and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly met with Kevin Warsh to discuss the possibility of his nomination to replace Janet Yellen. 
Warsh was a Fed governor from 2006 until 2011 and was a member of former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's inner circle of advisers.
Weakness in the greenback, however, was capped by a slump in the pound amid weaker-than-expected UK economic growth data.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2017 11:30AM ET</span>",Hedge funds look past the euro's stumble and like what they see,"By Maiya Keidan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are looking past the euro's drop this week and remaining bullish, encouraged by an improved economy and political stabilization.
The single currency  has been the standout trade in foreign exchange markets this year, climbing more than 12 percent against the dollar in 2017. Long positions in the euro are now at their greatest in five years, positioning data show.
Investors have raised their bets on expectations the European Central Bank will start unwinding its multi-year stimulus plans in the coming months. 
The outlook for closer political union may have dimmed after support for the far right surged in German elections last week. But hedge fund managers believe the euro's economic prospects remain relatively better than, say, the U.S. dollar's. 
""Our view on the euro is that it is going to up, and it’s primarily based on the fact that (ECB President) Mr. Draghi is way behind where the American Fed is,"" said Alex Roepers, chief executive at $1.3 billion Atlantic Investment Management.
""He needs to raise rates, and the moment he gives up on zero interest rates, the euro will rally and I think it will go to $1.30.""
The euro has fallen nearly 3 percent after peaking at a 2 1/2-year high near $1.21 earlier this month. The main reason for the loss was the dollar's rebound this week after the Trump administration released its tax plans and Federal Reserve officials make some hawkish comments about U.S. interest rates. 
Euro bulls are undeterred.
""Europe is at an early stage of economic recovery and has a large current account surplus,"" said Borut Miklavcic, CIO and managing partner at LindenGrove Capital, who is ""very optimistic"" on the euro.
With the euro zone economy now growing for the 17th straight quarter, the ECB is expected to wind down its stimulus efforts, starting next year, even if inflation looks likely to remain below the bank's near 2 percent target for years to come. 
Data on Friday showed inflation in the 19-member currency bloc held steady at 1.5 percent in September. 

""Europe reminds me a lot of Japan with declining demographics and a huge amount of savings,"" said Russell Clark, a partner at $1.2 billion Horseman Capital Management, who expects the euro to remain strong.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was flat on Friday, leaving it on course for its biggest weekly rise this year as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields fueled by a tax reform plan triggered a shake-out in short bets against it.
While the broader market remained skeptical about U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to push his tax plan through Congress, some see the dollar as primed for more gains in the short term after breaking out of established ranges.
""What you have seen is a general closing out of some short dollar positions but for that to be sustained we need greater detail on Trump’s fiscal plans and see it going through,"" said James Binny, head of currency portfolio management for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors, which manages $2.61 trillion in assets.
The dollar index (DXY), a trade-weighted basket of the greenback against its rivals, was little changed at 93.05.
It has gained more than 1 percent this week, putting it on track for its best weekly performance since December, spurred by the rise in U.S. yields.
Benchmark two-year yields (US2YT=RR) rose more than 20 basis points in the last week to hit their highest since October 2008, before settling slightly below those levels at 1.46 percent.
Trump on Wednesday proposed lower tax rates for businesses and individuals as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code.
U.S. economic data, including the personal consumption expenditures price index for August later in the day, is also in focus, while the technical picture for the dollar was turning positive.
The dollar index punched above its 50-day moving average this week, a level it has traded below since April 2017. 
Meanwhile the euro nursed losses and is poised for its first monthly decline since February as the result of Germany's national election prompted some profit-taking on a double-digit rally this year.
The single currency <EUR=EBS> was trading 0.3 percent up, near the day's high of $1.1816 on some short-covering before quarter-end. It was little moved by data showing euro zone inflation was a shade below expectations for September.
The euro has fallen 1.16 percent so far this week, its first weekly decline in seven months. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) say there is potentially still a large short euro and euro zone position despite this week's rally.
""This suggests that unwinding these short euro positions may be more relevant for the long term and could lead to a stronger euro in the years ahead, keeping everything else constant,"" they wrote in a weekly note. 

Inflation in the 19-country currency bloc was 1.5 percent, unchanged from August and a tick below market expectations of 1.6 percent. The ECB targets inflation of just below 2 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar consolidated gains after hitting a one-month high on Thursday against a basket of currencies as U.S. Treasury yields rose, prompting investors to unwind some of their dollar shorts.
Hawkish rhetoric by the U.S. Federal Reserve has bond yields threatening to break out of their multi-month trading ranges, leaving market watchers dubious about a fundamental change in the outlook for the U.S. economy. 
""In our view, this is a corrective move higher and the long-term outlook for the dollar still remained lower,"" said Stephen Gallo, European head of FX Strategy for BMO Financial Group in London.
The dollar has gained more than 1.2 percent against a basket of currencies (DXY) and is on track to post its best weekly performance this year on hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration may be making progress on tax reforms.
On Thursday, the dollar was flat at 93.34 against a basket of currencies (DXY). It has gained 2.5 percent since hitting a 2 1/2-year low of 91.35 in mid-September. But on an annual basis, the dollar was poised for its biggest drop since 2004.
The tax proposal faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Congress, with Trump's own Republican Party divided over it and Democrats hostile.
But the plan's release, along with recent hawkish rhetoric from the U.S. central bank, has raised the likelihood of a U.S. rate increase by December to 70 percent compared with less than a third a month earlier. Speculators began to unwind short dollar bets, which had grown to multi-year highs.
""This is probably the best time for the U.S. to raise interest rates, as short-term growth indicators look robust and market volatility is near record lows and financial markets healthy and near record highs,"" said Yassir Benjelloun Touimi, a portfolio manager at Dalton Strategic Partnership LLP in London.
In an outlook report for the next 12 months, money managers at Pacific Investment Management Co said real gross domestic product is expected to grow 3 percent in 2018 with low near-term recession risks.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) rose to 2.3590 percent, its highest level since mid-July and was nearing the top end of a trading range established since early May.
Including the current move, the U.S. 10-year yield has risen more than 12 basis points - putting it on track for its biggest two-day rise in more than seven months.
The dollar's gains were more pronounced against currencies where the domestic story has worsened in recent days, such as the euro <EUR=EBS> and the Japanese yen <JPY=>
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap election as the main opposition Democratic Party threw its support behind a fledgling party led by Tokyo's popular governor, Yuriko Koike, in the Oct. 22 vote. The euro has struggled this week after the unexpected outcome of the German elections. 
The euro  bounced and rose 0.25 percent against the dollar after posting some chunky losses this week as German inflation data was broadly along market expectations.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was underpinned on Wednesday by remarks from the Federal Reserve chief on the need to continue with rate hikes, while the euro licked the wounds from political uncertainty following the German election at weekend.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 93.07, its highest level in almost a month, having risen from 93.286 the previous day.

Tensions are rising also in Catalonia, as Spain's government said on Tuesday that police would take control of voting booths in Catalonia to help thwart the region's planned independence referendum that Madrid has declared illegal.
Still, most market players think the euro could rebound soon as investors will likely focus on how the ECB will wind back its stimulus at its policy meeting next month.
""No one really expects the European politics to become a dominant issue for the market. The euro's slide is driven by position adjustments and now may be a good time to buy,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street in Tokyo.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $0.7862 after having dropped to six-week low of $0.7860 on Tuesday.
The Aussie was undermined by a fall this month in the price of iron ore, its main export product.
The biggest focus for the market for Wednesday is the announcement of a tax plan by the U.S. administration and Republicans in Congress.

The plan has been developed over several months by six White House and congressional Republicans working behind closed doors. President Donald Trump told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday he wants bipartisan cooperation on tax reform.

Janet Yellen's comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy after the U.S. central bank last week announced it would begin trimming down its $4.5 trillion in assets and signaled it will likely raise rates again this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen stood tall on Tuesday after tensions on the Korean peninsula flared-up anew amid an escalating war of words between North Korea and the United States, while the euro struggled near a four-week low versus the dollar.
The dollar was 0.15 percent lower at 111.550 yen  after coming off a high of 112.530 the previous day.
The euro was steady at 132.340 yen (EURJPY=) after dropping more than 1 percent overnight.
The Japanese currency made sharp gains after North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said on Monday that President Donald Trump had declared war on the country and that Pyongyang reserved the right to take countermeasures, including shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in its air space.
Japan is the world's largest creditor nation and traders tend to assume Japanese investors would repatriate funds at times of crisis, thus pushing up the yen. Many wonder, however, if Japanese assets would really remain in favour if an actual war broke out in Asia.
The Swiss franc, also sought in times of geopolitical tensions, stood at 0.9662 franc per dollar  after gaining about 0.3 percent overnight.
""The dollar tends to fall on flare ups in North Korean-related matters, but whether the Federal Reserve can hike interest rates in December as they projected still remains the ultimate decider,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
Immediate focus was on what views could be expressed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who is due to speak in Cleveland at 1645 GMT on ""inflation, uncertainty, and monetary policy.""
The euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1857  but in close reach of $1.1832, its lowest level since Aug. 31 plumbed the previous day when it sank nearly 1 percent.
The common currency took a knock after German Chancellor Angela Merkel won her country's elections over the weekend but saw a chunk of support shift to the far right.
The euro faced additional pressure after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi singled out currency volatility as a source of uncertainty that required monitoring and argued that ""ample"" ECB accommodation was still needed, because a premature and hasty move could unravel its work.
The euro had risen to a 2-1/2-year high of $1.2092 soon after the ECB's Sept. 7 policy meeting. Euro bulls were buoyed by the central bank's signal of an eventual end to its large bond-buying scheme, while the dollar's weakness has also helped. 
At the same time the 10-year German bund yield  hit a two-month low as the debt markets interpreted the ECB's message differently, seeing the central bank taking a cautious and patient approach to tapering its stimulus.
But the divergence between the euro and German yields that occurred has narrowed since.
""It was hard to see the euro and yields continuing to move in different directions, which was only possible as some speculators appeared to have gone to great lengths to push the euro higher,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""But these euro long positions are beginning to become untenable as the dollar is stronger and U.S. yields are higher after the Fed's policy meeting this month."" 
The New Zealand dollar extended the previous day's slide and was last down 0.2 percent at $0.7249 .

EUR/USD started the week on the back foot, falling 0.95% to $1.1843, as Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union had their worst election showing since 1949, ceding ground to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The somewhat pyrrhic victory complicates Merkel’s efforts to stitch together a complicated three-way coalition that can withstand pressure from the anti-immigration AfD party, which garnered about 13% of the vote, becoming the first far-right party to win seats in parliament in more than 50 years.

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro slipped in early Asian trading on Monday after Germany's election showed surging support for a far-right party that left Chancellor Angela Merkel scrambling to form a governing coalition.
The euro fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1.1896 and last stood at $1.1933, down 0.2 percent, holding above support around $1.1860.
Merkel did win a fourth term in office on Sunday but will have to build an uneasy coalition to form a government after her conservatives haemorrhaged support in the face of a surge by the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Despite winning the most votes, Merkel's bloc slumped to its worst result since 1949 and her current Social Democrat coalition partners said they would go into opposition after tumbling to 20.7 percent in projections, a post-war low.
""Probably the most significant announcement following the election was that the current junior coalition partner, SPD, immediately announced it would go into opposition,"" said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Europe in London.
""With the withdrawal (from a grand coalition) by the SPD, we think the only realistic option left is a coalition of Merkel's CDU/CSU, the Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens - dubbed 'Jamaica coalition - due to the colours of the three blocks (black/yellow/green),"" he said.
But building such a coalition could take months as the three-way tie-up has not been tested at national level.
Political uncertainty also took a toll on the New Zealand dollar after no single party won a majority in an election over the weekend.
The New Zealand currency dropped 0.9 percent to $0.7269.
The ruling National Party won the largest number votes in the election, but neither of the major parties won enough seats to gain a majority in parliament, forcing a round of coalition building that could last days or weeks.
Sterling steadied at $1.3486 after falling on Friday when ratings agency Moody's downgraded Britain's credit rating, saying government plans to bring down debt had been knocked off course and Brexit would weigh on the economy.
A few hours after Prime Minister Theresa May set out plans for new ties with the European Union, Moody's cut the rating to Aa2, underscoring the economic risks that leaving the bloc poses for the world's fifth-biggest economy.
May failed to give any concrete details for how Britain might retain preferential access to Europe's single market in her speech.
The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 112.30 yen per dollar, helped by renewed hope of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic stimulus as he is expected to announce a snap election, to be held on October 22.
A weekend survey by the Nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters planned to vote for Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) versus 8 percent for the main opposition Democratic Party. 
""It's easier for traders to start the week by selling the yen given expected resolution of the parliament and so on. But I would suspect a lot of election related stuff is already priced in and the yen would have limited downside,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of foreign exchange at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Tokyo.
Concerns over simmering tensions between North Korea and the United States could resurface any time, likely lifting the yen.
Japan is the world’s largest creditor nation and traders tend to assume Japanese investors would repatriate funds at times of crisis, thus benefiting the yen.

North Korea said on Saturday targeting the U.S. mainland with its rockets was inevitable after ""Mr. Evil President"" Donald Trump called Pyongyang's leader ""rocket man"", further escalating rhetoric over the North's nuclear weapons and missile programs.

1112,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 24, 2017 10:49PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD weaker And Kiwi Down On Election Results,"Investing.com - The euro dropped in early Asia on Monday as German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a tough job of forging a new coalition that could see her lead a minority government as the far-right AfD party won a surprise gain in votes and enters parliament for the first time and the kiwi slumped on another undecided election outcome.
EUR/USD traded at 1.1932, down 0.21%, while USD/JPY changed hands at 112.48, up 0.44%. AUD/USD traded at 0.7968, up 0.18%. NZD/USD traded at 0.7269, down 0.97%.
The AfD stunned the establishment by finishing third and entering parliament for the first time, with 13.5% of the vote. Under Germany's mixed-member proportional voting system, that vaults in well beyond the 5% threshold needed for seats in parliament.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU and Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), won 32.5% of the vote, making them by far the largest parliamentary group, according to an exit poll for the broadcaster ARD, but that is down from 41.5% in the last election in 2013 and lower than recent polling. Their closest rivals, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), slumped to 20.0%, a new post-war low.
Merkel now needs to work to form a coalition reportedly without the SPD, a process that will likely involve protracted negotiations.

In New Zealand, Bill English's National Party and the Labour party will vie for the support of kingmaker Winston Peters and his New Zealand First Party.
Elsewhere, a 3.4 magnitude earthquake in North Korea reaised speculation of a nuew nuclear test, but monitoring agencies were split on whether itw as a natural event or a nuclear detonation.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.11% to 92.05.
Ahead this week, market players will turn their attention to fresh comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen as expectations start to grow for a December rate hike. Investors will be focusing on a pair of speeches from ECB President Mario Draghi as well as remarks from the heads of central banks in the UK, Canada and Japan.
Last week, the dollar slid against the yen on Friday, snapping five days of gains as heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula bolstered safe haven demand for the Japanese currency.
The yen gained ground after North Korea said on Friday it could test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to “totally destroy” the country if the U.S. was forced to defend itself or its allies.
The remarks added to concerns that the escalating rhetoric could lead to one side misinterpreting the other, with dangerous consequences.
The dollar hit the highest level since mid-July against the yen on Thursday after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged. The move higher in the dollar was also prompted by the Federal Reserve’s policy statement on Wednesday in which it indicated that it is still on track to raise interest rates in December.
The single currency touched the day’s highs after robust economic data out of the euro zone underlined expectations for tighter monetary policy from the European Central Bank.
Sterling remained on the defensive after a closely watch speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May gave few new indications on how Brexit will proceed.

The dollar had strengthened broadly after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday indicated that one more interest rate hike is likely this year and said it will begin to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October.
But market sentiment was hit after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Friday that Pyongyang will consider the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history"" against the U.S. in response to President Donald Trump's threat to destroy the country.
Shortly after, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country could conduct a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific Ocean of an unprecedented scale.

Speaking in Florence, Italy, May said the UK “has never totally felt at home in the European Union” but that Brexit “does not mean we are turning our back on Europe” and that she hopes for a “creative and practical” separation.
May continued to say that the EU and the UK have a shared commitment to free trade, adding however that her country's future partnership with the EU cannot be like the European Economic Area – where goods, services and people move freely – nor can it be solely based on a trade deal, like the one the bloc has with Canada.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar buckled against the yen on Friday as tensions simmered on the Korean peninsula, though the sharp divergence between U.S. and Japanese monetary policy kept the greenback on track for a winning week against the yen. 
North Korea said on Friday it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would destroy the country if it threatened the United States or its allies.
Adding to investors' risk-aversion was S&P Global Ratings' downgrade to China's sovereign credit rating. On Friday, the ratings agency said the country's attempts to reduce risks from its rapid buildup in debt are not working as quickly as expected and credit growth is still too fast. 
The dollar dropped as much as 0.8 percent to 111.65 yen , before recovering to trade down around half a percent on the day at 111.96 yen in early London trade. 
The yen tends to benefit during times of crisis due to Japan's net creditor nation status, and the expectation that Japanese investors would repatriate assets. 
""Many are questioning whether that can remain the case in the presence of a risk event that is local to Japan,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analysts in a note to clients. 
""We find near-perfect symmetry in the way the yen responds to Asia-specific shocks and shocks from elsewhere, suggesting it can (remain a safe haven),"" they added. 
For the week, the dollar was still up more than 1 percent against the yen, having scaled a two-month peak of 112.725 after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that it was still on track to raise interest rates by the end of the year, and after the Bank of Japan maintained its bond-buying pledge. 
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, fell 0.3 percent to 92.024 (DXY), but it was still slightly higher on the week and was well above its more than 2-1/2 year trough of 91.011 marked on Sept. 8. 
It surged to its strongest in 15 days on Wednesday, but has since slipped around 1 percent. 
""If traders were hoping for a strong U.S. dollar rebound in the wake of this week's Fed meeting, the initial response was certainly encouraging (but) beyond that the response has been underwhelming,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. 
""Even if the Federal Reserve were able to deliver on a December rate rise, there is so much uncertainty about what the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will look like in six months’ time...that any projections for three further rate rises in 2018 have to be treated with a huge amount of caution."" 
The euro climbed half a percent to $1.1992 <EUR=> and was also up 0.1 percent for the week, with traders not seeing Sunday's German elections as a risk. Chancellor Angela Merkel is widely expected to win a fourth term in power.

“Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.”
As expected, policy makers left the benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.
“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective,” Chair Janet Yellen said during a press conference.
Earlier, the dollar came under pressure after sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly fell in August, as tight supply continued to weigh on housing activity.
Existing home sales declined 1.7% in August from the previous month to an annualised pace of 5.35m homes, the National Association of Realtors, said on Wednesday. Economists were expecting a 0.3% rise to 5.46m homes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on Wednesday, hitting a two-month high versus the yen, as the Federal Reserve signaled it may raise interest rates for a third time this year even as inflation has remained below its 2 percent goal. 
The U.S. central bank also said after a two-day meeting it will begin reduction of the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October by allowing small amounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to run off. [nFOMKKEDCA] 
""Right now, the market sees the Fed more hawkish than anticipated,"" said Tim Alt, director of currencies and rates at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
Some traders had thought catastrophic damage from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida might force the Fed to postpone a rate increase until next year.
The Fed raised rates by a quarter point in March and June and its current target range is now at 1.00-1.25 percent.
""The Fed didn't alter this time to the market's outlook. This time the market adjusted to the Fed's outlook,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist with Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.
The futures market implied traders saw a 73 percent chance of the Fed raising rates at its Dec. 12-13 meeting  , up from 52 percent before the Fed's latest policy statement and forecast, CME Group's FedWatch tool showed.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was modestly lower before turning higher on the Fed's forecast for one more rate hike in 2017. It was up 0.7 percent for its biggest one-day increase since Aug. 4 at 92.426.
The euro  slid 0.8 percent to $1.1894, its lowest in four sessions, while the greenback gained 0.5 percent to 112.17 yen  after touching a two-month high at 112.51 yen, Reuters data showed.
Among emerging market currencies, the Mexican peso  recovered from Tuesday's losses spurred by the second deadly earthquake to strike the country in two weeks.
The Mexican currency ended up 0.2 percent at 17.76 peso per dollar , reversing the prior day's 0.2 percent decline.
The New Zealand dollar  gained 0.6 percent to $0.7360 after reaching its highest level in 6-1/2 weeks as one poll showed the country's National Party pulled ahead of the rival Labour Party ahead of a general election this weekend. 
Support for the National Party jumped 6 points to 46 percent, according to the One News-Colmar Brunton opinion poll, while support for the opposition Labour party slumped by seven points to 37 percent.

Existing home sales declined 1.7% in August from the previous month to an annualised pace of 5.35m homes, the National Association of Realtors, said on Wednesday. Economists were expecting a 0.3% rise to 5.46m homes.
The data comes just hours ahead of the conclusion of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) two-day meeting which got underway on Tuesday amid expectations the policymaking FOMC will leave interest rates unchanged and announce plans to begin unwinding its $4.5tn bond portfolio.
As well as plans for balance sheet unwinding, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections and dot-plot are expected garner much of the attention, as investors are keen to assess whether the slowing pace of inflation has altered the central bank’s longer-term view on interest rates.
“The dollar would likely rally if the Fed were to reiterate the median expectation of another rate hike this year and three in 2018,” said Guy Stear, head of emerging markets strategy at Société Générale (PA:SOGN), in an note.
At the FOMC June meeting, the ""dot plot,"" part of the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, indicated that the central bank saw rates rising to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of the 2017.
The dot plot shows where each participant in the meeting thinks the Fed funds rate should be at the end of the year, for the next few years, and in the longer run.
Sterling was one of the main beneficiaries of the slump in dollar rising to $1.3584, up 0.61%, against the greenback, following stronger-than-expected retail sales growth in August.
Safe-haven demand, meanwhile, remained subdued capping gains in the yen and Swiss franc in the wake of President Donald Trump’s threat to “totally destroy” North Korea if America was forced to defend itself or its allies.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2017 07:38AM ET</span>",Swiss franc falls to lowest versus euro since January 2015,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell to its lowest level in over two years against the euro on Tuesday, as relative calm over North Korea eased demand for perceived safe-haven currencies.
The franc, which tends to gain in times of crisis, fell as much as half a percent to 1.1565 francs per euro in London trade (EURCHF=). That was its lowest level since Jan. 15, 2015, when the Swiss central bank dropped the franc's ""cap"" against the euro.
In a move only punctuated by short-lived spikes on geopolitical tensions, the Swiss currency has weakened more than 8 percent against the euro this year.
That prompted the Swiss National Bank last week to temper its view of the franc's over-valuation.
The central bank ditched its nearly three-year mantra that the franc was ""significantly over-valued"", saying instead that the currency remained ""highly valued"".
But analysts said the shift in language should not be taken as heralding a departure from the SNB's ultra-loose monetary policy. The central bank retained its negative interest rates.
""(The SNB is) in no rush to tighten policy, so with central banks like the ECB (European Central Bank) and the BoE (Bank of England) last week moving closer to tightening policy, that is starting to feed through some downward pressure on the Swiss franc,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist with MUFG.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>",A winning bearish dollar bet: local currency emerging markets bonds,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the best strategies to cash in on the dollar's slide since Donald Trump’s election victory is a rather exotic one: buying local emerging market currency bonds.
Investors who doubted Trump could quickly deliver promised tax cuts, big spending and better trade deals - and by doing so boost the dollar - are now reaping handsome returns from their emerging markets investments while the dollar wades near 2-1/2-year lows. 
Those investors also viewed as overdone fears that economies like Mexico would suffer from Trump's protectionism and were buying during the post-election emerging markets sell-off.
""It was what he had to say to get elected, given his space and the people he was talking to,"" said Federico Garcia Zamora, who manages the Dreyfus Emerging Markets Debt Local Currency Fund. ""But it made no economic sense,"" he said of Trump's pledges to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, build a border wall with Mexico and slap tariffs on Mexican or Chinese products.
Between the Nov. 8 presidential election and its low point on Dec. 2, JP Morgan's Emerging Market Global Bond Index <.JPMEPR> fell 6 percent, Reuters data shows. Mexican bonds suffered the most, and the peso <MXN=> hit a record low. 
""Our view was that (Trump's) economic threats were not credible,"" Garcia said. Acting accordingly, he increased his holdings of peso-denominated Mexican bonds and the fund he manages has outperformed 90 percent of its peers so far this year, according to Morningstar Direct.
Investors generally favor emerging countries' government debt issued in dollars because it eliminates the risk that their returns might get wiped out by swings in the local currency. Consequently, almost $332 billion were invested in those in mid-2017 compared to $137 billion in local currency bonds, according to research firm eVestment.
But those who stuck with the latter ended up with superior returns. 
So far this year, emerging market local currency bonds on the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index have provided a total return of 13.48 percent compared to to 7.77 percent for hard currency bonds. The U.S. aggregate bond index has returned 3.40 percent.
WEAK DOLLAR BETS
All 20 of Morningstar's top 20 highest performing emerging market funds this year have been local currency exclusive or overweight in local currency. Some of the best returns for multi-sector funds have been boosted by local currency bonds.
Reuters interviewed half of the 20 top performing funds' managers and they are sticking with those bets, convinced that the dollar will remain weak. The dollar index (DXY) is expected to end the year down more than 7 percent, its worst annual performance since the financial crisis, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists. [nL4N1LN33L]
The dollar's slide reflects both investors' disappointment with the lack of progress on U.S. economic policy and other central banks' steps to end to their ultra-loose monetary policy, which made currencies like the euro become more attractive.
David Aniloff, portfolio manager for global fixed income strategies at asset manager SEI, said doubts about Trump's agenda prompted him to gradually increase emerging markets allocations.
Aniloff said he had typically split his emerging market bond exposure 50/50 between hard and local currency bonds, but that split was most recently 65-35 in local currency bonds' favor.
“We are about as large an overweight to EM local currency bonds and currencies as we have been in several years,"" Aniloff said. SEI is among the best performing emerging market debt funds this year with data showing one fund beating 98 percent of its peers and another outperforming 97 percent.
Fund managers also say many emerging economies have bolstered their financial markets, making them more resilient during cyclical downturns and thus less risky than in the past.
""It’s a great opportunity to buy into emerging markets,"" said Ricardo Adrogue, head of emerging markets debt at Barings.
Adrogue's Emerging Markets Local Currency Debt Fund is up around 20 percent so far this year, beating 99 percent of its peers.
Kathleen Gaffney, co-manager of the Eaton Vance Multisector Income Fund, said the fund last held roughly a quarter of its assets in foreign securities. Non-U.S. currency investments - including those in Mexican, Brazilian, Indian and Indonesian local currency bonds - accounted for half of the fund's outperformance. The fund is beating 97 percent of funds in its peer group year-to-date, Morningstar's data shows.

“It’s the currencies that offer the most total return potential,"" Gaffney said.

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 08:20AM ET</span>","Bank of England dove echoes rate hike message, sterling jumps","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The prospect of British interest rates rising for the first time in 10 years grew on Friday when a Bank of England policymaker who had been its strongest advocate of ultra-low borrowing costs said rates might need to rise in the coming months.
The comments by Gertjan Vlieghe largely echoed the BoE's message a day earlier, when it surprised investors by suggesting it could raise rates as soon as at its next meeting, in November.
But coming from Vlieghe, they prompted investors to pile on bets on a rate hike, despite several false starts in recent years when the BoE has previously hinted at changes in policy only to be overtaken by changes in the economy.
Vlieghe was the first MPC member to vote for a rate cut after Britain's shock referendum decision in June 2016 to leave the European Union. In July this year, he said a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that was slightly late.
After his speech on Friday, sterling hit its highest level against the U.S. dollar since the Brexit vote, peaking at $1.3616.
""It’s been quite an incredible week for the pound, with the currency soaring across the board,"" David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB online trading said. ""An increase at the next meeting in November is now odds-on according to the markets."" 
Yields on two- and five-year British government bonds, which are sensitive to short-term speculation about rates, also hit their highest level since the Brexit vote.
Ten-year gilt yields were set for their biggest one-week jump since June 2013, with a rise of 32 basis points.
Vlieghe said that until recently, he had favored holding off on monetary policy changes, given Britain's slow economic growth and the lack of inflation pressures other than the impact of the Brexit fall in the pound.
""But the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank Rate may need to rise,"" he said.
""If these data trends of reducing slack, rising pay pressure, strengthening household spending and robust global growth continue, the appropriate time for a rise in Bank Rate might be as early as in the coming months.""
Vlieghe said there was still a risk that Brexit hits the economy harder.
""If that happens, monetary policy would respond appropriately,"" he said. ""But for now, it seems the net effect of the many underlying forces acting on the UK economy is that slack is continually being eroded and wage pressure is gently building.""
Brexit represents a major challenge for the BoE.
The fall in the value of the pound since the referendum has propelled inflation to nearly 3 percent, above its 2 percent target. But economic growth remains weak and there still remains little sign of a strong pick-up in wages.
Vlieghe said that wage growth was not as weak as earlier in 2017 and that he expected it to pick up further.
Earlier this week, official data showed Britain's unemployment rate fell to a four-decade low of 4.3 percent while inflation rose to 2.9 percent, above the BoE's 2 percent target.
HAVE CAKE AND EAT IT?
Some economists remain unconvinced that the BoE really is on the verge of its first rate hike since 2007, especially given the emphatic 7-2 vote by Monetary Policy Committee members this week to keep Bank Rate at 0.25 percent.
Allan Monks, at JP Morgan, said it was possible that the BoE wanted to prepare financial markets for a hike, after its previous, subtler warnings fell on deaf ears.
""A second explanation for the BoE’s policy inaction yesterday is that it still wants to have its cake and eat it – i.e. effectively generate some degree of tightening without actually changing rates,"" he wrote in a note to clients.

Asked about the intensification of the BoE's message this week, Vlieghe said it represented part of a year-long evolution by the central bank.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 06:08AM ET</span>",Dollar brushes off latest North Korea missile as yen dips,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded against the yen in European trade on Friday as traders quickly brushed off the latest missile fired over Japan by North Korea, after an initial dip in risk appetite across currency markets. 
North Korea fired a missile on Friday that flew over Japan's northern island of Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean, South Korean and Japanese officials said, further ratcheting up tensions after Pyongyang's recent test of a powerful nuclear bomb.
Japan is the world's largest net creditor nation, and in uncertain times traders assume Japanese repatriation of overseas funds will eclipse foreign investors' selling of Japanese assets. The yen therefore has continued to operate as a ""safe-haven"" despite Japan's geographical proximity to North Korea. 
The dollar dipped as low as 109.55 yen in Asian trading, but by 0800 GMT was up more than 1 percent above that at 110.68 yen . It was on track for its best week against the Japanese currency since November. 
The missile launch came just days after the 15-member United Nations Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea over its Sept. 3 nuclear test, imposing a ban on textile exports and capping imports of crude oil.
""The markets were – or should have been – expecting some kind of response from North Korea after the tightening of sanctions, so to that extent it was a question of when North Korea responded rather than whether they responded,"" said RBC Capital Markets currency strategist Adam Cole
""The fact they have done so doesn’t tell us anything we didn’t know... The risk is very material but I think compared with what we knew yesterday, we don’t know a lot more today,"" he added. 
The dollar was also being supported by the latest U.S. consumer inflation data, which bolstered expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates again by year-end, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. 
""U.S. rate rise expectations have risen compared with what was seen in early September, pushing up U.S. bond yields and I think that is supporting the dollar versus the yen,"" he said.
Elsewhere, sterling hit a 14-month high of $1.3350  and was heading for its best week in more than eight years on a trade-weighted basis (=GBP), with traders ratcheting up bets on a near-term interest rate hike from the Bank of England.
Sterling recorded its best day against the dollar since April on Thursday, after the BoE warned it might raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in the ""coming months"".
The euro was steady at $1.1918 <EUR=>, staying below a 2-1/2 year high of $1.2092 set last week, while the dollar index was also flat on the day (DXY). 

Bitcoin was down for an eighth consecutive day  close to $3,000 and was on track for its worst week since 2013 after a 25 percent fall since Monday, as China shut down another bitcoin exchange and as fears grew of a wider crackdown.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.05% to 92.34.
The dollar failed to capitalize on better-than-expected inflation and initial claims jobless data in the wake of a surge in sterling amid rising expectations that the Bank of England will raise rates sooner rather than later.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price index  rose 0.4% last month after edging up 0.1% in July. The uptick in consumer prices in August was the largest monthly gain in seven months and lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.9% from 1.7% in July.
In a separate report the U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims decreased by 14,000 to 284,000 in the week ended Sept. 10, confounding forecasts of a 2,000 increase.
A strong day for sterling, however, weighed on dollar sentiment, after the Bank of England kept rates unchanged but warned that interest rates were likely to rise for the first time in more than a decade in the “coming months” to curb the fast pace of inflation.
GBP/USD jumped to a one-year high of $1.3403.

The consumer price index rose 0.4% in August from a month earlier, the Labor Department said, while the annual rate of inflation rose to 1.9% from 1.7% in July.
The increase was due in large part to a surge in gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. But signs that inflation is firming could allow the Fed to proceed with plans for a third interest rate hike this year.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2017 12:10PM ET</span>","Venezuela suspends dollar auctions, blames U.S. sanctions","CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Wednesday temporarily suspended the sale of U.S. dollars through its Dicom auction system, following an announcement last week that it was moving away from the greenback in response to U.S. sanctions.
The United States in August prohibited dealings in new debt from Venezuela and state oil company PDVSA in response to the creation of a new legislative superbody that critics call the consolidation of a dictatorship.
President Nicolas Maduro last week said the crisis-stricken OPEC country would create a basket of currencies to ""free"" Venezuela from the dollar, using the Dicom auction system.
Upcoming auctions are deferred until ""the necessary adjustments are made to our system to incorporate other currencies"" and to resolve problems associated with its correspondent bank, Dicom said via its Twitter account. 
Dicom as of August was auctioning dollars for 3,300 bolivars. The system serves as a complement to the country's currency control system that provides greenbacks at 10 bolivars for essential items such as food and medicine.
Dollars on the black market now fetch 22,431 bolivars, according to website DolarToday.com, which is the principal for the black market rate.
Dicom has auctioned only $72 million since it began operations three months ago. Business leaders say this is a fraction of what companies need to pay to import goods, leaving them reliant on the black market. 
Economists say the currency controls are the primary driver of the country's economic dysfunction, which includes triple-digit inflation and chronic product shortages.

Maduro says the country is victim of an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries with the help of Washington.

Irma, which had hammered the Caribbean late last week andwas one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes, weakened to a tropical depression, easing concerns over the severity of its financial impact.
Separately, market participants seemed to shrug off North Korea’s rejection of sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council.

Core producer prices, which strip out food and energy components, rose by just 0.1%.

The euro surged to two-and-a-half-year highs against the dollar last week after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated that the bank may start tapering its massive stimulus program this autumn.
But he also said the strong euro is weighing on inflation, adding to pressure on the ECB at time when it is starting to decide how to proceed with tapering.
Sterling remained slightly weaker, with GBP/USD slipping 0.11% to 1.3268, off the one-year high of 1.3329 hit earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held on to most of its gains on Tuesday, following a sharp rebound on improving investor risk sentiment as worries over North Korea and Hurricane Irma receded.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was steady at 91.874 (DXY), after it skidded to a 2-1/2-year low of 91.011 on Friday. 
The euro was little changed at $1.1955  after shedding 0.7 percent overnight. The common currency reached $1.2092 on Friday, its highest since January 2015, as the dollar suffered a broad retreat.
Higher U.S. Treasury yields also bolstered the dollar, as the benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield (US10YT=RR) rose to 2.135 percent from its close of 2.125 percent on Monday, and 2.061 percent on Friday.
""Some people said the dollar's fall and recovery was not strange, since U.S. yields got so low,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""But the market is still sensitive to risk-off news, maybe from North Korea, or from disappointing U.S. economic data,"" he said. ""So that's why the dollar is still struggling to find its way.""
The dollar was steady at 109.39 yen  after rallying 1.4 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day surge since mid-January. It had slumped to a 10-month low of 107.320 yen on Friday, when Hurricane Irma threatened Florida and as financial markets braced for the possibility of another missile or nuclear test to mark North Korea's founding day on Sept. 9. The yen tends to benefit during times of economic and political uncertainty due to Japan's net creditor nation status.
But Pyongyang's anniversary passed without further tests, and Irma lost strength and was downgraded to a tropical storm after battering Florida over the weekend.
""Receding fear over Hurricane Irma and North Korea was a key factor behind the dollar's bounce. Market focus is likely to return to fundamentals, although there aren't many major events scheduled this week that could decide the direction for currencies,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
Major U.S. allies in Asia welcomed on Tuesday the U.N. Security Council's unanimous vote to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies to the reclusive North capped after its sixth nuclear test.
The Swiss franc, often sought in times of global risk aversion along with the yen, was flat at 0.9560 per dollar. The franc had rallied to a two-year high of 0.9421 on Friday.
The pound edged up 0.1 percent to $1.3175  after losing 0.25 percent on Monday.
Sterling fared better against the euro, brushing a fresh one-month high of 90.83 pence (EURGBP=D3), aided by speculation that the Bank of England may sound more hawkish on interest rates in defense of the currency at its policy meeting on Thursday.
The Australian dollar was 0.2 percent lower at $0.8015 , extending its retreat from a two-year peak of $0.8125 scaled on Friday.

The Chinese yuan  pulled further away from Friday's 21-month high against the dollar of 6.5432, after China's central bank on Monday lifted measures put in place to support the yuan when it came under selling pressure.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",Soaring Canadian dollar set to pull back in coming months: Reuters poll,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's dollar, which has soared over 12 percent against its U.S. counterpart since May, will give up some of those gains in coming months as the boost from Bank of Canada interest rate hikes begins to fade, a Reuters poll found on Monday.
The loonie notched its strongest level since May 2015 on Friday at C$1.2063 after the BOC surprised some investors on Wednesday with its second rate increase in three months. 
The BOC's moves have driven Canadian bond yields above their U.S. peers for the first time in about three years, adding to the loonie's allure.
However, the central bank is likely done raising interest rates this year, a Reuters poll of primary dealers showed on Thursday, though the central bank is seen charting a more aggressive tightening path for 2018 than had been anticipated earlier. 
""Just as the Bank of Canada turned on the rate hike cycle with very short notice, they could also turn it off very quickly if the currency strengthens too much,"" said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy North America at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
The Canadian dollar was seen weakening to C$1.2300 in a month from around C$1.2160 on Monday, the median forecast in a poll of over 40 foreign exchange strategists showed.
From there, the currency is expected to soften to C$1.2400 in three months before stabilizing.
""While there is scope for further (BOC) tightening (over the coming months), we would expect that it would occur at a more gradual pace,"" said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Gains for the loonie have come despite the uncertain prospects of the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, given that most of Canada's exports go to the United States.
Canadian, U.S. and Mexican officials began negotiations last month to update the trade pact. However, U.S. President Donald Trump recently said he would probably need to terminate NAFTA to get what he considers a fair trade deal.
The Canadian currency has also shrugged off recent volatility in crude oil prices, one of the country's major exports.
U.S. crude prices tumbled more than 3 percent on Friday on worries energy demand would be hit hard by Hurricane Irma, and they extended their decline early on Monday.
""In our view we are already overshooting a little bit in USD-CAD relative to what's a long term sustainable level,"" Katzive said.
His estimate of fair value for the currency is around C$1.2700.
While primary bond dealers' prevailing view in a Reuters poll was of no more BOC rate hikes in the rest of 2017, the overnight index swap market reflects traders' view of a nearly three-in-four chance of the central bank hiking again by December.
""We still think the Bank of Canada is going to move again later on in the year, but this one (a rate hike by December) is priced in,"" said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial.

""What's not priced in is a Federal Reserve hike. If we are right (and the Fed hikes in December), the U.S. dollar could make a comeback later in the year or the beginning of next year,"" he added.

The euro hit a high of 1.2092 against the dollar on Friday, the most since January 2015. Expectations that the ECB will soon announce plans to taper its bond-buying stimulus program have driven the euro up around 14% against the dollar so far this year.
But the strong euro is a headache for the ECB at time when it is considering scaling back monetary stimulus because it pushes up the price of the euro area’s exports and reduces import prices, acting as a drag on growth and inflation.
Inflation in the euro area remains sluggish and some analysts think the ECB shouldn’t move until inflation is closer to its target of just below 2%.

China's trade balance data came in at a surplus of $41.99 billion, narrower than the $48.6 billion expected for August. Imports jumped 13.3%, better than the 10% gain seen, while exports rose 5.5%, compared to a gain of 6.0% expected.
China said oil imports in August reached 33.98 million metric tons, down from 34.74 million metric tons in July.
Earlier, China reported yuan-denominated exports gained 14.4% oon year and rose 6.9% on month for an August for a trade balance surplus of CNY 286. billion.
Crude oil imports rose 12.2% to 281 million metric tons in the period.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Thursday, after data showed U.S. supplies of crude oil rose for the first time in ten weeks, as several refinery shutdowns last week due to storm Harvey lowered demand for crude.
A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week offsetting recent optimism on oil prices which has seen crude futures settle higher for three-straight days.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 4.6m barrels in the week ended Sept. 1, missing expectations of a rise of about only 4m barrels. It was the first weekly build in crude stockpiles for ten weeks.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by roughly 3.2m barrels, missing expectations of a draw of 5m barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 1.4m barrels, below expectations of a decline of 3m barrels.
The build in crude stockpiles comes after heavy flooding due to storm Harvey knocked out nearly quarter of the U.S. refining capacity last week, lowering demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
Crude-oil refinery inputs fell by 3.3 million barrels a day last week, to average 14.5 million barrels a day, while refineries operated at just 79.7% of capacity, the EIA said.
Analysts expect the fallout from storm Harvey will continue to weigh on crude stockpiles as refiners have been slow to restart operations while the end of the summer driving season is traditionally associated with a dip in crude oil demand.

Mr Draghi, however, expressed concerns over the recent rally in the euro, saying that the currency’s strength “represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its implications for the medium term outlook for price stability”. Stronger currencies usually lead to an increase in imports, which tends to weigh on the pace of inflation.
Draghi’s comments came after the ECB kept interest rates at record lows and confirmed that asset purchases would continue at least until December.

Draghi said that the ECB will decide on the “calibration” of its policy beyond 2017 later this year. He added that the bulk of the decisions about the asset purchase program will be taken in October.
The comments came at the bank's post-policy meeting press conference.
Draghi noted that the ECB is watching the euro’s volatility carefully, as it is a source of uncertainty.
He said the outlook for the euro zone economy is “broadly unchanged”, adding that a “broad-based” recovery is underway across all countries and sectors.
Despite the recovery, the euro zone still needs a “very substantial degree of monetary support”, Draghi added.
He sounded a cautious note on inflation, saying that core inflation has yet to show a convincing pickup and that headline inflation could turn negative towards the end of the year.
The ECB has raised its growth forecast for 2017 and 2018, but cut its inflation forecast for 2018 and 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro held most of its gains against a broad swathe of currencies on Thursday after the European Central Bank reaffirmed its ultra-easy policy stance, with markets shifting focus to Mario Draghi's comments at a press conference shortly.
""The statement was a controlled copy and paste from the previous one and the focus shifts to the press conference where Draghi might talk about the currency's strength,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
The European Central Bank reaffirmed its policy stance on Thursday, even keeping the door open to increasing bond purchases, dashing the possibility it would formally signal its intent to claw back stimulus from next year.
The euro was perched near the day's highs against the dollar, up 0.5 percent on the previous day at $1.1974. 
Only 15 of 66 economists polled by Reuters had expected the ECB to announce a reduction of its monthly asset purchases at Thursday's policy meeting -- a sharp reversal from a month ago when slightly over half of respondents expected such a move.
In other major policy news, Sweden's crown fell in volatile trading after its central bank said it planned to tweak its inflation-targeting regime, a move interpreted by markets as dovish.
The crown  jumped 0.5 percent against the dollar minutes before the decision but erased all gains and turned lower on the day thereafter.
The euro extended gains against the crown (EURSEK=) and settled at the day's high of 9.5450 per euro. It jumped 0.4 percent after the decision and at current levels the crown has erased all its year-to-date gains against the single currency. 
Though the dollar lifted on Wednesday, helped by relief over U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise deal with the Democrats on extending the debt limit, lingering concerns over North Korea limited the currency's upside.
Against a broad trade-weighted basket of its rivals, the dollar fell 0.5 percent lower at 91.83.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a multiyear low against the Canadian dollar on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada surprised many by raising interest rates, while rising against the safe-haven yen after President Donald Trump said he agreed with lawmakers to pass an extension of the U.S. debt limit.
The Bank of Canada (BoC) raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 1 percent after a hike in July, putting Canada ahead of the curve in returning borrowing costs to more normal levels after they were slashed due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The dollar fell as much as 1.9 percent against the loonie to C$1.2140 , its lowest level since mid-June 2015, and was last on track for its biggest percentage decline against the loonie in nearly two months. ""The market was a little bit less convinced that (the BoC) would go today,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. ""A hike wasn’t fully priced in.""
The dollar jumped more than half a percentage point against the Japanese yen to 109.39 yen <JPY=>, rising off an eight-day trough touched in early trading of 108.47 yen on the news of agreement on the debt ceiling. The greenback was last on course for its biggest one-day percentage gain against the yen in more than two weeks. 
Trump, siding with Democrats over his fellow Republicans, said he agreed with lawmakers to pass an extension of the U.S. debt limit until Dec. 15, potentially avoiding an unprecedented default on U.S. government debt.
""The biggest news, I think, was the announcement that they’re going to have a three-month deal,"" said Steven Englander, head of research and strategy at Rafiki Capital Management in New York. ""The reason the yen is responding and bond yields are responding is that it’s risk-positive.""
The euro was last roughly flat against the dollar at $1.1910 <EUR=> ahead of the outcome of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. The euro pared earlier gains against the dollar after Bloomberg reported that the central bank was unlikely to reach a decision on reducing its bond purchases before October, citing euro-area officials familiar with the matter.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last roughly flat at 92.291.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2017 03:22PM ET</span>","Dollar falls on concern about North Korea, Fed rate outlook","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on course for its biggest daily percentage decline against the safe-haven yen in more than three months on Tuesday on concern about North Korea's largest nuclear test and a Federal Reserve official's comments about low U.S. inflation.
The dollar fell as much as 1 percent against the Japanese currency to 108.65 yen, its lowest since Aug. 29 after North Korea conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test two days ago. The dollar was last set for its biggest daily drop against the yen since mid-May. 
A top North Korean diplomat warned that his country was ready to send ""more gift packages"" to the United States as world powers struggled for a response to Pyongyang's latest nuclear weapons test.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell as much as 0.5 percent to a session low of 92.183 (DXY) and was set for its biggest daily percentage decline in eight days.
The dollar fell as much as 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency, on the risks surrounding North Korea to a session low of 0.9545 franc . 
""It’s a more risk-averse picture,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York. ""North Korea accounts for most of it."" 
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said inflation was ""well short"" of target, so the Fed should be cautious about raising U.S. interest rates.
Analysts said the comments cast more doubt over the likelihood of another rate hike this year. Brainard, a permanent voting member on the Fed's monetary policy committee, has in the past convinced colleagues to delay tightening.
""Brainard sounded fairly dovish, and talked about inflation tracking lower,"" said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut. ""That does not sound like someone inclined to vote for a rate hike in December.""
The Fed has raised rates twice this year. Investors have since grown skeptical and now give a December rate hike a 27 percent probability, down from 30 percent before Brainard spoke. 

The euro gained as much as 0.4 percent to $1.1939 <EUR=> ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting. That was still below a more than 2-1/2-year high of $1.2069 touched last week. The euro gained even as analysts expect ECB policymakers might voice some concerns at the meeting about the euro's strength.

The higher fix reflects gains in the spot yuan rate from a day earlier rather than dollar movements in global markets, market participants said.
Tuesday's midpoint, which is 298 pips or 0.45 percent firmer than the previous fix, was also the biggest move in percentage terms since Aug.10. Monday's guidance was fixed at 6.5668 per dollar.

Security Council possible responding with more sanctions on Pyongyang.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract rose 0.25% to $47.41 a barrel by close of trade. Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery fell 0.49% to $52.49 a barrel.
Weekly U.S. reports on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products are due on on Wednesday and Thursday to weigh what the impact of Harvey was on supply and demand. The reports come out one day later than usual due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday.
Last week, oil prices ended a bit higher on Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as energy markets continued to weigh what the impact of Harvey will be on crude production and refinery demand in the Gulf of Mexico region.
Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline hit a two-year high above $2 a gallon on Thursday, but eased back on Friday. The September futures contract settled up 25.5 cents, or 13.5%, at $2.139 on the last day of trading in the contract on Thursday.
Gasoline for October opened much lower on Friday, at $1.774 a gallon. It ended the day down 3.1 cents, or about 1.8%, to settle at $1.747.
Despite Friday's decline, gasoline prices closed around 13.4% higher for the week.
Exactly a week after Harvey crossed the Gulf of Mexico off Port O'Connor, Texas, nearly a quarter of U.S. refining capacity has been taken offline, representing roughly 4.4 million barrels per day, weighing on demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
More than 45% of the nation’s petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The devastating impact of the storm on oil infrastructure in the heartland of the U.S. energy industry, prompted the government to tap its strategic supplies and release 1 million barrels of crude oil to support refinery activity, as fears over fuel shortages remain front and center.
Falling crude prices have weighed on U.S. drilling activity over recent weeks, as data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes showed the number of U.S. oil rigs held steady at 759 last week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
So far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.

Gold futures for December delivery ended up 0.57% at $1,329.79 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest close since September 2016.
For the week, gold prices jumped 2.46%, the largest weekly gain since February amid heightened geopolitical tensions and growing doubts over the possibility of another U.S. interest rate increase this year.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar.
The dollar initially weakened after the jobs report, which also supported metals prices. A weaker dollar makes gold futures, which are denominated in the U.S. currency, cheaper for foreign buyers.

1298,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 01:10PM ET</span>",Dollar shrugs off weak jobs report as manufacturing pmi hits 6-year high,"Investing.com – The dollar steadied against a basket of major currencies on Friday, after better-than-expected manufacturing data offset a nonfarm payrolls report that undershot expectations fuelling uncertainty as to whether the Federal Reserve will hike rates late this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.14% to 92.72.
The dollar recovered from a dip to session lows of 92.06, following data showing weakness in the US labor market. Losses in the greenback, however, were short lived as investors cheered bullish manufacturing data.
The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index in August climbed to 58.8% from 56.3% in July. That is the highest reading since April 2011.
The U.S. economy created 156,000 jobs in August, missing consensus estimates for the creation of 180,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose in August to 4.4% while average hourly earnings fell short of expectations, slowing to 0.1% from 0.3% in the prior month.
The Federal Reserve closely monitors wage growth for evidence of continuing strength in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation. The retracement in the dollar, however, suggests that investors are not overly concerned that the weak nonfarm payrolls report could deter the Fed from raising rates for a third time later this year.
Some analysts said the weak jobs report was “not weak enough” to change the Fed’s plan to hike rates at least once more this year.
“The headline number was weaker than the consensus, but not weak enough to change the Fed’s stance on rates. Also, August is notorious for statisticians to get it right and numbers are usually revised higher afterward. Investors take it with a grain of salt,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.
The rebound in the dollar pegged back the euro to session lows while sterling pared some of its recent losses against the greenback to trade higher.
EUR/USD fell 0.42% to $1.1859 while GBP/USD rose 0.20 to $1.2954.

The Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 58.8 in August from 56.3 the previous month, beating expectations for an uptick to 56.5. It was the highest reading since November 2014.
However, the University of Michigan reported that its consumer sentiment index hit 96.8 this month, down from an initial estimate of 111.0.
The reports came shortly after the U.S. Labor Department said the economy added 156,000 jobs in August, disappointing expectations for an increase of 179,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% this month from 4.3% in July, confounding expectations for an unchanged reading.
The report also showed that average hourly earnings only rose 0.1% in August, compared to expectations for a 0.2% gain.
The weak employment data was likely to lower chances of another rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December.
EUR/USD was down 0.20% to 1.1885, off session highs of 1.1980, while GBP/USD rose 0.23% to trade at 1.2958, after hitting a three-week high of 1.2996 earlier in the day.
Data on Friday showed that UK manufacturing activity unexpectedly increased in August to a four-month high.
The yen and the Swiss franc retreated, with USD/JPY up 0.21% at 110.21 and with USD/CHF gaining 0.22% to 0.9611.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow would respond harshly to U.S. measures designed to hurt it.

Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar still benefited from the previous session's data showing that the country's economy grew at the fastest pace in nearly six years in the second quarter.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 05:12AM ET</span>","Political risk climbs in NZ markets as Labour leads in poll, Kiwi dollar dented","By Charlotte Greenfield and Ana Nicolaci da Costa
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Investors in New Zealand's financial markets are suddenly having to price in political risk after a decade of stability, as a nailbiting election race looks set to trigger a shake-up of economic and monetary policy.
The New Zealand dollar slumped to a three-month low on Thursday after an opinion poll showed the opposition Labour party, had unexpectedly grabbed the lead from the incumbent National party ahead of the Sept 23 election. Labour's support has been climbing since it picked 37-year old Jacinda Ardern as its new leader last month.
""This election could have quite a dramatic impact on the economy, whereas most elections really don't,"" said Paul Dales, chief Australia and New Zealand economist at Capital Economics.
Labour's platform includes cutting net migration by more than a third from record levels of 70,000 a year to reduce strains on infrastructure. It has also proposed changing the charter of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), the nation's central bank, by ending its sole focus on inflation and adding an employment goal. 
The National party is unlikely to get enough votes to form a government without support from the smaller New Zealand First party, which also wants lower immigration and changes to the way the RBNZ manages policy.
""Given the heightened domestic political uncertainty and prospects of significant policy changes by the next government, our base case for the kiwi dollar is to trade with a negative bias ahead of the elections,"" ING's London-based foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel said in a report.
The currency had risen as far as $0.7557  in July, its highest level in more than two years, when the government's re-election for a fourth term seemed likely.
But as the race tightened, and expectations of interest rate hikes have been pushed further out, the kiwi has taken a spill.
Last month, it fell 4.5 percent against the U.S. dollar to be the worst performer amongst major currencies, and badly underperformed its Australian counterpart. The New Zealand dollar was the 11th most traded currency in the world in 2016, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Support for Labour has jumped to 43 percent, its highest since 2006, overtaking National at 41 percent, a poll commissioned by 1 News showed on Thursday.
DUAL-MANDATE?
The introduction of a dual-mandate for the central bank would be one of the biggest changes for the RBNZ since it became the first central bank in the world to introduce an official inflation target in 1989.
Analysts say a full employment mandate alongside a 1-3 percent inflation target could lead to easier monetary policy, or a slower pace of tightening. The perception of a greater tolerance of inflation could also lead to a rise in bond yields.
""From the market point of view there's uncertainty. You don't know what the overriding priority will be,"" said Don Brash, who was the RBNZ governor in 1989 and later led the National Party in opposition. ""That's going to lead to some loss of confidence in the New Zealand dollar."" 
If a shift in the central bank's mandate were to delay expected interest rate hikes, it could also feed through to the profit margins of major banks, who largely raise funding in offshore wholesale markets.
""Investors want a stable platform, they don't want to see someone come in and rock the boat too much... if someone came in disrupting that base it would make it more expensive for us to borrow money,"" said Stuart Ive, Wellington-based dealer at OM Financial.

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>",Euro slips after six months of gains; ECB eyed,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday after ending its sixth straight month of gains, as investors prepared for a European Central Bank meeting next week where policymakers are expected to discuss the impact of the currency's strength.
With only 15 out of 79 analysts in the latest Reuters poll expecting the ECB to announce a timeline for its withdrawal in bond purchase plans, the market expects the currency's strength will invite some comments from officials.
The ECB is highly unlikely to take any decision on trimming its asset purchases, which will be phased out only slowly as the euro's rapid gains against the dollar are worrying a growing number of policymakers, three sources familiar with discussions told Reuters.
""The ECB story expressing some concern about the euro strength was to manage market expectations, but we think the impact will be temporary as the currency remains a 'buy on dips' story,"" said Christin Tuxen, an FX strategist at Danske Bank.
The single currency  slipped 0.25 percent to $1.1881 on Friday. It rose for six consecutive months through August, briefly touching a 2-1/2 year high above $1.20 this week.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said the euro is expected to remain supported against the dollar as it remains undervalued compared with its peers.

1310,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 03:13PM ET</span>",Crude oil settles higher but posts nearly 6% loss in August ,"Investing.com – Crude futures settled higher on Thursday, but ended the month in negative, following concerns over an uptick in crude supplies after floods knocked out nearly a third of US oil refineries.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose $1.27 to settle at $47.23 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added $2 to trade at $52.73 a barrel.
Nearly a week after Storm Harvey first made landfall in the U.S. oil heartland of Texas, almost a third of U.S. oil refining capacity has been taken offline, representing roughly 4.4 million barrels per day.
The slew of refinery shutdowns stoked fears of a fuel shortage, forcing the U.S. government to tap its strategic oil reserves and release 500,000 barrels of crude to a working refinery in Louisiana.
Following a week of heavy selling pressure, crude prices settled nearly 6% lower in August and remain on track to post a fifth straight week of losses. The selloff in crude futures is not expected to fade over the short-term as analysts expect crude supplies to increase amid the slump in refinery activity.
“Next week’s EIA data should see large draws in products due to refinery outages, prompting large builds in oil inventories,” said John Macaluso, an analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors. About 1.4 million barrels of extra oil that “won’t be refined to fuels will be sent to storage as long as refineries are shut-in.”
Meanwhile gasoline futures spiked to a more-than-two-year high on Thursday, following a report that the largest U.S. refinery could remain offline for up to two weeks, adding to fears of a fuel shortage.
The sharp rise in gasoline prices comes a day after the Energy Information agency said gasoline inventories unexpectedly rose by roughly 35,000 barrels, missing expectations of a draw of 989,000 barrels."

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin rose to $4,726.9, up $162.3 or 3.56%, surpassing its recent all-time high of $4,644.2.
Following its recent rally, Bitcoin is set to close nearly 80% higher in August, boosting its market cap to $77.83 billion, highlighting the elevated demand for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Over the past year, Bitcoin has surged more than 400%, easily outperforming US stock benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
In other crypto-currency trade, Bitcoin Cash rose $31.36, or 5.57%, to $594.86, but remained well below its peak of $935.50 while Ethereum, added 0.42% to $387.45
Bitcoin Cash was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after a minority of bitcoin miners rejected the first part (SegWit) of a two-step software upgrade called SegWit2x – a proposal, which was adopted by the majority of bitcoin users, aimed at speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network.
Proponents of Bitcoin Cash believe that SegWit2x fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to 1-megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
The Bitcoin Cash blockchain supports an 8-megabytes block size whereas SegWit moves transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track. The second step of the SegWit2x update due later this year aims to double bitcoin’s block size to 2-megabytes.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a two-week peak against the yen and below $1.19 per euro on Thursday, a broad recovery since Tuesday helping it end August close to flat against its major peers.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin fell to $4,581.9, down $26.3 or 0.57%, just shy of its recent all-time high of $4,583.8.
Following its recent rally, Bitcoin is set to close more than 70% higher in August, boosting its market cap to $75.63 billion, highlighting the elevated demand for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Over the past year, Bitcoin has surged more than 400%, easily outperforming US stock benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
In other crypto-currency trade, Bitcoin Cash rose $30.69, or 5.80%, to $565, but remained well below its peak of $935.50 while Ethereum, added 3.44% to $385.78.
Bitcoin Cash was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after some members of the bitcoin community rejected software upgrade SegWit2x – a proposal adopted by the majority of bitcoin users aimed at speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network – following concerns that SegWit2x fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to 1-megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
Bitcoin Cash seeks to increase the block size to 8-megabytes whereas SegWit2X proposes moving transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track with plans to increase bitcoin’s block size later this year.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2017 03:54AM ET</span>",Dollar recovers from four-month low vs. yen as North Korea fears ease,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered from a four-month low against the Japanese yen on Wednesday as investors’ worries over North Korea’s latest missile test eased, boosting appetite for riskier assets. 
The yen and Swiss franc – traditionally sought at times of political or financial uncertainty – had both surged on Tuesday, with the franc hitting its strongest against the dollar in two years. 
North Korea's launch of a ballistic missile over Japan's northern island of Hokkaido had been the primary cause for a risk-off mood across markets on Tuesday, triggering a drop in U.S. bond yields and dragging down the dollar index – which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies – to a 2-1/2-year low.
The index was up 0.3 percent by 0715 GMT on Wednesday.
The recovery in the greenback had begun during Tuesday’s U.S. trading session, with data showing U.S. consumer confidence hitting a five-month high and house prices rising again. 
Some investors said risk appetite had also been helped by the response to the North Korean missile test from the U.S. administration. President Donald Trump made a statement saying that the world had received the country’s message “loud and clear” and that all options were on the table.
“Instead of the President responding to the escalation via Twitter, as has happened on many recent occasions, the White House issued an official statement to condemn the action,” said IronFX analyst Charalambos Pissouros. 
“This may have been interpreted by investors as a sign that the U.S. will approach the situation in a more measured and diplomatic manner, as opposed to raining down “fire and fury”.
The euro had benefited from broad dollar weakness on Tuesday, rising above $1.20 for the first time in 2-1/2 years, but it was back below that level on Wednesday, down 0.3 percent at $1.1944. 
The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 110.11 yen following Tuesday’s 0.8 percent slide against the currency, which tends to benefit during times of worry on the assumption that Japanese investors will repatriate funds.
While North Korea-related risks haven't gone away, the fact that the dollar managed to bounce back sharply from Tuesday's lows could lend support to the greenback in the near term, said Andrew Bresler, deputy head of sales trading in Asia-Pacific for Saxo Markets in Singapore.
""We've certainly remained pretty cautious on the outlook for risk here, and definitely not buying fully into the discounting of the North Korean tensions,"" he said.
In the wake of the sharp swings seen in the dollar against major currencies on Tuesday, it is difficult to have a clear view on the dollar's near-term outlook, Bresler said, adding that U.S. economic data would be a focus in coming days
Investors are also gauging the potential economic fallout of Tropical Storm Harvey, which brought catastrophic flooding to Texas this week and shut down nearly a fifth of the U.S's crude oil refining capacity.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2017 10:50PM ET</span>",RBNZ's Wheeler says lower New Zealand dollar needed to boost inflation; kiwi tumbles,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Governor Graeme Wheeler said on Wednesday that a lower New Zealand dollar was needed to help bolster the export sector and push up inflation, triggering a selloff in the local currency.
Policymakers have long grappled with strong demand for the New Zealand dollar, often driven by its yield appeal, with the main concern being that rapid rises could hurt exporters' margins and temper import-driven inflation. 
""The appreciation in the exchange rate has been a headwind for the tradables sector and, by reducing already weak tradables inflation, made it more difficult to reach the Bank's inflation goals,"" Wheeler said in a speech reflecting on this five-year term as governor before he steps down on Sept. 26.
The New Zealand currency  fell to $0.7241 from$0.7263, after the bank released the speech on its website.
""He reiterated that a lower New Zealand dollar is needed, that was enough to spook the market,"" said Doug Steel, senior economist at BNZ. 
Shipments have picked up pace over the past few months, thanks to a rebound in the price of dairy - New Zealand's main export earner. However, as the economy has slowed in the last quarter, policy makers have been keen to temper the currency's strength lest it undermines the trade sector.
The RBNZ is also concerned about keeping inflation moving toward the top-end of its medium term target of 1-3 percent. Annual inflation is currently running at 1.7 percent.
""A lower New Zealand dollar is needed to increase tradables inflation and help deliver more balanced growth,"" Wheeler said.
The kiwi is poised for its worst monthly fall since January 2016, fueled in part by the central bank's ramped-up rhetoric over recent weeks for a lower currency.
Investors have also sold the kiwi on speculation that the central bank could intervene in the market, though many traders have said it is nowhere near close to that step.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2017 04:05PM ET</span>",Dollar recovers from 2-1/2-year lows as North Korea fears ebb,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar turned positive against a basket of major rivals on Tuesday after touching its lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years as traders brushed aside concerns surrounding a North Korean missile launch over Japan.
The dollar, which had touched its lowest level against the yen in 4-1/2 months earlier on widespread risk aversion following North Korea's launch of a ballistic missile over northern Japan's Hokkaido island into the sea, jumped more than half a percent against the Japanese currency in afternoon U.S. trading to a 12-day high of 109.89 yen . 
The euro was last roughly flat against the greenback at $1.1980  after earlier hitting a more than 2-1/2-year high and breaking through the critical $1.20 level to $1.2069 . 
""All that Korea news you can still classify in the ‘known unknown' category,"" said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of FX strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York. ""None of it is anything the market has never seen before, so the market's capacity to bounce back from that was really high.""
He also said the U.S. stock market's recovery had calmed some of the fears that had weighed on the dollar, and that investors were beginning to turn their focus to Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls data for August.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.1 percent at 92.336 after touching its lowest since January 2015 of 91.621 earlier. 
The missile launch had in part prompted short-term speculators such as macro hedge funds to buy back yen in an unwinding of so-called carry trades, Sireen Harajli, foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho in New York, said earlier regarding the dollar's weakness. 
The dollar was last flat against the Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency, at 0.9549 franc  after touching a two-year low of 0.9431 earlier. 
""Things have kind of settled down with Korea,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""In the past, it has always been you have knee-jerk selling...but it eventually wears off.""

The euro was still being supported in part by comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last Friday, said Jalinoos of Credit Suisse. Draghi did not mention the euro's strength, which was seen as a tacit green signal to euro bulls.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin rose to $4,569.2, up $232.6 or 5.36%, surpassing its previous high of $4,489.1.
The surge in bitcoin saw its monthly gains for August reach nearly 70%, boosting its market cap to $75.40 billion, highlighting the elevated demand for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Bitcoin is one of the top performing assets, boasting gains of more than 400% over the past year.
In other crypto-currency trade, Bitcoin Cash fell $29.51, or 5%, to $551.71, moving further away from its peak of $935.50 while Ethereum, added 7.49% to $369.28.
Bitcoin Cash was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after some members of the bitcoin community rejected software upgrade SegWit2x – a proposal adopted by the majority of bitcoin users aimed at speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network – following concerns that SegWit2x fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to 1-megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
Bitcoin Cash seeks to increase the block size to 8-megabytes whereas SegWit2X proposes moving transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track with plans to increase bitcoin’s block size later this year.

Gold’s surge above $1,300 comes after recent political controversies engulfing President Donald Trump sparked concerns over his ability to deliver on tax reform, raising investor demand for safe-haven assets like gold.
Investor uncertainty over tax reform, however, is expected clear over the coming weeks after Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn reassured market participants on Friday that the president will make a major push on tax reform in a series of speeches, the first one of which gets underway in Missouri on Wednesday.

1352,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2017 06:52PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar down sharply vs yen after Nkorea missile test,"Investing.com - The dollar fell sharply against the yen on Tuesday in Asia as North Korea fired a missile across Japanese territory, putting tension on the Korean peninsula front and center.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last quoted down 0.32% to 92.17.
USD/JPY changed hands at 108.42, down 0.76% after the test, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7909, down 0.74%.
In Japan, household spending data is due with a 0.5% decline seen on month in July and a 0.7% rise on year. Unemployment data is expected to show a steady 2.8% rate in July.
North Korea fired a missile early on Tuesday from near Pyongyang that flew over northern Japan, the South Korean and Japanese governments said. The Japanese military did not attempt to shoot down the missile, which passed over Japanese territory around 6:06 a.m. time (2106 GMT).
The move by North Korea comes as tensions had eased between North Korea and the United States after weeks of threats.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to fire missiles into the sea near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam and U.S. President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang would face ""fire and fury"" if it threatened the United States.
Overnight, the dollar slumped to a more than sixteen-month low against a basket of major currencies on Monday as sentiment on the greenback remained negative, following a speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Friday while concerns over Tropical Storm Harvey’s economic implications added to downside momentum.
In what was quiet day for top-tier economic data, investors continued to focus on Yellen’s speech, in which she avoided talking about monetary policy, denting rate-hike expectations.
According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool, about 36% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike rate in December. In the U.S., fears that Storm Harvey could have overreaching economic implications, as flooding caused by the storm tore through Texas, the second largest U.S. city in GDP terms, disrupting refinery activity.
The Texas Gulf coast is home to nearly a third of U.S. refining capacity, according to Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile a surge in the euro to a 2 ½ a half year high also weighed on the greenback, as investors mulled over the possibility of the ECB tapering its quantitative easing programme at its September policy meeting next week in the wake of ECB president Draghi’s comments on Friday.
Draghi didn’t attempt to use his speech at Jackson Hole to curb the rise in the euro, suggesting that the ECB president may be less concerned than his ECB colleagues with the recent spike in the euro.
""(Draghi) does not seem to be overly concerned with the current euro levels, which is the market’s justification to move the euro higher,"" said Commerzbank (DE:DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin fell to $4,334.1, down $20.1 or 0.46%, just shy of its most recent record high of $4,489.1. At current prices bitcoin has a market cap of about $72 billion. 
Investor interest in Bitcoin remains elevated as the digital currency is one of the top performing assets, boasting gains of about 400% over the past year. 
In other crypto-currency trade, Bitcoin Cash fell 3.44% to $594.20, well below its recent peak of $935.50, adding to losses sustained last week while Ethereum, added 1.11% to $334.15.
Bitcoin Cash, was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after some members of the bitcoin community rejected software upgrade SegWit2x – a proposal adopted by the majority of bitcoin users aimed at speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network – following concerns that SegWit2x fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to 1-megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
Bitcoin Cash seeks to increase the block size to 8-megabytes whereas SegWit2X proposes moving transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track with plans to increase bitcoin’s block size later this year.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2017 11:03AM ET</span>","Dollar extends drop in wake of Yellen, Draghi comments","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped to its lowest in roughly 16 months against a basket of major currencies and a more than 2-1/2-year low against the euro on Monday, following comments from central bankers on Friday and worries over Tropical Storm Harvey. 
The greenback extended losses after tumbling on Friday after U.S. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen did not mention monetary policy at a summit of central bankers in Wyoming, moderating expectations the Fed will raise interest rates further this year.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's decision to hold back from talking down the euro at the central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, despite the currency's double-digit gains this year, continued to weigh on the dollar and sent the euro to $1.1963 Monday , its strongest against the greenback since January 2015. 
The dollar also weakened after Tropical Storm Harvey paralyzed Houston, Texas, the nation's fourth-biggest city, spurring worries about the storm's potential impact on the U.S. economy. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, hit its lowest since May 2016 of 92.369 (DXY). 
""In general, what you’re seeing is a consistent tone of dollar weakness,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. 
""The disappointment from Yellen at Jackson Hole on Friday has carried over to trading this week,"" Lien said, adding that Draghi's remarks continued to underpin the euro while the impact of Harvey was weighing slightly on the greenback. 
A public holiday in global foreign exchange capital London kept the market subdued. While hitting multi-month lows, the dollar index was last down only 0.4 percent and the euro was up just 0.2 percent. 
The euro was broadly expected to remain firm in the short-term as investors focused on the ECB and whether it will announce plans to reduce debt-buying at its September policy meeting next week. 
""(Draghi) does not seem to be overly concerned with the current euro levels, which is the market’s justification to move the euro higher,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt. 

The greenback was last down slightly against the yen at 109.27 yen <JPY=> after touching an eight-day high on Friday of 109.84 yen. Investors awaited Friday's August U.S. non-farm payrolls report for further trading incentives.

1368,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 25, 2017 02:04PM ET</span>","Bitcoin sets sight on $5,000 as rally continues","Investing.com – Bitcoin rallied on Friday, nearing its all-time high from a week ago, as investors shrugged off fears the cryptocurrency faces a period of correction. 
On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin rose to $4,416, up $188.1 or 4.45%, less than $100 shy of its most recent record high of $4,489.1. At current prices bitcoin has a market cap of about $73 billion. 
The rise in Bitcoin comes after it fell to a nearly two-week low of $3,600 earlier this week, amid fears that the cryptocurrency was set for a period of consolidation.
Investor interest in Bitcoin remains elevated as the digital currency is one of the top performing assets, boasting gains of over 400% over the past year, buoyed by growing demand from Asia. 
Earlier this year, the Japanese government fully legalized Bitcoin as an official currency, expanding the digital currency reach to a wider range of users, as major retailers backed the new law.
Meanwhile in Vietnam, news reports suggested that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved a plan that could see the country formally recognize bitcoin as a form of payment by 2018.
In other crypto-currency trade, Bitcoin Cash rose 1.11% to $635, well below its recent peak of $935.50 on Saturday while Ethereum, added 4.15% to $334.15.
Bitcoin Cash, was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after some members of the bitcoin community rejected software upgrade SegWit2x – a proposal adopted by the majority of bitcoin users aimed at speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network – following concerns that SegWit2x fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to 1-megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
Bitcoin Cash seeks to increase the block size to 8-megabytes whereas SegWit2X proposes moving transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track with plans to increase bitcoin’s block size later this year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.63% to 92.64.
Fed chair Janet Yellen offered no insight into the central bank’s thinking on future monetary policy or the timing of its balance sheet unwinding, sparking uncertainty as to whether the central bank will raise rates for a third time later this year.
Yellen’s speech came a few hours after data showed durable goods orders in July undershot economists’ expectations.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, fell 6.8% in July, the Commerce Department said on Friday, missing expectations of just a 6% decline.
The decline in the greenback fueled sharp moves higher in both sterling and the euro.
EUR/USD rose 0.68% to $1.1880 while EUR/GBP rose 0.05% to 0.9223, ahead of speech by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi at Jackson Hall at 3pm EDT.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was buoyant against the yen on Friday as some participants bought back the currency to square positions ahead of a meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
While Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi are expected to stay on script in speeches later in the day, investors are hungry for any clues on further U.S. rate rises, the timing of its balance sheet tapering and whether Europe is still looking to rein in stimulus.
Yellen is due to give a speech at 1400 GMT and Draghi will speak at 1900 GMT.
The U.S. currency was a shade firmer at 109.640 yen  after gaining 0.5 percent overnight.
The greenback was poised to end 0.3 percent stronger against the yen on the week, during which it had slipped to as low as 108.635 yen on geopolitical tensions stemming from the Korean Peninsula.
Investors' focus for the time being has shifted from geopolitics and political turmoil in Washington to monetary policy.
""The theme at Jackson Hole this year is 'fostering a dynamic global economy' and as such a general title suggests, the market may not get the immediate hints on interest rates it is eager to hear,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
But as a precaution some speculators appeared to have bought back the dollar before Jackson Hole, resulting in the dollar/yen's rise, Ishizuki said.
Price data from Japan highlighted what could be a major topic of discussion at the central bankers' gathering: why are inflationary pressures remaining so stubbornly weak despite a seemingly synchronized global economic recovery?
Japan's core consumer prices inched up for a seventh straight month in July from a year earlier, but the gain was a tepid 0.5 percent and driven largely by higher fuel bills. The yen showed little reaction.
The euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.1796  following a subdued overnight session, during which it was bound to a tight $1.1818-1.1784 range. It was on track to end the week with a 0.3 percent gain.
The common currency awaited ECB Draghi's speech, though most market watchers expect he will drop few hints before the central bank's next policy review on Sept. 7, when some expect he will announce plans to start reducing stimulus. 
The euro has gained nearly 14 percent against the dollar this year and some observers were focusing on whether Draghi would choose to talk down the currency's strength.
""Surprises from Jackson Hole, if any, would probably come from Yellen rather than Draghi, and any impact on the euro would come from moves in the dollar,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""Market expectations for a December Fed rate hike have sunk quite low and there is room for improvement.""
Fed funds futures implied that traders saw a 42 percent probability of the Fed raising interest rates at its December meeting, down from around 50 percent early in July.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood little changed at 93.299 (DXY) after nudging up 0.15 percent overnight on the back of a rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were both steady at $0.7900  and $0.7210 , respectively.

The kiwi took a hit this week after the New Zealand government downgraded the country's growth outlook for this fiscal year and next. It fell to a two-month low of $0.7192 on Thursday.

1385,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 08:26AM ET</span>",Bitcoin ticks higher in rangebound trade,"Investing.com - The price of the digital currency bitcoin ticked higher on Thursday, but gains were held in check in rangebound trade.
On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin touched a high of $4,216.2 and was at $4,160.9 by 08:21 AM ET (12:21 GMT) having opened at $4,135.0.
Since setting its most recent all-time high of $4,489.1 on Aug.17, prices have pulled back and at current prices bitcoin has a market cap of about $69 billion.
The pullback has prompted speculation that bitcoin's rally – which saw the digital asset quadruple in value this year – might be reaching its peak.
Meanwhile, the price of the new bitcoin offshoot, Bitcoin Cash was lower. It touched a low of $635.00 and was last at $636.00, having opened at $677.43.
It rose as high as $935.50 on Saturday, the highest level in its three-week history and an increase of almost 400% from its low of $210 on its first day of trading.
The price of the bitcoin alternative rallied after the bitcoin cash blockchain showed it could handle the higher transaction capacity for which it was built.
At current prices, bitcoin cash has a total market capitalization of around $10.6 billion, making it the third most valuable cryptocurrency.
Elsewhere in cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, was up 3.24% to $326.58, while Ripple added 14.7% to trade at 26 cents.
The price of Ripple is still holding below its all-time high of 33 cents, set on May 24.

GBP/USD was up 0.16% to 1.2823 by 07:10 AM ET (11:10 GMT) from around 1.2805 earlier.
Sterling initially edged lower after the Office for National Statistics reported that gross domestic product was unrevised from a preliminary estimate at 0.3% quarter-over-quarter and 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.
The service sector was the only positive contributor to GDP growth, increasing by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter.
The report showed that household spending increased by just 0.1% in the three month to June, down from 0.4% in the first quarter.
Business investment was flat during the quarter after a 0.6% increase in the first quarter.
""GDP growth has slowed markedly in the first half of the year,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said. ""Household spending grew weakly, with the lower-value pound hitting household budgets.""
Another report showed that UK retail sales growth fell to its lowest since since July 2016 this month.

Sterling has been pressured lower by uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the deteriorating outlook for the economy.
On a trade weighted basis, sterling remained weaker. The UK Pound Sterling Index ticked up 0.27% to 74.8, but remained close to the trough of 74.6 set on Wednesday, which was the lowest level since November."

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",Investors bullish Asia; long yuan positions at near three-year highs: Reuters poll,"By Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - Investors positioned themselves for further gains in Asian currencies against the dollar on expectations the U.S. currency will soften further in the coming months, a Reuters Poll showed on Thursday.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, has fallen about 8.9 percent this year on issues such as escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea, worries over President Donald Trump's ability to deliver on his proposed economic reforms, and Federal Reserve policy. [USD/]
Uncertainty over the dollar may explain why investors have raised their long positions on most Asian currencies, as shown in the Reuters poll of 13 analysts, traders and fund managers.
Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan <CNY=CFXS> were maintained at three-year highs. The currency has gained about 4.1 percent this year, underpinned by the central bank's guidance of the daily trading band and controls on capital outflows. [CNY/]
Investors remained positioned for the Indian rupee <INR=IN> to gain against the dollar. The rupee has been underpinned by foreign inflows into the country's equities on expectations of easier monetary policy and improving economic growth.
The rupee has gained about 5.7 percent against the dollar so far in 2017.
Investor positions on the Thailand baht <THB=TH> were also bullish. Thailand’s economy grew at its fastest for more than four years in the second quarter of 2017, thanks to stronger exports and tourism in a recovery that is gaining momentum.
On the other hand, bearish positions in the Philippine peso <PHP=PDSP> rose to more than 9 month highs. The peso hit an 11-year low against the dollar earlier this month, extending a more than 2-month slide caused by the country’s rising trade deficit.
A government-driven infrastructure drive has seen a surge in capital goods imports in the Philippines, and accounted for a sizeable portion of a $13.2 billion trade deficit in the first half of the year, putting the country on track for its first annual current account deficit in 15 years.
Long positions on the South Korean won <KRW=KFTC> fell to their lowest in more than a month, as political tensions between the United States and North Korea took their toll.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 04:01AM ET</span>",Dollar steadies ahead of Jackson Hole meetings,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Thursday after another politically-driven slide against the euro and yen, helped by nerves over what message Federal Reserve policymakers will send during meetings in Jackson Hole starting later in the day.
The dollar's 14 percent decline against the euro this year has come courtesy of a collapse in expectations for tax cuts and other pro-growth moves by the Trump administration that weaken the case for further rises in Fed interest rates. 
But the U.S. central bank remains the only of the world's big monetary authorities to have begun raising rates and it is also seeking to rationalize the huge stores of securities it has built while pumping cash into the economy in the past 8 years. 
Any harder signal on that issue from Fed chair Janet Yellen when she speaks on Friday would be liable to help the greenback. The U.S. currency gained around 0.2 percent in early deals in Europe, trading at $1.1792 per euro. 
""The market is short dollars already and from a risk-reward point of view, it makes sense to close some of those positions, just in case Yellen said something hawkish,"" said Jane Foley, a strategist with Rabobank in London.
The dollar also rose around a quarter of a percent to 109.31 yen  and 0.2 percent against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. (DXY)
That was still just a minimal recovery from losses since President Trump on Tuesday suggested that a shutdown of the government was possible and threatened to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
His remarks, made ahead of a debate in Congress over a spending package and a rise in the debt ceiling, also prompted Fitch Ratings to warn about the impact on the government's credit rating.
Congress will have about 12 working days, when it returns on Sept. 5 from summer break, to approve spending measures to keep the government from shutting. Also, a deadline is nearing for raising the cap on how much the federal government may borrow.
In June, the Congressional Budget Office said Congress needs to raise the debt limit by early to mid-October to avoid a default.
Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore, said it was unclear whether Trump's comments were a negotiation tactic or constitute a real threat that could lead to a government shutdown.
""We have to think a bit harder about the downside risks of the dollar, especially against the safe havens,"" Sim said.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin touched a high of $4,246.4 and was at $4,233.5 by 06:05 a.m. ET (10:05 GMT) having opened at $4,086.9. It fell to a low of $3,600.00 on Tuesday before recovering to close up 1.79% at $4,074.0.
Since setting its most recent all-time high of $4,489.1 on Aug.17, prices have pulled back and at current prices bitcoin has a market cap of about $69 billion.
The pullback has prompted speculation that bitcoin's rally – which saw the digital asset quadruple in value this year – might be reaching its peak.
Meanwhile, the price of the new bitcoin offshoot, Bitcoin Cash was lower. It touched a low of $654.00 and was last at $661.1, having opened at $686.12.
It rose as high as $935.50 on Saturday, the highest level in its three-week history and an increase of almost 400% from its low of $210 on its first day of trading.
The price of the bitcoin alternative rallied after the bitcoin cash blockchain showed it could handle the higher transaction capacity for which it was built.
At current prices, bitcoin cash has a total market capitalization of around $11 billion, making it the third most valuable cryptocurrency.
Elsewhere in cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, was up 2.77% to $323.3, while Ripple added 9.35% to trade at 27 cents.
The price of Ripple is still holding below its all-time high of 33 cents, set on May 24.
Ripple has risen around 60% in the last three days with most of the trading volume – more than $2 billion in the last 24 hours – occurring on exchanges that offer Korean won trading pairs, according to coindesk.com.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dipped 0.1% to 93.33 by 04.16 a.m. ET (08.16 a.m. GMT).
The euro gained ground, with EUR/USD rising 0.19% to 1.1782 after survey data showing that a strong performance from the euro zone manufacturing sector this month offset slower growth in services.
The euro showed little reaction to a speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi in which he defended unconventional monetary policy and said that central banks should continue preparing for new challenges.
The speech came ahead of his appearance at the annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole on Friday. Draghi is not widely expected to deliver any new policy message in his speech despite speculation over how soon the central bank plans to start scaling back its stimulus program.
The dollar was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY slipping 0.16% to 109.39, still holding above last week's low of 108.59, which was the weakest level in four months.
The dollar came under pressure against the Japanese currency overnight following remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump, who raised the prospect of a government shutdown.
Speaking at a rally Trump referred to his vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border saying, ""If we have to close down the government, we are building that wall.""
Trump also warned that he might terminate the NAFTA trade treaty with Canada and Mexico after first round talks aimed at revamping the trade pact ended with few signs of progress.
The greenback has weakened recent sessions amid renewed investor concerns about the Trump administration's ability to deliver on its economic policy agenda.
Persistent doubts about the prospects for a third interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year have also fed into dollar weakness.
Lower rates typically weigh on the dollar by making U.S. assets less attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Market participants were awaiting comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen at Jackson Hole on Friday for clues on how policymakers view the economy. Some investors believe Yellen may make the case for a third rate hike this year.
The euro rose to fresh 10-month highs against the broadly weaker sterling, with EUR/GBP climbing 0.38% to 0.9207.
The pound was also lower against the greenback, with GBP/USD down 0.2% to 1.2797.
Sterling has been pressured lower by growing expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates on hold in the coming months amid concerns over the economic impact from Brexit.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar edged down against the yen on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the specter of a government shutdown to fulfill a campaign pledge, but overall moves among major currencies were limited ahead of this week's Jackson Hole global central bankers' conference.
At a rally with his supporters in Phoenix, Trump referred to his vow to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border and said, ""If we have to close down the government, we are building that wall."" 
In wide-ranging comments, he also signaled the possible termination of the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada to jumpstart negotiations, and said the standoff with North Korea over its weapons programs might have taken a positive turn.
The dollar was last off slightly on the day at 109.53 yen  after touching a low of 109.37, down from around 109.67 before Trump's statement and below an earlier session high of 109.83 yen. 
But it remained well above a four-month low of 108.605 yen set late last week. 
""It was not a big move, and it has mostly retraced, but the market seems to have taken Trump's comments as negative for the dollar,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust.
""Investors are focusing much more on the upcoming Jackson Hole conference than on anything Trump is saying today,"" she said, ""particularly since there are many weeks remaining before the government shutdown issue would risk becoming critical.""
The U.S. government is bumping up against its debt ceiling, with the possibility that it will be unable to pay all its bills in October and face a shutdown unless Congress approves an increase in its borrowing capacity by the end of next month. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat on the day at 93.513 (DXY), after it gained 0.5 percent in the previous session.
The dollar rose on Tuesday as the euro was weighed down by a weaker-than-expected reading on German investor confidence. Position-squaring ahead of the gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Thursday and Friday also supported the dollar, analysts said.
""Ahead of Jackson Hole...investors have started to reduce their short dollar positions,"" said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy for United Overseas Bank in Singapore. Investors are awaiting speeches from Fed Chair Janet Yellenand European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Friday in Jackson Hole, though neither is expected to announce new policy messages.
Draghi is also due to give a speech in Germany later on Wednesday. 
The euro eased slightly to $1.1760 , staying on the defensive after shedding 0.5 percent on Tuesday.

A survey out on Tuesday showed a steeper-than-expected drop in German investor morale in August, dragging on the euro.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar on Tuesday, retracing most of its overnight gains as a broadly resurgent greenback prompted investors to square positions in a thin market before a central bank conference this week.
The single currency  slipped 0.6 percent against the greenback to $1.1750, retracing most of its overnight gains when it posted its biggest single day rise so far this month. 
""Our bias in these thin markets is to sell the euro on rallies against the dollar as we think underlying positioning is still quite stretched,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.
Friday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is among the set-piece events at the Jackson Hole symposium, where remarks by his Federal Reserve counterpart Janet Yellen on the same day will be the main focus.
With speculative bullish bets on the euro still near its biggest in five years, according to latest positioning data, some investors think the euro's strength may likely fade given the central bank's recent cautious stance about the currency. 
Since hitting a 2-1/2 year high near $1.1910 in early August, the common currency has lost some steam, as investors took on board the cautious tone struck by ECB policymakers revealed in the minutes of their July meeting.
Draghi will refrain from delivering a new policy message, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters last week, tempering any expectations for the ECB to start charting the course out of its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme.
""The euro has become slightly vulnerable after the recent rise and unless Draghi comes out and says anything significant, we expect the currency to remain under pressure,"" said Piotr Matys, an FX strategist at Rabobank in London.
The euro's losses were also exacerbated by a broad bounce in the dollar against most of its rivals in mid-morning trades.
It hopped 0.4 percent (DXY) higher against a trade-weighted basket of its currencies on Tuesday. The sterling fell to a six-week low against the dollar .

Bitcoin’s blockchain split into two on August 2, after members of the bitcoin community rejected the first part of the SegWit2x upgrade, creating a competing cryptocurrency currency called ‘Bitcoin Cash’.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday, extending its biggest weekly decline in more than two months as markets judged the single currency's double-digit gains this year may be too much for a central bank that is still wary of removing stimulus.
The single currency fell 0.17 percent to $1.1740 against the U.S. dollar, after weakening 0.5 percent last week, its biggest weekly decline since June. 9, according to Reuters data. (Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)
It is still up more than 11 percent so far this year, making it the best performing currency in the G10 currency universe.
""Absent some Mario Draghi fireworks this week, buying on dips for euro/dollar may be a better strategy rather than chasing the euro higher at these levels,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will not deliver a new policy message at a Fed conference in Jackson Hole this week, two sources familiar with the situation have said, tempering expectations for the ECB to start charting the course out of stimulus.
But traders are not taking any chances. About $45 billion of euro-dollar currency options on the exchange rate will expire in the three days leading up to the Wyoming meeting.
With markets hemmed in tight ranges and the lack of any top tier data this week, the dollar index (DXY) drifted higher to 93.56 on Monday with latest positioning data showing speculators reducing their bearish bets against the greenback. <0#NETUSDFX=>
Investors cut short dollar bets, particularly against the Japanese yen with positioning seen stretched before Janet Yellen's speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole conference.
""With the market now short-USD and with market participants knowing that the preponderance of positions is short-USD, the pace of downward movement almost invariably had to slow,"" BMO strategists wrote in a weekly note.

1437,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2017 09:38AM ET</span>",Bitcoin Cash soars more than 100% to record high above $900,"Investing.com - Bitcoin Cash prices rose sharply on Sunday, jumping to a record high above the $900-level, amid optimism that faster transactions times will speed up the spread of the cryptocurrency.
According to market participants, over half of Bitcoin Cash’s transaction volume was made on trading exchanges in South Korea, such as Bithumb and Coinone.
Bitcoin Cash was last at $774.00 by 9:35AM ET (1335GMT), up about 106.4%, or $398.96.
It touched $935.50 earlier, the highest the Bitcoin offshoot has ever traded in its less than three weeks of history and an increase of almost 400% from its low of $210 on its first day of trading.
The surge means that the total market cap of Bitcoin Cash has now reached around $13 billion, making it the third-largest digital currency after Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The rapid price rise has made it more profitable for miners to mine Bitcoin Cash as opposed to the original Bitcoin.
Prices of the original Bitcoin slumped around 6%, or $250, to $4,087.70, continuing its retreat from last week's all-time peak of $4,489.10.
It fell to a low of $3,951.30, amid growing investor concerns that the digital currency could face a second split in November.
Bitcoin’s blockchain split into two earlier this month, after members of the bitcoin community rejected the first part of the SegWit2x upgrade, creating a competing currency called ‘Bitcoin Cash’.
The most important difference between the two coins is that Bitcoin Cash allows for faster transaction times by using custom block sizing.
Bitcoin Cash has a block size with an 8-megabyte transaction limit. Bitcoin transactions on the other hand are limited to 1-megabyte every 10 minutes.
Elsewhere in cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum was down almost 3.5% to $292.53. It has the second-largest market capitalization among cryptocurrencies at nearly $28 billion.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.22% to 93.42.
U.S. political drama remained front and centre on Friday, after Donald Trump told aides he has decided to remove Steve Bannon from his post as chief White house advisor, according to a White House official.
""White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
The latest twist in the U.S. political saga comes on the back of growing concerns that recent controversies engulfing U.S. President Donald Trump could derail the president’s ability to push through his pro-growth agenda.
Losses in the greenback, however, were capped as a preliminary reading for consumer sentiment data for August topped expectations adding to narrative of a strengthening U.S. economy.
The consumer sentiment index, a survey of consumers by The University of Michigan, rose to 97.6 in August. Economists estimated the index would climb to 94 from the 93.4 reading in July.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen was the major mover among the G10 group of developed world currencies on Friday, gaining another half percent against the dollar as nerves over stock market valuations and the future of an 8-year global rally seeped into other assets.
The euro had recovered all of the ground it lost after European Central Bank policymakers warned of an overshoot in the currency in the minutes from last month’s policy meeting, to trade 0.2 percent higher at $1.1748. <EUR=>
Concerns over President Donald Trump's ability to push through the pro-growth measures financial investors had expected at the start of this year were at the heart of a second daily 1 percent loss for Wall Street on Thursday. 
That drove flows into the traditional security of the yen and the Swiss franc, with nerves around another attack claimed by Islamic State, this time in Barcelona, feeding into the shaky mood.
Despite a recovery in the last fortnight, the dollar index that measures its broader strength against a basket of currencies is still just 1 percent above 13-month lows hit at the start of August. 
""With President Trump’s support from both within and outside of the White House waning, the uncertain US political environment is likely to keep the dollar pinned down at these low levels,"" said Viraj Patel, a strategist with ING in London.
""It is difficult to find any other domestic catalyst to more than offset this negative factor and drive the dollar higher in the near term.""
By 0718 the yen was trading 0.5 percent higher at 109.04 yen per dollar. The dollar index (DXY) fell 0.2 percent to 93.472.
The yen often comes into favor in times of market stress, partly due to expectations that Japanese investors will eventually repatriate their overseas assets if such market turmoil persists.
How European and U.S. equity markets fare on Friday could prove crucial for the dollar's near-term outlook against the yen, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""There is the risk that the yen might keep edging higher,"" he said. 
""If the dollar falls below 109 yen, that could set the stage for a test of its year-to-date low of 108.13 yen,"" he added, referring to a trough the dollar hit in mid-April.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended Aug. 12, the Labor Department said. That beat economists’ forecasts of a just 4,000 decline. 
On the manufacturing front, the Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia said that its Philly Fed manufacturing index rose to a seasonally adjusted 18.9 for August, compared with consensus estimates of 18.5. 
The rebound in the dollar came after it slumped to session lows on Wednesday, as sentiment on a third rate hike later this year soured, after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting indicated Fed members were divided on the outlook for inflation and monetary policy tightening. 
Meanwhile, EUR/USD fell to a three-week low of $1.1662, after minutes from the ECB’s July policy meeting showed officials warned that the recent surge in the euro could hamper the central bank’s efforts to get inflation closer to its target of below, but close to, 2%.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin touched a high of $4,489.1. It was last at $4,409.0, up $51 or 1.17%.
Since setting its most recent all-time high of $4,430 on Aug.15, prices have fluctuated in a range of $4,000 to $4,200.
Bitcoin has more than quadrupled in value so far this year and has gained around 55% in August. The surge means that the total market cap of bitcoin has now risen to around $73 billion.
Bitcoin has rallied to a series of record highs amid optimism that a software update designed to improve the coin's scalability and make it faster to process transactions will speed up the spread of the cryptocurrency.
New software called Segregated Witness, or SegWit was successfully adopted by the blockchain supporting bitcoin last week.
The software was developed as a solution to the cryptocurrency’s scaling problem, which led to a split or so-called ‘hard fork’ on August 1 when the blockchain supporting bitcoin split into two, creating Bitcoin Cash.
Meanwhile, Australia announced plans on Thursday to regulate digital currencies, including bitcoin.
The move will bring digital currency providers under the remit of Austrac, the government's financial intelligence agency.
Australia’s move to regulate cryptocurrencies follows a similar decision by Japan.
Tokyo’s decision to regulate bitcoin followed the 2014 bankruptcy of Mt Gox, the world’s largest virtual currency exchange.
By regulating the currency, Japan officially recognized bitcoin as a legal method of payment. Analysts say this has helped the price of bitcoin surge to record highs.
Elsewhere in cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, was up 2.65% to $307.87.
Bitcoin Cash, the newly created offshoot of bitcoin, was up 1.08% at $300.3, while Ripple lost 0.53% to trade at 15 cents.

EUR/USD touched a low of 1.1662, the weakest since July 27 and was last at 1.1700.
Policymakers believed there was a risk that the euro could ""overshoot"", the meeting minutes showed, after it rose to two-and-a-half year highs against the dollar in recent months.
“While most of the recent gyrations in prices of financial assets were down to the region’s economic recovery, “concerns were expressed about a possible overshooting in the repricing by … markets, notably the foreign exchange markets, in the future,” the minutes said.
“It was underlined that the still favorable financing conditions could not be taken for granted and relied to a considerable extent on a continued high degree of monetary policy support.”
The minutes cited two factors in the euro's rise, the first being the removal of political risk following the election of Emmanuel Macron as France’s president. The second factor was market expectations over U.S. interest rates.
Last month the ECB held interest rates and asset purchases steady, amid speculation that it will start to scale back its ultra-loose monetary policy in the autumn.
The euro was also lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP losing 0.41% to trade at 0.9090, off Wednesday’s 10-month peaks of 0.9142.
The euro had weakened following reports on Wednesday that ECB President Mario Draghi will not deliver any fresh monetary policy message in his speech at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole conference later this month.
Anticipation had been building ahead of the speech, which is due to take place on Aug. 25 amid expectations that Draghi would signal a shift in ECB policy. In his last speech in Jackson Hole in 2014, Draghi laid the groundwork for the ECB's quantitative easing program."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro on Thursday rose towards 2 1/2-year highs against the dollar seen earlier this month on bets that euro zone officials will embark on a gradual unwinding of their massive policy stimulus while U.S. policymakers looked increasingly wary.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve's July 25-26 meeting showed some members called for halting interest rate hikes until it was clear a softening inflation trend was transitory, but it also indicated the Fed was poised to begin reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of bonds.
Even though the euro stumbled on Wednesday after sources signaled European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi would not use his Jackson Hole appearance to signal policy change by the bank, investors remain bullish about the currency's outlook.
""Most investors are still relatively underinvested in the euro and that unwinding is still going on while structural factors such as the current account surplus for the euro zone is a strong support for the currency,"" said James Binny, EMEA head of currency, State Street Global Advisors based in London. 
The single currency was trading slightly higher at $1.1763 in early trades, nearing a 2-1/2 year high of $1.1910 hit earlier this month.
The euro has gained 12 percent so far this year against the dollar and is the best performing currency in the G10 FX space with most of its gains coming in recent months on growing bets that the ECB will start unwinding its massive policy stimulus.

The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, fell near its lows of the day following the announcement from Trump via Twitter.
""Right now it seems like (the dollar’s slide) is coinciding with Trump’s announcement that he’s disbanding the council, another hit to administration, weighing on market sentiment and leading investors to sell more dollars because dollar has had a very difficult time extending gains ahead of the FOMC,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of BK Asset Management. ""The timing seems to indicate this is the primary driver.""

The dollar turned negative against the yen <JPY=>, euro <EUR=> and Swiss franc , having earlier touched weekslong highs against each.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin rose to $4314.0, up $242 or 5.94%, just shy of its all-time high of $4,430.9 achieved on Tuesday.
The developers behind Segwit2x – a software upgrade to increase the transaction capacity of the blockchain supporting bitcoin – expect the software upgrade to take effect in November this year, according to a draft post on a website related to the project. 
""During the month of November 2017, approximately 90 days after the activation of Segregated Witnesses in the Bitcoin blockchain, a block between 1MB and 2MB in size will be generated by bitcoin miners in a move to increase network capacity.” 
The rally in Bitcoin could come under pressure, however, as there is a possibility of yet another split in Bitcoin in November, when second phase SegWit is expected to be implemented.
Bitcoin Cash mirrored Bitcoin’s move higher, rising 1.17% to $303.50 while Ethereum, rose by 6.95% to $302.

Housing starts dropped 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
The unexpected dip in housing starts, however, didn’t deter investor expectations of a rate hike later this year. According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool, nearly 50% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates in December, compared to just 37% last week.
Renewed optimism for a third rate hike comes ahead of the minutes from the Federal Reserve July meeting due later in the session.
At its July policy meeting, the fed kept its benchmark rate unchanged, citing concerns over the slowdown in inflation but said it expects to begin tapering its massive $4.5tn balance sheet “relatively soon”.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a three-week high on Wednesday against a trade-weighted basket of its rivals as strong U.S. retail sales data boosted risk appetite, though markets were wary of chasing gains due to lurking geopolitical risks.
""The North Korea missile fears seems to be abating for now and if the recent bunch of strong U.S. data translates into higher inflation, then markets will start pricing more interest rate increases from the Fed in the coming months,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
The dollar index (DXY) edged higher to 93.86 and was consolidating most of its overnight gains when it hit its highest level since July 26 at 94.14 in the previous session.
U.S. retail sales jumped 0.6 percent in July, handily beating economists' estimate of a 0.4 percent reading, to post their biggest gain in seven months as consumers bought more cars and increased discretionary spending.
But despite the strong data, interest rate expectations remain broadly unchanged with markets expecting the Federal Reserve to raise rates only once over the next 12 months, according to the CME's Fedwatch tool.
Easing fears of armed conflict between the United States and North Korea also prompted investors to buy back riskier assets they had sold last week as fiery rhetoric between the two countries escalated.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists were wary about reading too much into the dollar's overnight bounce, pointing out that economic data from other countries such as Sweden and Japan have been robust, indicating further dollar gains may be slow.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.6% last month. That was the largest gain in seven months, ending four-consecutive months of lower than expected growth.
Also lifting sentiment on the dollar were comments from Bill Dudley on Monday, the New York Fed chief who is seen as an influential voice on the central bank’s policy-setting committee. Mr Dudley said he would favour a third rate hike this year, even as Wall Street expectations for such a move have dipped below 50%.
Meanwhile, safe-haven jitters continued to ease, as North Korean state media reported Tuesday that leader Kim Jong Un had delayed a decision on firing missiles towards the U.S. pacific territory of Guam, suggesting that his earlier threats were rhetorical.
In the wake of cooling tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, demand eased for safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, prompting the dollar to claw back recent losses.
USD/CHF rose to 0.9726, up 0.12% while USD/JPY rose 0.76% to Y110.47.
GBP/USD fell 0.76% to $1.2866, following data showing UK inflation undershot economists’ forecasts, cooling expectations the Bank of England would look at tapering its loose monetary policy measures sooner rather than later.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin was last at $4,065.7, down $176.5 or 4.41%. It earlier set a fresh all-time high of $4,430.0.
Bitcoin has more than quadrupled in value so far this year and has gained around 42% in August.
The surge means that the total market cap of Bitcoin has now risen to around $67 billion.
Bitcoin has rallied to a series of record highs in recent sessions amid optimism that faster transactions times will speed up the spread of the cryptocurrency.
New software called Segregated Witness, or SegWit was successfully adopted by the blockchain supporting Bitcoin last week.
The software was developed as a solution to the cryptocurrency’s scaling problem, which led to a split or so-called ‘hard fork’ on August 1 when the blockchain supporting Bitcoin split into two, creating Bitcoin Cash.

Consumer prices rose 2.6% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly below economists' expectations for a 2.7% annual rise.
Falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food, the ONS said.
Excluding oil prices and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation rose by 2.4% from a year earlier, compared with economists' expectations for 2.5%.
The retail price index, the level used by the government to set rail fare increases, rose by an annualized 3.6% in July, up from 3.5% in the previous month.
Economists had expected an unchanged reading.
In its latest assessment of the economy released last week, the BoE said it expected inflation to peak at 3% in October.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2017 03:58AM ET</span>",Dollar climbs as North Korean tensions ease,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Gains against the yen and the Swiss franc led a broad rise in the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, helped by an easing of the tensions around North Korea that drove capital towards Switzerland and Japan last week.
The yen and the franc had both surged as Washington and Pyongyang ramped up military threats following the imposition of new sanctions on the Koreans through the United Nations 10 days ago. 
However, a North Korean state media report on Tuesday that leader Kim Jong Un had delayed a decision on firing missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam was taken by markets as another sign that the threats were rhetorical.
Currency market strategists also point to a general recovery by the dollar over the past fortnight after its worst four months since 2011 against the euro and the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. 
""Selling dollars isn't as easy now as it was in June because of positioning,"" said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal in London.
""The market is short dollars versus G10 (currencies), probably now short versus emerging markets and, I think, short versus China. So if you sold the dollar at the start of June, why wouldn't you take some money off the table now?""
Gallo pointed to a raft of political and economic event risks - ranging from German elections to the expected start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet wind-down - that move into view in September as reasons for investors to consolidate on anti-dollar plays.
The dollar index rose 0.4 percent in morning trade in Europe and the U.S. currency was similarly higher against the euro at $1.1738. 
It gained 0.7 percent to 110.42 yen, taking it back to levels last seen before U.S. President Donald Trump promised last week that North Korea would be met with ""fire and fury"" it if threatened the United States.
Poorer than expected German growth numbers also played into moves early in European time, with Europe's biggest economy growing 0.6 percent on the quarter compared to expectations of 0.7 percent in a Reuters poll. 
""The dollar could be making a permanent comeback,"" said City Index's Kathleen Brooks in a morning note. 
""From a technical perspective EUR/USD looks strong, however (the rise yesterday) highlights the impact that central bank speak is likely to have on the euro as we lead up to the all-important Jackson Hole conference on 24-26th August.""

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2017 03:11AM ET</span>",Yuan's strength against the dollar fails to snuff out depreciation expectations,"By Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has given those who bet against the yuan a bloody nose this year thanks to policy moves and intervention by the authorities. And yet, many traders and investors are still tipping the Chinese currency to decline against the U.S. dollar in the next year.
They argue that after a Communist Party leadership meeting in the fall, which is expected to solidify President Xi Jinping's grip on power, there will be room for the yuan to weaken. The Chinese government is determined to keep the financial system and the wider economy stable ahead of the gathering, which is held once every five years.
Even after three consecutive months of strengthening against the U.S. dollar, the first such positive run since 2014, many market participants are unconvinced by the gains.
David Qu, markets economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai, said he doesn't believe that even with its recent strength the yuan's broad downward trend of recent years has been fundamentally reversed. ""I don't think the renminbi is back on an appreciation path,"" he said, using the other name for the currency.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank, did not provide answers to faxed questions about the yuan's trajectory.
A Reuters poll of foreign exchange analysts published on August 3 found the yuan is forecast to weaken to 6.85 per dollar in six months and to 6.9 per dollar in a year. It settled at 6.6715 per dollar at the late night close on Monday.
The yuan slumped around 6.5 percent against the surging dollar last year, its largest decline since China unified official and market exchange rates in 1994. The global dollar index .DXY, which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, rose 3.6 percent in 2016.
This year, the yuan has gained around 4 percent as the greenback has slumped, but analysts say it should be up even more given that the dollar is down about 9 percent against other major currencies.
Companies wary of foreign exchange risks are keeping the yuan's gains in check.
""Half of our corporate clients who are purchasing dollars at current levels are still betting on a decline in the yuan in the belief that the rebound in the yuan has been a result of the weakness in the dollar and central bank intervention,"" said a forex trader at a regional bank in Shanghai.
Against other currencies, the yuan's value on a trade-weighted basis has actually fallen more than 1 percent this year, indicating it is actually weaker than the dollar exchange rate suggests.
GOOD VIBES
Tighter controls on capital outflows have been a big reason for yuan strength this year, along with dollar weakness and signs that the Chinese economy is improving, said Wang Tao, chief economist at UBS in Hong Kong.
""Some fundamental drivers of capital outflows remain - there is still strong demand among households and corporates to diversify their wealth into FX and overseas assets, while concerns about domestic asset bubbles and high leverage also remain high,"" Wang said.
Much of the money changed into dollars in China will actually stay in Chinese bank accounts, rather than circumventing capital export controls, but it sill serves as a hedge, experts say.
Another sign that the market still wants dollars: the daily local closing price has been persistently weaker than the same day's benchmark fixing set by the PBOC prior to the market opening.
This has been the case even after the May introduction of a mysterious ""counter-cyclical factor"" into the official midpoint formula, with this X factor designed to reduce price swings and stabilise market expectations. In 44 out of 53 trading sessions between June 1 and August 14, the yuan was weaker than the midpoint at the 4:30 p.m. close.
Shan Kun, head of local-markets strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in Shanghai, said impetus for the yuan to retreat could grow.
""We have concerns that companies and financial institutions could decide that the yuan has become too strong in a short period of time and resume expansion of their holdings of dollar-denominated assets, and increase their enthusiasm for dollar buying,"" Shan said.
Foreign currency deposits held by households and companies have been rising steadily this year. The volume stood at $793.1 billion at the end of June, up 20.9 percent from a year earlier, official data from the central bank showed.
Derivatives and other gauges also suggest weakness ahead.
One-year dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards CNY1YNDFOR=, considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations for the yuan's value, on Monday showed that the yuan was expected to weaken to 6.8205 per dollar, a drop of more than 2 percent from the day's midpoint.
One-year risk reversals for the dollar against the yuan onshore CNY1YRR=, a gauge that measures the premium paid for calls over puts, have shown an upward trend since late July to a nearly two-month high at one point on Monday. That indicates that bullish call options remained more expensive than bearish put options, underscoring how the market is positioning for further yuan depreciation.

""The Chinese yuan would be still vulnerable to any upward correction in the U.S. dollar. If there is a potential rebound in the dollar, the impact on the yuan would be relatively huge,"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.

1500,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>",Dollar steadies as US-North Korea tensions ease,"Investing.com – The dollar rose against a basket of global currencies on Monday, as geopolitical tensions eased between the U.S. and North Korea while upbeat Japanese economic data lifted sentiment on risky assets.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.30% to 93.29.
The dollar pared losses following a slump on Friday, after safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc gave up recent gains as investors welcomed comments from U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson downplaying the risk of imminent war on the Korean peninsula.
""The U.S. has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea. We do not seek an excuse to garrison U.S. troops north of the Demilitarized Zone,"" the officials said, addressing some of Pyongyang's fears that Washington ultimately intends to replace the reclusive country's leadership.
USD/CHF rose to 0.9708, up 0.95% while USD/JPY rose 0.23% to Y109.45, as solid Japanese economic data pressured the yen to session lows against the greenback.
Japanese second-quarter growth expanded 1% quarter-on-quarter, on the back of a rise in consumption and capital expenditure, beating economists’ forecasts of a 0.6% increase.
Also adding to positive sentiment on the greenback was a fall in both the euro and sterling, as market participants awaited UK inflation data slated for Tuesday.
GBP/USD fell 0.19% to $1.2984 while EUR/USD lost 0.27% to $1.1789.

Bitcoin has more than quadrupled in value so far this year and has gained around 47% in August. The surge means that the total market cap of Bitcoin has now risen to around $69 million.
Bitcoin has rallied to a series of record highs in recent sessions amid optimism that faster transactions times will speed up the spread of the cryptocurrency.
New software called Segregated Witness, or SegWit was successfully adopted by the blockchain supporting Bitcoin last week. The SegWit rollout is seen as a milestone for Bitcoin.
The software was developed as a solution to the cryptocurrency’s scaling problem, which led to a split or so-called ‘hard fork’ on August 1 when the blockchain supporting Bitcoin split into two, creating Bitcoin Cash.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower against a trade-weighted basket of currencies on Monday after posting its biggest weekly drop in three weeks as expectations of U.S. rate increases dwindled further after weak inflation data.
With Japanese second-quarter growth expanding 1 percent quarter-on-quarter, fueled by rising consumption and capital expenditure, investors stepped in to buy risky assets after tensions over North Korea.
Renewed risk appetite also encouraged investors to borrow in relatively weak currencies such as the dollar and the franc  and invest in the euro  which is the best performing currency in the G10 FX universe.
""Despite some near-term headwinds for the euro after the recent rise, it is set to rise against the dollar because of the relatively favorable economic outlook,"" said Rob Carnell, head of research at ING in Singapore.
The dollar was trading at 93.05, a shade lower from Friday's session when it came under pressure after softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data for July dampened expectations for another Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.
Heightened geopolitical risks also weighed on the dollar's outlook.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Saturday that there needs to be a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue, and in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump he urged all sides to avoid words or action that raise tensions.
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.1827  and was approaching a 2-1/2 year high of 1.1910 hit earlier this month.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.32% to 93.01.
The Labor Department said on Friday the Consumer Price Index (CPI) edged up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in June. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.7% from 1.6% in June.
Economists had forecast the CPI rising 0.2% in July and climbing 1.8% year-on-year.
The downbeat consumer inflation report comes a day after wholesale inflation data undershot expectations, pointing to a continued slowdown in inflation, narrowing expectations the Federal Reserve may keep to its plan to hike rates at least once more this year. 
The stuttering pace of inflation has been a key concern for the Federal Reserve, weighing on the central bank’s decision to tightened monetary policy further, after Fed members voted to keep rates unchanged in July. 
Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan on Friday downplayed the prospect of a third rate hike, saying the Fed’s key interest rate is getting close to a “neutral” level so the Fed should patiently wait for further evidence that inflation will rise before tightening policy.
The euro and sterling were the main beneficiaries of the slump in the greenback, as the latter hit session highs.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2017 08:10PM ET</span>","Dollar hits eight-week low vs. yen, North Korea tensions spook investors","By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar set an eight-week low against the yen on Friday as escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea triggered yet more investor flight to safety.
The dollar slipped to as low as 109.11 yen  in early Asian trade on Friday, its lowest level since June 14, when the greenback had fallen to as low as 108.81 yen.
Below that level lies another key support level for the dollar on technical charts at 108.13 yen, a trough the greenback touched in mid-April. 
""We're getting close towards very important support on the dollar/yen,"" said Steven Dooley, currency strategist for Western Union Business Solutions in Melbourne.
""Particularly that 108.10/108.00 level, a break below those levels would really set up a rapid move to the downside,"" he said.
On Thursday the greenback had shed 0.8 percent versus the yen, with the Japanese currency rallying broadly against most major currencies. 
Both the Swiss franc and the yen have climbed against the dollar this week, after U.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea that it would face ""fire and fury"" if it threatened the United States.
Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric against North Korea and its leader on Thursday, warning Pyongyang against attacking Guam or U.S. allies after it disclosed plans to fire missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory.
""The yen is the big story really. Risk aversion is still very much a concern for markets,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. 
The Swiss franc and Japanese yen are often sought in times of geopolitical tension or global financial stress, partly because both countries have big current account surpluses.
Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption Japanese investors may repatriate their foreign holdings in times of heightened global uncertainty. 
Later on Friday, investors will look to U.S. July consumer price data for hints on the Fed's policy outlook and near-term moves in the dollar. 
Subdued U.S. inflation has stirred doubts about the chances of another Fed interest rate hike this year, weighing on the greenback.

The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1766 , staying below a high of around $1.1910 set last week, the euro's strongest level in 2-1/2 years.

Bitcoin Cash, was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after some members of the bitcoin community rejected software upgrade SegWit2x on the back of concerns that the measure fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to one megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
Bitcoin Cash seeks to increase the block size to eight megabytes whereas SegWit2X proposes moving transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track with plans to increase bitcoin’s block size later in the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose against a trade-weighted basket of currencies on Thursday as investors consolidated positions with the low-yielding Swiss franc and Japanese yen supported amid deepening anxiety over tensions between the United States and North Korea.
""The markets are looking for direction after Wednesday's sharp moves and geopolitical concerns will dominate investor mindsets in the coming days,"" said Esther Maria Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
The dollar index was trading 0.2 percent up at 93.73. It hit a 15-month low of 92.548 on August 2.
The Swiss franc and Japanese yen had notched up impressive gains against the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea that it would face ""fire and fury"" if it threatened the United States. 
That prompted North Korea to say it was considering firing missiles at Guam, a U.S. Pacific island territory.
The jump in the franc had prompted hedge funds to unwind leveraged positions which involved borrowing in the weak Swiss currency and investing the proceeds in the relatively higher-yielding Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar.
The Swiss franc and Japanese yen are often sought in times of geopolitical tension or global financial stress, partly because both countries have big current account surpluses.
Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption Japanese investors may repatriate their foreign holdings in times of heightened global uncertainty. 
The euro edged 0.3 percent lower to 1.1726 against the dollar. It has weakened 1.5 percent since hitting a 2-1/2 year high of 1.1910 on Aug. 2.

(Reuters) - Investors have likely added to bets on further gains in emerging Asian currencies in the past two weeks as the dollar remained sluggish and most regional stock markets continued to rally, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
The dollar has come under renewed pressure in recent weeks from heightened political turmoil in the United States, a stronger euro and lingering doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again in 2017. 
The dollar index which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, has fallen about 8.4 percent this year.
With the outlook for the dollar remaining soft, investors were estimated to have raised their long positions on most emerging Asian currencies, according to a poll of 11 analysts, traders and fund managers.
Bullish bets on the yuan ballooned to the largest in almost 3 years, with stronger central bank fixings, continued corporate dollar selling and a larger-than-expected increase in China's foreign exchange reserves fuelling a rally in the past few weeks.
The yuan has now strengthened 4 percent this year, helped by tougher policing of capital outflows and fresh steps by the central bank to flush out speculators who were betting the currency would continue to fall.
Traders raised bullish bets on the Indian rupee to their highest level since May 2014, the poll showed.
The rupee hit a more than two-year high last week amid heavy selling of dollars by foreign banks, and as the Reserve Bank of India's decision to cut interest rates posed little risk to the currency.
Exchange data showed Indian equities, attracted inflows for the sixth consecutive month in July on expectations of easier monetary policy.
The poll also showed market participants lifted their bullish bets on the Thai baht to the highest in over 3 years. The baht has appreciated more than its Southeast Asian peers this year.
The currency has been helped by the country's lower external risks and smaller foreign fund outflows, BOT Assistant Governor Jaturong Jantarangs had earlier said in March.
Investors reduced short positions on the Philippine peso over the last two weeks, while, bullishness on the Korean won diminished as political tension between U.S. and North Korea continued to escalate.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

""Instead, we see a mixed outlook for the greenback, with gains against some crosses and losses against others.""
Pandl and Trivedi said several factors would help stabilize the greenback including a possible U.S. tax cut by 2018 and an expected slowdown in capital inflows in Europe.

The activation of SegWit2x came a week after Bitcoin’s blockchain split into two, creating a competing currency called Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash followed Bitcoin’s move lower, easing 6.10% to $322.48.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2017 05:36AM ET</span>",Swiss franc set for biggest single day rise in 2-1/2 years,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Switzerland's franc on Wednesday posted its biggest single-day rise against the euro since the central bank removed its cap on the currency in January 2015. 
Traders said hedge funds had cut leveraged bets against the franc, prompted in part by worries about increased U.S.-North Korea tension. The Swiss franc is a traditional safe haven.
The franc jumped 1.4 percent to 0.9611 francs per euro in early trades.
""The overnight Korean news has prompted some unwinding of the cheapening trades on the franc that has been going on for some time and though positioning is not stretched by any means, the franc's strength may have room to run,"" said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets in London.
Against the dollar, the franc surged 0.6 percent to 0.9688 francs, reversing a two-week losing streak. 
The franc's surge against the dollar is likely to flush out some leveraged bets as some hedge funds had used the lower yielding franc as a borrowing currency to invest in others, such as euro assets, in the last three weeks. 
North Korea said on Wednesday it is ""carefully examining"" plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump told the North that any threat it presented to the United States would be met with ""fire and fury""
""Heightened geopolitical risks overnight have seen the markets flip from risk-on to risk-off and we have to wait and see how long this move runs before adding some positions,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
The franc wasn't the only beneficiary to the risk-off sentiment sweeping markets. 
German bond yields fell, gold and the Japanese yen surged and the leveraged bets on higher yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar took a beating.
The dollar weakened against the yen, which is often sought in times of geopolitical tension. The U.S. currency was down 0.3 percent at 109.94 yen, following a retreat to 109.740, its weakest since June 15.
The Australian dollar, which rose to a 19-month high near 90.00 yen late in July, was down 0.6 percent at 86.77 yen after slipping to a one-month low of 86.23 yen.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin rose to $3,379.4, up $31.2 or 0.93%.
Bitcoin soared to all-time highs, rising to $3,483 amid expectations a key software upgrade called BIP 91, which aims to speed up transactions on the bitcoin network, would activate later today.
BIP 91, seeks to introduce something known as SegWit2X to the blockchain - the digital ledger which records every bitcoin transaction. SegWit is short for ""segregated witness"" which would move some of the data outside the main bitcoin network to increase its capacity.
The activation of SegWit2X comes a week after Bitcoin’s blockchain split into two, creating a competing currency called Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash followed Bitcoin’s move higher, rising 18.5% to $347.90, adding to gains in the prior session, which saw the newly created digital currency surge 40%.
Bitcoin Cash, was created as a result of a ‘civil war’ in Bitcoin, after some members of the bitcoin community rejected software upgrade SegWit2x on the back of concerns that the measure fails to adequately address bitcoin’s scaling problem.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to one megabyte every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second. This compares to 2,000 per second for Visa and means that at peak times bitcoin transactions can take hours to be fulfilled, inhibiting the currency.
Bitcoin Cash seeks to increase the block size to eight megabytes whereas SegWit2X proposes moving transaction data outside of the block on a parallel track with plans to increase bitcoin’s block size later in the year.
Meanwhile, Ethereum, rose to $284.75, up 7.21%.

 The greenback was boosted after the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, settled at a record-high 6.163 million in June from 5.702 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.666 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to increase to 5.775 million at the end of the second quarter from May’s initial reading.
The report came after Friday’s strong nonfarm payrolls data, which fueled expectations the Federal Reserve will stick to its plans for a third interest rate hike this year.

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin hit a high of $3,482.9. It was last at $3,440.6 up $92.4 or 2.76%.
Bitcoin has more than tripled this year and has gained around 20% so far this month.
The recent price surge means that the total market cap of Bitcoin has now risen to around $56 million.
Prices have risen in a relief rally after the relatively smooth split of the digital currency into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, a new version of Bitcoin.
The blockchain supporting Bitcoin split into two on August 1 in an event known as a ‘hard fork’.
Bitcoin Cash was developed as a measure to improve transaction speed on Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, a shared online ledger that records all transactions.
Bitcoin Cash edged lower, dipping 0.52% or $1.7 to $328.3. Bitcoin Cash fell to a trough of $188.00 on Thursday after debuting at $1,213.9.
Elsewhere in cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum, Bitcoin’s closest rival in terms of market cap, was last up 6.87% or $17.80 to $283.42.

EUR/GBP rose to 0.9074, the most since the most since October 12, 2016 and was at 0.9068 by 07.53 a.m. ET (11.53 a.m. GMT).
The euro has strengthened in recent week amid expectations that the European Central Bank will begin scaling back its monetary stimulus program in the autumn.
Data last week showed that the euro zone economy grew by a stronger than forecast 0.6% in the second quarter, double the 0.3% rate of growth in the UK over the same period.
Sterling has come under pressure since the Bank of England left interest rates on hold at record lows last week and cut its growth forecasts for wages and the economy amid ongoing headwinds from Brexit.
Uncertainty over the size of the UK’s ‘Brexit bill’ has also weighed on the pound.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2017 03:29AM ET</span>",Dollar inches back down after jobs boost on Fed hike doubts,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched down for a second day on Tuesday, still holding on to most of the gains made on Friday after strong U.S. jobs data even though investors remain unconvinced that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again this year.
The greenback had slumped to 15-month lows against its broad index last week after weak data bolstered the view that, having already increased interest rates twice this year, the Fed would now stay put until next year. 
But Friday's bumper labor market data challenged that view, handing the dollar its best day so far this year and bringing forward expectations for when the Fed will tighten policy again. 
Markets are pricing in less than a 50 percent chance that another Fed hike will come in 2017, and comments from rate-setters at the central bank did little to change investors' minds on that on Monday.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Fed can leave interest rates where they are for now because inflation is not likely to rise much even if the U.S. job market continues to improve, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari talked about inflation being below target.
""(They) seemed to oppose further rate hikes. That means they exactly reflect the current market expectations, which are limiting the dollar’s appreciation,"" wrote analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt in a morning note to clients.
""It is still inflation that poses the problem,"" they added, while noting that Bullard's and Kashkari's dovish reputations meant market players were likely to discount their comments.
U.S. producer prices for July, due on Thursday, and consumer price index figures on Friday are likely to draw closer attention and will give investors a clue about the extent to which a stronger labor market is spilling over into inflation.
Investors are also awaiting clues as to when the Fed will begin shrinking its $4.2 trillion bond portfolio. 
""The September meeting is where we are anticipating the identification of the start date and we would not be surprised to see it start in almost an immediate fashion,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana.
The dollar index edged down 0.1 percent to 93.353, holding well above last week's 15-month low of 92.548, though it remained shy of Friday's high of 93.774 as investors pondered the timing of the U.S. central bank's next tightening steps. 
The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1806, around a cent away from last week's 2-1/2-year highs, having largely shrugged off figures on Monday showing an unexpected fall in German industrial production in June.
With the European Central Bank now widely expected to scale-back its quantitative easing program as doubts rise about whether the Fed will be able to raise rates again this year, the euro is expected to hold on to its strength against the dollar.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2017 08:56AM ET</span>",Dollar slips after Friday's gains; data eyed,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower on Monday, giving back some of its gains from Friday as investors consolidated bets before inflation data this week that may signal a turnaround in the currency's weakness this year.
Friday's strong employment data helped the dollar snap out of its funk which has seen it fall more than 8.5 percent so far this year.
""Friday's strong U.S. jobs data has given the dollar bears something to think about but we would have to see whether this trend can be sustained before we see large short dollar position unwinding,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index in London.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.1 percent lower at 93.40 (DXY) having climbed 0.75 percent on Friday. That was its biggest single-day rise of 2017 and pulled it away from 92.548, its lowest level since May 2016 that it marked on Wednesday.
While the dollar surged in the wake of the jobs data on Friday, both Asian and European trading was marked with a bit more scepticism on the greenback's outlook with investors preferring to buy other majors like the euro  on dips.
The single currency rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.1805 on Monday after falling more than 0.7 percent on Friday. 
Of greater concern to dollar bulls was that the bounce in the greenback was not matched with a corresponding rise in U.S. benchmark bond yields. Ten year U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) are a shade lower at 2.27 percent on Monday.
That might change if inflation data this week surprises on the upside prompting analysts to revise up their expectations of policy tightening from the U.S. central bank.
U.S. producer prices for July due on Thursday and consumer price index figures on Friday should confirm whether the labor market strength is spilling over into inflation.
Fed funds futures on Thursday implied traders saw a roughly 47 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, slightly higher from a week ago.
But JP Morgan strategists say the intensification of broad dollar weakness that had unfolded since late June, has subsided in the past week based on multiple indicators, suggesting the dollar's weakness may be overstretched.

As was widely expected the jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.3% while average hourly earnings met expectations, rising 0.3% from the prior month.
The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of continuing strength in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 09:10PM ET</span>",Struggling dollar awaits U.S. jobs report for potential relief,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar struggled near a 2-1/2-year low against the euro and a seven-week trough versus the yen on Friday in the wake of weak U.S. data, awaiting the closely watched non-farm jobs report later in the session for potential relief.
The greenback has been on the back foot through the week, weighed by largely uninspiring U.S. economic data which have added to uncertainty about the pace of future Federal Reserve policy tightening and political turmoil gripping Washington.
The market received a fresh dose of both factors overnight. Data from the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) showed its manufacturing index fell more than expected, while it was reported that a grand jury will investigate allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
Beleaguered dollar bulls looked to the U.S. jobs report due at 1230 GMT to turn fortunes around for the greenback, at least in the short term.
Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 183,000 jobs in July, down from 222,000 in June.
The euro added 0.1 percent to $1.1878  and in striking distance of $1.1910, its highest since January 2015 scaled midweek.
The dollar was steady at 110.005 yen  after touching 109.855 overnight, its lowest since mid-June.
""Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates within the year are already less than 50 percent and the figure could drop further if the jobs report disappoints, taking dollar/yen towards 109.00,"" said Yukio Ishizaki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Fed funds futures implied traders saw a roughly 44 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
""While bargain hunting by Japanese institutional investors is preventing dollar/yen from sliding too far below 110.00 yen, there is also significant demand for the yen stemming from its gains against the pound and the Canadian and Australian dollars,"" Ishizaki said.
Sterling took a battering overnight after the Bank of England voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at current record lows and lowered its forecasts for growth, inflation and wages, disappointing investors who expected more hawkish messaging. 
The pound was last at 90.410 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3) after retreating to a nine-month low of 90.485 pence overnight. It stood little changed at $1.3144  after losing 0.7 percent the previous day.
Against the yen, the pound extended losses from Thursday, when it slid 1.2 percent, to touch an 11-day low of 144.33 (GBPJPY=).

The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.15 percent lower at 92.704 (DXY), poised to lose about 0.6 percent on the week during which it fell to a 15-month low of 92.548.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 08:50PM ET</span>",Venezuela currency down 18 percent as constituent assembly set be installed,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's bolivar currency tumbled 18 percent against the U.S. dollar on Thursday on the black market, ahead of the inauguration of a legislative superbody that the opposition says will give President Nicola Maduro sweeping new powers.
The currency data, provided by the widely-tracked but opaque website DolarToday, show the bolivar fell just under 60 percent to 17,981 bolivars per dollar over the last month as countries around the world urged Maduro to back off the idea of electing a ""constituent assembly"".
The vote, boycotted by the opposition, was held on Sunday.
The new body, to be inaugurated on Friday, will have broad powers, including that of re-writing the constitution.
Maduro says the new assembly will bring peace to the oil-rich but economically-ailing country, after four months of opposition street protests that have left more than 120 people dead.
The currency's decline means that Venezuela's minimum wage is now worth just $1.50 per week, despite numerous hikes by the government in recent months. Inflation is in triple digits, exacerbated by the currency's fall as well as a rapid rise in money supply — up 10 percent in just one week last month.

A thousand dollars of local currency purchased when Maduro came to power in April 2013 would now be worth just $1.34.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.09% to 92.67. 
The dollar bounced off session lows, after data showed service sector growth slowed in July while the number of Americans filing for unemployment last week fell more-than-expected. 
The Institute for Supply Management's Index registered 53.9 in July, below economists’ forecasts of 57, indicating a slowdown in service sector activity for the month.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, sank to its lowest level since May 2016 at 92.39 on Wednesday.
The index fell almost 3% in July, its fifth straight monthly decline, which is the longest losing streak since 2011.
The dollar is down around 9% through the first seven months of the year. The last time the greenback suffered such a weak start to the year was in 1985, when it suffered a 12.5% decline in the January-July period.



Political turmoil in Washington dampened hopes for quick passage of President Donald Trump's stimulus and tax reform agendas, weighing heavily on appetite for the greenback in recent months.
Tepid U.S. inflation, which has lessened the risk of another Federal Reserve rate hike this year, has also been a factor in the dollar's descent.

LONDON (Reuters) - An under-pressure dollar held on Thursday above a 2-1/2-year low versus the euro hit in the previous session as investors readied for U.S. jobs data.
The dollar index, which measures its value against a basket of six major currencies, rose about 0.1 percent to 92.940. On Wednesday, it slid to 92.548, its weakest since May 2016.
""It would need a substantially good jobs data (reading on Friday) to mitigate some of the growing bearish sentiment around the dollar and, barring that, we should see the dollar continue to trade lower,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
Despite double-digit U.S. earnings growth in the second quarter and private sector payroll growth last month of another 178,000, expectations of a third Federal Reserve interest rate rise have dissipated and futures markets now only see a 35 percent chance of another hike by the end of 2017.
The dollar's decline has pushed the euro higher with the single currency hitting a 2-1/2-year high of 1.1910 against the dollar on Wednesday. It was trading a shade below that at $1.1844 on Thursday.
Despite the single currency's more than 12.5 percent rise against the dollar this year, a Reuters poll found risks still skewed more in favor of the single currency, driven by expectations the European Central Bank will start to scale back its stimulus program.
The poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists showed the euro will weaken slightly in the coming year but is expected to close 2017 higher than where it started the year.
Sterling was trading a touch higher at $1.1323 before a Bank England policy decision later in the day. Markets expect the Bank to have turned more dovish again after a burst of hawkishness in June.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 92.77 by 03.08 a.m. ET (07.08 a.m. GMT) after falling to 92.41 on Wednesday, its lowest since May 2016.
The greenback has been pressured lower by a combination of worries over political turmoil in Washington and recent lackluster economic reports, which have raised doubts over whether the Federal Reserve will raise rates again this year.
The dollar had been supported by the Fed's gradual policy tightening since late 2015 but the prospect that other major central banks may join it in tightening monetary policy has also fed into dollar weakness.
Investors were looking ahead to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for July to gauge whether the U.S. economy is strong enough for the Fed to stick to its planned tightening path.

(Reuters) - The euro is set to end 2017 higher against the dollar, a Reuters poll showed, with the risks skewed more in favor of the single currency, driven by expectations the European Central Bank starts to scale back stimulus.
Having lost almost a quarter of its value against the dollar over the last three years, the euro has gained more than 12 percent so far this year, making it the best performing major currency. (World FX rates in 2017 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)
While the poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists showed the euro will weaken slightly in the coming year from where it was trading on Wednesday, the currency is expected to close out 2017 higher than where it started the year.
The euro is forecast to trade at $1.16 in a month and at $1.15 in six months and hold at that level in a year, compared to a 2016 close of around $1.05.
Median predictions in August's survey were the highest since a January 2015 poll, the month when the ECB announced it would start buying bonds on a monthly basis and just after the Fed had raised interest rates for the first time in the current cycle.
But now, with the ECB widely expected to scale back its quantitative easing (QE) program, and as doubts have risen if the Federal Reserve will be able to raise rates again this year, the euro is expected to hold strong against the dollar.
""We were expecting the euro to do better, it certainly has gone beyond our expectations. The rotation back into the euro and the anticipation that there will be a tapering from the ECB is certainly a big factor,"" said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank.
""The ball is very much in the court of the ECB right now with respect to sending signals that could move the euro dollar.""
Over three quarters of strategists who answered an extra question said a change in expectations for ECB policy will have a bigger influence on euro strength for the remainder of 2017 compared to a change in expectations for another Fed rate hike.
""A distinct and explicit shift to (ECB) 'taper' will probably have more impact than watered down Fed, given the likely dovish spill over to other central banks too,"" said Vishnu Varathan, economist at Mizuho Bank.
Forty-two of the 56 strategists who answered another extra question said risks to their euro forecasts were skewed more in favor of the single currency.
Predictions for euro/dollar parity or lower have vanished in recent polls after several forecasters had it penciled into their horizons at the beginning of 2017.
The euro has been bolstered by buoyant euro zone growth this year, outpacing its trading peers like Britain and the United States.
Not only has data out of the U.S. remained lackluster, the lack of political unity in Washington and fading expectations for any form of tax cuts from President Donald Trump has hurt the dollar dearly.
Currency speculators too have cut their bets in favor of the dollar, with net short positions in July built up for the first time in well over a year, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Currently, there is very little in favor of the dollar.
The currency should benefit when the Fed starts to shrink its balance sheet but if the central bank does not follow through on a predicted rate hike by the end of the year, it could weigh on the dollar further. [FED/R]
Any further dollar fall though will be limited as financial markets are assigning less than 50 percent chance for the Fed to raise rates at its December meeting.
""If the Fed does not raise rates this year, the euro would appreciate more than we currently expect,"" said Asmara Jamaleh, economist at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 02:30AM ET</span>","Mexico, Brazil currencies set to weaken less on dovish Fed, ECB: Reuters poll","By Bruno Federowski
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian and Mexican currencies will weaken less than previously thought against the U.S. dollar during the next 12 months as low interest rates abroad offset political uncertainty at home, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
The fresh forecasts come in the wake of a stronger-than-expected performance for both currencies in the first seven months of 2017, which drove them to their strongest levels in more than a year.
Still, estimates from top banks and research firms suggest the currencies probably will give back part of their recent gains.
The Mexican peso is seen at 18.115 per dollar in 12 months versus 18.5 in July, having outperformed all major emerging market currencies this year as fears of a U.S. trade war abated. The Brazilian real is expected to weaken to 3.35 per dollar from 3.42.
Elsewhere in the region, foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters forecast the Argentine peso at 18.865 in a year, the Chilean peso at 666.5, the Colombian peso at 3,039 and the Peruvian sol at 3.38 to the greenback.
Emerging market currencies are expected to benefit from resilient appetite for high-yielding assets throughout the world as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) take their time in unraveling monetary stimulus.
Although U.S. economic growth has shown signs of accelerating, an unexpectedly slow pickup in price hikes has made analysts skeptical of the Fed's stated plan of increasing interest rates once more this year and three times next year.
Meanwhile, euro zone inflation remains far below the ECB's target of close to 2 percent, driving policymakers to hold off paring back bond purchases meant to stimulate activity.
That prospect is likely to provide support to the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, despite both countries facing highly uncertain general elections in 2018 that have stoked trader fears of a populist swing. A series of interest rate hikes and currency interventions in Mexico also have fostered trust in the strength of the local currency.
In Brazil, concerns that corruption allegations against President Michel Temer could derail his plans to streamline the country's bloated social security system also seem to have been put off in the short-term.
""So far, the political crisis hasn't impacted the risk perception in Brazil in any meaningful way,"" Ivo Chermont, an economist with investment boutique Quantitas, said. ""We'll only begin to seriously discuss the elections in around six months.""

Eleven of 12 strategists who replied to an additional question said they saw no potential for regional spillovers from the political crisis in Venezuela.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - In 12 month's time the Chinese yuan will have erased most of its gains made this year, provided the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks to its tightening path, boosting the greenback, a Reuters poll showed.
Having strengthened more than 3 percent since the start of 2017, the yuan is forecast to weaken to 6.90 per dollar in a year, according to the poll of over 60 foreign exchange analysts taken July 27-Aug 2.
It was trading around 6.72 on Wednesday.
While the dollar should benefit when the Fed starts shrinking its balance sheet, which it has said it expected to do ""relatively soon"", it could falter again if the central bank fails to follow through with a rate hike later this year. 
At the start of the year, traders had expected faster rate hikes from the Fed and some form of stimulus from the new Trump administration would drive the dollar up strongly against emerging currencies.
But, the greenback has instead taken a beating on fading hopes that President Trump will be able to push through deep tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending.
That has brightened the outlook for Asian currencies.
Strong Chinese economic data over recent months has cooled worries over the yuan's weakening, leaving further scope for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to tighten the country's domestic liquidity conditions.
Authorities also tightened their grip on the yuan recently by adjusting the daily midpoint guidance formula to deter speculators betting on further falls in the yuan. That move has been reinforced by frequent dollar selling by state banks. 
""China's currency had long been struggling with depreciation pressure, which is now history for the time being,"" wrote Stefan Grosse, economist at NORD/LB.
""The U.S. dollar's current phase of weakness is helping the renminbi (yuan).""
Helping restore market confidence in the currency, the PBOC introduced a different methodology to calculate the mid-point reference rate for the yuan.
In its latest report, The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the yuan's exchange rate is broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and desirable policies.
Fitch Ratings agency echoed the IMF's view, confirming a stable outlook on the Chinese economy and maintaining its A+ rating, citing improvement in the country's external finances as well as macroeconomic picture.
A separate Reuters poll showed speculators increased their positions in favor of most Asian currencies.
Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan were at their highest since December late last month. Investors also turned bullish on the Indian rupee after being sellers of the currency since April. 
The Indian rupee is now forecast to have weakened to 65.00 per dollar in a year, lower than the 63.70 it was trading around on Wednesday, having gained roughly 6 percent so far in 2017.
On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.0 percent as expected, the lowest since November 2010, on concerns over softening inflation. The poll was taken before the rate decision.
The RBI also cut the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent.
India is set to reclaim its position as the fastest growing major economy, with GDP expected to grow an annual 7.3 percent in the current fiscal year, benefiting from a new goods and services tax policy. 
But in the near-term the impact of the new tax is expected to be negative for the economy and a lack of clarity among producers hurt the country's factory activity in July, which shrank at its fastest rate in more than nine years.
""Within the emerging market space, currencies with strong fundamentals could continue to gain despite stretched valuations – INR falls in this category,"" said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts have again lifted their forecasts for the Australian and New Zealand dollars, yet are still lagging the market as the currencies barrel ahead to two-year peaks.
A Reuters poll of 46 analysts predicted the Australian dollar at $0.7800 in one month, up from $0.7600 in the July poll and $0.7400 in the survey before that. 
Yet the Aussie was already trading at $0.7930 on Thursday and recently hit a top of $0.8066. Back in July the highest forecast in the poll, from OCBC, had been for $0.7750 in one month.
Analysts also upgraded their forecasts for three months ahead to $0.7700, with $0.7600 now penciled in on a six- and 12-month horizon. At the start of 2017, the Aussie had been seen at $0.7300 in six months and $0.7200 in a year.
The New Zealand dollar was forecast at $0.7340 in a month, not far from current levels of $0.7399 and up from $0.7200 in the previous poll. It climbed to $0.7557 last week, the highest since May 2015. 
Median forecasts for further out were closely grouped, with the kiwi seen at $0.7275 in three months and at $0.7200 on both a six- and 12-month horizon.
The two currencies have surged dramatically this year against a beleaguered U.S. dollar which has succumbed to 13-month lows on political woes and expectations of a slow pace of tightening by the Federal Reserve. 
The antipodean currencies have also soared on the back of carry trades where investors purchase higher yielding currencies by borrowing in perceived safe haven assets such as the yen. 
Australia's commodity driven currency, in particular, has also found support from higher price of iron ore - the single biggest export earner - which has boosted the country's national income.
However, most analysts assume the currencies will eventually be undermined given the likelihood that interest rates will remain at record lows in the two countries. 
Australia's central bank has reiterated the need to keep interest rates at 1.50 percent for a while as inflation is stuck below its long-term target band of 2-3 percent.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which slashed rates throughout 2016 to an all-time trough of 1.75 percent, has also signaled it will keep rates on hold, possibly until 2010. 
This means the yield advantage that Australia and New Zealand currently enjoy could be whittled away as some of their rich-world peers unwind stimulus. 
Canada recently raised its rates and the Federal Reserve still aims to hike once more before year end.
""The velocity of the recent rally means that on a tactical basis, we see some downside risks for the AUD,"" said Daniel Been, head of forex strategy at ANZ.
Been said that the current risk-on environment with plentiful liquidity and all-time low volatility is unlikely to stick for too long.
""Risk reward does not favor selling the U.S. dollar at these levels. We remain of the view that a rebound in the USD will come once the liquidity tap starts to turn off or when risk aversion rises. This will see AUD, NZD, and Asian currencies impacted more.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar briefly touched a 15-month low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday on political turmoil in Washington and weak U.S. economic data that kept the Federal Reserve's policy outlook uncertain. 
While the dollar was last higher on the day as investors consolidated positions, it was not far from its lowest in more than a year against major rivals as uncertainty was expected to continue weighing on the greenback following President Donald Trump's ouster of White House communications chief Anthony Scaramucci on Monday.
Concerns also persisted about whether the Fed would raise interest rates again this year. Expectations for a December rate hike from the U.S. central bank last stood at about 50 percent, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.2 percent at 93.065 after touching 92.777, the lowest since early May 2016. 
""It’s all about negative dollar momentum,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York. ""If you’re short the dollar, the move has been playing out in your favor and there is little reason to change the view.""
Serebriakov said weak U.S. construction spending and auto sales added to the dollar's troubles. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell 1.3 percent in June to the lowest since September 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had expected construction spending to increase 0.4 percent.
Serebriakov also referred to weak U.S. auto sales. U.S. carmakers said Tuesday they continued to slash sales to daily rental fleets in July.
The dollar fell below 110 yen for the first time in more than six weeks, touching 109.94 yen <JPY=>. The dollar was last at 110.22 yen. The euro was down 0.4 percent against the dollar at $1.1797 but not far from a 2-1/2-year high of $1.1845 touched Monday. 
The dollar index fell in July, its fifth consecutive monthly decline, the longest such stretch since December 2010 through April 2011. On a monthly basis, it was the biggest drop since March 2016.

""(Political) policy uncertainty in the U.S. I think has been the biggest driver of declines in the dollar recently,"" said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York. ""Any positive effect from the election of President Trump I think at this point has been priced out.""

On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin fell to $2,747.9, down $136.8 or 4.75%.
Bitcoin cash, a new version of Bitcoin, launched at 08.20 ET on Tuesday, creating a new cryptocurrency.
A recent surge in the popularity of Bitcoin, which saw prices hit a record of $3,000 in June, has meant the underlying technology has struggled to cope with a boom in transaction numbers.
Bitcoin transactions are limited to 1MB every 10 minutes - or seven transactions per second.
Bitcoin avoided a split into two independent currencies last month when its network supported a proposal on upgrading to its software in order to speed up transactions on the Bitcoin network.
But some in the Bitcoin community thought the proposal did not go far enough, leading to the ‘hard fork.’
Holders of Bitcoin before the split will end up with an equal value of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash following the fork, but Bitcoin Cash will likely only be worth a fraction of Bitcoin.
Elsewhere in cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum, Bitcoin’s closest rival in terms of market cap, was last up 14.35% or $27.52 to $219.07.

On Tuesday August 1, a ‘user activated hard fork’ (UAHF) will get underway, causing the blockchain – the digital ledger which records every bitcoin transaction – to fork, creating a new separate digital token called Bitcoin Cash.
The ‘hard fork’ comes after weeks of optimism that Bitcoin would avert a split, after bitcoin miners signalled support for SegWit2X, a software upgrade aimed to increase the transaction limit from 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes, speeding up transactions on the bitcoin network.
Some members of the bitcoin community, however, failed to signal support for SegWit2X, on the back of concerns that the proposed software upgrade doesn’t adequately address the slowdown in transactions on the Bitcoin network.
These members announced plans to launch a fork on August 1, known as Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash will have a bigger block size than Bitcoin – even after SegWit2x activates – with an 8-megabyte transaction limit.
Bitcoin Cash, however, is likely to be worth only a fraction of bitcoin, as some of the biggest bitcoin wallet providers don’t have immediate plans to support Bitcoin Cash.
“As of today, we have no immediate plans to fully support the Bitcoin Cash fork within our main product,"" Blockchain’s Alsyon Margaret said on Sunday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar struggled on Monday, wallowing near a 2-1/2-year low against the euro, weighed down by U.S. political uncertainty and uninspiring U.S. data that added to doubts about whether there will be another Federal Reserve rate hike this year.
Growth in the world's largest economy picked up to 2.6 percent in the second quarter, matching expectations of economists polled by Reuters, but growth in the first quarter was revised down to 1.2 percent.
U.S. labor costs also rose less than expected in the second quarter, data on Friday showed, adding to concerns that inflation will remain low.
""It is easy for uncertainty to increase about the Fed's ability to raise rates next year if inflation remains low. We could see the dollar head below 110.00 yen under such circumstances,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
Deepening U.S. political uncertainty was also expected to keep the greenback on the defensive. 
President Donald Trump on Friday replaced his White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, installing retired General John Kelly in his place, in a major shake-up of his top team.
""The replacement of Priebus could be a turning point for the Trump administration. 'Trump risk' could now begin to take its toll on U.S. equities, which have been doing well until now, and in turn weigh on the dollar,"" Ishikawa at IG Securities said.
Hopes that the Trump administration will implement tax reforms and economic stimulus in the near future, seen as dollar-positive factors, also faded after the U.S. Senate on Friday failed to dismantle Obamacare, in another political setback for the president.
The euro was a shade lower at $1.1732  but remained in striking distance of $1.1777, its strongest level since January 2015 set on Thursday.
The U.S. currency was down 0.1 percent at 110.570 yen  after touching 110.300 earlier in the session, its weakest since mid-June.
""The dollar is capped firmly by the perception that U.S. yields won't be able to rise any time soon,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
The 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) stretched Friday's decline and touched 2.273 percent, its lowest in nearly a week.
""The Fed has been labeled as dovish after last week's policy meeting. I don't necessarily agree with such a view but this is the understanding that is now holding sway in the market and the dollar has weakened steadily.""

On the U.S.-based GDAX exchange, Bitcoin rose to $2,784.2, up $222.9 or 8.70%.
News surfaced Thursday, showing that 100% of miners signalled support for software upgrade SegWit, easing concerns that Bitcoin would split into two currencies.
For SegWit to activate, at least 95% of miners are required to continue to support the software upgrade.
The upgrade to Bitcoin's network, is expected to activate in late August, providing miners with ample time to upgrade their software.
The rise in bitcoin comes a few days after an analyst warned that the digital currency faces a period of consolidation before attempting to break above its all-time high of $3,000.
""Anything above $3,000 will suggest potential to have already started wave V, which again has a minimum target at 2,988 and scope to reach 3,691 (the latter being a preferred target as this assumes a new high.),"" Jafari wrote.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>",High-flying euro may run into rough weather,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro is the year's best-performing major currency against the dollar, but a shrinking interest-rate advantage and the weight of the bets on the single currency are making a retreat ever more likely.
The euro reached its highest point since January 2015 on Thursday at $1.1777, with a variety of factors contributing.
Chief among them were increasing talk the European Central Bank will soon begin to wind down its bond-buying stimulus and the dollar's decline to 13-month lows against a basket of other major currencies (DXY).
Political calm after elections in the first half of the year and improving economic data in the euro zone also helped. Greece's successful debt sale this week - its first in three years - was a sign of confidence in the euro. 
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi provided the single biggest boost in June, when he gave a speech in Sintra, Portugal, that many took to mean the ECB was getting closer to ending its bond-buying program. The euro rose nearly 5 percent against the dollar.
""It is as if the markets are almost impatient with the ECB to tighten policy as soon as possible without giving a thought to the speed of the underlying (euro) move,"" said David Kohl, chief currency strategist at Julius Baer in Frankfurt. ""They may be in for some disappointment."" 
The single currency has gained nearly 11 percent against the dollar so far in 2017. At the same time, long euro positions - bets it will rise - have increased to the largest number in six years, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
Now some analysts say things have moved too far, too fast.
""The currency markets are getting a bit ahead of themselves on the euro premium story,"" said Adam Cole, head of G10 FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. He recommends selling the currency against the likes of the Australian dollar (EURAUD=D3).
Any sudden weakness will have implications for investment flows in both equity and bond markets, where currency gains have boosted returns.
Unhedged equity flows in the second quarter of the year have been a big factor behind the euro's strength, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists, and any weakness in the currency would trigger outflows, at a time when European stocks have been underperforming their U.S. counterparts.
Warning noises are the loudest from bond markets. The yield premium offered by lower-rated euro zone states has shrunk, nearing two-year lows. That reduces the return investors can earn from borrowing in low-yielding currencies such as the Swiss franc  and buying euro debt. 
Equally worrying, spreads between U.S. and German debt have widened, making it more attractive for European institutional investors to buy U.S. debt, if the dollar stabilizes.
At 203 basis points, the two-year U.S. yield premium over German debt is near its highest in more than a month, and the 10-year premium of 177 bps is at its widest in two weeks.
""If the premium continues to trend in the U.S. favor, the dollar may get better traction,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. 
WARNING SIGNS
The euro is also coming up against key resistance levels on charts that can contribute to investment decisions.
It is holding around $1.17, a 23.6 percent retracement of the 2008-2017 $1.6040-$1.0340 range on the monthly charts.
Beyond that is the psychologically important level of $1.20, where the euro last traded in January 2015.
Some other indicators say the euro is not yet overbought, but amber signals are flashing from the currency derivatives markets.
Risk reversals for the euro , a measure of investor sentiment in the currency options markets over the coming three months and a year, are holding at their highest in more than seven years, according to Reuters data, a sign that positions are becoming stretched.
And then there is history. Ben Bernanke, then the Federal Reserve Chairman, caused a ""taper tantrum"" when he signaled in May 2013 it was time to stop pumping cash into the U.S. economy. The dollar index (DXY) fell more than 3 percent by September before Bernanke backpedalled on the timing.
By that metric, the euro has already outperformed the dollar.
Not everyone sees the euro falling. It remains somewhat undervalued on a trade-weighted basis compared with its longer-term averages and economic prospects remain bright.
For Kevin O'Nolan, a multi-asset fund manager at Fidelity International in London, ""the game changer for the euro this year has been the politics"".
He is looking to play euro strength by buying it particularly against the Korean won .

“We are finally experiencing a robust recovery where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow course,” he said.
In Switzerland, data earlier showed that the KOF Economic Barometer rose to 106.8 this month from 105.8 the previous month, beating expectations for an uptick to 106.0.
The euro was also higher against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD up 0.29% at 1.1713, just off Thursday’s two-and-a-half year peak of 1.1777.
Sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable after the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that inflation remains below its 2% target even as near-term risks to the economic outlook appear “roughly balanced.” In the past, the Fed judged that weakness in inflation was transitory.
The central bank’s cautious tone on inflation sparked fresh uncertainty over the possibility of a third rate hike this year.
The dollar was also fragile after Senate Republicans failed to pass their Obamacare repeal bill in a dramatic vote of 49-51 late Thursday night.
At least three Republicans, incuding Sen. John McCain, voted against the bill which needed a simple majority to pass in the Senate. President Donald Trump reacted to the vote by saying the three had ""let the American people down""."
1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2017 03:38AM ET</span>",Swiss franc set for biggest weekly drop in nearly two years,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell on Friday and is on track to post its biggest weekly drop against the dollar for more than 22 months after breaking through some major technical levels. 
Its weakness against the euro was even more pronounced as investors grew more optimistic about euro-denominated assets after recent upbeat comments from policymakers.
""There is some rebalancing flows going through from some model-driven funds after euro/franc cracked through the 1.10 level and with very little option barriers at these levels, this can go higher,"" Scotiabank's head of Asian FX sales and trading, Gerrard Katz, said.
The franc was trading 0.3 percent weaker against the dollar at 96.77 cents. It has fallen more than 2 percent this week, its biggest weekly drop since October 2015. 
The currency was down half a percent at 1.1328 against the euro and traded below a 200-week moving average for the first time since September 2008, according to Reuters data. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists expect more losses on the view that the franc remains the ""most overvalued currency in the G10 universe"" despite this week's fall.
""The bearish franc trade is an alternative approach to trading better prospects for European Monetary Union economic and political stability,"" they wrote in a morning note.
The dollar dipped against its major peers on Friday, with a modest early bounce petering out ahead of the second quarter U.S. economic growth data due later in the session.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 93.755 after edging up 0.2 percent the previous day.
The market's focus was now on second quarter U.S. gross domestic product data due at 1230 GMT.
Economists expect the world's largest economy to have grown about 2.6 percent in the second quarter, from 1.4 percent in the first quarter. A solid outcome will no doubt give the beleaguered dollar some respite from the recent sell-off.

1671,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 10:01AM ET</span>",The Fed has become the dollar's 'biggest problem',"The US dollar has a problem.
It's the worst-performing G10 currency of this year, and has fallen about 8% against its major peers. As strategists identify catalysts that could send it higher, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be on that list.
""The USD’s biggest problem, is it can’t expect help from the Fed for a long time, and that won’t change following the July FOMC meeting,"" said Alan Ruskin, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a note on Wednesday.
""The most USD negative feature right now is simply how difficult it is to tell a USD positive story while there is a hiatus of another 5 months (and possibly longer) before Fed rate hikes resume,"" Ruskin said.
On Wednesday, the Fed concluded its two-day policy meeting and left interest rates unchanged as expected; Bloomberg's World Interest Rate Probability data showed a 0% chance the Fed hikes rates. The Fed said in a statement that it planned to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet ""relatively soon.""
Although the Fed began raising interest rates before many other G10 peers, it's expected to continue paying close attention to how inflation is evolving before continuing to raise rates. This caution has put some downward pressure on the dollar.
""The USD needs either some increased probability of a fiscal stimulus; or a risk-off event like fixed income treating a Fed balance sheet tapering as a tightening,"" Ruskin said.
With the Fed working to shrink its balance sheet, the momentum for the dollar through the summer rests on technical signals, Ruskin added.
Traders' bets per the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the dollar would fall rose to the highest level since February 2013 last week, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). This should limit how far below major technical support levels the dollar is allowed to decline, Ruskin said.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 01:50AM ET</span>",Bullish bets on China yuan rise to highest since December: Reuters poll,"By Christina Martin
(Reuters) - Investors raised their long positions in most Asian currencies compared with two weeks ago, with bullish bets on the Chinese yuan at their highest since December, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as the dollar languished near multimonth lows on political woes in Washington.
The poll was conducted between Tuesday and Wednesday, with all responses received before the U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
The Fed maintained its benchmark lending rate and said it was continuing the slow path of monetary tightening, but it noted that both overall inflation and a measure of underlying price gains had declined. The perceived dovish tone on inflation sent the dollar to a 13-month low against a basket of currencies.
The dollar was already under pressure this week as the Trump administration, dogged by investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election, took a fresh hit after White House spokesman Sean Spicer resigned.
The disarray at the White House has stoked concerns about the administration's ability to pass its tax reform and stimulus agenda.
Investors were estimated to have lifted their bullish bets on most emerging Asian currencies, according to the poll of 12 analysts, traders and fund managers.
Long positions in the Chinese yuan rose to their largest since December, while the Korean won notched up the most bullish bets since May.
Traders have shifted from holding an entrenched bearish view on the yuan following concerted efforts by Beijing to stabilize the currency since the second quarter. The move has also been aided by the dollar facing political headwinds as well as on expectations for a slower pace of Fed rate increases.
Bullish bets on the Thai baht increased to their largest since October 2015, even as Thailand's central bank deputy governor highlighted the baht's rapid rise and said the central bank will closely monitor market activity.
Investors turned bullish on the Taiwan dollar again after being sellers of the currency two weeks ago for the first time since January.
Bearish positions in the Philippine peso increased to their largest since November, as rising imports and a widening current account deficit fueled its weakening streak.
The Philippine government posted a budget deficit of 154.5 billion pesos ($3.05 billion) in the first half of the year, exceeding the ceiling for the period as it missed its revenue and spending targets, the country's budget minister said on Monday.
The Asian currency positioning poll focuses on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar licked its wounds at 13-month lows against a basket of major currencies on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve's more cautious wording on the inflation outlook bolstered views it might not hike interest rates again this year.
While the Fed said it expected to start shrinking its massive holdings of bonds ""relatively soon"", a phrase taken by many to mean an announcement in September, the central bank also noted weakness in U.S. inflation more explicitly than before. 
That recognition of soft inflation from the Fed, which had in the past judged the weakness as transitory, added to expectations that the Fed's plan to raise interest rates a third time this year might be delayed.
""Even though the U.S. economy is strong, inflation is weak. Markets want to see more signs of inflation before they are convinced about future rate hikes,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
""I also suspect people want to take stock of the impact of the likely reduction of the Fed's balance sheet,"" she added.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies slumped to 93.26. It has fallen more than 10 percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Jan 3.
The next support levels are seen at 93.019, its June 2016 low, and 91.919, a 16-month low touched in May 2016. A break of these could be seen as major bearish signals.
Although the dollar had been supported by the Fed's gradual policy tightening since late 2015, its perceived interest rate advantage is eroding as many other central banks have started to look to wind back their stimulus in recent months.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled in June that it could tweak its asset purchases, prompting investors to flock to the euro.
The euro rose to as high as $1.1777, hitting its highest level since January 2015. It last stood at $1.1755, up 0.2 percent from late U.S. levels.
The Canadian dollar, which has been helped by the Bank of Canada's rate hike earlier this month, hit a two-year high of C$1.2415 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday and last stood at C$1.2436.
The British pound fetched $1.3146, reaching its highest level since September, while the Australian dollar reclaimed the $0.80 mark for the first time since 2015 and last stood at $0.8054 for a gain of 0.6 percent.
The dollar also slipped 0.2 percent to 110.90 yen , edging near 110.625, its 5 1/2-week low touched on Monday.
Although Fed policymakers have said another interest rate hike is likely by the end of year, Fed funds rate futures are pricing in slightly less than a 50 percent chance of a rate hike by December, compared to a little over 50 percent before the Fed's meeting.
But some players also said the market may have over-reacted to the Fed's latest statement.

""I think the Fed just fine-tuned its message to keep it in line with the reality, rather than trying to telegraph a message that it is going to delay its rate hike,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street Bank and Trust's Tokyo Branch.

In a move largely expected in financial markets, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) agreed to keep its benchmark rate target at 1%-1.25%.
The accompanying statement revealed concerns among policymakers about the recent slowdown in inflation, which remained well below the central bank’s target of 2%.
