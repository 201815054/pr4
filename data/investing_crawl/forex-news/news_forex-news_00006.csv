On the U.S.-based GDAX exchange, Bitcoin fell to $2,546.6, down $192.5 or 7.19%.
Despite data showing 93% of bitcoin miners supported software upgrade BIP91, which would enable the Bitcoin network to process transactions quicker, investor sentiment turned cautious as traders awaited further clues on whether miners would signal support for the next iteration in the path to software upgrade, BIP 141 (SegWit).
The upgrade to Bitcoin's network, is expected to activate in late August, providing miners with ample time to upgrade their software.
Meanwhile, Ethereum, followed bitcoin lower, falling 9.27% to $204.15, down 9.27%, after snapping a four-week losing streak last week.

1,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 25, 2017 01:01PM ET</span>",Dollar in holding pattern as Fed two-day policy meeting gets underway,"Investing.com – The dollar traded flat against a basket of global currencies on Tuesday, as the Fed’s two-day rate policy meeting overshadowed economic data showing an improvement in consumer optimism about the strength of the U.S. economy. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.01% to 93.83 
The dollar eased from highs, as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s rate decision due Wednesday, expected to provide fresh insight into the U.S. central bank’s thinking on monetary tightening. 
Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to keep its benchmark rate unchanged on Wednesday. 
Ahead of the Fed rate decision, the dollar struggled to capitalize on better-than-expected consumer confidence data for July, easing fears about a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy. 
The Consumer Confidence Index rose in July to 121.1 to a 16-year high, despite expectations for a drop, The Conference Board announced Tuesday.
Economists had forecast the major indicator of consumer optimism to decline to 116.5 in July.
Meanwhile, GBP/USD eased to $1.3036, up 0.06%, after rallying to session highs of $1.3084 on the back of a tweet from President Donald Trump outlining that his administration is working on “major trade deal” with the United Kingdom. 
A speech by Bank of England MPC member Andy Haldane later during the session is expected to provide further insight on whether the central bank continues to support the idea of tapering its ultra-accommodative monetary policy measures later this year.
EUR/USD traded roughly flat at $1.1654, up 0.09%, while EUR/GBP added 0.01% to 0.8938.
USD/CAD traded at $1.2502, down 0.02%, after a surge in oil prices supported a move higher in the oil-sensitive loonie while USD/JPY rose to Y111.62, up 0.47%. "
2,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2017 11:01AM ET</span>",Dollar hits 13-month low as Fed meeting begins; euro near 2-1/2-year high,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest level since June 2016 against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as investors grew wary of the short-term U.S. economic outlook ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve and got more bullish on the euro zone.
The euro  rose to its highest point since August 2015 and was just a hair below a 2-1/2-year high, boosted by a stronger-than-expected German business survey. The Ifo business sentiment index hit its highest level on record, showing that Germans were ""euphoric"" about the country's business climate.
The Fed starts a two-day meeting later on Tuesday with no change to interest rates expected. Markets give a less than 50 percent probability of a rate increase before the end of the year, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
With minute expectations for an increase in overnight interest rates, investors will be looking for the U.S. central bank's outlook on trimming its $4.5 trillion in bond holdings, said Eric Nelson, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
The euro  rose to a high of $1.1711, matching its high from Aug. 24, 2015, and just below its highest level since January 2015. That represented an important technical level, Nelson said.
""What you have is markets pushing it toward that level but just waiting on another catalyst to break through,"" he said. ""Whether it's the Fed or U.S. political developments that could be influential, but for now it's just consolidating below that key level.""
The euro was last up 0.4 percent to $1.1683.
Investors will be watching the U.S. Senate's vote on a repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which President Donald Trump and Republicans have vowed to undo. Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate, meaning they can withstand only a few defections within their ranks in the face of united opposition from Democrats.
The uncertain healthcare vote as well as an investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and its possible collusion with the Trump campaign has cast a cloud over the Republican president's pledges to cut taxes and ramp up spending, analysts said, weakening expectations for U.S. growth and inflation.

The dollar index (DXY) earlier fell to its lowest level since June 2016 at 93.638. It has fallen nearly 4 percent over the last month and more than 8 percent this year. It was last down 0.2 percent at 93.811.

Investors also remained focused on the investigation into alleged links between U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and Russia in last year’s election. 
Investors fear the persistent political turmoil in Washington will derail the Trump administration’s pro-growth economic agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, which helped propel the dollar index to 14-year peaks after the November election.

Overnight, crude futures settled higher on Monday, after Opec producer Saudi Arabia pledged to lower crude exports in August while Nigeria agreed to curb production.
At a gathering of ministers from major crude-producing nations in St. Petersburg, Russia on Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would limit crude oil exports at 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost 1 million bpd below levels a year ago.
The Saudi energy minster added that the production-cut agreement could be extended beyond March if necessary but any further extension would rely on non-compliant nations adhering to the agreement.
Also adding to positive sentiment on oil, were reports suggesting that Nigeria committed to take part in production if it reaches a production level of 1.8m bpd.
Nigeria output reached 1.7 million bpd in June, according to independent sources cited by OPEC in a monthly report.
Some analysts praised Nigeria decision to agree to cap production but expressed concerns about Opec’s compliance rate – with the deal to curb production – which fell to 78% June, the IEA said in its report earlier this month.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m bpd for a period of nine months until March but rising production from the U.S., Nigeria and Libya has undermined the cartel’s efforts to curb excess supply.

Demand for Bitcoin continued to be underpinned after it avoided a split into two independent currencies last week when its network supported upgrading to its software in order to process transactions more quickly.
The upgrade to bitcoin's network will not take place until autumn, according to reports.
Bitcoin prices rallied last week, rising to a high of $2,953.5 on July 19, just shy of its record high of $3,000 set in June.
Meanwhile, Ethereum was almost unchanged for the day at $227.40, remaining well below its all-time high of $419.3.
The pullback in Ethereum from its all-time high has seen its market capitalization fall to $20 billion, well below Bitcoin’s $43 billion, reducing investor expectations that Ethereum would be the alternative digital currency that usurps Bitcoin as the best capitalized cryptocurrency.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar struggled near a 13-month low against a basket of major currencies on Monday as U.S. political turmoil dampened hopes for quick passage of President Donald Trump's stimulus and tax reform agendas and the euro extended gains.
The Trump administration, already dogged by investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election, took a fresh hit on Friday after White House spokesman Sean Spicer resigned, highlighting the upheaval within the president's inner circle.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was little changed at 93.887 (DXY), after touching 93.823, its lowest since June 2016.
""For any chance of the dollar bouncing back in the near term, it will need a rebound in U.S. yields,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The current U.S. political situation is weighing heavily on U.S. yields. So we will need strong U.S. data to dislodge U.S. yields from their low levels,"" he said.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) hit a three-week low on Friday, as a retreat on Wall Street kindled safe-haven demand for debt. 
The euro was steady at $1.1668  after inching up earlier to a 23-month high of $1.1684.
The common currency's advance was limited after euro zone yields fell across the board on Friday, with the strong currency prompting investors to question the timing of the ECB's planned stimulus withdrawal. [GVD/EUR]
The euro has been on strong footing this month after what the markets perceived as hawkish talk from ECB President Mario Draghi reinforced views that the central bank would begin moving away from its easy policy sooner rather than later. Neither did he express any concern at the currency's strength. 
The dollar slipped 0.15 percent to 110.970 yen , with the Japanese currency at its strongest in roughly five weeks.
Speculators' bets on the U.S. dollar swung to a net short for the first time in more than a year, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
According to the same data, Japanese yen net shorts grew to their largest since January 2014. 
Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo, said the high level of yen shorts probably reflected yen trades versus non-dollar currencies, so called cross trades.
""A lot of the selling pressure on the yen is channeled through cross yen pairs. That is why dollar/yen has been weak despite the large net short positions built up against the yen.""
The Bank of Japan has stuck to its easy monetary policy while other major central banks have signaled shifts to normalizing policy, which is why some investors have expected a weaker yen.
The Japanese currency stood in proximity of a 17-month low against the euro (EURJPY=) and a 19-month trough versus the Australian dollar (AUDJPY=).
The Australian dollar traded at $0.7923  after being pushed down from a 26-month high of $0.7992 scaled on Friday.
The Aussie had advanced on the dollar's broad weakness before its rally was tempered by dovish comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) deputy governor Guy Debelle on Friday.

The New Zealand dollar fared better, staying in close reach of $0.7460 , its highest since September 2016 scaled on Friday.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>","Sterling to fall 15 percent on slowing UK growth, BoE inaction: Voya","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sterling is set to plummet by double-digits by the end of the year on slowing UK economic growth and the likelihood the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates, said Guy Petcho of Voya Investment Management. 
Petcho, global macro portfolio manager for the $213 billion investment firm, said in an interview that sterling was set to fall about 15 percent from its level on Friday of around $1.2960 to $1.10 .
The former Soros Fund Management analyst said second-quarter UK economic growth would likely be weak at slightly below 1 percent on an annualized basis. Petcho, who is based in Atlanta, expected total 2017 growth to be a modest 1.5 percent, making it unlikely the Bank of England (BoE) would proceed with raising rates. He cited weak wage growth and depreciating home prices as two sources of concern. 
“The result going forward is certainly bad for pound-sterling,"" Petcho said.
Petcho, who said he had been bullish on sterling before last month's UK election, said Voya had ""expressed a negative view"" on the currency immediately after the shock loss of British Prime Minister Theresa May’s parliamentary majority. 
He said the negative call was being implemented in the roughly $480 million Voya Global Bond Fund  and the $197 million Voya Strategic Income Opportunities Fund . Petcho declined to specify whether the firm had bet against or “shorted” the currency.
Sterling fell earlier this week from a 10-month high against the greenback of $1.3125 after data showing British inflation unexpectedly slowed in June. The data doused expectations that the BoE might soon raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Petcho also said he expected the euro to fall about 7.5 percent from Friday's nearly two-year high of above $1.1680 to $1.08 by year-end. The euro has rallied in the past two sessions after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi abstained from talking down the currency on Thursday. 
The ECB chief's apparent lack of concern about the strengthening euro convinced traders that the central bank remained on track to at least announce a tapering of its bond-buying stimulus in the autumn, analysts said.
Petcho said, however, that any tapering announcement would likely disappoint traders hoping for a hawkish move by showing a more moderate bias, while second-quarter European economic growth was poised to come in at a modest 1.5 percent annualized. 

""The euro also looks quite ripe for a depreciation,"" he said.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.26% to 93.85.
That was just off an intraday low of 93.82, its lowest level since the UK voted to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, on June 24, 2016.

Several news agencies suggested that Mueller could delve into U.S. President Donald Trump’s private business, though the U.S. leader expressed his opinion that investigating his personal finances would be crossing a red line.
The recent reports kept continuous downward pressure on the dollar as market players fretted over how the investigations would sidetrack the implementation of Trump’s fiscal and economic policies.
In the meantime, the strength in the euro also put downward pressure on the dollar as expectations grew that the European Central Bank (ECB) is moving closer to tapering its bond-buying program, after Draghi said on Thursday that the central bank saw signs of “unquestionable improvement” in the euro zone growth and indicated that policymakers would discuss changes to the bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy in the fall.
ECB policymakers now see October as the most likely date to decide on the future of the central bank's asset purchases and consider December, an option flagged by staff, as too late, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussion told Reuters in an article released on Friday.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2017 12:51AM ET</span>",Dollar near two-year lows vs. euro after Draghi comments,"By Lisa Twaronite
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar headed for weekly losses on Friday, wallowing at its lowest levels against the euro in nearly two years after what markets perceived as hawkish talk from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi.
But the Australian dollar skidded against the greenback after contrastingly dovish comments from a Reserve Bank of Australia official.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was flat on the day at 94.322, not far from its overnight low of 94.090, its deepest nadir since August 2016. It was down 0.9 percent for the week.
The euro caught its breath and steadied at $1.1626 after climbing as high as $1.1659 on Thursday, its loftiest level since August 2015.
Draghi said that no exact date had been set for discussing any changes to the ECB's ultra-easy monetary program but did say policymakers would revisit the topic in the autumn.
His comments were perceived as ""hawkish, even though the ECB didn't tip its hand as to when it will begin balance sheet normalization and in fact left the door open to additional easing if needed,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana.
The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.06, after touching an overnight low of 111.48, its lowest since June 27. It was on track to shed 0.4 percent for the week.
The euro crept 0.1 percent higher against its Japanese counterpart to 130.32 yen, within sight of last week's high of 130.76 yen, its highest since February. It was on track to gain 1 percent for the week.
The dollar's losses against the yen were mitigated by market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep its massive stimulus program in place far longer than other major central banks amid stubbornly weak inflation.
On Thursday, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady as expected and postponed the timeframe to achieve its ambitious inflation target for a sixth time, though it slightly raised its economic growth forecasts.
Concerns over low inflation will likely keep the Federal Reserve from raising U.S. rates at its policy meeting next week, analysts said.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled caution in her congressional testimony last week, with disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data a week ago adding to evidence that the central bank has reason to take its time in tightening even as it has vowed to do so.
""When you look at dollar/yen, the Fed has explicitly said they're on a rate-hiking curve, and the BOJ has said this week that they still have a specific 2 percent inflation figure in mind, and they're going to hit it,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo.
""So I would have expected the dollar to be even higher than where it is against the yen now, and this background is definitely limiting the dollar's losses,"" he said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to garner enough support for his healthcare bills in the Senate this week also weighed on the dollar, as it raised fears about similar obstacles in passing his stimulus and tax reform agendas. 
The Australian dollar plunged after a top central banker said on Friday that the Reserve Bank of Australia doesn't need to follow the leader when it comes to global monetary tightening.
""Just as the policy rate in Australia did not need to decline to the very low levels seen in other parts of the world, the fact that other central banks increase their policy rates does not automatically mean that the policy rate here needs to increase,"" RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said in a speech in Adelaide.
The Aussie tumbled 0.9 percent to $0.7889 after falling as low as $0.7875 earlier.
The New Zealand dollar added 0.4 percent to $0.7423 after rising as high as $0.7429, its highest level since September 2016, after New Zealand Finance Minister Steven Joyce told Bloomberg in an interview that he was not worried about the strength of the local dollar.

On the U.S.-based GDAX exchange, Bitcoin rose to $2,659.0, up $400.9 or 17.86%, making up recent losses, after data on Monday showed 80% of Bitcoin's mining power, including AntPool, BitClub, Bixin, BTC.com and BitFury, have signaled support for proposal Segwit2x, which would allow the bitcoin network to scale more efficiently.
The uptick in support for the scaling proposal Segwit2x, reduced investor uncertainty over the outcome of the final vote on the proposal due August 1.
Ethereum followed bitcoin’s move higher, rising to $225.41, up 8.89%.
Despite the recent rally, following its collapse to $130.26 on Sunday, Ethereum remained well below its all-time high of $419.3.
The dip in Ethereum from its all-time high has seen its market capitalization fall to $20 billion, well below bitcoin’s $43 billion, reducing investor expectations that Ethereum would be the alternative digital currency that usurps bitcoin as the best capitalized cryptocurrency.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro held near a 14-month high against the dollar on Thursday as investors look to hints from the European Central Bank on tapering of its stimulus, while the yen barely budged after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy on hold.
The ECB is expected to lay the groundwork for an autumn policy shift when it meets on Thursday, emphasizing improved growth while trying to temper expectations after previously setting off a mini-tantrum in financial markets.
ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to policy tweaks in a speech in Sintra, Portugal, in late June, leading to expectations that the ECB is ready to announce cuts in its asset purchasing program.
The euro is now at $1.1515, backing off a tad from Tuesday's $1.1583, its highest level since May 2016 but still maintaining gains of 3.0 percent since Draghi's Sintra speech. 
While most market players expect an announcement of tapering from the ECB's next meeting in September, a move this week is not completely ruled out.
Some market participants, though, said there was a chance the euro would hit suffer a setback given investors have already built up massive positions in the currency.
Data from U.S. financial watchdog published on Friday showed speculators last week held the largest net long position in Chicago euro/dollar futures in six years - calling attention to risks in such positions being unwound.
On the other hand, Chicago futures speculators at the same time had sold the yen believing that the Bank of Japan would stick to its loose monetary policy at Thursday's monetary meeting, with their net short position at two-year highs.
""This suggests speculators' core positions are euro-long, yen-short. There is a chance those positions will be wound back after the ECB if markets think the ECB was less hawkish than expected,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The euro was flat on day at 129.10 yen, off the 17-month peak of 130.76 touched last week.
The dollar fetched 112.11 yen, up 0.1 percent from late U.S. levels after the Bank of Japan kept its policy on hold as expected.
Unlike some other major central banks looking to dial back many years of massive easing, the BOJ showed no inclination to adjust policy. 
Yet the yen has been strengthening against the dollar in recent weeks, because of the dollar's broad weakness, hitting a three-week high of 111.555 to the dollar on Wednesday.
Soft U.S. inflation in recent months is raising speculation that the Federal Reserve may not have justification to raise interest rates one more time this year as Fed policymakers have suggested.
""In the short term, the dollar appears to be under pressure. But given low volatilities in financial markets and the soundness in the global economy, the downside in the dollar/yen will be limited,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). 
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 94.848, up 0.1 percent in Asia but still not far from a 10-month low of 94.476 touched on Tuesday.
The U.S. currency was also hurt by the disappointment that U.S. healthcare bills appear to be falling apart in Congress, undermining the prospects for President Donald Trump's mooted stimulus and infrastructure-building plans.

The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.7935, meeting a strong resistance at $0.80 after hitting a two-year high of $0.7992. Australia posted bullish employment data on Thursday.

The ECB is facing a balancing act between reducing stimulus as the economy strengthens while markets remain jittery and inflation remains below the bank’s target of close to, but just under 2%.
The risk is that the process of scaling back stimulus could spark a ‘taper tantrum,’ sending the euro and borrowing costs higher, effectively choking the recovery.
The minutes of the bank’s June meeting showed that policymakers discussed removing from its statement a pledge to increasing asset purchases if the economy takes a turn for the worse.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Wednesday after skidding to a 10-month low against a currency basket as Republican legislators' failure to pass a stalled healthcare bill raised fears for the rest of President Donald's Trump reform agenda. 
Republican efforts to overhaul or repeal Obamacare collapsed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, rattling financial markets and casting doubt on the chances of getting Trump's economic plans, such as tax reform and stimulus, through a divided Congress.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.2 percent to 94.780 (DXY) after falling as low as 94.476 on Tuesday, its lowest level since September 2016. 
The euro inched 0.2 percent lower to $1.1534 , after rising as high as $1.1583 on Tuesday, its highest since May 2016.
The European Central Bank will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, with participants seen likely to adjust their language as they edge the ECB towards normalizing policy.
Such adjustments may include dropping a reference to the bank's readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase program before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond-buying.
The ECB, keen to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours, is set to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, three sources familiar with the discussion said.
ECB President Mario Draghi roiled markets last month when he opened the door to potential adjustments to the quantitative easing program. 
""For the ECB, the market has shifted its expectations somewhat in recent weeks, especially following Draghi's comments which were taken to be more hawkish,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia macro strategy for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Singapore. 
""To this extent, there's a lot already priced in, in terms of both the euro and expectations of ECB policy,"" he said. ""The attention is on whether that is sustained in terms of what Draghi was saying, or whether we'll see some reassessment."" 
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious about raising interest rates also weighed on the greenback.
Economic data on Tuesday showed U.S. import prices falling for a second straight month in June as the cost of petroleum products declined further, suggesting inflation pressures could remain weak for a while.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled caution in congressional testimony last week, with disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data on Friday adding to evidence that the central bank has reason to take its time in tightening. 
""The failure of the healthcare bill added the newest pressure to the dollar, but it was already under pressure after Yellen's comments last week,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.
The Fed chief referred to ""uncertainty,"" he said, a word that ""makes markets nervous,"" and prompted them to pare their expectations of another interest rate hike this year, he said.
The dollar was flat against its Japanese counterpart at 112.065 yen , well below its nearly four-month high of 114.495 touched last week. It fell as low as 111.685 on Tuesday, its lowest since June 27.
The Bank of Japan will also conclude a policy meeting on Thursday. Policymakers are expected to raise their economic growth forecasts but cut their rosy inflation outlook, sources say, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialling back its massive stimulus program.
A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to delay again its projected timing for achieving the 2 percent inflation target. 
The Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent to $0.7926  after surging to two-year highs on Tuesday as minutes of the last meeting of the country's central bank showed policymakers turned more upbeat on the economic outlook.
The dollar edged down 0.2 percent against the Mexican peso to 17.446 after credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Tuesday revised Mexico's sovereign credit outlook up to ""stable"" from ""negative,"" and commended the government's efforts to rein in a surge in debt.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2017 04:27PM ET</span>",Doubts about Trump's agenda seen accelerating U.S. dollar decline,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The outlook for the U.S. dollar turned even more bearish on Tuesday after healthcare reform legislation again failed to pass in Congress, casting further doubt on whether the Trump administration will be able to progress to tax reform, infrastructure improvements, and banking deregulation.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) that tracks the greenback's strength against major currencies slid to an 10-month low in the wake of setback to President Trump's agenda. 
And with the euro and yen both gaining on the possibility that the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will raise interest rates later this year as their economies improve, the dollar's decline of the past five months may well continue.
""The prospects for the dollar have turned bearish for the rest of year,"" said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. 
A Reuters poll published earlier in July showed a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters less bullish on the greenback than at the start of the year.
TRUMP TRADE TARNISHED
After the U.S. elections last November, Wall Street stocks and the dollar gained and bond yields rose on hopes that, with the Republican party controlling both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006, the new administration would quickly enact big tax cuts and spend on bridges and roads, driving faster economic growth and inflation. 
The so-called ""Trump trade"" has steadily eroded though in the first half of the year as infighting in the Republican party stalled the promised reforms, and the collapse of the latest effort to reform healthcare on Tuesday only served to accelerate the dollar's selloff.
“It pushes out the rest of the agenda. It’s hard to do a tax reform in the style that it was campaigned on. The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump’s agenda to 2018,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
As a result, the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, has fallen 7.48 percent so far this year, making the fall for the year-to-date the biggest since 2002 when it shed 10.87 percent in the same period.
Other indicators are also providing evidence of the market's increasing bearishness on the dollar. 
Last week, speculators reduced their net long bets on the dollar to their lowest level since last May, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
Traders' three-month bearishness on the dollar versus the euro hit its most extreme since at least 2010 in late June before retreating a bit, Reuters data showed. 
ECB AND BOJ ALSO PRESSURE USD
However, prospects for U.S. economic reform are not the only factor seen pressuring the U.S. dollar later this year. 
The euro <EUR=> began its latest leg up against the greenback four weeks ago after comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi highlighted the euro zone's economic recovery, stoking speculation the ECB may consider paring bond purchases later this year, pushing up euro bond yields and the single-currency.
The euro has gained 10 percent versus the dollar year-to-date, rebounding from a cumulative 23.5 percent drop in the prior three years due to weak economic growth and the region's sovereign debt crisis, Reuters data showed. 
On Tuesday, the euro  climbed to its highest against the greenback since May 2016 after the U.S. Senate failed to bring the healthcare bill to a vote.
The Japanese yen has also advanced against the dollar, gaining over 4.0 percent since January <JPY=>, after the Bank of Japan upgraded its economic outlook, increasing the prospects for paring monetary stimulus in the latter half of 2018.
The greenback has also weakened against the Canadian dollar and the British pound . 
The Canadian dollar hit a 15 month high against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday at C$1.2581, bringing its year-to-date gain to 6.0 percent <CAD=D4> in the wake of the first interest rate rise in seven years by the Bank of Canada last week. 
Years of ultra-low interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis had spurred a borrowing binge and helped drive Canadian household debt to record levels in recent years, fuelling a housing boom that has only recently begun to falter.
And analysts forecast the Canadian central bank will raise rates again in October, according to a Reuters poll. 
Last week, sterling  also reached a 10-month high against the greenback as rising U.K inflation prompted comments from Bank of England officials suggesting interest rates may need to rise, despite slowing economic growth as Britain negotiates its exit from the European Union.
""Clearly, anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude on the dollar,"" said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London.
""There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.""

64,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2017 10:30AM ET</span>","Less not more is key to efficient FX markets, Deutsche Bank finds","By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Conventional wisdom has it that as more participants join a market, it leads to better price discovery and therefore greater efficiency.
Not so, according to a study of the world's foreign exchange markets by Roel Oomen, global co-head of electronic FX spot trading at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), one of the world's top FX trading banks. 
Instead, adding more liquidity providers or traders to a platform is ultimately counterproductive for clients, he said in an interview. 
Banks' share of the foreign exchange market -- the world's biggest financial market, with more than $5 trillion changing hands daily -- has fallen in recent years as trading platforms have proliferated.
New technology has made it easier for institutional players and retail punters alike to trade at prices previously only available to the major banks. It is now possible, for example, to get the best prices from multiple players in a single order book, a process known as aggregation. 
While some of the world's biggest banks have their own trading platforms for clients, such as Citibank's Velocity, they also offer liquidity on some external trading platforms.
But Oomen's study found that adding more than a certain number of liquidity providers to a platform is unlikely to benefit the client and can result in worse pricing over time. 
""This is because it appears to increase the probability of 'winner's curse', where dealers end up losing money on deals because they have to submit overly aggressive pricing to win transactions,"" he said. 
They subsequently gave less competitive prices than they might ordinarily have offered to shield themselves from future potential losses, leading to a drop in liquidity. 
The study has implications for trading and hedging strategies used by companies and large funds, which increasingly use such technology offered by banks and non-bank participants. 
The top five banks' share of FX trading fell to less than half in 2016 from a peak of 60 percent in 2013, according to the latest triennial survey of the market, published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) last year.
That reflects lower participation by big hedge funds as currency volatility has declined, hitting banks which trade on their behalf. 
The difficulty of generating a steady income over long periods from carry trades, in which an investor borrows in a low-yielding currency to buy a higher yielding one, while interest rates are low has also sapped trading appetite.

Daily volumes on non-bank trading platforms such as XTX Markets, Virtu Financial (O:VIRT) and Citadel Securities can nowadays run into billions of dollars, according to BIS analysts.

USD/CAD hit a low of 1.2581, the weakest trough since May 3 2016 in early trade. It was at 1.2605 by 09.30 a.m. ET (01.30 p.m. GMT), off 0.75% for the day.
The greenback weakened across the board after a second attempt by Republicans to replace Obamacare collapsed late Monday, delivering a major policy blow to the Trump administration.
Around half of the cuts in health-care spending were earmarked to finance proposed tax cuts. The failure to deliver healthcare reform added to disappointment over the lack of progress on Trump’s economic agenda.
The dollar was already on the defensive after Friday’s weak U.S. inflation and retail sales data added to doubts that the Fed will be able to raise interest rates again this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.65% to an 11-month low of 94.3.
Demand for the loonie continued to be underpinned after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in almost seven years last Wednesday and indicated that it will need to hike again in the coming months.
The loonie found additional support as prices for oil, a major Canadian export jumped higher on Tuesday.
Oil was boosted by reports that Libya will attend a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Russia later this month, sparking speculation that the country may join a global pact to reduce output in a bid to rebalance oversupplied markets."

Bitcoin was at $2,302.10 on the U.S.-based GDAX exchange operated by Coinbase by 8:30AM ET (1230GMT), up about 15.8%, or $313.30.
Prices spiked higher amid news that about 43% of Bitcoin's mining power, including AntPool, BitClub, Bixin, BTC.com and BitFury, have signaled support for the scaling proposal Segwit2x.
The news came as a positive surprise to traders since miners were not expected to signal their intentions until July 21. The final vote on the proposal is due on August 1.
The cryptocurrency plunged from above $2,000 to as low as $1,758.20 on Sunday, a level not seen since May 16, as investors remained wary of initiating large positions ahead of the controversial scaling proposal, which has threatened to divide the cryptocurrency.
If the majority of developers fail to agree on the proposal, the cryptocurrency could split. If that happens, Coinbase's GDAX exchange said in a blog post last week the exchange ""will temporarily suspend the deposit and withdrawal of bitcoin on GDAX and may pause the trading of bitcoin as well.""
Bitcoin prices remain well off all-time highs close to the $3,000-level touched last month. Despite recent losses, it is still up nearly 60% since the start of the year.
Meanwhile, Ethereum, Bitcoin's closest rival in terms of market cap, was up 18.4%, or $29.90, to $192.72 in early trade. It dropped to $130.26 on Sunday, its lowest level in more than a month.
Ethereum notched its fourth weekly loss in a row last week amid concern the cryptocurrency faces a period of correction after surging to record-highs.
Prices are down almost 50% since peaking at an all-time high close to the $400-level in mid-June, but still up about 1,800% year-to-date.
Other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ripple and Dash also traded higher.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a 10-month low on Tuesday, bearing the brunt of a selloff triggered by another setback to U.S. President Donald Trump's agenda and scaled-back expectations for another rate hike at Federal Reserve this year.
The announcement overnight that two Republican senators would not support the latest version of the healthcare bill -- had led to speculation that the reform proposal was likely to be withdrawn.
It fed into a belief that Trump's tax cuts and spending plans will come to nought.
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies (DXY) sank to its lowest since last September with euro  rising above $1.15 against the greenback for the first time since May 2016.
In Asian hours, the Australian dollar  surged more than 1 percent after minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economic outlook.
""The reform momentum of the Trump administration has received another blow,"" said strategists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led by Hans Redeker, in a note to clients.
The strategists, however, added that the ""Goldilocks"" scenario for the United States -- loose monetary policy along with relatively healthy economic growth -- was likely to continue.
Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September.
""Clearly anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude on the dollar,"" said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London.
""There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.""
Expectations for a rate hike at the Bank of England were also dented, hurting sterling, as British inflation unexpectedly slowed for the first time since last October. The drop in the pound helped the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 (FTSE) recoup earlier losses and trade higher on the day.
Elsewhere in Europe, stocks struggled with European shares off 0.4 percent as a set of disappointing results from the likes of Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) soured the mood.
Regional stocks have rushed back into the limelight this year as foreign investors have piled in on the back of receding political risks, upbeat earnings and an economic recovery gaining traction.
Bullish bets on euro zone equities were named as one of three top crowded trades in the latest Bank of America-Merrill Lynch global fund managers survey, leaving them most vulnerable to earnings disappointments or signs of central bank tightening.
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS) was little changed while U.S. stock futures  (ESc1) were off 0.1 percent.
Tempered expectations for Trump's spending plans weighed on European bond yields which edged lower, tracking U.S. equivalents, after the collapse of the second healthcare bill.
U.S. 10-year bond yields  fell after the news, while German 10-year yields  dipped 2 basis points to 0.57 percent when European trading started on Tuesday.
Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy.
In commodity markets, oil prices steadied as expectations of firm demand, particularly from China, was met ample supply. 

Brent crude futures (LCOc1) eased 0.1 percent to $48.35 a barrel while U.S. crude oil (CLc1) fell 0.2 percent to $45.93.

""Market confidence in the renminbi (yuan) is strengthening, while expectations of devaluation are getting ever weaker,"" Huang Yiping, a member of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy committee, told the Financial News.
China's foreign exchange reserves edged up in June for a fifth consecutive month as capital outflows eased in the face of tighter controls over moving funds out of the country and a pause in the U.S. dollar's rally.
China will also look to give its currency greater flexibility, expand its free floating range and reduce intervention in the foreign exchange markets, Huang said. 
The central bank has long called for greater long-term flexibility in the yuan as China pushes ahead with its plan to further internationalize its currency.
Huang also said that while there were still downward risks to China's economic growth, the pressure had eased and there should be ""no problem"" for the country to hit around its target of around 6.5 percent full-year GDP growth.
China's economy expanded by a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, giving policymakers room to tackle big economic challenges ahead of key leadership changes later this year.
Huang added though that there was still many risks in the financial markets, a key focus for Beijing as it looks to stamp out risky behavior by corporations and lenders. He pointed to shadow banking, online finance and local government financing as the main three areas of uncertainty.

China's PBOC is set to play a bigger role managing financial risk and coordinating with the various financial regulators, President Xi Jinping said on Saturday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar sank to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, hobbled by uncertainty over the pace of the Federal Reserve's policy tightening and worries that President Donald Trump will fail to deliver healthcare reforms.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies sank to a 10-month low of 94.75. From its 14-year peak of 103.82 touched on Jan. 3, it has lost 8.4 percent.
Two more Republican Senators, Jerry Moran and Mike Lee, announced their opposition on Monday to a revised Republican healthcare bill, delivering a serious blow to the legislation.
""If the bills won't pass, there will be no money for tax cuts. The implementation of his fiscal policy will be difficult,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street.
Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales also fanned speculation that the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move.
Money market instruments are now pricing in less than 50 percent chance of a rate increase during the rest of the year.
In contrast, central bank policymakers in the euro zone, the UK and Canada have recently signaled they could adjust their policies, with the Bank of Canada raising rates last week for the first time since 2010.

The latest data is likely to reinforce the central bank's view that it is in no rush to hike interest rates.
The kiwi last stood at $0.7315, helped by the U.S. dollar's broad decline.
The Australian dollar gained 1.0 percent to a two-year high of $0.7875 as commodity prices such as iron ore and copper surged following Monday's data showing robust economic growth in China.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar nursed losses at a 10-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday as investors cheered upbeat Chinese data by piling into leveraged positions such as the Australian dollar and other high-yielding currencies.
Some of the biggest gains were seen in the yen crosses such as sterling, which was up 0.1 percent on the day as investors added bets that U.S. interest rates would rise very gradually in the coming months after the latest data.
""Risk outlook remains positive after the latest figures and markets are looking to add positions especially in the high-yielding names,"" said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.
China's second-quarter gross domestic product topped forecasts with a rise of 6.9 percent on the year, while retail sale and industrial output were both strong.
The Aussie shot to a two-year high and breached major chart resistance in the process in the $0.7700/7778 range. The Aussie was last at $0.7814 with bulls targeting the 200-week moving average around $0.8018. [AUD/]
U.S. rate hike expectations have been pared to less than a 50-percent probability after the latest inflation print on Friday and with no top-tier data this week, markets have plenty of time to mull over the future direction of interest rates.
The repeated disappointment on prices cast a question mark over the Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation would soon rebound.
Latest positioning data suggest markets are also turning bearish on the dollar with the first U.S. dollar shorts evident since May 2016. However, carry trades are flourishing with Japanese yen shorts at its highest level since June 2015.
The dollar was trading broadly flat at 112.575 against the yen.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen remained on the back foot against high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar on Friday after dovish comments from major policymakers this week reaffirmed market expectations that interest rates will rise very slowly.
""It is broadly a U.S. dollar-negative market as latest comments from Yellen and others suggest that interest rates will rise very gently and that is supportive for high-yielding currencies for now,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London.
The Aussie  and sterling  were among the best performing currencies, especially against the Japanese yen. 
Against the yen, the Australian dollar rose 0.23 percent and sterling climbed 0.31 percent, with a relatively upbeat outlook from Fitch Ratings on China also supporting risk sentiment.
Major market gauges of asset volatility, such as the Merrill Lynch Option volatility estimate <.MERMOVE1M> and VIX (VIX), drifted lower on Friday, providing a boost to carry trades. 
The U.S. currency's recent advance, notably against the yen , has stalled toward the end of this week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen curbed some of the monetary tightening expectations that had supported the greenback.
That view was further reinforced by other U.S. policymakers such as Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan on Thursday, though analysts were wary of kicking the dollar lower before U.S. inflation data. 
Signs of a pick-up in U.S. inflation could reinforce views that the Fed would hike interest rates again sooner rather than later, which would lift Treasury yields and the dollar.
However, the core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month.  

The euro was little changed at $1.1407 , unable to find much lift even as Germany's 10-year bond yield  climbed back above the 0.50 percent threshold overnight. That followed a report that the European Central Bank is likely to signal in September that its asset purchase program will be gradually wound down next year.

The dollar was also down against the Korean won by 0.03% in the morning to KRW1,136.
The greenback was also falling against the Australian dollar by 0.12% to AUS1.2921. The Aussie dollar, which often acts as a proxy for the Chinese yuan, has been supported this by stronger iron and oil prices. 
The Japanse yen weakened against the dollar Friday, giving up some early gaing. By mid-morning, it was trading at JPY113.44, losing 0.14% against the greenback. It was the worst performer in Asia. The yen started the year at JPY118.6 to the dollar. 
The Malaysian ringgit, which has made significant gains this year against the dollar also gave up a bit of ground in the morning. The USD/MYR pair was up 0.07% to 4.2955 as of midmorning.

(Reuters) - Bullish bets on most emerging Asian currencies eased in the last two weeks as a sell-off in bonds amid global monetary tightening boosted U.S. Treasury yields and brightened the outlook for the dollar, putting emerging market currencies under pressure, a Reuters poll showed.
Sentiment toward the Chinese yuan and the Malaysian ringgit improved further, however, with long positions in both currencies touching their largest in a month. 
Treasuries and benchmark European bond yields resumed their march upwards, having paused on Monday, as the focus shifted back to the pace of monetary tightening in the world's largest economies. 
Investors were estimated to have trimmed their bullish bets on most emerging Asian currencies, according to the poll of 17 analysts, traders and fund managers.
Bearish positions in the Philippine peso increased to their largest since late March after the peso hit its lowest since 2006 on Tuesday as data showed the Philippines posted its widest trade deficit in decades in May. 
The Philippines had a trade deficit of $2.753 billion in May, wider than the $2.24 billion gap in the same month last year.
Bets on the Taiwan dollar took a bearish turn for the first time since January. 
The poll was conducted between Tuesday and Wednesday. 
All of the responses came before Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's two-day Congressional address, even as the world's top bonds and emerging market currencies were under pressure on bets for higher interest rates in a small but growing group of major economies.
In remarks to the House Committee on Financial Services, Yellen said the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb further gradual rate increases along with the slow wind-down of the Fed's massive bond portfolio.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso surged on Wednesday to a more than one-year high, bolstered by growing confidence that U.S. President Donald Trump will not pull out of NAFTA, as well as a major oil discovery and dovish comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.
The Mexican currency  gained about 0.7 percent to 17.781 per dollar, a level not seen since May 2016. It has more than recovered from a plunge after Trump was elected and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican goods to protect U.S. industry.
Expectations that Trump will not shred the North American Free Trade Agreement have fed demand for the peso and helped make it the top-performing emerging-markets currency this year, with a 17 percent gain. On Wednesday it was 3 percent stronger than just before Trump unexpectedly won the election.
""None of the fears associated with Trump relative to Mexico have come anywhere near to fruition,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago. ""Assuming you don't see a spike in U.S. yields or an absolute implosion in the price of oil, I'd say the probability is that the peso continues to strengthen.""
Scalone said the peso could reach 16 per dollar, a level where he would consider selling. Strategists in a Reuters poll on average forecast last week that the peso would end 2017 at 18.5 per dollar.
Wednesday's peso gain stemmed partly from  Premier Oil  Plc's (L:PMO) discovery of potentially more than 1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Mexico, a major victory for Latin America's No. 2 economy.
Emerging markets currencies also benefited after Yellen said U.S. interest rates would not have to rise much further to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate. An increase in the spread between U.S. and Mexican interest rates could lure more traders to borrow dollars to buy Mexican peso debt.

At last week's G20 summit in Hamburg, Trump hailed progress on trade after meeting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for the first time, while Mexico's government said it expected a general agreement on modernizing NAFTA by the end of 2017.

The BoC raised the cash rate to 0.75% in a widely anticipated decision. It also raised the bank rate to 1% and the deposit rate to 0.5%.
The rate increase was the first under Governor Stephen Poloz, who took over at the helm of the bank in 2013 after his predecessor Mark Carney went to the Bank of England.
In a statement, the bank said growth is strengthening across the economy and becoming more sustainable.
""Recent data have bolstered the bank’s confidence in its outlook for above-potential growth and the absorption of excess capacity in the economy.""
The bank acknowledged recent softness in inflation, but said the factors behind it appear to be mostly temporary and noted that the adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete.
Expectations for a rate hike had been rising since senior BoC officials said last month that a pair of rate cuts in 2015 had done their job in cushioning the economy from the steep fall in oil prices.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2017 11:26AM ET</span>","Bank of England's Broadbent silent on rates, sends pound sliding","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent kept mum on his views about interest rates on Tuesday, prompting financial markets to assume he sees no pressing need to change.
Sterling hit an 8-month low against the euro as a result. (EURGBP=)
Broadbent's speech in Aberdeen to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry had been keenly watched as a chance to hear the views of a rate-setter who has not commented publicly since the Monetary Policy Committee came unexpectedly close to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade last month.
But Tuesday's comments shed little light.
Instead, he spoke on how a reduction in trade between Britain and the European Union would harm both economies and causes prices to rise.
His trade comments came after businesses last week pressed Prime Minister Theresa May to negotiate a smooth Brexit when Britain leaves the EU in just under two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter trade and investment.
If Britain could not trade easily with the EU, it would end up having to produce more of the things it is less efficient at creating and currently imports, Broadbent said.
""All else equal, the first shift - i.e. away from services exports - would tend to lower UK income, the second to raise certain costs - that is, of food and machinery,"" he said.
""Trade really is mutually beneficial and less of it costs us all,"" he added.
But it was his views on interest rates that were missing.
BoE VOTES
The MPC split 5-3 in favor of keeping rates at a record-low 0.25 percent, and since then both BoE Governor Mark Carney and chief economist Andy Haldane -- who backed keeping rates on hold -- have shown some willingness to consider a rate rise this year.
Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent -- who is deputy governor for monetary policy -- will be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade.
Broadbent has yet to dissent against the views of Carney since taking up his post as deputy governor in 2014.
Newcomer Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced hike advocate Kristin Forbes this month, has also not spoken publicly.
""You have to scrape the barrel to get Broadbent's views ahead of the August MPC. If scraping I would say (this) points to a 'no change' vote given recent weak exports data,"" said Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, on Twitter.
Previously, Broadbent has sounded cautious about the outlook for economy as Britain negotiates its departure from the EU.
In March he said British exporters cannot count on enjoying the ""sweet spot"" which was created by the Brexit vote last year for long.

Last week MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders said they were upbeat about the ability of exports and investment to help offset a slowdown in consumer spending.

There is also no necessity for China to devalue its currency, Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, wrote in state magazine Qiu Shi.
The yuan slumped about 6.5 percent against the dollar last year in its biggest annual drop since 1994. But since then, the yuan has regained its vigour, rising 2.4 percent against the dollar in the first half of 2017.
Faced with an entrenched bearish view on the yuan, Beijing moved swiftly to flush out currency speculators, quash expectations of a further steep depreciation and safeguard its reserves.
Data this week showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose to $3.057 trillion in June. It was the first time the reserves had climbed for five months in a row since June 2014.
U.S. President Donald Trump has also backed away from a campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator. Under U.S. law, labelling a country as currency manipulator can trigger an investigation and negotiations on tariffs and trade.
Despite the yuan's strength, China's trade balance has stayed at a surplus since March, indicating foreign demand for Chinese goods remains positive. 
""Capital outflows have eased markedly since the start of the year and are now mostly offset by the trade surplus,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Friday.

""This should prove supportive of the renminbi (yuan) which we think, contrary to the consensus, will strengthen against the U.S. dollar during the next couple of years.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained across the board on Friday in choppy trading after a report showed the U.S. economy created far more jobs than expected in June and the previous months, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least once this year.
Following the jobs report, the dollar rose to two-month highs against the yen, on pace to post its largest weekly percentage gain since late April. The greenback also rose to a more than one-week peak against sterling. 
Friday's data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Data for April and May was revised to show 47,000 more jobs created than previously reported.
""We view today's report as supportive of the Fed view that they can hike an additional time later this year, while starting to reduce the balance sheet in the fall,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston.
But while the employment headline number was strong, inflation pressure was still tame. Average hourly earnings, which currency and bond traders also monitor closely, increased just 0.2 percent in June, down from expectations of a 0.3 percent rise.
Loh said hourly earnings' 2.5 percent gain from a year earlier were disappointing, with growth slower than at the start of the year and mostly stagnant over the past several months.
The dollar initially weakened to 113.54 yen following the jobs report from 113.74 yen  minutes before the data's release, as investors focused mostly on the inflation implications of the average earnings growth. It was last at 113.88, up 0.6 percent.
The euro, on the other hand, rose to around $1.1430 , from $1.1411 ahead of the jobs report, and was last at $1.1395, down 0.2 percent. That pushed the dollar index up 0.3 percent at 96.042 (DXY)
Sterling, meanwhile, fell to a more than one-week low of $1.2871  and was last down 0.7 percent at $1.2882.

After the jobs data, U.S. short-term interest rate futures reflected continued bets that the Fed would raise interest rates in December.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Dollar bulls stumble as euro's outlook brightens: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The multi-year rising trend for the U.S. dollar appears to have hit a wall, with a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters less bullish on the greenback than at the start of the year and more optimistic about the euro.
The dollar has taken a beating in 2017 as economic growth and inflation in the United States has not taken off as previously thought, and President Donald Trump's reflationary policies have hit a series of political obstacles.
""The outlook for the dollar is less bullish than at the beginning of the year...given that the fiscal stimulus has not yet materialized and that the likelihood of any announcement in the second half of the year looks limited,"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, has lost nearly 6 percent this year, marking its weakest performance for the first half of a year in well over a decade.
While Reuters foreign exchange polls this year have predicted the dollar to strengthen slightly, the latest poll of around 70 strategists taken over the past week showed the outlook has broadly dimmed.
A majority of strategists, 43 of 71, who answered an extra question said their dollar outlook was less bullish now compared with the beginning of the year. Seventeen said they were more bearish, only five said they were more bullish, and the remaining six strategists said they were less bearish.
Speculators have also cut bets in favor of the dollar. Net long positions fell to their lowest in a year, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters.
POLICY DIVERGING LESS?
Improving economic growth in Europe and Canada has opened the door for a shift in monetary policy. Hints from both the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada that may happen soon have ramped up those expectations.
Pushing in the opposite direction, Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how the lack of it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises.
""The policy divergence trade, which created a significantly stronger dollar, is looking less and less well-grounded,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. 
""We could see less policy divergence going forward between the Fed and other central banks and that should encourage further reversal of dollar strength.""
But some strategists struck a more positive note. 
Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, argued that the shift in central banks' focus away from inflation and instead towards growth should help the dollar.
""Several G10 central banks have dropped their easing bias of late while the Fed has remained committed to its tightening cycle. This has given rise to the FX convergence trade where investors buy currencies with an improving growth outlook and ignore their challenging inflation outlook.""
""(The dollar) remains a reliable long - the 'cash cow' of the convergence trade – and it should benefit from an improving U.S. growth outlook"" in the second half of this year,"" added Marinov in a note to clients.
EURO FLAVOR FAVORED
The euro has gained around 8 percent against the dollar in 2017 so far. It is predicted to hold onto those gains over the coming 12 months, trading at around $1.13, roughly where it is now, and in one and 12 months' time.
That 12-month view is the strongest euro bet since a January 2015 Reuters foreign exchange poll, the month when the ECB announced that it would start buying bonds on a monthly basis.
A little over half the common contributors compared with the previous month have upgraded their 12-month euro view.
At the beginning of 2017, there were several forecasters calling for the euro to crash below parity to the dollar, but not a single strategist in the latest poll expects that to happen over the coming year.
That is mostly thanks to ECB President Mario Draghi's more upbeat assessment on the euro zone economy. However, Reuters polls over several years have been clear that a fall below parity wasn't likely.
""There is further scope for recent EUR trends to extend, but this is contingent on how ongoing ECB rhetoric unfolds from here,"" noted Daniel Hui, executive director of global FX strategy at J.P. Morgan.
""While EUR/USD is already very close to our year-end target of 1.15, this is not necessarily a hurdle, given that the strength in the pair is as much a manifestation of broad USD weakness, given the extreme subdued pricing for the Fed.""

165,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Fog around pound lifts a bit on dimmer U.S. dollar view: Reuters poll,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange strategists are now more optimistic about sterling against the dollar than they were at the start of 2017, with a majority becoming either less bearish or more bullish, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
But they were evenly split on how views on the pound against the euro had changed, with an equal number becoming more or less bearish. There was a similar trend as to whether they were more or less bullish.
""A lot of the reflationary expectations that were built into the dollar at the end of last year have been revised lower,"" said Jane Foley at Rabobank. ""Markets are no longer expecting (U.S. President Donald) Trump's 3 percent growth forecast to come to fruition.
""We weren't forecasting that the euro zone economy would be as strong as it has been this year. We had some euro strength but not enough,"" said Foley, who is now more bearish on sterling against the euro.
Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, and as Reuters polls predicted beforehand, the pound fell after the referendum.
A year later, sterling is still down around 10 percent against the dollar and 13 percent against the euro. But it is not expected to weaken much more. 
Median forecasts in a Reuters poll of around 60 strategists taken in the past week predicted the pound would be little changed from current levels at $1.29 in a month, dip to $1.28 by end-September and then to $1.27 six months later.
Those spot predictions were little changed from a June poll.
Against the single currency, the pound is expected to barely move over the forecast horizon. Forecasts are one euro will be worth 88.00 pence through 2017 and 88.25p in a year's time.
Soon after the referendum, the Bank of England cut interest rates and restarted its quantitative easing program to support an economy expected to slump. But until recently at least, the economy has fared better had been feared.
However, sterling's slide since the vote has driven inflation well above the Bank's 2 percent target, and last month three of the Bank's eight monetary policymakers voted for a rate increase.
""In the medium term, the BoE's lower tolerance for inflation means downside room for UK real yields is now much more limited. This means downside room for sterling is also more limited,"" Jordan Rochester and Yujiro Goto at Nomura said in a note.
One of the three policymakers has since left the BoE and few economists expect the central bank to tighten monetary policy anytime soon. Instead, they are waiting to see how the EU divorce talks progress.
There has so far been little clarity on that front. After Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, what approach the UK government will take to Brexit negotiations is even less clear.

The central banks of both countries in recent weeks removed long-held easing bias from their interest rate outlook, prodded in part by a U.S. Federal Reserve rate increase and the European Central Bank's hardening its dovish stance.
Norway's crown appeared poised for the biggest moves in the next 12 months. It was forecast to gain 5.5 percent from current levels against the dollar and 5.6 percent against the euro, the poll showed.
The Swedish crown was expected to rise by 4.0 percent against the dollar and 4.4 percent against the euro over the coming year.
""The Norwegian crown is too weak compared to the underlying fundamentals. The economy is improving, the oil price has picked up and the currency hasn't fully incorporated these developments,"" Nordea Markets economist Erik Bruce said.
""As for Sweden, the central bank is done with rate cuts, and we believe the economy will be strong enough to accommodate an increase in rates next year,"" he said.
The Norwegian crown was forecast to strengthen to 8.99 against the euro and 7.91 versus the dollar in the next 12 months from its current 9.52 and 8.37.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2017 01:40AM ET</span>",Outlook for Asian currencies brightens as Trump trade fades: Reuters poll,"By Vivek Mishra and Indradip Ghosh
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for emerging Asian currencies has brightened compared to the beginning of the year, driven largely by a weaker dollar on fading expectations for major U.S. tax cuts any time soon, a Reuters poll found.
Most Asian currencies have got the better of the dollar which has taken a beating on growing concerns over the U.S. administration's inability to deliver on promises made.
The Chinese yuan, a major focal point for global markets in the past few months as authorities scrambled to stabilize it and flush out speculators betting on a steep fall, looked set to end the year in better shape than previously thought.
The Taiwan dollar was among the best performers in Asia, up nearly 6 percent this year. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Thai baht have gained more than 4 percent.
The latest poll consensus of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists surveyed over the past week showed many of the major Asian currencies are likely to hold onto most of their gains made this year over the coming 12 months.
That is in contrast to a poll in January, which predicted a steep fall against the dollar on expectations for fiscal stimulus and a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.
""There has been some disappointment in lack of progress in the U.S. in terms of pushing through fiscal reforms and tax reforms, which is one of the reasons why the dollar hasn't done that well,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.
""We still do expect a small fiscal package at some point probably in the next year but the market has started to question (President Donald) Trump's ability to get as much done and I don't expect any kind of major fiscal stimulus to help the dollar jump higher.""
The Chinese yuan and Indian rupee have gained over 2 percent against the dollar this year, with half of those gains made over the last two months.
The yuan is predicted to trade at 6.95 per dollar by the end of this year, compared to 7.2 forecast at the beginning of the year. The Indian rupee is tipped around 65.5 to the dollar by end-2017 compared to 69.5 seen in January poll.
While the outlook has definitely brightened for Asian currencies, it is mainly due to the loss of momentum in the dollar with country-specific factors playing second fiddle.
Bets in the latest poll have turned less bullish for the dollar as much of the Federal Reserve's policy tightening plan has already been priced-in and the real risk now is that the central bank may be pushed off its path.
But a separate Reuters poll on positioning showed speculators trimmed their bullish bets in most of the Asian currencies, even as they increased their long positions in the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht. 
The outlook for the regional currencies was also supported by better economic performance and some reforms undertaken in recent months.
China's economy grew a solid 6.9 percent in the first quarter on a year earlier, supported by significant government infrastructure spending.
A string of curbs on capital outflows by Beijing, and the introduction of a different methodology to calculate the mid-point reference rate for the yuan by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has also helped restore market confidence in the currency.
""We have revised our USD/CNY forecast and the reason is that the dollar has not been stronger than we expected. The other reason is the Chinese economy has stabilized and that should be good for CNY,"" said Irene Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at ANZ.
Separately, the strength in the Indian rupee has been driven in part by confidence the government will likely pass through major reforms and on expectations for better economic growth.
The implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) by the government, touted as the biggest tax reform since independence, has bolstered the view on the Indian economy as well as the outlook for its stocks. 
""We are still quite constructive on the INR and the reason is reforms,"" added ANZ's Cheung.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2017 01:40AM ET</span>","Australian, NZ dollars seen flying high near-term, before gliding lower","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian and New Zealand dollars are expected to hold near multi-month peaks in the near-term but further gains are seen capped as their yield advantage narrows amid rising expectations of monetary tightening in Europe and the United States. 
A Reuters poll of 52 analysts predicted the Australian dollar at $0.7600 in one month, up from earlier expectations of $0.7400.
It was trading at $0.7585 on Friday after hitting a 3-1/2 month high of $0.7712 last week. 
The currency was seen at $0.7500 in three months, up 1 cent from the May survey. It will stay at that level over the next six months before edging lower to $0.7470 on a one-year horizon, the survey shows. 
The Aussie has been on an uptrend since early May, as a bull run in the U.S. dollar - which began when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November - ended. The antipodean currency is already up more than 5 percent so far this year, becoming one of the best performing major currencies.
""We are looking for a firmer Australian dollar largely because of an improvement in global economic activity which is supportive of commodity prices like iron ore,"" said Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at CBA.
CBA sees the Aussie at 78 U.S. cents in 12 months. 
""Australia's current account deficit is the smallest since the late 1970s and is only 6 percent of the country's economic output. That would continue to underpin the fundamental value of the Australian dollar,"" he added.
The commodity driven currency is finding support from higher prices for Australia's major exports - iron ore and coal - which have delivered seven straight months of trade surpluses after years of deficits.
However, analysts expect further upside to be capped as the Aussie's yield advantage narrows with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) staying pat on interest rates at the same time that the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy. 
Central banks in England, Europe and Canada are also sounding unexpectedly hawkish. In contrast, markets assume policymakers in Australia and New Zealand will keep their rates at record lows for a long time to come. 
The premium paid by Australian two-year debt over its U.S. counterpart has dwindled to just 33 basis points, the smallest since early 2001 and down from 119 basis points this time last year.
The New Zealand dollar was seen at $0.7200 in one month, up 2.8 cents from the April poll, but slipping to $0.7100 in three months. It was last at $0.7286, not far from a five month top.
The six-month outlook dropped further to $0.7050, staying there over the next 12 months.
The currency has been slipping since the Reserve Bank of New Zealand last month reaffirmed its intention not to raise rates for perhaps another two years, undermining carry trades. 
The Kiwi is also up more than 5 percent so far this year, with most of the gains coming in since early May.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 10:50PM ET</span>",Bitcoin can be an asset but not currency: China central bank adviser,"SHANGHAI, (Reuters) - Virtual currencies like bitcoin are assets but bitcoin in itself does not have the fundamental attributes needed to be a currency that could meet modern economic development needs, a Chinese central bank adviser said.
Sheng Songcheng, adviser to the People's Bank of China (PBOC), made the comments in an interview with financial magazine Yicai published late Thursday.
""Bitcoin does not have the fundamental attributes needed to be a currency as it is a string of code generated by complex algorithms... But I do not deny that virtual currencies have technical value and are a type of asset,"" he said.
His comments come after the Chinese central bank increased scrutiny of the country's bitcoin exchanges earlier this year, a move that prompted the companies to stop margin lending, introduced trading fees and issue rules to rein in users. 
Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000. China has classified it as a ""virtual good"".
Squaring in on bitcoin, Sheng said expectations that bitcoin supply would be capped in the year 2140 would make it difficult for it to become a medium of exchange that could meet modern economic development needs as money supply should be related to economic needs.

He also said that Chinese monetary authorities should study issuing a central bank virtual currency that it could regulate and run properly.

Ethereum mirrored Bitcoin’s move lower, easing from session highs of $275, to $264.45, up 0.94%. 
In the second half of 2017, the price of both Bitcoin and Ethereum is likely to be driven by initial coin offerings (ICOs), which can be thought of as a cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering. "

EUR/USD was up 0.3% to 1.1385 by 08.00 AM ET (11.00 AM GMT).
Policymakers judged that it was important to stress the stronger momentum of the euro area recovery, while emphasizing that inflation remained subdued.
Officials were concerned that even ""small and incremental"" changes to forward guidance would spook markets.
“It was necessary to avoid signals that could trigger a premature tightening of financial conditions,” the minutes said.
The minutes come after ECB President Mario Draghi appeared to open the door to policy adjustments in comments last week, fueling speculation the bank could start to scale back its stimulus program as soon as September.
Draghi said factors weighing on inflation in the euro area were mainly temporary, adding that the bank could look through them.
He also said the ECB sees growth that is above trend and well distributed across the euro area, but reiterated that “a considerable degree” of stimulus is still needed in the euro zone, and that the ECB must be “prudent” in how it unwinds it.
ECB sources subsequently said the markets had over interpreted Draghi’s remarks.
Earlier Thursday, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said the bank needs to be patient and maintain a steady hand in policy as inflation is still far below its target.
The euro was also higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP adding 0.24% to trade at 0.8798 and EUR/JPY advancing 0.36% to 129.06.

188,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 05, 2017 05:13AM ET</span>",Forex - Sterling hits days lows as UK service sector growth slows,"Investing.com - The pound slid to the days lows on Wednesday after data showing that growth in the dominant UK service sector slowed to its lowest in four months in June.
GBP/USD was down 0.13% to 1.2899 by 08.57 AM GMT (04.57 ET).
Financial data firm Markit said its services purchasing managers' index ticked down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just below economists’ forecasts for a reading of 53.5.
The report also showed that UK business optimism fell to its lowest level since last June’s EU referendum amid worries over heightened political uncertainty after last month’s election and the Brexit negotiations.
Markit said it saw a weak outlook for the economy, despite ""pockets of growth"" in financial services and business services.
Taken along with the other disappointing PMI data on manufacturing and construction earlier in the week, the figures indicate that Britain’s economy may slow in the coming months.
“A slowing in services sector growth completes a triple-whammy of disappointing PMI survey readings,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit.
“Given the deterioration in the forward-looking indicators, such as business optimism and order book growth, the risks are tilted towards the economy slowing in the third quarter.”
The rate of economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter as consumers were hit by slowing wage growth and accelerating inflation due to the steep drop in sterling since the Brexit vote.
The pound was little changed against the euro, with EUR/GBP at 0.8779.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2017 04:56AM ET</span>","Dollar goes higher against yen, flat vs. euro","By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar inched higher against the yen on Wednesday but struggled to make progress against the euro as investors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting and U.S. jobs data later in the week.
The dollar rose 0.3 percent to trade at 113.59 yen, its highest level in nearly two months. Against the euro, the greenback was broadly flat at $1.13530.
""Latest Fed communication suggests US monetary authorities are willing to look through currently weak inflation data,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note recommending selling the yen and Australian and New Zealand dollars against their U.S. counterpart. 
""It may not be only the Fed providing the USD with a lift. June labor market data starting with the release of the ADP report tomorrow, completed by Friday’s NFP, could start turning the U.S. surprise indicator around."" 
The yen tends to be bought back at times of heightened global uncertainty because of expectations Japanese investors may repatriate their foreign investment, despite the country's proximity to North Korea.
Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead. That triggered a call by Washington for global action to hold the isolated nation accountable for its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
With very little in the way of big U.S. economic data in the coming days, the release of the June 14 Fed minutes will dominate the next 24 hours. Investors will look for clues on the likely outlook of the balance sheet reduction.
In other currencies, sterling languished at one-week lows on Wednesday as investors reduced positions amid growing evidence the economy was facing headwinds.
""The pressure will remain on the sterling in the short term as the downside risks have intensified and in that backdrop the recent hawkishness by central bank officials may not be justified,"" said Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) strategist Neil Mellor.
Data earlier this week offered more evidence of softness in the UK economy with a purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey showing activity falling to 54.8 in June. That was still above the 50 level that denotes growth but down from May's 18-month high of 56.0 and slightly below the median forecast of a Reuters poll. 
On Tuesday, a Bank of England policymaker who last month voted to raise interest rates was quoted as saying on Tuesday that he was ""reasonably confident"" that investment and exports would compensate for a consumer slowdown. 
Last week, Governor Mark Carney said a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity and the BoE would debate when to do so ""in the coming months"".
That prompted the sterling to post its best weekly performance in eight months last week.

The Canadian dollar also held firm, trading at C$1.2944 per dollar after having hit a 10-month high of C$1.2912 to the dollar on Tuesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on Monday, starting the new quarter on a positive note, bolstered by higher U.S. government bond yields and a private report that showed manufacturing activity increased to its strongest level in nearly three years.
The greenback just came off its worst quarter since 2010 last week as overseas central banks have signaled they are considering whether to begin reducing monetary stimulus in light of evidence their local economies are doing better.
""The market is debating whether central banks could follow through with their tightening. So far the data are going central banks' way,"" said Steven Englander, head of research and strategy at Rafiki Capital Management in New York.
Earlier Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 57.8 last month, the highest reading since August 2014.
This upbeat factory report propelled benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) to 2.346 percent, the highest in nearly seven weeks, Reuters data showed. 
A closely watched index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies (DXY) was 0.6 percent at 96.192, rebounding from its lowest level since early October seen on Friday.
The dollar index shed 4.71 percent in the second quarter, its steepest quarterly loss since the 8.49 percent drop in third quarter of 2010.
The greenback climbed to a six-week high against the yen at 113.37 yen. It was last up 0.9 percent at 113.34 yen .
The euro  retreated from its highest in more than a year against the dollar last week. It was last down 0.5 percent at $1.1369.
Currency trading activity was muted ahead of the U.S. July Fourth holiday. U.S. financial markets will close early on Monday and will be shut on Tuesday. 
Ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Sweden's Riksbank, the Swedish crown was down 0.6 percent at 8.4771 crown per dollar .

204,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 03, 2017 11:03AM ET</span>","GOLDMAN SACHS: Bitcoin could see a big drop then surge to almost $4,000","Bitcoin had a blistering first half of 2017. It rallied from about $1,000 a coin to a record high near $3,000 before finishing June near $2,500. It booked a first-half gain of about 168%.
The historic run for the cryptocurrency has prompted observers both in the tech world and on Wall Street to talk about the cryptocurrency being in a ""bubble.""
Last week, Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), suggested bitcoin was in a bubble unlike any we had ever seen before. Kleintop's warning came just a few weeks after tech billionaire Mark Cuban tweeted: ""I think it's in a bubble. I just don't know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) thinks bitcoin could see a big drop before running to another record high. In a note to clients sent out Sunday, Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at Goldman Sachs, suggested that while bitcoin's correction hadn't run its course, the cryptocurrency was ultimately heading higher.
Jafari wrote bitcoin was ""still in a corrective 4th wave"" that ""shouldn't go much further than 1,857."" That would make for a drop of about 25% from its current level.
But bitcoin enthusiasts shouldn't worry too much, according to Jafari, because from there she sees the fifth wave of the move taking the cryptocurrency to a record high.
""From current levels, this has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212 (if equal to the length of wave I),"" Jafari wrote. ""There’s potential to extend as far as 3,915 (if 1.618 times the length of wave I). It just might take time to get there."""

Production and new orders grew in June, but at a slower rate than in the previous month. The report also noted that demand from domestic and export markets both slowed, dimming optimism that the weaker pound would make exports more competitive.
The data also dampened hopes that the economy is rebounding after it grew by just 0.2% in the first quarter.
“While the survey data add to signs that the economy is likely to have shown stronger growth in the second quarter, further doubts are raised as to whether this performance can be sustained into the second half of the year,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2017 12:03PM ET</span>",Dollar set for biggest quarterly drop in nearly seven years,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered slightly on Friday but remained set for its biggest quarterly decline against a basket of rival currencies in nearly seven years after hawkish signals from foreign central banks this week pressured the greenback further. 
Investors have ramped-up expectations for tighter monetary policy from the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Canada after hints from officials this week. This has made the greenback less attractive, in addition to doubts that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year and that U.S. President Donald Trump could enact his pro-growth agenda.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was set to decline about 4.6 (DXY) percent for the second quarter to mark its steepest quarterly percentage drop since the third quarter of 2010.
The euro was set to gain more than 7 percent against the greenback for its biggest quarterly percentage gain since the third quarter of 2010. The euro has racked up about 2 percent of its gains and the dollar index has posted 1.6 percent of its losses this week alone. 
""What really gave the hawkish central banks extra punch was how it seemed to be a coordinated effort to signal a shift away from low-rate policies,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. 
He said improving economic growth in Europe and Canada opened the door for those comments and was ""a reality check how the U.S. isn’t standing head and shoulders above everyone else.""
The dollar index was last up 0.1 percent at 95.727, while the euro was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.1412. The euro touched its strongest in nearly 14 months on Thursday of $1.1445, while the dollar index touched a roughly nine-month low of 95.470 early Friday. 
Analysts said Friday's bounce for the dollar came as some traders likely took profits on gains in the euro as well as the sterling. The dollar fell against the Canadian dollar, however, and was last at C$1.2985 after touching a nearly 10-month low of C$1.2948 earlier. 

""It appears as though the euro and the pound could be testing some resistance levels, and that could also contribute to...the profit-taking,"" said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2017 07:20AM ET</span>",Brightening economy sets euro up for strongest quarter since debt crisis,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro came off yearly highs on Friday but was still set for its strongest quarter in six years as investors piled into the currency on a brightening euro zone economy and its implications for monetary policy in the bloc.
The single currency dropped 0.35 percent to trade at $1.1402, but in the April-June quarter the euro has climbed over 7 percent, putting it on track for its biggest quarterly gain since January-March 2011. <EUR=EBS>
The euro shot to one-year highs after Tuesday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi bolstered expectations that a reduction in stimulus measures would be signaled as soon as September.
Though policymakers sought to play this down in the days that followed, investors appear convinced that economic strength will push them to end stimulus sooner rather than later.
""This is partly a response to Draghi's comments and also on the back of a euro zone economy that is firing on all cylinders and outperforming the rest of the developed economies,"" said Investec economist Victoria Clarke.
Growth in the bloc outstripped that of the United States in the first quarter and set the stage for a strong 2017.
""It's at a different stage in the cycle to the U.S. so I do expect some of that to cool in the second half of the year, but the growth momentum doesn't seem to be going anywhere,"" said Clarke.
Money markets are pricing in around an 80 percent chance that the ECB will hike rates over the next year. That's up from just 20 percent earlier this month .
Underlying inflation in the euro zone ticked up this month, official data showed on Friday, welcome relief for the ECB as it braces for weak oil prices to drag consumer prices down in the coming months.
Conversely, the dollar was on course for its worst quarter in seven years on Friday, recovering only marginally against major peers.
""Obviously there's a shift afoot. It really seems that there's some coordinated effort going on out here among the G10 central banks,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore, referring to the series of hawkish-sounding comments on monetary policy.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a rate hike was likely to be needed as the British economy came closer to running at full capacity.
Sterling <GBP=D3> edged lower 0.3 percent on Friday to $1.2967, halving Thursday's 0.6 percent gain.
Two top policymakers at the Bank of Canada also suggested they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July.
The euro zone inflation data pushed European shares up 0.55 percent on Friday (STOXXE), but they were still set to end June with their biggest monthly loss in a year as worries over tightening monetary conditions soured the mood. U.S. stock futures also pointed toward a higher open in Wall Street. (ESc1)
Earlier, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.7 percent, after hitting a two-year high on Thursday. It is up 5.3 percent for the quarter and has risen 18.3 percent this year.
In commodities, oil prices continued their recovery this week on a decline in weekly U.S. crude production.
U.S. crude (CLc1) added 0.9 percent to $45.35 a barrel in its seventh straight session of gains, bringing its weekly increase to over 5 percent.
Global benchmark Brent (LCOc1) gained 0.7 percent to $47.77 a barrel, poised for a nearly 10 percent rise for the quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro jetted past $1.14 to its highest in just under 14 months on Thursday, with attempts by European Central Bank sources to moderate the message taken from a speech by President Mario Draghi this week falling on deaf ears.
Three days of the biggest gains in more than a year for the single currency have pushed the broader dollar index to its lowest since October and prompted some of the market's biggest dollar supporters to call the currency's rally over.
Draghi's speech on Tuesday - coming amid a raft of hawkish signals from other major global central banks - convinced markets the ECB was preparing to start withdrawing its own emergency stimulus for the euro zone economy later this year.
After a long run lower, that has put the euro back in relatively uncharted territory, with some analysts arguing there is little technical resistance beneath $1.20.
""The biggest test will be 1.1500,"" said RBC's head of global FX strategy Elsa Lignos. 
""Though month-end USD selling may reinforce the bearish USD sentiment in the next few days, we still think EUR’s rally is more likely to run out of steam at 1.15.""
By 0730 GMT, the euro was trading 0.4 percent stronger at $1.1425, having broken briefly above last year's June high of $1.1428. <EUR=> It was also 0.4 percent higher against the yen at 128.275 yen. (EURJPY=) 
The other big gainers among the G10 group of major developed world currencies over the past 24 hours were the Canadian dollar and sterling, both also driven by comments by their respective central bank governors. 
Sterling gained another half a percent in morning trade in London, stopping just shy of its first break above $1.30 in five weeks.  
""This is simply the central banks getting together and trying to arrest inflation,"" said Nomura's head of G10 currency trading Peter Gorra. 
""They are trying to be as smart as they can and agreeing that they have to act in unison. I don't think this is necessarily a dollar move and I don't think the dollar's rally is over. They are just trying to add some two-way risk to the market.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar touched its lowest level against the euro in a year on Wednesday after hawkish comments from the head of the Bank of England fueled bets on tighter monetary policy in Europe, while Tuesday's delay to a U.S. healthcare vote also hurt the greenback.
The euro extended the prior session's rally against the dollar, which had sent it to its strongest one-day percentage gain against the greenback in more than a year, while sterling also jumped after BoE Governor Mark Carney said the central bank is likely to need to raise interest rates as the British economy comes closer to operating at full capacity.
Speaking at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, Carney said the BoE will debate this ""in the coming months.""
Carney's remarks convinced traders that European monetary policy was shifting in a more hawkish direction, analysts said, just a day after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the bank's stimulus policy, fuelling market expectations that the ECB will announce a reduction of stimulus as soon as September.
Analysts said Draghi's comments continued to support the euro even as sources familiar with the ECB chief's thinking said Wednesday that he intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening.
“There is a bit of a concern in the markets about the fact that the balance of monetary policy expectations is moving a little bit in a more hawkish direction in Europe,"" said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.
The euro rose as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar to a one-year high of $1.1390 <EUR=> after jumping 1.4 percent Tuesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell as much as 0.4 percent to hit a more than seven-month low of 95.967 (DXY).

The announcement on Tuesday that U.S. Senate Republican leaders postponed a vote on a healthcare overhaul continued to fuel skepticism that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration would realize pro-growth infrastructure spending and tax reform policies, hurting the dollar.

“Prospects for infrastructure spending and tax reform are fading by the minute,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2017 09:05AM ET</span>","Euro surges nearly 1 percent after Draghi comments, dollar slips","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro surged almost 1 percent against the dollar on Tuesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks that might begin to reduce the Bank's emergency stimulus to the economy shortly.
Speaking to a conference in Portugal, Draghi said the central bank could adjust its policy tools of sub-zero interest rates and massive bond purchases as economic prospects improve in Europe.
But any change in the bank's stance should be gradual as ""considerable"" monetary support is still needed and the rebound in inflation will also depend on favorable global financing conditions, he added.
That sounded to investors, however, that he was ready to give more ground on German demands that the ECB start reducing the volume of extra euros it is feeding monthly into the economy.
The euro surged as Draghi spoke, rising as much as half a percent on the day to $1.1277, its highest level since Jun. 14, up nearly 1 percent on the day. 
Draghi also hinted at a willingness to look through some of the factors holding down price growth, which Martin Arnold, currency strategist with ETF Securities in London, said was what the market was reacting to. 
""However, he's got a track record of keeping the stimulus in place so when you've got a market that's positioned ... for euro longs, we're just concerned that there's more downside risk to the euro than upside because it could unwind pretty quick if action doesn't follow the rhetoric,"" Arnold said.
The single currency's strength pulled the dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, to an eight-day low of 96.846, more than half a percent lower on the day. (DXY)
The greenback recovered some ground against the Japanese yen however, up 0.1 percent at 111.910 yen, and off a five-week high of 112.075 hit in Asian trading. 
Investors were awaiting speeches by Federal Reserve officials for signs on whether the central bank will stick to its guns and raise rates this year.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen addresses the British Academy in London at 1700 GMT, less than two hours after an address by Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in the same city at 1515 GMT. 
Fed officials have signaled they will look through a slowdown in inflation and continue on their current trajectory of interest rate hikes - though investors are skeptical and market pricing shows only a 40 percent chance of a rise at the Fed's December meeting.
A positive view from Yellen despite a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data would support the Fed's forecast for another rise in policy rates this year.
""A notion increasingly shared in the market ... is that the Fed is continuing to normalize monetary policy regardless of more muted inflation developments,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist with  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
""This suggests that the market-based rate expectations have additional room of adjusting to the upside should this notion become even a bigger one."" 
Sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.2756, staying broadly unchanged after the Bank of England tightened capital controls on banks in Britain.  [GBP/]

The comments came during the keynote speech at the ECB’s central banking forum in Portugal.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2017 11:22AM ET</span>","Dollar dips after weak U.S. data; Yellen, Draghi speeches awaited","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a more than one-week low against the euro on Monday after weaker-than-expected economic data fueled doubts about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike timeline, while caution ahead of speeches from central bank officials limited the move. 
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent in May, the largest decline since December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.3 percent last month.
The report added to growing worries that an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter may not be as robust as expected. Recent data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation have given pause and housing data has been mixed.
Those worries have stoked doubts that the Fed will be able to follow through on its plan to boost interest rates one more time this year and three times next year. 
The durable goods data ""is certainly is a small reminder of other pieces of more important data that haven’t been particularly strong,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.
""The dollar has lost a bit of its appeal because of the fact that many market participants think that the Fed is less likely to raise rates."" 
The euro <EUR=> rose against the dollar to $1.1219, its highest since June 15, and was last up 0.2 percent at $1.1214. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was only down 0.1 percent at 97.165 (DXY) as anticipation of comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Monday and a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday mitigated the dollar's losses. 
""We’ll know more from Yellen tomorrow,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd in New York. ""Traders are still split on what the Fed is going to do.""
While the dollar was slightly higher against the yen at 111.38 yen <JPY=>, it dipped against emerging market currencies such as the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. 
Scalone of TJM Brokerage said traders were buying emerging market currencies for their higher yields given low trading volatility. 

""We are unfortunately in the midst of the summer doldrums,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar sagged against its major peers on Monday, losing traction as U.S. Treasury yields stayed low amid fading expectations that the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again later this year.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a fraction lower at 97.239 (DXY), adding to Friday's losses when it fell 0.4 percent.
The index had climbed to a one-month peak of 97.871 earlier last week, supported by expectations that the Fed, fresh from a mid-June rate hike, would tighten policy again as early as September.
But such expectations ebbed over the course of a week, with investors doubtful of another rate increase this year as U.S. data on balance have fallen short of forecasts.
""The main reason behind the weakness of the dollar, which has lost its upward momentum since the Fed rate hike, is U.S. yields stuck at low altitude,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Yields appear to better reflect U.S. fundamentals relative to equities, and in focus this week are political developments and the various indicators due for release.""

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) rose briefly after the Fed tightened policy this month but have drifted lower since as expectations of low inflation continued to boost demand for longer-dated debt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Friday, on track for its biggest single-day drop in three weeks, on persistent doubts whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again this year due to softening inflation data.
The greenback was also broadly weaker versus commodity-linked currencies, which got a boost as global benchmark Brent futures recovered from a seven-month low.
Sterling rose for a third consecutive day following a speech by soon-to-depart Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes, who late Thursday urged hiking U.K. rates immediately to stem a weaker pound.
Trading volume was muted in the absence of major economic data, according to traders and analysts.
""This has been largely a week of consolidation among major currency pairings given the lack of economic data this week,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six major peers (DXY), fell 0.37 percent at 97.232, retreating further from a one-month peak reached on Tuesday. 
The euro  was up 0.45 percent at $1.1200, while the greenback  slipped to 111.22 yen.
The pound  gained 0.4 percent at $1.2728. 
The greenback rose earlier this week on comments from New York Fed President William Dudley, who said a tightening labor market would push up wages and cause U.S. inflation to reverse from its current pullback.
The U.S. Consumer Price Index has come in weaker-than-expected for three consecutive months. This raised concerns whether inflation would reach the Fed's 2 percent goal.
Traders, however, were doubtful about this premise, which would support the case for another rate increase later this year as recent U.S. data on balance have fallen short of forecast.
On Friday, Markit's flash June reports on U.S. factory and services activity was weaker than expected, while the government said new home sales rebounded more than expected in May.
""The data need to confirm the Fed's stance for another rate hike this year,"" Esiner said.
The futures market implied traders saw a 53 percent chance the Fed would raise rates in December  , CME Group's FedWatch program showed.
Meanwhile, commodity-linked currencies rose with a rebound in crude oil prices. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 0.9 percent at $45.62 a barrel after hitting their lowest since November on Thursday.

The Australian dollar  was up 0.5 percent at $0.7578, while the New Zealand dollar  was up 0.4 percent at $0.7291.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2017 07:31AM ET</span>","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain's pound. 
No more. 
In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain's decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.
Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.
That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling. 
There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi's promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.
But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound. 
That is the first time in Reuters' historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound's exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides. 
With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal  on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness. 
This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.
On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.
On Wednesday, the central bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year. 
Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad. 
Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk. 
""Risk reversals tend to price fear,"" said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market. 
""It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people's minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.""
At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority. 
Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound. 
""The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,"" said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London. 

""That is a change.""

Prices plunged to as low as 10 cents from around $317 in a matter of seconds on the U.S.-based GDAX exchange operated by Coinbase, which is being blamed on a ""multimillion dollar market sell"" order.
Adam White, the vice president of GDAX, posted on the exchange's blog, outlining what took place in late trade on Wednesday. According to White, the multimillion dollar market sell order resulted in a number of orders being filled from $317.81 to $224.48.
As the price continued to fall, another 800 stop loss orders and margin funding liquidations caused Ethereum to trade as low as 10 cents. White also noted that these trades are final and will not be reversed.
Ethereum has since snapped back to around its pre-flash-crash level, trading at around $324 on Thursday morning in New York, down about 3%. The digital currency is up roughly 3,600% so far in 2017.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>",Dollar five-year super-cycle is over: Barclays,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rises in U.S. interest rates will probably prop the dollar up over the next 18 months, but its multi-year run higher since 2012 looks to be over, strategists from British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note on Thursday.
The swifter recovery of U.S. banks and the U.S. economy after the global financial crisis of 2008 have funded a stronger dollar in recent years, firstly against the yen  in 2012 and 2013 and then more broadly from the second half of 2014.
But those moves have long been stalling against the euro  and the yen, and a downturn in data - and faith in the economic promises of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration - this year have brought the index that measures the greenback's broader strength down from 14-year peaks. (DXY) 
""We believe the USD super-cycle of the past five years is over: the cyclical divergence that helped the dollar in these years has likely peaked, not only because of the European recovery, but also because the U.S. business cycle is more advanced than in Europe,"" Barclays said in an updated global outlook dated June 22.
""Valuations also suggest downside risks over the medium term, though for the immediate future, we expect the dollar to move sideways against major currencies.""
The bank accompanied the report with new currency forecasts which called for the dollar to weaken by 2-3 percent against China's yuan over the next year  and by almost 7 percent against the yen. 

It forecast the U.S. currency would strengthen to $1.06 per euro at the start of next year, before weakening back to $1.12, close to current levels.

LONDON (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar was the main mover in an otherwise dormant market in major global currencies on Thursday, up half a percent after the country’s central bank made no clear effort to talk the currency down at a regular policy meeting. 
With European stock markets set to fall for a third day, investors sought the traditional security of the yen, pushing it around 0.3 percent higher against both the euro (EURJPY=) and the dollar <JPY=> in the first hour of European trade.
Dealers said ""short"" bets against the kiwi had been squeezed after the central bank sounded several upbeat notes on the outlook for growth and impact of current exchange rates.
A number of banks had been calling for more gains for the kiwi around the meeting, arguing that a 3 percent gain since May still leaves it well undervalued compared to long term measures of fair value and others in the commodities currencies bloc more exposed to falling oil prices.
""While the RBNZ kept a neutral stance and continued to pledge to keep rates low for a long time, it did not complain strongly about the currency’s recent strength, which caused the New Zealand dollar to rise post the decision,"" analysts from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a morning note. 
By 0700 GMT, the kiwi had climbed 0.5 percent to $0.7256.  
It was also around 0.4 percent higher against both the Aussie and Canadian dollars - both currencies that tend to be closely dependent on the prices of oil and other major commodities. 
After a dip in the past week, however, there was little sign of more pain for the group, despite a fall in Brent crude to less than $45 a barrel overnight. [O/R] The Aussie and the Canadian dollar were both roughly steady against their U.S. counterpart  .
In an updated outlook for the year ahead published on Thursday,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) called for the kiwi to gain almost 5 percent against the Aussie over the next year. 
""The NZD has performed well despite RBNZ trying to dampen expectations of an early rate rise,"" the British bank said. 
""Strong net permanent and long-term migration is helping to support domestic activity and lift business sentiment, but also
... dampening wage pressures. If the RBNZ were to raise rates faster than expected in 2018, the NZD could outperform.""
The central bank of another major oil producers, Norges Bank, makes its own regular statement on policy at 0800 GMT. Its crown currency was 0.1 percent stronger in early trade in Europe. <NOK=> (EURNOK=)
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was roughly flat at 97.54, having retreated from a one-month high of 97.871 set on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity-linked currencies such as the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian crown were on the back foot on Wednesday, dragged lower by declining oil prices, while sterling wallowed near two-month lows.
Oil prices held near multi-month lows on Wednesday as investors discounted evidence of strong compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output. 
That pulled the commodity-linked complex of currencies lower with the Norwegian crown languishing close to 5-month lows against the dollar after falling half a percent on Tuesday.
It last traded at 8.5564 crowns per dollar, down 0.2 percent on the day. 
The Canadian dollar, which fell about 0.4 percent on Tuesday, traded at C$1.3296 per dollar , down 0.2 percent on the day. It moved further away from a 3-1/2-month high of C$1.3165 reached a week ago after Bank of Canada's governor expressed support for an interest rate hike. 
The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.7550  and the New Zealand dollar was 0.2 percent lower at $0.7228 .
""The culprit behind their (commodity currencies) lackluster performance is the oil price in recent days,"" said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
""The key question for the FX markets on the day is the extent to which the oil price weakness will ultimately grow into a broad-based risk-off move.""
The safe-haven yen, which tends to gain when ""risk-on"" commodity currencies decline, rose 0.3 percent to 111.120 yen per dollar. 
The dollar itself stayed tightly range-bound, almost flat against a basket of peers at 97.764. (DXY)
The euro was also flat at $1.1132, off a seven-month peak of $1.1296. 
Sterling hit fresh two-month lows, extending its declines after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that now was not the time to raise British interest rates. It was last 0.3 percent lower at $1.2590. 
Last week three out of eight BoE policymakers voted in favor of a rate hike and raised hopes for a near-term tightening. 
Prime Minister Theresa May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists' Party, nearly two weeks after Britain's election produced no clear majority for any party. 
""Sterling is weak as this political risk premium embedded in the pound looks like it is set to extend into next week with the DUP and the Conservative Party still not finalizing talks,"" said Stephen Gallo, currency strategist with BMO Capital Markets in London.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A slew of Western investors and traders who placed bets in the past two years that China’s yuan currency would drop because of a weaker Chinese economy, the threat of a debt crisis, and capital outflows, abandoned those positions in recent months.
They have decided that – at least in the short term - they may well be on a loser if they try to fight the People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, which has been taking a series of measures that appear aimed at keeping the currency stable.
For graphic on Yuan cross rates interactive click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rcyMrv
This is particularly the case ahead of an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China, that is expected to allow Chinese leader Xi Jinping to consolidate his power. Also, the Chinese economy has been more robust than expected, the nation’s authorities have taken stiff measures to reduce capital outflows, and the U.S. dollar has been retreating from gains it made last year.
Major global fund managers – such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management, Old Mutual Global Investors,  Standard Life  (LON:SL) Investments and  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors -- have taken off short yuan positions even as many of them see some weakness further down the road.
The PBOC has made some moves to defend the yuan, which is also known as the renminbi. It has pushed up the cost of short-selling the currency and even changing the way it sets a daily mid-point used as a benchmark.
""They are not happy with a really weaker renminbi,"" said Mark Nash, the London-based head of global bonds at Old Mutual Global Investors. ""People obviously don’t want to fight the central bank.” 
Nash, whose firm manages $44.7 billion globally, said he had been short the yuan at the turn of 2017 but took that position off early in the year.
But he said he believes the strength in the yuan is reflective more of ""an exercise in financial regulation"" rather than an improvement in China's economic outlook and hopes to go short again soon.
Standard Life Investments' Hong Kong-based emerging markets fixed income fund manager, Mark Baker, said he gave up his short yuan position in the first quarter of 2017, after seeing the success China was having with capital controls and some improvement in economic data. ""There is a desire to rein in expectations that the currency is merely a one-way bet,” he said.
The PBOC did not respond to a Reuters request for comments for this article.
The yuan  has risen 2 percent against the dollar so far this year. In the latest policy tweak, the PBOC has included a ""counter-cyclical factor"" in its method for fixing the daily mid-point around which the currency is allowed to trade. 
The adjustment to the fixing method in May was the second this year and came after a string of capital control moves, all aimed at stopping domestic Chinese investors from moving cash abroad.
That has put a floor under a currency which fell 6.5 percent in 2016 and 4.5 percent in 2015. Concern about the decline led the central bank to spend a trillion dollars over 2-1/2-years to defend the yuan. 
Short yuan positions are expensive. It costs about 5 percent annually to own and short the yuan directly based on short-term borrowing costs, though there are a myriad ways in which an investor or trader can structure a short bet. Some investors interviewed for this article said they mainly use offshore forward currency contracts - settled for cash at a particular date - which makes the trade somewhat cheaper. 
INTENTIONS UNCLEAR 
Beijing is also keen on keeping the yuan strong so that U.S. President Donald Trump isn’t given any reason to take tough trade measures against China. During the election campaign, Trump had accused Beijing of manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive, hurting U.S. companies. 
The stronger yuan also helps to dissuade Chinese companies and citizens from moving money offshore. Jonathan Xiong, head of the fixed income alternatives group at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said he closed out his short yuan positions at the beginning of the year as China’s growth prospects improved. Stuart Ritson, head of Asian rates and FX at Aviva Investors, with about $453 billion under management, removed his short position around the end of the first quarter, and is now positive on the yuan owing to the PBOC's preference for a stronger currency, reduced capital outflows and because the yuan offers one of the best yields relative to volatility among emerging market currencies. Ritson hasn’t taken a bullish bet as yet. 
Not everyone has left the trade. Kyle Bass, the founder of Dallas-based hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, has kept his short position because he says he believes the nation’s credit bubble problems are “metastasizing.” 
Bass, has long argued that the Chinese yuan is set to fall 30 percent against the U.S. dollar. “The numbers are telling me that we are right. The numbers are getting so bad so quickly,” he said. 
But even those who see the currency weakening have pulled back their forecasts. Deutsche Bank's chief China economist, Zhiwei Zhang, sees the yuan ending the year at 7.1 per dollar, rather than the 7.4 he was forecasting at the beginning of the year. There should be some weakness, he says, because economic growth is likely to slow, capital controls could become less effective over time and the dollar may not continue depreciating, 
At the other end of the spectrum are fund managers such as Jan Dehn, London-based head of research at asset manager Ashmore Group, who says he believes the market shouldn't be blind-sided by conspiracy theories. 
""The recent stabilization of the yuan has perfectly sound foundations and can be explained without having to resort to some suspect or obscure schemes on the part of Chinese policy makers,"" said Dehn.

“Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any bank rate increase,” Carney explained in a speech at the Manor House breakfast in the U.K.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2017 01:39AM ET</span>",Dollar firmer versus yen after Fed's Dudley strikes hawkish tone,"By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar reached a more than three-week high versus the yen on Tuesday, after an influential Federal Reserve official said U.S. inflation should rise alongside wages, reinforcing expectations for the Fed to keep raising interest rates.
At one point, the dollar rose to 111.775 yen , reaching its strongest level since May 26. That marked a gain of about 2.7 percent from the dollar's near 2-month low of 108.81 yen set on June 14.
The greenback last stood at 111.67 yen, up 0.1 percent on the day.
The dollar was lifted on Monday when New York Fed President William Dudley said that tightening in the labour market should help drive up inflation.
That helped offset concerns among some investors that stubbornly low inflation could prevent the Fed from raising interest rates further this year.
Dudley's comments reinforced the message from last week's Fed meeting and gave a boost to the dollar, said Teppei Ino, analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore.
The dollar is now near some key technical resistance levels, including its May 24 intraday high of 112.13 yen, Ino said.
""It's sort of at a crossroads now. If it gets through these levels, that could open the way for further gains, at least from a technical perspective,"" he said.
Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday it may be worthwhile for the U.S. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise interest rates again. 
The greenback has edged higher since the Fed on June 14 raised interest rates for a second time in 2017 and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities later this year, while indicating that a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory. 
The dollar may see further gains against the yen, especially after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week indicated the BOJ would be in no hurry to dial back its massive stimulus programme, said Tan Teck Leng, forex analyst for UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.
""Short-term, maybe the dollar/yen could be the one that's more interesting,"" Tan said. However, any weakness in U.S. inflation data going forward would pose a risk for dollar bulls, he added. 
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar (DXY) rose to as high as 97.609 at one point on Tuesday, its highest level since May 30. The dollar index last traded at 97.514.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1156. .
Sterling held steady at $1.2740 , ahead of speeches by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and British finance minister Philip Hammond later on Tuesday.

The two men in charge of Britain's economy are expected to spell out how they plan to prevent a further hit to its already weakened growth prospects following this week's launch of the historic Brexit talks.

EUR/USD succumbed to dollar strength and traded down 0.22% to $1.1171, despite the fact that French President Emmanuel Macron's government promised on Monday to renew politics in France as final official results showed he had won the commanding parliamentary majority that he had sought to push through his far-reaching pro-growth reforms.

LONDON (Reuters) - The differing messages of the world's major central banks on inflation and monetary policy prodded the dollar and euro higher against the yen on Monday, with traders eyeing a series of appearances by U.S. Federal Reserve officials this week. 
Fed chief Janet Yellen's confidence as her team raised interest rates for the third time in six months last week surprised investors who had expected more caution about the economy.
There are signs, however, that the market does not believe Fed forecasts that show it will be able to continue raising rates later this year and any signs of doubt from other Fed officials speaking this week may hurt the dollar.
The dollar was up just under 0.1 percent against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength. (DXY)
""I think that the burden of proof for the dollar (to appreciate) is pretty high,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC in London. 
""Even if there isn't going to be any outright criticism of Yellen, if you don't think U.S. (10-year government bond) yields are going to be above 2.20 percent then it is tough to buy into it.""
U.S. market interest rates point to a less than 40 percent chance of the Fed hiking rates by December and data on Friday showed investors had further reduced net bets on the dollar gaining ahead of last week's Fed meeting.
Friday's Bank of Japan meeting, however, played down even the chance of it beginning to reduce emergency stimulus for the economy and the yen was again weak on Monday, down 0.2-0.3 percent against the dollar and euro.  (EURJPY=)
Against the dollar, the euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1185  after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday, taking little from French President Emmanuel Macron's landslide in parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Polls had widely favored Macron and interest in French politics has declined since the risk of a far-right president who might take the country out of the euro abated with his defeat of Marine Le Pen last month.
Sterling was steady ahead of the formal start of negotiations on Britain's planned exit from the European Union, expected by many analysts to generate negative headlines for the currency in the weeks ahead. 
""While medium-term (sterling) appreciation is still likely, the tail risks of a no-deal or disorderly Brexit scenarios have increased, and should weigh on (the pound),"" currency strategists from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note to clients.
Prime Minister Theresa May is also still struggling to secure the support of Northern Ireland's DUP party she needs to proceed as a minority government after losing her majority 10 days ago. 
The pound was little changed at $1.2796

346,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>","Qatar riyal quoted below peg but no threat of devaluation, bankers say","By Andrew Torchia and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar's riyal is being quoted weaker than its peg against the U.S. dollar as Doha grapples with a diplomatic crisis, but that is the result of poor liquidity in the currency market rather than a serious threat to the peg, bankers in the region say.
The riyal , officially fixed at 3.64 to the dollar since 2001, has been offered as low as 3.6680 since Saudi Arabia and other Arab states cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism.
That was not a big move in absolute terms, less than 1 percent, but it marked the weakest spot market rate since July 2005, Thomson Reuters data shows. 
Furthermore, previous dips in the riyal  were usually one-day affairs, but this time the Qatari currency has been quoted significantly weaker than its peg for two weeks.
Gulf bankers inside and outside Qatar, however, said they did not think the spot market quotes showed any change in Qatar's determination or ability to maintain the peg.
Instead, they said, the fluctuations seemed to be the result of the way in which economic sanctions against Qatar have distorted trading between banks.
Many Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Bahraini banks have cut back or suspended trading with Qatari institutions, fearing the displeasure of their governments. International banks have become more cautious because of political risk.
This has slowed foreign exchange trade, particularly between banks operating onshore and offshore, and caused bottlenecks in the supply of dollars to offshore institutions, pushing down the riyal.
""The fact that the spot quote has gone below the peg is due to low liquidity, not a change in Qatar's policy,"" said a treasury manager at a Saudi bank, speaking on condition of anonymity because of political sensitivities. 
He noted that in the past, the Saudi riyal  had also fluctuated by significant margins around its dollar peg because of temporary liquidity squeezes, even though Riyadh's central bank had maintained the peg.
A Dubai-based fixed income portfolio manager said he didn't view the move of the spot rate off the peg as alarming.
""It might be a sign of a little speculative pressure, hard to say. It doesn't seem like banks have had massive outflow pressure from Qatar,"" he said.
CENTRAL BANK
The emir's 2001 decree establishing the peg said the central bank would ""buy the dollar at a rate not exceeding 3.6385 riyals and sell the dollar at a rate not exceeding 3.6415 riyals to the banks operating in the State of Qatar"".
It is continuing to do this, bankers said. A treasury banker at a Qatari bank in Doha said his institution remained able to obtain dollar supplies it needed from the central bank.
""We can buy dollars from the central bank,"" he said. ""We are selling dollars in the market at 3.6415.""
Because links between onshore Qatari banks and offshore banks in centers such as Bahrain and London have been damaged by the sanctions, however, these supplies are not reaching all corners of the market promptly.
Some traders said they were surprised the central bank had not acted immediately to quash any speculation about a change to the peg by releasing huge amounts of dollars into the market.
In his only public statement since the crisis erupted, central bank governor Skeikh Abdullah bin Saoud Al-Thani declared last week that Doha had ""sufficient foreign currency reserves to meet all requirements"" but did not explicitly mention the peg.
However, bankers in the Gulf noted the emir's decree did not commit the central bank to massive intervention as soon as the spot rate moved off the peg; it merely said the bank had the right to determine the volume and timing of dollar sales.
Skeikh Abdullah has rarely talked publicly about the peg in the past, and may be reluctant to do so now as that could draw the currency market's attention, raising pressure on the riyal.
His strategy may be working; after falling sharply in the offshore forwards market , which banks use to hedge exchange rates 12 months from now, the riyal has come off its lows in the past few days.
The central bank has $34.5 billion of net foreign reserves and the government may have more than $200 billion of additional liquid assets in its sovereign wealth fund. So for now, Qatar seems in no danger of running out of money to defend the peg.

""There is no reason for the riyal to be de-pegged in the short term,"" said the Qatari banker. ""They have enough resources.""

347,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2017 07:12AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly outlook: June 19 - 23,"Investing.com - The dollar slipped against a basket of the other major currencies on Friday, after weak U.S. housing and consumer sentiment data backed bets of a slower pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, declined 0.3% to end at 97.14 by late Friday. The index ended the week with a loss of roughly 0.1%.
U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in May to the lowest level in eight months, suggesting that subdued housing activity could dent economic growth in the second quarter.
In a separate report the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment gauged fell to 94.5 in early June from 91.1 in May. Analysts had expected a reading of 97.1.
The subdued economic reports weighed on the dollar as it dropped to session lows against its peers.
The greenback rose to a more than two-week highs on Thursday after the Fed raised interest rates as widely expected and maintained plans to go ahead with another rate hike by year-end. The central bank also provided greater detail about how it plans to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Despite the Fed's relatively hawkish message, market players remained doubtful over the Fed's ability to raise rates as much as it would like before the end of the year due to a recent run of disappointing U.S. economic data.
Futures traders are pricing in less than a 15% chance of a hike at the Fed's September meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a December increase was seen at about 35%.
Elsewhere, the yen ended Friday's session little changed in choppy, volatile trading after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged and hinted that its ultra-loose monetary policy could remain in place for a while.
Meanwhile, the British pound inched higher, underpinned by expectations that the Bank of England could alter its stance on low interest rates in the near future, after an increasing number of its members voted in favor of a rate hike on Thursday.
The euro also rose on Friday, drawing support after the International Monetary Fund and the euro zone's 19 finance ministers backed a payout of €8.5 billion to Greece in order to a default in July and avert another debt crisis.
In the week ahead, market players will focus on a handful of Federal Reserve speakers as they look for more clues on future monetary policy moves.
Traders will also keep an eye out on U.S. housing data to gauge if a recent downtick in consumer spending and inflation is translating into lower home prices and slack in sales.
In Europe, market players eagerly await the start of Brexit negotiations between Britain and the European Union.
Investors will also focus on flash survey data on euro zone business activity for fresh clues on the health of the region’s manufacturing and services sector.
Elsewhere, traders will pay close attention to retail sales and inflation data from Canada as they look for more clues on the health of the economy and the timing of a rise in borrowing costs.

On the U.S.-based GDAX exchange, BTC/USD rose to $2,481.50, up 9.64%.
Despite hitting a record high of $3,000 on Monday, bitcoin remained on track to post a weekly loss for the first time in nine weeks in the wake of recent comments from analysts and traders alike, signalling a potential downturn for publicly traded cryptocurrencies.
Goldman Sachs chief technician Sheba Jafari, recently warned investors that bitcoin could be heading for bearish territory.
Meanwhile, Ethereum rose to $358.91, up 13.58%, as investors continue to expect that Ethereum would be the alternative cryptocurrency that usurps bitcoin as the largest and best capitalized blockchain – a phenomenon referred to as “the flippening”.
Since the start of the year, bitcoin has soared roughly 200% to a total value of around $41 billion while Ethereum, which was trading a notch under $8.00 at the start of the year, has surged more than 5,000% to a total value of around $34 billion.
Both cryptocurrencies have easily outperformed U.S. stock benchmarks such as S&P 500 index and Nasdaq in 2017, both are up about 15% and 8% year-to-date, respectively."
351,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2017 01:08PM ET</span>",Bitcoin drops to three-week low on profit taking,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell to a three-week low on Thursday as investors took profits partly in response to a bearish report from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as well as concerns about a Chinese bitcoin miner's plan to undertake a ""hard fork"" that will result in a split in the digital currency. 
The virtual currency relies on ""mining"" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins.
Bitcoin fell as low as $2,120  on the Bitstamp on Thursday and was last down 6 percent at $2,290. On the week, the currency has fallen about 22 percent, on track for its largest weekly slide since December 2013.
On Monday, bitcoin hit a record just shy of $3,000. So far this year, bitcoin remains up 137 percent.
Sharp losses such as Thursday's are par for the course for an asset like bitcoin, analysts said. Over the course of its eight-year history, Bitcoin has on a daily basis risen as much as 18 percent and fallen as much as 13 percent.
Greg Dwyer, business development manager at crypto-currency trading platform BitMEX, said bitcoin's decline may have started on Monday when Goldman Sachs analyst Sheba Jafari said in a report, ""The balance of signals are looking broadly heavy"" for bitcoin.
Jafari was ""wary of a near-term top ahead of $3,134, adding that investors should consider re-establishing bullish exposure between $2,330 and no lower than $1,915.""
Analysts also said investors were spooked by Chinese miner Bitmain's plan to undertake a ""hard fork"" of bitcoin if a code upgrade on the currency is activated late this summer.
Under a ""hard fork"", Bitmain would create an entirely new version of the bitcoin blockchain, resulting in an entirely new bitcoin currency, separate from the original currency.
Bitmain's move was in response to proposals that attempt to solve the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. Bitcoin's network has not kept pace with its growth and is unable to process all the transactions fast enough.
""Traders are concerned with what a fork could do to their holdings and most likely now converting to fiat (government currencies) until some clarity about the scaling debate comes to light,"" said BitMEX's Dwyer.

But the BoE still chose to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low and maintain the level of its asset purchase program for the time being.
Meanwhile, USD/JPY rose 0.19% to 111.13 after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged, in a widely expected move, pledging to keep asset purchases around the current target of ¥80 trillion.
""Private consumption has increased resilience against a background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation,"" the BOJ said in a statement.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 97.44, close to Thursday’s two-week high of 97.56."
358,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2017 12:45AM ET</span>","Dollar firms on upbeat data, yen down as BOJ keeps policy steady","TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall in Asia on Friday, on track for weekly gains against a currency basket, after upbeat U.S. economic data gave investors reason to hope the U.S. central bank will stick with its plan to hike rates. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, added 0.1 percent to 97.491 (DXY), and was up 0.6 percent for the week. 
The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 111.18 yen , on track to gain 1.1 percent for the week.
It ticked up to a session high of 111.27 yen, its highest since June 2, after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as expected, before quickly paring its gain.
The BOJ also upgraded its assessment of private consumption and overseas growth, signaling its confidence that an export-driven economic recovery was broadening and gaining momentum. 
Investors awaited a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT)with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who is expected to reassure markets that the central bank was in no hurry to follow the Federal Reserve's tapering example, according to sources familiar with BOJ thinking. 
""With the BOJ, there were no big surprises there,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia macro strategy for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Singapore. 
""Obviously, the dollar is reacting more positively today"" than it did on Wednesday, after the downbeat U.S. economic data that preceded the Fed announcement.
On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates as widely expected, and also released some preliminary details of its plan to begin paring its $4 trillion-plus debt holdings. 
Ahead of the central bank's announcements, however, downbeat inflation and retail sales data earlier sent the dollar into a tailspin. 
""The dollar now seems to be getting over its shock from the core CPI release,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
He noted that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was relatively hawkish, releasing its plan for balance sheet reduction earlier than expected and keeping the interest rate outlook unchanged - despite market expectations for a slowing in the tempo of rate hikes.
""It will be increasingly difficult to short the dollar, he added. 
Thursday's run of U.S. economic data gave dollar bulls some reason for cheer. The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, lower than the 242,000 that economists had predicted.
June readings of the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions index also both surpassed economists' expectations. 
Higher yields underpinned the dollar. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) was last at 2.174 percent in Asian trade, above its U.S. close of 2.162 percent. It had fallen as low as 2.103 percent on Wednesday after the downbeat data was published. 
The euro  was steady on the day at $1.1147, well below a seven-month high of $1.1296 touched on Wednesday, and down 0.6 percent for the week. 
Sterling edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2773 , getting a lift overnight after the Bank of England (BoE) came closer to hiking interest rates than many had believed it would. As many as three members of the BoE's policy committee surprised financial markets by voting for a rise in interest rates. It was still down 1.4 percent for the week so far.

The unexpectedly tight 5-3 vote came despite signs of a slowdown in Britain's economy, and uncertainty over Britain's political outlook since Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election.

""The overarching question is not so much what else the BoJ may do, as it is what’s left for the BoJ to exploit in the toolbox, and the triggers to act,"" Mizuho said in a note to clients on Friday ahead of the announcement.
""On one hand, Governor Kuroda is acutely aware and has been articulating that inflation is a long way off the 2% target and lacks “escape velocity” as it. On the other, he has been under pressure from lawmakers to account for the record size of the BoJ’s balance sheet – now around JPY500 trln (~99% of GDP); which corresponds to increasing costs of stimulus.""
""Bridging the gap is an exercise in delicate balance – much ado about nothing much may be the optimal state of play. And if this reticence is construed as dovish accommodation, USD/JPY may be poised to extend gains above 111 as markets digest a hawkish Fed.

Deepening political turmoil in Washington also weighed on the greenback and U.S. Treasury yields, with the Washington Post reporting that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice. 
Also on Wednesday, a prominent Republican was among those shot by a gunman said to be angry with Trump.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six rivals, was slightly lower on the day at 96.915 (DXY) though above its overnight low of 96.323 plumbed after downbeat economic figures. 
The Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent on Wednesday, as expected, and gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio.
But the moves were overshadowed by inflation and retail sales data earlier in the day that fell short of market expectations. The core rate of inflation increased at just 1.7 percent on year, the fourth straight monthly deceleration and the slowest overall pace in two years.
The Fed said a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory, but the latest tepid price readings made investors question its view that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve. 
Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar shrugged off earlier losses and was flat at 109.54 yen , above Wednesday's eight-week low of 108.81 yen. 
The euro  was also unchanged at $1.1217, below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 scaled overnight. 
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) were last at 2.134 percent, below their U.S. close of 2.138 percent. They fell as low as 2.103 percent following the downbeat data, their lowest since Nov. 10. 
The Fed also mapped out a very gradual approach to shrink its $4.2-trillion holdings of Treasury- and mortgage-backed assets that would allow it to begin as early as September. The process could start ""relatively soon,"" Fed Chair Janet Yellen said.
""There is a lot to digest, and even some apparently conflicting signals, such as the fact that the Fed revised its own inflation outlook slightly down and yet kept its intention to raise rates again this year,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.
The Fed said it expects U.S. inflation to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.
""It remains to be seen if the Fed can really do both this year - raise rates again, and also begin reducing its balance sheet,"" Imaizumi added. 
A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed it would announce the start of its balance sheet normalization at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.
They said they expected Fed policymakers to raise interest rates one more time by the end of 2017 and then three times in 2018.
""Investors believe that it is going to take the Fed some time to confirm that inflation is strong enough to raise rates again, and in the meantime, the Fed is going to start reducing its balance sheet at a gradual pace,"" said Kumiko Ishikawa, FX market analyst at Sony Financial Holdings in Tokyo.
""In this climate, there are no incentives to buy the dollar,"" she said.
On Friday, the Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged, and reassure markets it will lag the Fed in tapering its massive stimulus program, as Japan's inflation remains low despite a strengthening economy.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is also seen dispelling market speculation that the central bank is engaging in ""stealth tapering"" by stressing that the recent slowdown in its Japanese government bond buying is simply the result of a stable bond market, according to sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking.
The Australia dollar  rose 0.2 percent to $0.7605, moving back toward its 2-1/2-month high of $0.7636 hit on Wednesday, after a better-than-forecast employment report.

Data showed that New Zealand's economy grew 0.5 percent in the three months to March, lower than the 0.7 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll and well below the central bank's forecast for 0.9 percent growth.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2017 12:31PM ET</span>","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Last week's shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country's economy and the value of the pound sterling. 
Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.
Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the ""Brexit discount"" demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world's fifth-largest economy.
But May's loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling. 
After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed. 
For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year's referendum.
""Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,"" says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London. 
""If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.""
VICIOUS CYCLE
Markets now assume May's failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government's Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.
But there's little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.
Anxiety that Britain's economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election. 
Sterling's weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England's target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined. 
But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose. 
The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.
That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro. 
Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative.  
""The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,"" said Josh O'Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world's single biggest currency trader, in London.
""We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so. 
""And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.""
 Barclays  (LON:BARC), which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them. 
""The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,"" said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. ""The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.""
Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.
That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts. 
Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances. 
""But here's the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,"" he said. ""The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration. 
""But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.""

382,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2017 11:22AM ET</span>",Dollar index hits lowest since November 9 after weak U.S. data,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest since the day after the U.S. election against a basket of major currencies following the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. CPI and retail sales data on Wednesday.
U.S. retail sales in May recorded their biggest drop in 16 months and consumer prices unexpectedly fell month over month, suggesting inflation pressures are moderating, which could impact further Federal Reserve interest rate increases this year.
The euro  rose to its highest since Nov. 9 against the dollar, hitting $1.1295.
Against the yen, the greenback fell by more than 1 percent following the data release to touch 108.95 yen, its lowest since April 21 . 
""The numbers cast serious, serious doubt on whether there will be another hike this year,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
The dollar index (DXY) was last down 0.6 percent at 96.437, after earlier touching its lowest since Nov. 9 at 96.323. 
Investors were still expecting the Federal Open Markets Committee to increase U.S. overnight interest rates later on Wednesday at the conclusion of its June policy meeting.
Fed funds futures prices showed traders saw a more than 95 percent chance of a rates rise to between 1.00 and 1.25 percent.
The likelihood of a rate hike in September has significantly weakened, however, with futures rates showing just a 17 percent chance of an increase, down from 28 percent before the data release on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch.
""It won't stop the Fed from hiking interest rates later today, but it increases the downside risks to our forecast that there will be a further two rate hikes in the second half of this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The Australian dollar  rose 1.3 percent to its highest against its U.S. counterpart since April 3. New Zealand's dollar  rose 1.25 percent to its highest since Feb. 7.
The Canadian dollar rose 0.45 percent, hitting its highest against the U.S. dollar since Feb. 27. The loonie was on pace for its best week since January 2016, up 2.5 percent since Friday. 
Worries about global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce has weighed on commodity-linked currencies like the Aussie, kiwi and loonie.

But after comments by Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins on Monday flipped markets toward an earlier rise in borrowing rates there, traders and analysts said short bets against commodity-linked currencies looked exposed.

EUR/USD gained 0.62% to 1.1278, just off a seven-month peak of 1.1296 hit earlier in the session.
The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.3% in May, compared to forecasts for a 0.1% rise.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, decreased by 0.3% last month, disappointing expectations for an increase of 0.2%.
A separate report showed that the U.S. consumer price index fell by 0.1% last month, confounding forecasts for an increase of 0.1%. Year-over-year, consumer prices gained 1.9%, missing expectations for 2.0% rise.
Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, inched up by 0.1%, below forecasts for a 0.2% rise.
Later Wednesday, the Fed was widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points from 1.00% to 1.25%.
Market participants were especially awaiting Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s comments following the decision for indications on the future pace of rate hikes.
Investors were also cautious as more than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued President Donald Trump accusing him of receiving funds from foreign governments through his firms and thus of violating the constitution.
GBP/USD added 0.13% to trade at 1.2769 after falling to session lows of 1.2724 when the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the claimant count increased by 7,300 in May, compared to expectations for a gain of 20,300 people.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.6% in April, in line with expectations and at its lowest level since 1975.

The peso became something of a gauge of Trump's prospects in the months leading up to the election. When traders thought Trump's prospects of winning went up, the peso often went down against the dollar - and vice versa. 
After he was elected, the peso continued to weaken against the dollar as Trump ratcheted up his anti-trade rhetoric, focusing on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

388,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>","Pound hit by wage disappointment, signs of delay to coalition deal","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling handed back early gains to trade lower on Wednesday after a reading of UK wages missed forecasts and a report that a deal needed to form a government could be delayed until next week.
The pound had been recovering from its almost 3 percent slide since Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority in elections last Thursday. 
But the BBC report that a deal to obtain support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which May needs to form a government, would not now be signed on Wednesday, drove the pound back into negative territory against both the dollar and the euro. 
""One of the things we thought was very positive for sterling was that we'd extended the life of the parliament to give a very large window after the end of the two-year negotiation period (on Brexit),"" said Adam Cole, head of G10 currency strategy with RBC in London. 
""That no longer looks like the case.""
By 1010 GMT, sterling was down 0.1 percent on the day at $1.2738, having traded as strong as $1.2797 earlier.  It was also 0.1 percent weaker at 87.95 pence per euro. (EURGBP=) 
The wages numbers added to a handful of worrying signals since the election for an economy that is now trailing many of its European contemporaries. 
Pay grew at the slowest pace since February 2016, rising an annual 2.1 percent in the three months to April compared to forecasts of growth of 2.4 percent.
That followed a rise in inflation to its highest level in four years, adding to the pain for British consumers who already seem to be easing back on the spending which propped up Britain's economy in the aftermath of last year's Brexit vote. 
""Falling real wage growth is not a new theme, but the fact that inflation-adjusted wage growth has continued to fall to its lowest level for 3-years, is likely to keep a lid on the GBP and firmly keep the BOE on hold for some time,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index wrote in a note.
Ten-year gilt yields (GB10YT=RR) were down more than 4 basis points on the day at 0.99 percent and their spread over 10-year Bunds  tightened by 4 basis points to 73 basis points.
A number of major banks and asset managers have raised the prospect of the Bank of England buying more debt to provide more stimulus for the economy if it slows sharply in what promises to be a politically turbulent year. 

One problem is that any further stimulus would be likely to weaken the pound further and only add to inflation, in turn hurting consumers and household incomes.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rose to its highest level in nearly two months on Tuesday, buoyed by hawkish comments from Canada's central bank, while worries about UK political uncertainty dented sterling.
At one point, the Canadian dollar was at its strongest since April 17, at C$1.3274  per U.S. dollar, extending gains after climbing more than 1 percent on Monday. The loonie last traded at C$1.3293, up around 0.2 percent on the day. 
Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said on Monday first-quarter growth was ""pretty impressive"" and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required. 
""She delivered a much more hawkish signal than we've seen from the central bank in some time,"" said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy for Royal Bank of Canada's Hong Kong branch.
""Bottom-line, odds of a rate hike by the end of the year from the Bank of Canada have moved up considerably,"" Trinh said, adding that markets were now pricing in more than a 50 percent chance.
Sterling was still looking wobbly after the shock result of Thursday's UK general election, which left Prime Minister Theresa May short of a parliamentary majority that would have strengthened her hand as Britain prepares for Brexit negotiations with Europe. 
The pound eased 0.1 percent to $1.2653 , after shedding 2.3 percent the previous two trading days.
""The prospect of further political uncertainty due to the lack of an overall Conservative majority is likely to weigh on sterling in the short term,"" said Jeremy Gatto, senior vice president, trading, for Geneva-based boutique asset manager Unigestion. 
On the other hand, the potential for ""softer Brexit"" rhetoric in a market that is already short on sterling could help support the currency over the medium-term, Gatto added.
The greenback was steady to firmer against the yen and the euro ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting starting later on Tuesday. 
Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.97 . The euro  eased 0.1 percent to $1.1193.
With the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of tightening in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. 
Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the Fed's plans for trimming its balance sheet.
""Given that the minutes (of the last Fed meeting) contained lots of details, one possible scenario is that there will be an announcement in June and that it will start in September,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, referring to the Fed's possible balance sheet reduction.

Elsewhere, the Bank of England is set to announce an interest rate decision on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting on Thursday and Friday.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2017 12:25AM ET</span>","Sterling steadies as British PM scrambles to unite party, dollar awaits Fed","By Masayuki Kitano
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sterling steadied on Monday as British Prime Minister Theresa May scrambled to pick up the pieces and reunite her Conservative Party after a disastrous election that could disrupt Brexit negotiations. 
Sterling last traded at $1.2756 , edging up 0.1 percent on the day, after sliding 1.7 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day drop in around eight months. 
The pound had tumbled by as much as 2.5 percent in the previous session to its lowest since mid-April after no single party won a clear claim to power in the UK election on Thursday - a result flagged by some analysts as the worst possible election outcome due to uncertainty. 
May is now trying to unite a disillusioned party around her to not only support her in the Brexit talks but also to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party that will enable her to stay in power.
""There is still heightened uncertainty surrounding issues, including how the (British government's) stance toward Brexit talks might change,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""The lack of moves (in sterling) is more because the market is waiting for fresh information, rather than a sign that it is settling down,"" he added. 
Negotiations on Britain's exit from the European Union are due to start next Monday.
While sterling has retreated as investors with long positions moved back towards neutral, there is no reason to expect further weakness simply because of the election result, said Andrew Milligan, Edinburgh-based head of global strategy for  Standard Life  (LON:SL) Investments.
""On valuation grounds, sterling is about fair value versus the other major currencies, so to see a much cheaper currency would require considerable new news on either the state of the UK economy or on the state of Brexit negotiations.""
Milligan added that it is ""far too soon"" to say how the election results may affect the Brexit talks.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1208 , staying below a seven-month high of $1.1285 set in early June.
The euro showed little reaction, after projections following the first round of French parliamentary elections on Sunday showed that President Emmanuel Macron's fledgling party was set to secure a huge majority. The outcome of initial results was in line with expectations.
The dollar held steady at 110.29 yen , having retreated from Friday's one-week high of 110.815 yen.
Analysts said the dollar could come under pressure against the yen, if falls in U.S. technology shares deepen after the sell-off seen on Friday, when the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) tumbled 1.8 percent. 
""If it spills over into broader (U.S.) stock indices, that could trigger risk-off moves and put downward pressure on the dollar against the yen,"" said Hirofumi Suzuki, economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
A key focus for markets this week is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday. 

With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening in the months to come and next year, and any further details on its plans for trimming its balance sheet.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 05:40PM ET</span>","Mexican peso hits 10-month high, long bets at four-year high","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso currency reached an almost 10-month high on Friday and data on derivatives market bets showed investors have taken the most optimistic view on the currency in four years.
The Mexican currency clawed its way back to levels last seen before the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president as higher oil prices helped lift emerging market currencies.
The peso firmed to 18.1125 pesos per dollar, its best level since Aug. 18, but then pulled back a bit to trade around 18.17 per dollar, about 0.1 percent stronger on the day.
Trump's election victory drove the currency to a record low on fears he would rip up a trade deal with Mexico.
But the peso has bounced back and it has been the best-performing major currency this year, up more than 14 percent against the dollar, as the Trump administration moved toward talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
""The peso has more room to appreciate,"" said Marco Oviedo, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Mexico City, citing fewer clouds over the NAFTA deal, as well as less concern about Mexico's political landscape combined with bets on higher interest rates.
The peso gained ground this week after data on Thursday showed a jump in inflation to an eight-year high that backed expectations of more central bank interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates lift the appeal of the peso to foreign investors.
That added to gains seen Monday after the ruling party managed to hold onto the governorship in the populous State of Mexico, according to preliminary results.
President Enrique Pena Nieto's PRI party fended off a challenge there from new leftist party founded by populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who leads in early polls for next year's presidential race.
Analysts have warned that signs Lopez Obrador is gaining ground could weigh on the peso due to uncertainty about what he could do to free-market reforms seen under Pena Nieto, such as an opening of the energy sector to private investment.
Data on Friday showed the number of bets by speculators for a stronger peso rose to a four-year high.
Long positions recorded by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data rose to 115,601 contracts, the highest since late May 2013, as of June 6, the latest data.
Some analysts think investors have become too confident in more peso gains. Analysts at Citi this week warned they would not make big bets on further gains in the peso at these levels after analyzing other rallies in emerging market currencies seen since 2004.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Friday, helped by a sharp drop in the British pound after Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in national elections.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.37 percent at 97.273, after rising to a 10-day high of 97.5 earlier in the session.
The index had fallen to a seven-month low midweek on caution ahead of U.S. Senate testimony by former FBI Director James Comey and the British election. But on Friday, it added to gains from the previous session. 
Comey on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation of possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia, but did not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice. 
""Comey's testimony was pretty much a non-event for the markets. I think it was more of a relief (for the dollar) than anything else,"" said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.
The euro was down 0.14 percent to $1.1196 against the dollar, a day after the European Central Bank closed the door on more interest rate cuts.
""The overall sentiment is that regardless of what is going on elsewhere, the U.S. is a safe haven for investors and traders,"" said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
Traders will turn their attention to next week's U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to deliver this year's second rate hike, Harajli said.

The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart as strong domestic jobs data supported the view that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates earlier than previously thought.

GBP/USD pared some of its losses to trade above $1.27, down 1.68%, as investors hoped that UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that she would form a government  with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party will spur a fresh Brexit strategy, potentially avoiding a ‘hard Brexit’. 
Deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) insisted that his party is ready to face up to the “challenges of Brexit” while Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, said that “no-one wants to see a ‘hard’ Brexit”. 
Sterling fell to $1.2635, the lowest level since April 18, after the result of the general election sparked political uncertainty, as Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative party failed to secure a majority in parliament.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound tumbled on Friday, lifting the country's main FTSE share index, after an election that denied any party a majority in parliament and fomented a sense of political chaos just days before Brexit talks begin. 
Prime Minister Theresa May said she would form a government with help from Northern Irish unionists, despite having failed to win the stronger mandate she had sought to conduct exit talks with the rest of the European Union.
While sterling registered its biggest daily fall in eight months, the slump appeared to be checked by expectations from some investors that the government may pursue a softer stance on Brexit and even loosen the purse strings to assuage an austerity-weary electorate. 
""Faced with this uncertainty, the immediate market response seems fairly reasonable: a modest sell-off in the pound,"" PIMCO's head of sterling portfolio management, Mike Amey, said.
""Looking ahead, assuming a base case of easier fiscal policy and a ""softer"" Brexit, we would expect...stability returning to the pound."" 
Others, though, have argued that without a strong Brexit mandate, the government's hand in negotiations may have been weakened.
The pound touched an eight-week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro, before recovering some ground later in the day.  (EURGBP=D3)
London's main FTSE 100 stock index (FTSE), composed of multinational companies that largely earn in foreign currency and therefore benefit when the pound falls, climbed as much as 1.3 percent, before closing up 1 percent on the day. (L)
The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index (FTMC), meanwhile, whose constituents are vulnerable to sterling weakness, recovered from an earlier loss to close slightly higher on the day.
Housebuilders suffered and gold miners climbed as investors rushed to safety and ditched stocks more exposed to domestic instability. Shares in some British utilities rose on diminishing concerns that energy prices would be capped, as planned by the Conservatives.  United Utilities  (L:UU) and SSE (L:SSE) were both up 0.2 percent.
Challenger banks Metro (L:MTRO) , OneSavings (L:OSBO) and Virgin Money (L:VM), which analysts said were most sensitive to domestic growth, fell particularly sharply. Blue-chip bank RBS (L:RBS) also fell.
British 10-year gilt yields (GB10YT=RR) fell nearly 3 basis points to 1.01 percent as investors bet on political uncertainty keeping Bank of England rates on hold for longer.
""Given the degree of uncertainty that's been unleashed by this election about what will happen next with the Brexit negotiations and how stable this government will be, the prospect of the Bank of England raising rates is pretty much non-existent. People are pushing it back to perhaps 2020,"" said Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services.
UK credit default swaps (CDS) - which reflect the cost of buying protection against a government defaulting - were trading around their highest since late April.
STERLING SKIDS
Having slid over 2.5 percent to as low as $1.2636 in early European trade, sterling had recovered to $1.2737 by 1540 GMT.
That still left sterling down 1.7 percent against the dollar on the day and on track for its biggest one-day fall since October, though that move was dwarfed by an almost 8 percent dive the day after last June's EU referendum.
The pound was almost back to where it had been trading before May called the election on April 18 gave it a boost.
The one-month sterling-dollar risk reversal , a measure of the balance of bets on the pound rising or falling in the next month, had touched its lowest level since September overnight, indicating a bias for further sterling weakness. But it recovered to reach a one-week high.
Some analysts have argued the Conservatives' failure to secure a majority might weaken the case for a ""hard"" Brexit, in which Britain leaves the EU's single market and customs union, a matter of deep concern for businesses. Talks begin on June 19.
""Clearly political uncertainty is the overriding theme here, this is why sterling dropped significantly on the exit poll last night,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.

""But the fact that it hasn’t weakened as much as many commentators had anticipated I think can be attributed to the discussion about a soft Brexit.""

Meanwhile, the euro remained vulnerable after the European Central Bank on Thursday cut its forecast for inflation this year to 1.5%, down from 1.7% in March.
The forecast came after the central bank left interest rates unchanged in a widely expected move.
GBP/USD was down 1.74% at a two-month low of 1.2727 after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she will not be resigning and that she will seek permission from the Queen to form a new government on Friday.
The announcement came after May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in Thursday’s general election, potentially disrupting Brexit negotiations.
May faced calls to leave the government on Friday after the election left no single party with a clear claim to power just 10 days ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations.
Earlier Friday, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said manufacturing production increased by 0.2% in April, disappointing expectations for a gain of 0.9%. Year-on-year, manufacturing production was flat in April.

LONDON (Reuters) - A shock British election result that left no single party with a clear claim to power hit sterling on Friday and left the dollar on course for its best day in over a month, while world shares headed toward their first weekly fall since April.
The outcome of the snap poll, called by Prime Minister Theresa May to try to bolster her parliamentary majority, was a blow to investors who had already weathered major risk events in the United States and Europe the previous day.
But the reaction as it unfolded suggested a more limited impact than after last year's Brexit vote, which triggered a prolonged decline in the pound and unsettled other assets.
After a sharp initial fall, the pound  (EURGBP=) steadied early in European trading and then began to claw back ground. Safe-haven gold  and U.S. Treasuries drifted lower and futures markets pointed to Wall Street opening modestly higher. (N) 
""The uncertainty is bad news for sterling,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch European equity & cross-asset strategist James Barty. ""I think for the global market it doesn't matter. Unlike Brexit, which at the time had a spillover into other markets, this is a very UK-specific thing."" 
Bets that another drop in sterling would flatter international firms' profits pushed London's FTSE (FTSE) as much as 1 percent higher but it was up a more limited 0.4 percent by mid-session.
Bourses in Frankfurt (GDAXI), Paris (FCHI) and Milan (FTMIB) had also slipped back to leave MSCI's closely-followed 46-country 'All World' index down 0.1 percent and set for its first weekly fall since mid-April.
May's Conservatives failed to win an outright majority in parliament. It meant she turned to Northern Ireland's small Democratic Unionist Party to retain power, amid serious questions about her own future.

The pound shed more than 2 percent against the dollar, dropping as low as $1.2636  and 88.6 pence per euro (EURGBP=) -- two- and six-month troughs -- before recovering all the way to $1.2741 and 87.70. Yields on 10-year gilts  also ticked higher after falling to 1 percent.
John Wraith, a strategist at UBS, said there was a high likelihood of a potentially prolonged period of uncertainty over whether May would be replaced. But he cautioned bears against chasing the pound much lower.

Overnight, Wall Street had also seemingly judged that the testimony of former FBI director James Comey was not life-threatening for the administration of President Donald Trump.
Comey accused Trump of firing him to try to undermine the investigation into possible collusion by his campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 election.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The greenback held gains against a basket of currencies on Thursday as investors took stock of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to the U.S. Senate, while the euro weakened after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold.
Comey on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia, but did not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.27 percent at 97.01. Against the yen, the greenback was up 0.26 percent to 110.07 yen, after rising to a two-day high of 110.38 yen.
""So far we haven’t had any major surprises or any kind of bombshells released,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
""The dollar-yen ran up a little bit as the testimony got underway, suggesting a little bit of a relief on the fact that we are not likely to get a smoking gun from James Comey that we did not already know.""
The euro fell after the ECB cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back its massive bond-buying program.
The euro, which weakened on Wednesday on reports that the ECB would cut its inflation forecasts, was down 0.4 percent to $1.121, after dipping to $1.1196, its lowest since May 31.
""Even though it was well telegraphed over the last 24 hours, the future expectations on inflation came in a bit lower than the market had been anticipating,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.
""That sort of weighed on the euro.""
The euro has risen against the dollar in the past five months, partly due to the greenback's weakness, but also on the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to raise interest rates in early 2018.
Meanwhile, sterling fell against the dollar while market bets on how volatile the currency will be over the next 24 hours touched their highest in a year, as Britain voted in a national election that some polls have suggested is too close to call.

Sterling hit a two-week high of $1.2936 earlier in the session after polling organizations' last surveys, but weakened later in the day to trade down 0.18 percent at $1.2936.

The ECB cuts its forecast for inflation this year to 1.5%, down from 1.7% in March. The bank also downgraded its forecasts for 2018 and 2019 to 1.3% and 1.6% respectively.
ECB chief Mario Draghi said the cuts were mainly due to lower oil prices.
The central bank raised its growth forecasts for the next few years, saying it now expects gross domestic product to rise by 1.9% this year, up from 1.8% expected back in March.
Draghi said risks to the growth outlook are now “broadly balanced”, dropping the ECB’s previous warning that risks were to the downside.
He added that the euro zone recovery is enjoying “stronger momentum”, and is growing at a “somewhat faster pace than previously expected”.
The ECB left its interest rates unchanged earlier on Thursday and dropped its guidance that interest rates may be cut again.
The ECB kept its rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, at -0.40%.
The main refinancing rate was unchanged at zero while the rate on the marginal lending facility, or emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks, stayed at 0.25%.
The ECB said that it expects policy rates to remain “at present” for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.
In previous statements the ECB said it expected policy rates to remain “at present or lower levels” for an extended period.

445,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 08, 2017 08:01AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Everyone wants to join the Bitcoin and Ethereum party,"Investing.com - Bitcoin traded just shy of its all-time high on Thursday, while Ethereum remained within sight of its record-peak, as a monster rally continued amid bullish noises around the future of the cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin was at $2,776.40 on the U.S.-based GDAX exchange in New York morning hours, not far from an all-time high of $2,938.50 touched earlier this week.
Since the start of the year, the price of bitcoin has soared roughly 195%, taking the total value of the cryptocurrency in circulation to around $46 billion.
Recent gains were likely driven by soaring demand in Asia, most notably Japan, China and South Korea.
Bullishness around bitcoin has stoked appetite for other cryptocurrencies. One in particular known as Ethereum is gaining traction.
Ethereum has risen from $8.24 on January 1, to a high of $269.32 on Tuesday. This represents a whopping 2,850% increase year-to-date.
The impressive gains have sparked buying interest from traditional stock market investors, as the S&P 500 has returned only 7% since the start of the year.

Weaker energy prices forced the ECB staff to reconsider its projections for inflation for 2017 to 2019, according to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter.
These sources said that the ECB draft forecasts were pointing to inflation of just 1.5% through 2019, compared to its prior estimates released in March of 1.7% for this year, 1.6% for 2018 and 1.7% for 2019.
The ECB targets inflation to be ""close to, but below 2%"".
Forecasts for core inflation were said to be little changed while growth projections were expected to be revised up by about 0.1%, according to the report.
In its prior projections in March, the ECB said that inflation excluding energy and food was “envisaged to average 1.1% in 2017 and to rise to 1.5% and 1.8% in 2018 and 2019 respectively”.
ECB president Mario Draghi has often insisted that underlying inflation remains subdued, backing the need for an “extraordinary amount of monetary policy support”.
Meanwhile, the central bank said last March that real GDP was expected to grow by 1.8% in 2017, by 1.7% in 2018 and by 1.6% in 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a seven-week low against the yen on Wednesday, with traders cautious a day before Britain votes, the European Central Bank makes a policy decision and former FBI director James Comey gives testimony to the U.S. Senate.
The dollar has lost more than 1 percent versus the safe-haven Japanese currency so far this week, pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows amid a risk-averse mood, and as weak U.S. data has curtailed expectations for interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. 
On Wednesday the greenback fell 0.2 percent to 109.22 yen , its weakest since April 21. 
""Tomorrow’s what is being dubbed as 'Triple Threat Thursday',...an event-filled day that could send global markets on a bumpy ride,"" said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel, in London. 
Any damaging revelations in Comey's testimony is likely to further hurt Trump and take the wind out of his plans to roll back regulations and overhauling the tax system - an agenda that had sent the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.
In Britain, markets are worried that the ruling Conservative party might not get a majority of seats - an outcome seen strengthening Britain's hand in its exit talks with the European Union. Investors had been betting on a solid Conservative win until two weeks ago, when polls narrowed.
And while the ECB is unlikely to start to wind back its expansive stimulus program given waning global inflation pressures, investors will be keen to hear its stance on the euro zone economy. 
ECB President Mario Draghi said last week that while euro zone growth may be improving, inflation remains subdued and still requires substantial stimulus.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar steadied at 96.649 (DXY), close to a seven-month low of 96.517 hit the previous day. 
The euro edged down 0.2 percent to $1.1256 <EUR=> after data showed German industrial orders dropped far more than expected in April. The single currency hit a seven-month high of $1.1285 last week.
""Of the three big events on...Thursday, the ECB meeting could be the least disruptive as participants have already had time to curtail their previously hawkish expectations,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo. 
The Australian dollar added 0.6 percent to reach a one-month high of $0.7555  after data showed the resource-rich economy grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter, dousing fears that its record expansion may have ended. 

Sterling was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2900 .

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a more than six-week low against the yen on Tuesday, dipping below a key technical level as treasury yields slipped on heightened caution ahead of a trio of events on Thursday.
U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors piled into low-risk bonds on worries linked to Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel, all scheduled for Thursday.
The dollar was down 0.91 percent against the yen  at 109.45, having broken below its 200-day moving average to touch 109.29 yen, its lowest since April 21.
""It's safe-haven (demand) as well as the technical break that's driving dollar-yen,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York.
""It's basically following yields in the U.S., which are grinding lower as the market gets a little bit nervous ahead of Thursday.""
With the Bank of Japan keeping 10-year Japanese bond yields pinned to zero, the dollar-yen exchange rate has been closely correlated for the past year with any shifts in U.S. 10-year Treasuries. (US10YT=RR)

Comey, fired by President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation of alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia.
The threats to Trump and some of his senior advisers from the affair have added to market doubts over the administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and weighed on the dollar.
The euro was up 0.16 percent against the dollar to $1.127. The common currency has gained in recent weeks on various factors, including an ebb in French political concerns and upbeat euro zone data.
However, complacency that the ECB will be less dovish has left the euro vulnerable to disappointment if the central bank does not satisfy those expectations, analysts said.
Sterling was down 0.09 percent against the dollar to $1.2889. With two days to go until Britain holds a national election, opinion polls have shown that Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party has ebbed over the last three weeks, with some putting her majority in doubt.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2017 07:23AM ET</span>","Qatari riyal under pressure as Saudi, UAE banks delay Qatar deals","By Tom Arnold, Hadeel Al Sayegh and Tom Finn
DUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar's currency came under pressure on Tuesday as Gulf Arab commercial banks started holding off on business with Qatari banks because of a diplomatic rift in the region.
Banking sources said some banks from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain delayed letters of credit and other deals with Qatari banks after their governments cut diplomatic ties and transport links with Doha on Monday, accusing Qatar of backing terrorism.
Saudi Arabia's central bank advised banks in the kingdom not to trade with Qatari banks in Qatari riyals, the sources told Reuters. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
Qatar has dismissed the terrorism charge and welcomed a Kuwaiti mediation effort. Doha, the world's biggest liquefied natural gas exporter, says it has enough reserves to support its banks and its riyal currency, which is pegged to the dollar.
Qatari banks have been borrowing abroad to fund their activities. Their foreign liabilities ballooned to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015, central bank data shows. 
So any extended disruption to their ties with foreign banks could potentially threaten a funding crunch for some Qatari banks. Banks from the UAE, Europe and elsewhere have been lending to Qatari institutions.
Gulf banking sources, who declined to be named because of political sensitivities, said Saudi Arabian, UAE and Bahraini banks were postponing deals until they received guidance from their central banks on how to handle Qatar.
""We will not take action without central bank guidance, but it is wise to evaluate what you give to Qatari clients and hold off until there is further clarity,"" said a UAE banker, adding that trade finance had stalled for the time being.
The sources said the UAE and Bahraini central banks had asked banks under their supervision to report their exposure to Qatari banks. The UAE and Bahraini central banks did not reply to requests for comment.
RESERVES
With an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund and its gas exports earning billions of dollars every month, Qatar has enough financial power to protect its banks.
""We are watching the financial sector very closely. If the market needs liquidity, the central bank will definitely provide liquidity,"" a Qatari central bank official told Reuters.
Nevertheless, losing some of their foreign business links could be uncomfortable for Qatari banks because they have been expanding their loans faster than other banks in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. To fund this, they have been seeking loans and deposits from the rest of the GCC.
Among large banks, Doha Bank (QA:DOBK) and Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) (QA:QISB) are the most exposed to GCC deposits, with QIB obtaining a quarter of its deposits from the GCC, said Olivier Panis, analyst at Moody's Investors Service. 
""We need to look into the maturity of those deposits but if they're short-term deposits, this could expose the banks rapidly to reduced confidence from GCC institutions,"" he said.
Doha Bank and QIB did not respond to requests for comment.
Because of such worries, the Qatari riyal fell in the spot market  on Tuesday to 3.6470 against the U.S. dollar, its lowest level since June 2016, although it later rebounded to 3.6405, almost equal to its official peg of 3.64. 
It also fell slightly in the one-year forwards market , where traders bet on rates 12 months from now.
The riyal's drop ""is based on speculation"", the Qatari central bank official said, adding Doha had a ""huge cushion"" of foreign currency to support the riyal if necessary.
A commercial banker in fellow GCC state Kuwait, which did not sever diplomatic ties with Qatar, said on Tuesday that business with Qatari institutions was continuing as normal.
But there were signs that Qatar's financial ties might be damaged well beyond the Gulf. Some Sri Lankan banks stopped buying Qatari riyals, saying counterpart banks in Singapore had advised them not to accept the currency.
In Egypt, which also cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, some banks resumed dealing in Qatari riyals after halting trade on Monday, but others appeared to be continuing to limit transactions with Doha.

Banks reducing their business with Qatar could lose out financially, but the damage looks likely to be relatively minor. Panis at Moody's estimated under 2 percent of Saudi banking sector assets were related to Qatar and the figure was around 5 percent for Bahrain, while the UAE's exposure was also small.

Bitcoin rose to a daily peak of $2,879.00 on the U.S.-based GDAX exchange at one point, its highest on record. It was last at $2,860.90 by 6:45AM ET (1045GMT), up about 10% on the day.
Other big exchanges such as Poloniex, Bitfinex and BitStamp also showed the cryptocurrency above the $2,800-level early Tuesday.
Since the start of the year, the price of bitcoin has soared roughly 195%, taking the total value of the cryptocurrency in circulation to around $46 billion.
Recent gains were likely driven by soaring demand in Asia, most notably Japan, China and South Korea.
Buyers have also been piling into the digital currency amid speculation that the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission may overturn its decision to ban the creation of a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund.
An approved ETF would make bitcoin investing simple for small traders and institutions.
Bullishness around bitcoin has stoked appetite for other cryptocurrencies. One in particular known as Ethereum is gaining traction.

483,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 10:01AM ET</span>",Bitcoin is getting close to its all-time high," Bitcoin is closing in on record territory.
The cryptocurrency was trading up by 2.1% at $2,573 a coin as of 7:03 a.m. ET. The early advance has bitcoin on track for its best close ever. It would need to top $2,799 to put in its best print of all time.
Monday's advance comes absent any real catalyst. The bid seems to be a continuation of the gains that developed late last week after China's three biggest bitcoin exchanges announced they were  allowing customers to begin withdrawals for the  first time since February. At the time of the ban on withdrawals, bitcoin was threatening its then-record high of $1,161 a coin before plunging by more than 10% on the news.
Since then, however, bitcoin has seen a steady stream of good news. In early April, Japan announced bitcoin had become a  legal payment method. Additionally, Russia's largest online retailer,  Ulmart, began accepting bitcoin even though Russia said it wouldn't consider the use of the cryptocurrency until 2018.
There is still one big hurdle to climb. Back in March, the  US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected two bitcoin exchange-traded funds. It has since taken public comment on its decision regarding an ETF started by the Winklevoss twins, but it has not made an additional ruling.
Bitcoin is up 172% in 2017."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered from last week's seven-month lows on Monday, edging up against the euro and yen, but still looking exposed to any renewed optimism from a European Central Bank policy meeting this week.
Sterling, on a rollercoaster ride driven by diverging opinion polls ahead of Thursday's national election, also steadied after a van and knife attack on pedestrians in central London on Saturday spurred a sharp drop in early Asian trade.
Services data from the data are the main set-piece of the European morning on Monday, but dealers say the week should be dominated by the UK election and the ECB meeting, eyed for signs of the bank turning toward tighter policy later this year.
Coming at a time when political risk in Europe has eased, U.S. economic data has worsened and expectations for more rises in Federal Reserve rates have fallen, that prospect pushed the euro to a seven-month high on Friday.
""Overall we think the risks are skewed toward a more cautious stance (from the ECB) than the market is expecting,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategist Nick Sgouropoulos, pointing to more downbeat messages sent by other major central banks in recent weeks.
""It would be a very big message for the ECB to go ahead of everybody else. They want to be very cautious about how they change the wording of their statement. We don't think the euro goes further (up) from here.""
The euro fell just over 0.1 percent to $1.1270, still very close to Friday's high of $1.1285. <EUR=> The dollar was also 0.1 percent stronger at 110.48 yen. <JPY=>
Other moves among the G10 group of major developed world currencies, however, kept the dollar index almost flat compared to Friday's close at 96.756 (DXY).
The pound's trade-weighted value has fallen by 3 percent in just under 4 weeks as Prime Minister Theresa May's bid for a landslide electoral victory that would strengthen her hand in talks on leaving the European Union ran into trouble.
It was not immediately clear how the events on Saturday would impact the election, though the issue of security has been thrust to the forefront of the campaign after the London Bridge and Manchester attacks.
Polls have given widely varying results, but some indicate the election could be close, possibly throwing Britain into political deadlock just days before formal Brexit talks with the European Union are due to begin on June 19.
""The pound has made an impressive recovery in early trading after a torrid weekend,"" said City Index analyst Kathleen Brooks.
""Although the Tory lead has been eroded, if the FT's poll of polls is correct then it would suggest that the Conservatives will win this election, but maybe not by such a comfortable majority as was expected a month ago.""

The soft headline jobs number did little to derail expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would hike its benchmark rate in June, as the majority of traders, more than 80%, continued to support the view that the Fed will hike rates at its next meeting on June 13-14.
“We know the Fed is more than happy to look through this kind of thing,” Saxo Bank head FX Strategy John Hardy said on Friday.
Despite elevated expectations of a June rate hike, the dollar has fallen to its lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected last November, while the U.S. 10-Year remained on track to post its fourth straight weekly loss, as investors questioned whether the soft jobs report may be a precursor to a slowdown in the U.S. economy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to seven-month lows on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected last month, which could derail a possible interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in the second half of this year.
The greenback fell to seven-month troughs against euro and Swiss franc, while sliding from a one-week high versus the yen.
Data showed that U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased just 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, while the consensus forecast was for 185,000 new jobs. 
March and April data was revised to show 66,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. May's job gains marked a sharp deceleration from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months.
The unemployment rate, however, fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
Despite the big miss in payrolls, analysts said this would not necessarily derail the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this month.
""A hike in June is still on the table but the news flow will have to improve for the Fed to keep tightening in the second part of the year,"" said Thomas Julien, U.S. economist, at Natixis North America in New York.
Traders now see a roughly 87 percent chance of a Fed rate increase on June 14, down slightly from 89 percent before the jobs report.
They continue to see slightly less than an even chance for one more rate hike before the end of the year, based on the price of fed funds futures contracts traded at CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) Inc's Chicago Board of Trade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Slightly higher U.S. Treasury yields and solidifying expectations of a rise in interest rates this month helped the dollar recover some ground on Thursday after its weakest run in more than a year.
The dollar index has had its poorest fortnight since March of last year due to an improvement in euro zone economic data at a time when U.S. equivalents have looked shaky and belief is evaporating in a boost from public spending to growth.
Traders said the wait for jobs numbers on Friday may provide the dollar with some respite, and the greenback gained just over 0.2 percent against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength in morning trade in Europe. 
But those gains were more pronounced against the yen, the Australian dollar and a weakened British pound, and few analysts are willing currently to bet against the euro. 
""We saw some profit-taking on the euro this week because of worries over Italy and Greece and some dovish comments from (European Central Bank chief) Mario Draghi,"" said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in London.
""It is interesting how fast it rebounded. People are clearly trying to buy the dips (in the euro). But for now we may just see a wait for the non-farm payrolls numbers tomorrow.""
By 1115 GMT, the dollar was just under 0.2 percent stronger at $1.1225 , compared to last week's 6-1/2 month low of $1.1268. It gained 0.4 percent to 111.21 yen  and $1.2845 per pound  respectively.
The big mover in Asian time was the Australian dollar, hit by a private survey showing Chinese manufacturing activity unexpectedly shrank in May.
The Caixin report, which tends to focus on smaller firms, contrasted sharply with official readings on Wednesday that had shown steady manufacturing growth in China, and the Aussie slid as much as half a percent in response. 
It stood 0.4 percent lower at $0.7396 by midday in London. 
China's yuan, by contrast, remained firm even after the weak factory activity reading, officially guided onshore rates  touching their strongest in nearly seven months.
Sterling, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls send conflicting signals about next week's national election, was also 0.14 percent weaker at 87.29 pence per euro. (EURGBP=D3)
Another poll overnight showed Prime Minister Theresa May's lead at just 3 points and her overall majority now in question.. Others say she is still 10 points or more in front and will increase her majority. 
Betting markets still put the probability of a win for May's Conservatives at more than 90 percent and the pound is trading almost a cent above the past week's lows against the dollar. But in trade-weighted terms, it hit an 8-week low on Wednesday.
""You get the feeling that the pound just wants to go higher but keeps on getting knocked back down again,"" analysts from Investec said in a morning note. 
""Be it a poll showing Labour’s deficit eroding or data out this morning from the Nationwide showing that the UK house prices have slipped for the third month in a row. (Against the dollar) the pound just seems to be hitting a wall.""

514,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2017 06:17PM ET</span>",British PM May could lose majority in June 8 election: YouGov projection,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in Britain's June 8 election, according to a projection by polling company YouGov, raising the prospect of political turmoil just as formal Brexit talks begin.
The YouGov model suggested May would lose 20 seats and her 17-seat working majority in the 650-seat British parliament, though other models show May winning a big majority of as much as 142 seats and a Kantar poll showed her lead widening.
If the YouGov model turns out to be accurate, May would be well short of the 326 seats needed to form a government tasked with the complicated talks, due to start shortly after the election, on Britain's divorce from the European Union.
A later poll, a separate regular survey carried out by YouGov for Thursday's Times newspaper, showed May's Conservative Party just three percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition, which has been eating into her lead since the start of the campaign.
The Conservatives were on 42 percent, down a point from last week, with Labour up three points, the YouGov survey said.
The findings again weakened sterling which had earlier fallen almost a cent against the U.S. dollar on the YouGov model before rising on a Kantar poll which showed May's lead had increased to 10 percentage points.
May called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, to win more time to deal with the impact of the divorce and to strengthen her grip on the Conservative Party.
But if she does not handsomely beat the 12-seat majority Cameron won in 2015, her electoral gamble will have failed and her authority could be undermined just as she tries to deliver what she has told voters will be a successful Brexit.
If May fails to win an overall majority, she would be forced to strike a deal with another party to continue governing either as a coalition or a minority government.
That would raise questions about the future of Brexit, Britain's $2.5 trillion economy and British policy on a range of issues including corporate taxation and government spending and borrowing.
LANDSLIDE TO LOSING?
When May stunned politicians and financial markets on April 18 with her call for a snap election, opinion polls suggested she could emulate Margaret Thatcher's 1983 majority of 144 seats or even threaten Tony Blair's 1997 Labour majority of 179 seats.
But polls had shown May's rating slipping over the past month and they fell sharply after she set out plans on May 18 to make some elderly people pay a greater share of their care costs, a proposal dubbed the ""dementia tax"" by opponents.
A total of eight polls carried out since the May 22 Manchester suicide attack have shown May's lead over the Labour Party narrowing, with some suggesting she might not win the landslide predicted just a month ago.
When asked by a reporter if she would resign if she lost seats, May dodged the question on Wednesday, saying that the only poll that mattered was the election on June 8.
Recent opinion polls have shown May's lead has contracted to a range of 5 to 14 percentage points. YouGov's election model was based on voting intention figures which gave May a lead of just 3 percentage points, YouGov said.
""Once the Conservative lead falls below 7 points we are potentially in the world of a hung parliament,"" said John Curtice, a leading election expert who is president of the British Polling Council.
""Support for Labour among younger voters has gone up and gone up dramatically but then the crucial question is whether these young people will come out to vote,"" Curtice said.
YouGov, using a technique called ""Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification"", uses a range of factors including demographics, past elections and voter profiles to build a model which can come up with an estimate of how the vote will be split in individual constituencies.
MODELING ELECTIONS
Michael Ashcroft, a former Conservative Party donor who funds polling, uses the same types of modeling as YouGov but came up with a very different estimate of the election: May winning 396 seats and Corbyn winning 180 seats.
Other projections suggested May would win soundly. The Electoral Calculus website, which predicts the results based on polls and electoral geography, said May would win 371 seats and Labour 205 seats.
Betting markets give a more than 80-percent probability of May winning an overall majority, though they were wrong ahead of the unexpected Brexit result in the June 23 referendum last year.
YouGov acknowledged that its predictions were controversial and allowed for a wide margin of error, adding that the samples in each constituency were small.
Jim Messina, a polling and data adviser for the Conservative Party who worked on Barack Obama's campaign, said the YouGov numbers were stupid and that he had spent the day laughing at them.

YouGov allowed for big variations in the outcome of the election, ranging from as high as 345 seats for the Conservatives, 15 more than their current number, to as low as 274, the pollster's chief executive, Stephan Shakespeare, said.

Investors continue to await clues from the European Central Bank on whether it will wind down its bond purchase program this autumn as planned in light of signs that the eurozone economy is improving. But ECB President Mario Draghi on Monday repeated the need for ""substantial"" stimulus.

523,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2017 04:25AM ET</span>","Vietnam to sign deals for up to $17 billion in U.S. goods, services: prime minister","By David Lawder and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said on Tuesday he would sign deals for U.S. goods and services worth $15 billion to $17 billion during his visit to Washington, D.C., mainly for high technology products and for services.
""Vietnam will increase the import of high technologies and services from the United States, and on the occasion of this visit, many important deals will be made,"" Phuc told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce dinner.
Phuc, who is due to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday at the end of a three-day visit to the United States, did not provide any further details of the transactions. 
GE Power Chief Executive Officer Steve Bolze told the dinner that  General Electric  Co (N:GE) will sign new business worth about $6 billion with Vietnam, but also offered no details.
Phuc's comments came after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam, saying this was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it.
""Over the last decade, our bilateral trade deficit has risen from about $7 billion to nearly $32 billion,"" Lighthizer said. ""This concerning growth in our trade deficit presents new challenges and shows us that there is considerable potential to improve further our important trade relationship.""
Lighthizer and other Trump administration trade officials have pledged to work to reduce U.S. bilateral trade deficits with major trading partners. The $32 billion deficit with Vietnam last year -- the sixth largest U.S. trade deficit -- reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture.
The trade issue has become a potential irritant in a relationship where Washington and Hanoi have stepped up security cooperation in recent years given shared concerns about China’s increasingly assertive behavior in East Asia.
In a meeting on Tuesday, Trade Minister Tran Tuan Anh told Lighthizer about Vietnam's views and solutions to some U.S. concerns, such as advertising on U.S. social media, electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products, the southeast Asian nation's trade ministry said.
Vietnam also urged the United States to remove an inspection program on catfish, speed import licenses for its fruit and make fair decisions on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures on Vietnamese products, the ministry said in a statement.
Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.
It reflected calls, letters, diplomatic contacts and lower-level visits that started long before Trump took office in Washington, where Vietnam retains a lobbyist at $30,000 a month.

Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, in which Hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries, and focused U.S. trade policy on reducing deficits.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against most currencies on Tuesday, weighed by a drop in U.S. Treasury yields amid a cautious global sentiment with political worries in Europe and weaker stock and commodity markets after a long U.S. holiday weekend.
""There is a whiff of risk aversion about the markets,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, after Japan's Nikkei dropped, European stocks fell and U.S. equity indexes slid.
Commodities were also on the defensive, with U.S. crude oil futures (clC1) trading below $50 per barrel.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to a more than one-week low, and the dollar was further undermined by weaker-than-expected U.S. consumer confidence data.
In the euro zone, falls in inflation in Spain and several German regions as well as European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's commitment to continued emergency stimulus initially pushed the euro lower. 
Signs that elections in Italy may come as early as September also added to the early pressure on the euro.
""We always knew Italy was going to come back into the market's sights, but I think people thought we would have a longer stay of execution,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley in London. 
""It does seem like the market will have to face worries about elections and populism again over the summer. That of course is a drag for the euro.""
But the euro recovered as the dollar struggled. The dollar index has been soft over the last two weeks on concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. 
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index was down 0.2 percent at 97.29 (DXY), with the euro up 0.2 percent at $1.1186.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound was the main mover among major currencies on Monday, recovering some ground after weekend polls showed Prime Minister Theresa May is set to win next week's elections even if the scale of victory is in question.
Sterling had its worst day since early February on Friday and fell around 2 cents last week as polls showed May's lead over the opposition Labour Party had shrunk from as much as 20 points last month to as low as 5 in one poll. 
More surveys over the weekend confirmed the trend but also showed that May's Conservatives still lead and should win - just potentially not by the landslide she had targeted when calling the election six weeks ago. 
With London markets closed for a holiday, the pound rose 0.2 to 0.3 percent in thin trade in Europe, trading at $1.2837  and 87.07 pence per euro (EURGBP=) respectively. 
The dollar, which also struggled last week in the face of receding expectations for a major boost for growth from the Trump administration, was roughly steady at $1.1185 per euro  and 111.35 yen. 
""A lot of what we are seeing is the after-effects of Friday's news and data releases,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. 
""We have a little bit of dollar strength following better U.S. data and some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials. And we have a little bit of a pound recovery following the latest poll results from the UK.""
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six other major currencies, was lower at 97.366 (DXY) but above last week's nadir of 96.797, its lowest since Nov. 9.
San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said in Singapore on Monday that medium-term trends in U.S. inflation remained ""pretty favourable,"" despite some recent soft consumer price data.
The U.S. economy was at or near the Federal Reserve's goals of full employment and stable prices, Williams said, adding that the U.S. central bank wanted to ensure markets stayed calm as the Fed slowly returned interest-rate policy to normal.
Data on Friday indicated the U.S. economy was expanding, solidifying expectations for a rise in official interest rates next month and adding to the case for the Fed to begin paring its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
""Friday’s batch of US data is weighing on the euro as it strengthens the case a recent slowdown in US data may in fact have been transitory in nature ,"" said LMAX Exchange analyst Joel Kruger.
With New York traders not at their desks, reaction was minimal to a speech by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, which stressed the need for extraordinary monetary stimulus and prodded euro zone bond yields lower.

The PBOC has fine-tuned the pricing mode in the last couple of years by taking reference to the yuan-dollar closing price and the yuan’s value against a basket of currencies.Beijing says yuan policy is actually doing US a favor
But the China Foreign Exchange Trade System said the mainland’s foreign exchange market was susceptible to “irrational expectations” that could exaggerate one-sided sentiment. A “counter-cyclical” factor in the pricing model could help offset the “herd effect” and bring the yuan’s central parity in line with economic fundamentals, it said.
No details about the factor have been made public, but the yuan’s recent stability has been noted in the market and called into question in the face of expected hikes by the Federal Reserve in interest rates this year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.23% to 97.36 by 13:00 EDT.
The U.S. economy slowed less than initially expected in the first quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a pace of 1.2%, well above the 0.7% rise reported last month.
In a separate report, The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell 0.7% in April after rising 2.3% in March. Economists had expected a 1.2% drop in durable goods order.
The bullish GDP data quelled fears that slower U.S. economic growth would sway the Federal Reserve away from its commitment of two additional rate increases in 2017.
The minutes to the Federal Reserve May 2-3 meeting revealed that some Fed officials cautioned that longer-term rate increases would be subject to economic data, showing the dip in first quarter economic growth had been “transitory”.
The pound fell sharply against the dollar to $1.2797, down 1.12%, with an opinion poll showing a narrowing in the Conservatives’ lead over Labour, raising uncertainty over the appeal of Theresa May’s leadership and the ruling party’s election manifesto.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a one-week high on Friday after upbeat U.S. gross domestic product data while Britain's pound slipped after a poll showed a narrowing lead for the ruling Conservatives before elections next month.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.11 percent to 97.357, after rising to a high of 97.512, its strongest since May 19.
The U.S. economy slowed less than initially thought in the first quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.2 percent annual rate instead of the 0.7 percent pace reported last month.
""The GDP figure was a pleasant surprise. I don’t think markets were looking for a revision this big,"" said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.
""It confirms or at least gives some relief to the idea that the weakness that we had seen in economic performance is likely to be transitory.""
The greenback weakened earlier this week after minutes of the Federal Reserve's most recent meeting showed policymakers agreed they should hold off on raising interest rates until it was clear a recent U.S. economic slowdown was temporary.
The dollar was down 0.63 percent against the yen to 111.11 after paring earlier losses and the euro slipped to a 1-week low of $1.1161 against the greenback.
Sterling dived about one percent against the dollar to a 1-month low of $1.2791 after a YouGov poll published on Thursday showed British Prime Minister Theresa May's lead narrowing to just 5 percentage points over the Labour opposition less than two weeks before a general election.
The assumption that a landslide election win for May would strengthen her hand over hardline Brexiteers in her ruling party and allow her to negotiate a smoother departure from the European Union, has given sterling a near 4 percent bump since she announced the election.
That view, however, has been challenged by recent polls.
Sterling was also pressured Thursday after data showed Britain's economy slowed more than previously thought in the first quarter of this year. 
""We are starting to see some signs of economic weakness in the UK and we think that will continue to weigh on sterling,"" said Harajli.

Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar and its New Zealand counterpart recovered ground against the greenback after slipping sharply on Thursday on weakness in commodities, including crude oil.

Overnight, the dollar traded above break-even Thursday, buoyed by bullish initial jobless claims data, lifting expectations that the economy will rebound in the second-quarter but a widening of the trade balance limited upside momentum.
Investors mulled over a mixed bag of economic data, as initial jobless rose less than expected, offsetting a larger than expected rise in the trade deficit, which helped push the dollar into positive territory.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims rose by 1,000 to 234,000 in the week ended May 18.

The stronger labor market data came a day after the release of the Federal Reserve’s minutes to its May meeting, pushed the dollar to fresh six-month lows, as investors parsed somewhat dovish comments from Fed members concerning future rate hikes.
The minutes revealed that some Fed members said that further signs would need to show that weakness in the first-quarter was temporary, prior to future rate hikes.
Traders' expectations of a June rate hike, however, remained intact – nearly 80% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike rates in June, according to investing.com's Fed rate monitor tool.

576,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2017 10:55AM ET</span>","Bitcoin soars above $2,400 to all-time high","(Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin hit a fresh record high on Wednesday, surging above $2,400, as demand for crypto-assets soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology.
Blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator.
Bitcoin hit a record of $2,409  on the BitStamp platform and was last up 4.3 percent at $2,363. So far this year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled. 
A key reason for bitcoin's dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size - the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.
Also, a big part of bitcoin's recent surge is the increase in demand for other digital currencies being sold in so-called ""initial coin offerings"", or ICOs. Under ICOs, blockchain start-ups sell their tokens directly to the public to raise capital without any regulatory oversight.
""Bitcoin up 100 percent in under 2 months. Shanghai down almost 10 percent same timeframe, compared to most global stocks up. Probably not a coincidence!"", Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive at DoubleLine Capital tweeted on Tuesday.

Strong demand for bitcoins in Japan has also fueled the rise of the virtual currency that can be moved like money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for a central authority.

That came after it rose 9% on Monday to trade above $2,200 for the first time, after closing last Friday at a then record high of $1,913. Bitcoin is up some 130% since the start of the year and has risen close to 400% from a year ago as an increasing number of companies seem willing to assume exposure to the digital currency. It has also become a safe haven currency for political risk. Ironically, the biggest group of buyers are Japanese nationals, holders of the safe-haven yen. Japanese regulators are some of the strictest regarding trading in digital currencies.So, should you invest in Bitcoin? If you believe what you are witnessing is a stampede then prudence would suggest investors should wait for a correction before getting exposure to the asset.“To say that the RSI is overbought is an understatement,” an Investing.com analyst says in an article for the global financial site. The RSI, or relative strength index, charts the strength or weakness of an asset based on recent closing prices.The site’s analyst also points out that stochastics are overbought, posing the threat of a bearish cross and a double top. Stochastics measure the relationship between closing prices and price range for a set period of time.He says it is anyone’s guess as to when to get into the market. His suggestion: when the digital currency’s price returns to its last uptrend line in late March, probably at the $1,650 level."

The cryptocurrency is up by 3.5%, or $80, on Wednesday at $2,339 a coin. It has gained in 26 of the past 29 sessions and has doubled in value over that time.
Wednesday's gain comes after  China was downgraded at Moody's and a  bitcoin scaling agreement was reached by the Digital Currency Group, representing 56 companies in 21 countries, at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. The agreement states:
""We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades to the bitcoin protocol, which will be deployed simultaneously and based on the original  Segwit2Mb proposal:
The announcement is the latest bit of good news for the cryptocurrency. At the beginning of April, Japan announced bitcoin had become a  legal payment method in the country. Additionally, Ulmart, Russia's largest online retailer, said it would  begin accepting bitcoin even though Russia had said it wouldn't explore the cryptocurrency until 2018.
The gains also seem to be boosted by speculation the US Securities and Exchange Commission could overturn its  ruling on the Winklevoss twins' bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The SEC was accepting public comment on its decision until May 15, but it hasn't announced whether it will overturn its rejection of the ETF.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Wednesday, having rebounded from 6-1/2-month lows against its major peers helped by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, while the yuan eased after Moody's cut its sovereign rating on China due to concerns over the country's soaring debt.
The dollar index held steady against a basket of six currencies at 97.321 after bouncing 0.4 percent the previous day.
It managed to pull away from the 96.797 level plumbed on Monday, its lowest since Nov. 9, when concerns over U.S. politics stemming from the Trump election campaign's suspected links with Russia took a toll on the greenback.
The dollar was boosted as U.S. debt prices fell, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield climbing 3 basis points overnight and putting some distance between the one-month trough reached last week in a bond-buying flight to safety.
""The rise in Treasury yields is supporting the dollar. It appears that speculative buying of Treasuries has run its course, with Trump concerns and geopolitical risks no longer fresh news,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The dollar was firm at 111.795 yen after a bounce to 111.995 yen, its highest in a week.
The U.S. currency also managed to halt its slide against the euro, which had enjoyed a bull run this month on factors including an ebb in French political concerns, upbeat euro zone data, and a widening German-U.S. government debt yield spread.
The euro was little changed at $1.1191, nudged away from a 6-1/2-month high of $1.1268 scaled the previous day.
Investors are now turning their focus toward the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. Minutes of the Fed's latest policy-setting meeting are set for publication at 2 p.m. eastern time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday.
The market already expects the Fed to raise interest rates in June, but given the greenback's recent weakness, dollar bulls are expected to welcome any hawkish hints by the central bank.
MOODY'S DOWNGRADES CHINA
Moody's Investors Services on Wednesday downgraded China's long-term local and foreign currency issuer ratings by one notch to A1 from Aa3, citing expectations that the financial strength of the world's second-biggest economy would erode in the coming years.
China's offshore yuan slipped in knee-jerk reaction but the overall response was limited. The yuan fell to 6.8901 per dollar, down by 0.1 percent, before pulling back to 6.8841 for a loss of about 0.05 percent.
The Australian dollar, sometimes used as a proxy of China-related trades, eased slightly but reaction to the downgrade was also relatively subdued. The Aussie was down 0.15 percent at $0.7466.
""Currencies are reacting quite calmly, as China is still seen to have enough reserve strength for further fiscal spending,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar stood steady at C$1.3518 per dollar after touching C$1.3457 overnight, its strongest in a month.
A rise in crude oil prices lifted the Canadian dollar. The focus is now on the OPEC meeting in Vienna on Thursday to see whether a deal to prolong output cuts can be struck. [O/R]

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound slipped against the yen after a suspected terrorist attack at a concert in Britain's city of Manchester, while the euro hovered near a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the currency was ""too weak."" 
Sterling was down 0.2 percent at 144.36 yen (GBPJPY=) after weakening to as much as 144.06.
It was little changed against the dollar at $1.2992  and a touch lower at 86.60 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
Police said an explosion at the end of a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in the English city of Manchester on Monday killed at least 19 people and injured more than 50.
Two U.S. officials said a suicide bomber was suspected, while Prime Minister Theresa May said the incident was being treated as a terrorist attack. 
The safe-haven yen advanced against major peers like the dollar and euro but its gains were modest.
The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 111.100 yen  after a dip to 110.860 and the euro slid 0.2 percent to 124.860 yen (EURJPY=).
""The yen may have been bought in reaction to the blast, but the incident is unlikely to have lasting impact on the broader scheme of things,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""Even prior to the incident, market sentiment has not been particularly 'risk on' for a while, with relatively low U.S. yields limiting the dollar's attraction."" 
The euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1247  after touching $1.1264 overnight, its highest since Nov. 9.
Merkel said on Monday that the common currency is weak due to the European Central Bank's monetary policy, pointing out that this helped explain Germany's relatively high trade surplus.
The chancellor's comments provided fresh momentum to the euro, which has been on a bullish footing since the French presidential elections earlier this month. Upbeat euro zone data and a widening spread between the 10-year German and U.S. government bond yields have also supported the currency.
""While the ebb in French political risk and prospects of a ECB policy shift have helped the euro, the biggest support factor still remains the recent weakening of the dollar in wake of 'Russiagate,'"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Merkel's comments was extra fuel for the euro...that said, a weaker dollar is not necessarily a bad thing for Trump.""
The dollar index lost 0.1 percent to 96.882 (DXY).
Antipodean currencies benefited from the dollar's broader weakness.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a more than six-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday, extending its losses from last week, as an uncertain U.S. political climate and a buoyant euro weighed on the greenback.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.14 percent to 97.005. It fell to a low of 96.797, its lowest since Nov. 9, earlier in the session.
""I think it is a continuation of the move we have seen since mid-April,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. 
""The dollar's broad declines are driven by the increasingly mixed tone to U.S. economic data, which has led to investors questioning the extent to which the Fed will be raising rates this year. The political climate is also acting as a key headwind for the dollar.""
The dollar fell more than 2 percent last week, logging its worst performance in more than a year, amid growing concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's recent firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into possible links between the president's team and Russia.
Political turmoil in Washington has also raised worries that there could be delays in Trump's efforts to implement his economic stimulus plans.
""Generally speaking, we still have a constructive view on the dollar but in light of some of the recent weakness we certainly have to contemplate how lasting could this impact from fiscal policy, or lack thereof, be for the currency markets,"" said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
The greenback was also pressured by a rallying euro, which hit a more than six-month high against the dollar on Monday after Germany's Angela Merkel prefaced a summit of G7 leaders later this week by saying a ""too weak"" currency was behind her country's massive trade surplus.
Speaking to students at a secondary school in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany's huge export earnings were propelled by two factors over which the government had no influence, namely the euro's exchange rate and oil prices.
The euro was up 0.25 percent against the dollar at $1.1232 after hitting a high of $1.1263, earlier in the session.

Meanwhile, sterling slipped broadly after polls showed a narrowing lead for Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May over her opposition ahead of elections next month.

631,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2017 07:33AM ET</span>",Trump slump deepens after worst falls for dollar since July,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar extended losses against the yen and the Swiss franc on Thursday as investors feeling increasingly nervous over the future of Donald Trump's U.S. presidency sought safe havens for their money.
After some signs of stability in Asia, dollar selling resumed in the European morning as Reuters reported that investigators were looking at records of numerous undisclosed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
The franc, a traditional destination for capital in times of financial or political stress, hit a 10-day high against the euro and its strongest since Trump's election last November against the dollar.
The yen, which saw its biggest daily gain against the dollar since last July on Wednesday, gained another 0.4 percent to 110.24 yen.
""Risk aversion is rife once again with the brewing political storm surrounding President Trump in the U.S. largely being blamed,"" said Craig Erlam, a market analyst with retail broker Oanda in London.
""While I don’t believe at this stage that these reports regarding Trump will jeopardize his agenda, markets must reflect the challenges he now faces.""
The dollar surged late last year on the assumption that Trump would boost U.S. growth and inflation with a combination of tax cuts and spending while also encouraging repatriation of foreign-held corporate capital to the United States.
That faith has steadily evaporated in 2017 as he struggled to deliver on promises of ""phenomenal"" tax reform and a new healthcare bill, and rows over other parts of the administration erupted.
Meanwhile, a run of downbeat U.S. economic data in the past month has weakened expectations for further rises in Federal Reserve interest rates this year.
""While there could be a meaningful dollar recovery on the horizon, the short-term picture still suggests room for a little more weakness,"" said Joel Kruger, a strategist with LMAX Exchange in London.
""It's important to note that this move in the dollar was already in play, with the market assigning too much of the weakness to this political distraction. The U.S. administration's protectionist policies and softer data have been the primary drivers.""
Still, the fall was not all-encompassing.
A drop in global oil prices that went along with weaker stock markets hurt commodities-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar <CAD=> and the Norwegian crown <NOK=> down by 0.3 and 0.7 percent respectively against the greenback.
The dollar was also marginally higher on the day against the euro at $1.1121. <EUR=EBS>
""After the massive rally in bonds yesterday we have seen something of a snapback,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy with CIBC World Markets in London.

""It remains to be seen whether we can move on from the political issues around Trump and Russia. We haven't been dollar bulls for a while and even if we see some more recovery this does just look like the tail-end of the dollar's run (higher).""

On Wednesday the Justice Department appointed a former FBI director as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in November’s presidential election, as well as possible collusion by President Donald Trump’s campaign team.
The appointment of a special counsel comes after Trump fired James Comey, his FBI director who was leading a probe into Russia’s role in the election and reports that he attempted to interfere with the judicial process, leading to talk of possible impeachment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar wallowed near six-month lows against a basket of major currencies on Thursday as the U.S. political crisis appeared to deepen, threatening to delay efforts by President Donald Trump to implement his economic stimulus plans.
""Political instability in the United States is shaking markets. You put a brake on investments to the U.S. when you see those headlines,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street Bank.
The Justice Department appointed a former FBI director as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team and Russia.
The appointment of a special counsel follows Trump's dismissal of James Comey, his FBI director who was investigating Russia's role in the U.S. election. 
Media then reported that Trump may have interfered with a federal investigation, a serious allegation that could even lead to his impeachment if verified.
""Some politicians might try to begin the impeachment process, and if they do, that would take much time to carry it out, and while it is ongoing, it would be almost impossible to push fiscal stimulus through,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo, noting that it took almost two years for the Bill Clinton impeachment process to proceed though Congress.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, fell as low as 97.333 (DXY) on Wednesday, its lowest level since Nov. 9, having given up all the gains it had made following the U.S. presidential election in November. 
It last stood at 97.588, flat from late U.S. trade, and down more than 2 percent over the past four sessions. 
Trump's surprise election victory had initially sparked buying in the dollar and U.S. assets on hopes for his tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans, but such ""Trump trades"" have been wound back.
The dollar index has now fallen more than 5 percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Jan 3, despite expectations of higher U.S. interest rates that should bolster the U.S. currency.
The Federal Reserve raised rates in March and its officials have said there could be two or three more rate hikes this year.
Yet, U.S. political turmoil and softer-than-expected U.S. economic data such as retail sales, consumer inflation and housing starts in the past week is leading market players to discount the chance of more rate hikes.
Fed Fund futures <0#FF:> are now pricing in only about 60 percent chance of a rate hike by June, compared to around 90 percent earlier this month, and are no longer pricing in a 100 percent chance of a hike even by December.
Against that backdrop, the dollar dropped 2.09 percent against the yen on Wednesday, its biggest fall since July 29 last year. 
It fell to a three-week low of 110.53 yen early on Thursday before bouncing back slightly to 111.25 yen , up 0.5 percent from late U.S. levels on bargain-hunting by Japanese investors. 
The yen gave a limited response to data showing Japan's GDP grew an annualized 2.2 percent in the first quarter, handily beating economists' forecast of 1.7 percent rise.
""Although the headline GDP was stronger than expected, the GDP deflator was deeper into negative, pointing to persistent deflationary pressure,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
The euro  hit a six-month high of $1.1174 and last stood at $1.1143, down 0.1 percent on the day. 
""My feeling is that the current level of the euro is too high, and isn't sustainable based on fundamentals, when U.S. growth and the economy are not so bad, so I'm feeling that the current levels are a very good chance to sell the euro against the dollar,"" Brown Brothers Harriman's Murata said.
""I'm guessing that some ECB officials will speak up about euro strength having a downside for the eurozone economy,"" he added.
The Swiss franc  hit a six-month high of 0.9772 to the dollar on Wednesday before easing back to 0.9805. 

Against the euro, to which the Swiss currency is closely tied, the franc firmed to 1.0923 franc per euro (EURCHF=) from last week's eight-month low of 1.0988.

Elsewhere, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.2% after a 0.3% drop in March, which was the biggest fall in more than two years.
The slowdown in retail sales and inflation failed to dampened investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve was set to hike its benchmark rate in June, after Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker said on Friday ""things are looking pretty good"" for the U.S. economy and reiterated his view that two more rate hikes are appropriate this year.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, 70% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in June, compared to 63% in the previous week.

694,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2017 07:46AM ET</span>",Forex - Sterling hits day’s lows after BoE meeting minutes,"Investing.com - The pound fell to the days lows against the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of England left interest rates on hold at current record lows and warned that living standards will fall this year as the headwinds from Brexit mount.
GBP/USD was down 0.61% to 1.2863 by 11.40 GMT from around 1.2919 ahead of the announcement.
The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-1 to keep rates on hold at a record low of 0.25%, in line with economists’ expectations.
Kristin Forbes, who is due to leave the BoE in June, cast the sole vote in favor of raising borrowing costs to 0.5%. The other seven members of the MPC opted to keep rates steady.
The committee voted unanimously to make no changes to its bond-buying stimulus program, in line with economists’ expectations.
The MPC was one member short, with Charlotte Hogg still to be replaced after resigning last month following her failure to disclose that her brother works for Barclays, which is regulated by the BoE.
The bank trimmed its forecast for growth for this year, saying it now expected economic growth of 1.9%, down from 2.0% three months ago. It raised its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.7% up from 1.6% in February.
The bank now expects inflation to be 2.7% this quarter, up from the 2.4% rate it forecast in February. It said inflation would continue to rise further above its 2% target in the coming months, “peaking a little below 3% in the fourth quarter.”
The bank warned that living standards will fall this year, cutting its forecast for average earnings growth for 2017 to 2% from 3% expected in February.
The minutes noted that its forecasts are based on Britain achieving a ‘smooth’ Brexit.
The BoE also warned that it might have to raise interest rates faster than the market thinks if inflation continues to overshoot its target.
""If the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the May central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the very gently rising path implied by the market yield curve underlying the May projections,"" the minutes said.

701,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2017 02:00AM ET</span>","Kiwi slides as NZ central bank retains inflation outlook, neutral rate bias","By Charlotte Greenfield and Jane Wardell
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) defied market expectations it would adopt a more hawkish tone at its policy meeting on Thursday, retaining instead its neutral stance and sending the country's currency to an 11-month low.
The monetary policy statement accompanying the RBNZ's decision to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 1.75 percent was the clearest sign yet of the divergence between the central bank and the market on the inflation outlook. 
""Underlying inflationary pressure is no different today than it was in February,"" Assistant Governor John McDermott told Reuters in an interview, adding that a spike in headline inflation in the March quarter was mainly due to temporary rises in petrol and food prices. 
Inflation accelerated to 2.2 percent in the quarter, well above the RBNZ's projection of 1.5 percent, and the first time since 2011 inflation had reached the midpoint of the central bank's target range.
""There is a lot of noise and some people are misunderstanding what they are seeing,"" McDermott said. ""I think some people have simply got it wrong.""
The bank's consumer price index forecasts show inflation falling back to the bottom of the 1-3 percent target band next year.
It maintained an unchanged official cash rate (OCR) projection that implies the next move will be a tightening in late 2019, surprising economists who had expected that timeline to shift forward to the first half of 2019.
McDermott said the bank retains ""a broad view that the next (rate) move could be up or down.""
""Premature tightening of policy could undermine growth, causing inflation to persistently undershoot the target midpoint,"" the bank said in its Monetary Policy Statement.
Conversely, ""further policy easing, in an attempt to see non-tradables inflation strengthen more quickly, would risk generating unnecessary volatility in the economy.""
Satish Ranchhod, a senior economist at Westpac in Auckland, said he agreed that some of the recent inflation was temporary but added that a strong outlook for construction would drive up prices.
""We do think inflation's going to rise a bit more quickly than the Reserve Bank is going to factor in,"" he said.
KIWI FALL
RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said that a 5 percent decline in the New Zealand dollar on a trade-weighted basis over the past three months was ""encouraging, and if sustained, would help rebalance the growth outlook."" 
He dropped the phrase ""further depreciation is needed to achieve more balanced growth"" that had featured in statements published earlier this year.
However, McDermott told Reuters that while the bank was ""not unhappy"" with an immediate 1.4 percent drop in the New Zealand dollar  to an 11-month low of $0.6843 after the statement, policymakers ""continue to think that a little bit more is necessary.""
McDermott said the main three international risks were the outlook for U.S. fiscal policy, European growth and China demand.
""The risk of the extreme outcomes from those three things seems to be less than they were a few months ago,"" he said, while still advising caution.
Citibank economists said the RBNZ had delivered a somewhat mixed message, although the market had interpreted it as dovish, there were elements that hinted at inflationary stresses.
""Despite...key signposts on the policy bias, the monetary policy statement is littered by comments that point to rising capacity pressure,"" they said in an emailed note.
Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank in Auckland, queried whether the RBNZ's rate outlook was too serene. 
""There are a few things in there that raise some question marks about whether or not the Reserve Bank's being too sanguine in expecting to keep interest rates at a record low for another two and a half years,"" Tuffley told Reuters.

710,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2017 04:13AM ET</span>",Dollar close to eight-week high vs yen as risk appetite recovers,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied close to an eight-week high against the safe-haven yen on Wednesday as risk appetite - historically high in recent days - recovered from a dip in Asian trading when U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly fired the head of the FBI. 
Trump said he had sacked FBI Director James Comey - who had been leading an investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaign's possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome - over his handling of an email scandal involving presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
But Democrats immediately accused Trump of having political motives, piquing investors' aversion to risk, and sending the dollar down as much as 0.6 percent against the yen , a currency that investors favor at times of uncertainty.
By 0752 GMT, though, the strong risk appetite that has dominated global markets this week appeared to be returning, and the dollar edged back above 114 yen, close to the previous day's high of 114.325. 
Both realized and implied volatility have fallen sharply since Emmanuel Macron defeated the anti-EU Marine Le Pen in France's presidential run-off on Sunday, as worries over European political risk have faded and focus has returned to central bank policy. 
The Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency, fell to its lowest in seven months on Tuesday and stayed close to that at 1.09575 francs per euro, flat on the day (EURCHF=). 
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt, though, said risk appetite could only drive the currency market so far before new drivers were needed. 
""Dollar strength could materialize more, given the more benevolent risk environment, but that can only move the market for so long – you always need new impetus,"" she said. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, had hit a three-week high of 99.688 on Tuesday (DXY), but it slipped 0.2 percent to 99.415 on Wednesday. 
U.S. political uncertainty has tended to weigh on the dollar in recent months, on the view that a divided Congress could derail Trump's promised tax reform and stimulus program. 
""The 'Trump trade' lifted the dollar after the election, but now we have to see if he can deliver on all of his promises,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 124.31 (EURJPY=EBS), close to Monday's one-year high of 124.58.
Against the dollar, it gained 0.2 percent but stayed below $1.09, having topped $1.10 after Macron's election win.
Focus was on a speech later in the Netherlands by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, who will be watched for a possible move towards a more hawkish tone amid strength in the euro zone economy and receding political risks.

717,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2017 07:38PM ET</span>","Bitcoin surges to all-time high above $1,700","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin hit a record high on Tuesday as demand for crypto-assets soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology.
Blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset wthout the need for a central regulator
Bitcoin hit a record $1,760.40  on the BitStamp platform and was last at $1,747.89, up 6 percent on the day. So far this year, bitcoin has surged nearly 80 percent. Bitcoin's market capitalization on Tuesday soared to $52.5 billion, according to data from coinmarketcap.com.
Aside from being an asset that can be traded on exchanges like stocks and bonds, bitcoin has become a mode of payment for some retailers, such as  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK), and a way to transfer funds without the need for a third party.
""We have an influx of new capital in the space and that capital goes back and forth among crypto-assets and bitcoin,"" said Chris Burniske, blockchain products leader at ARK Invest in New York, which manages exchange-traded funds.
""Bitcoin is still the main liquidity provider in the market and people use it to buy other crypto-assets.""
That said, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari has been skeptical about bitcoin's outlook, noting that blockchain has more potential for being adopted in the future than the digital currency itself.
""I think sentiment has shifted in the markets, in the Fed,"" Kashkari said at a technology conference in Minneapolis on Tuesday.
Still, a big part of bitcoin's recent surge is the increase in demand for other digital currencies being sold in so-called ""initial coin offerings,"" or ICOs. Under ICOs, blockchain start-ups sell their tokens directly to the public to raise capital without any regulatory oversight.
At least 40 start-ups have launched an ICO this year, according Smith + Crown data.
""For the first time in financial history, founders can access capital from both large and small investors armed with nothing more than a slick website,"" said Arthur Hayes, chief executive at crypto-currency derivatives trading platform BitMEX.
Analysts say the foundation for bitcoin's gains was set last July in a process called ""halving,"" in which rewards offered to bitcoin miners shrink. That has constrained bitcoin's supply.

Bitcoin relies on so-called ""mining"" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins.

USD/CAD was up 0.33% to 1.3739 by 09.43 ET, from Monday’s close of 1.3688.
Oil prices surrendered early gains Tuesday amid persistent concerns that rising U.S. oil output is threatening to derail efforts by other major producers to restrict supply in a bid to rebalance the global market.
Traders were looking ahead to oil inventory data from industry group the America Petroleum Institute later in the trading day.
Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil and metals.
The Canadian dollar has been one of the worst performers against the greenback so far this year, weakening steadily since mid-April and falling to a 14-month trough last week, before recovering slightly.
The loonie has been pressured lower by a combination of lower commodity prices, concerns about a possible renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and worries over how trouble at alternative lender Home Capital could affect the country's real estate market.
Home Capital Group (TO:HCG) said on Tuesday that a third party, which it did not name, intends to buy up to C$1.50 billion ($1.10 billion) in mortgages.
Home Capital, Canada’s largest non-bank lender is facing a regulatory probe for misleading investors, leading to an exodus of customer deposits.
Meanwhile, data on Tuesday showed that the value of Canadian building permits unexpectedly declined in March for the second month in a row, falling by 5.8%. Economists had expected an increase of 5.5%.
The greenback remained broadly stronger, with the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, up 0.35% to 99.38."

The cryptocurrency trades up 3.45% at $1,720.82 a coin, as trade grinds higher for the 16th time in 18 sessions. It has gained nearly 50% during its run.
Tuesday's gain comes without any obvious catalyst as traders await the US Securities and Exchange Commission's ruling on whether it will  reverse its decision to reject the Winklevoss twins' exchange-traded fund.
The SEC rejected two bitcoin ETFs back in March, saying it ""is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.""
Bitcoin recently has shrugged off  China restricting trade, the SEC's rejecting of the two bitcoin ETFs, and threats from developers to create a ""hard fork"" that would split the cryptocurrency in two.
But there has also been some good news for bitcoin, which has posted an 81% gain this year.
At the beginning of April, Japan's financial regulators said  bitcoin would be considered a legal payment method in the country, and days later Russia said it would consider bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018.

The euro retreated as gains had already been priced in after Macron’s strong showing in the first round of voting two weeks ago.
Investors were also turning their attention to the difficulties Macron will face in implementing his proposed program of economic reforms.
With political risk seen fading investors were refocusing on monetary policy.
Recent economic reports have indicated that the economic recovery in the euro area is gathering momentum, which is expected to give the European Central Bank more room to tighten monetary policy before the end of the year.

USD/CAD was up 0.25% at 1.3685 by 09.30 ET, after rising as high as 1.3719 earlier.
The price of oil, one of Canada's main exports, gave up early gains on Monday amid persistent concerns that rising U.S. oil output is threatening to derail efforts by other major producers to restrict supply in a bid to rebalance the global market.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters, including Russia, enacted production cuts in the first half of 2017.
Oil prices found some support after Russia said it was discussing prolonging cuts with other producers beyond the end of this year. Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih also talked of the possibility of prolonging curbs beyond 2017.
The loonie fell to 14-month lows against the greenback on Friday as oil prices plunged, before rebounding when oil prices bounced back.
The loonie also came under additional pressure after Canadian jobs data showed that the economy added fewer jobs than expected in April.
Statistics Canada reported Friday that the economy added 3,200 jobs last month, falling short of economists' forecasts for a gain of 10,000. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 6.5% from 6.7%, the lowest since October 2008.
Meanwhile, Friday’s U.S. jobs report showed that the economy added 211,000 jobs last month, beating expectations for a gain of 185,000 and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%, a near a 10-year low.

760,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2017 01:10PM ET</span>",Canadian dollar to strengthen after 'perfect storm': Reuters poll,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar will weather a ""perfect storm"" to regain some ground over the coming months, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, as a pickup in the domestic economy could prod the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates by next year.
The loonie  has lost 2 percent against the greenback this year, the weakest performance among G10 currencies. On Tuesday it touched a 14-month intraday low at C$1.3758.
Speculators have also ramped up bearish bets on the loonie to the most since February 2016.
However, a survey of more than 50 foreign exchange strategists shows they expect the Canadian dollar will recover to C$1.3500 in one month and firm further to C$1.3400 in a year, according to their median forecast.
The loonie is under pressure from myriad factors, including the fall in the price of crude oil, a major Canadian export. 
Another headwind is the monetary policy divergence between the U.S. Federal Reserve, which began raising interest rates in December 2015, and the Bank of Canada, which has not hiked them since 2010. 
Also weighing on the currency is the uncertain fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which binds Canada, the United States and Mexico. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would terminate it if negotiations on the accord became ""unserious.""
""Right now it is a perfect storm for the Canadian dollar, you have a dovish Bank of Canada; you have soft oil prices; you have import duties being slapped by the U.S. on Canadian lumber which gets investors worried that it could lead to worse things like other trade barriers,"" said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial.
He expects the currency to turn the corner and firm to C$1.3300 in 12 months as current strength in the economy feeds inflationary pressures. 
Economists say Canada's gross domestic product may have grown as much as 4 percent at an annualized rate in the first quarter following a strong expansion in the second half of 2016.
""Our view is that the currency has overreacted to these events and will strengthen from here,"" said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""We think this is the weaker end of the range that we are going to see over the next 12 to 18 months.""
He added: ""We have seen very strong growth in the Canadian economy ... which has seen us pull forward (to the first quarter of 2018) our expectations for the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates.""
But the bank has played down the sustainability of recent growth.
In addition, the funding crisis at mortgage lender  Home Capital Group Inc  (TO:HCG) may spark a welcome cooling in Canada's housing market and take pressure off the central bank to tighten monetary policy.
Expectations of a central bank interest rate hike this year have dwindled, data from the overnight index swaps market shows. As recently as Friday, there was a one-in-four chance implied of a rate increase. 
Still, strategists expect the Bank of Canada to eventually adopt a more hawkish tone.
""There is a limit to how long you can stick to a negative story when things are improving,"" National Bank Financial's Rangasamy said.

U.S.-Canadian monetary policy divergence should narrow as Canada's economy reaches full capacity in the first half of 2018, said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).

762,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2017 11:57AM ET</span>",Sterling's election-led bounce breaks developing spiral,"By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - The lift to sterling given by the prospect of a snap British election next month has, at least temporarily, broken a vicious circle of rapidly rising inflation that threatened to further undermine the economy and paint the central bank into a corner.
The currency's steep fall since June's Brexit referendum has aggravated inflation to 2.3 percent, above the Bank of England's 2 percent target, risking a drain on consumers' real spending power while tying the Bank of England's hands if further monetary easing were needed.
The pound has traded in a range of roughly $1.20 to $1.27 to the dollar for the past six months and many analysts said they thought it was heading back towards the bottom of that range or even lower due to fears the two-year EU exit negotiating process would bring a sharp break with the bloc.
British bond yields had been climbing on the inflation picture and the conundrum that would pose for policymakers, driving up the country's borrowing costs.
But after the election announcement on April 18, sterling rose sharply, breaking out of the top of the range to a seven-month high close to $1.30, due to indications from opinion polls that it would result in a bigger majority for Prime Minister Theresa May's ruling Conservatives.
Investors took the view that it would also boost the number of Conservatives seeking a “softer” Brexit, in which Britain keep some kind of preferential access to the EU single market rather than cutting all ties as some in the party advocate.
Few people think the pound will rise much further, but if it levels out, it should help tame inflation and ease the strain on consumers, whose spending accounts for about two thirds of economic output, breaking the ""stagflationary"" spiral of higher inflation and lower growth.
The turnaround has been accompanied by a reversal in bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield recently hit a six-month low close to 1 percent, having topped 1.50 percent in January.
""Sterling back to $1.30 and UK yields not moving too high, keeping easy financial conditions in place, is probably the best combination the Bank of England could have hoped for,"" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management, who oversees around $2 trillion in assets.
Sterling is up slightly against the euro this year and nearly 5 percent higher against the dollar. Ten-year gilt yields are 13 basis points lower year to date too.
CARRY THAT WEIGHT
The British economy is holding up far better than most economists had anticipated, but is beginning to feel the pinch from inflation and Brexit uncertainty. Growth in the first quarter of this year was 0.3 percent, the slowest in a year.
Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) say the Brexit slowdown has begun, and that interest rates will remain on hold until at least 2019. The BoE will give its prognosis on the economy on May 11 when it releases its latest Quarterly Inflation Report.
The Bank halved interest rates to a new record low of 0.25 percent and expanded its quantitative easing bond-buying program shortly after the referendum last year.
Only one of the Bank's nine policymakers, Kristin Forbes, voted for a rate hike at the last MPC meeting. But Michael Saunders has hinted that he may join her, predicting that the ""powerful effects"" of sterling's fall since the Brexit referendum could push growth and inflation beyond forecasts.
Burkhard Varnholt, deputy global chief investment officer at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which oversees 1.3 trillion francs of assets under management, notes that sterling has been ""underowned and underloved"" by international investors.
Positioning data from the International Monetary Market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange at the end of March reflected that. Speculators such as hedge funds had amassed the biggest bet against sterling on record, a net short position of over 107,000 contracts.
That's been cut to 91,182 contracts, still large by historical standards but the smallest since early March.
""As investors are buying sterling again, yields are coming down because there's money flowing into gilts. Markets are doing the heavy lifting for the BoE – the BoE must be pleased with what's going on here,"" Varnholt said.
The FX market's outlook for the pound is brighter too. Sterling bears Deutsche and BAML both raised their forecasts on the election news, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects it to reach $1.45 next year
However, medians in the poll of over 60 strategists, taken by Reuters in the past week, showed sterling would be worth $1.27 in a month -- just before the general election -- but then weaken to $1.24 in six months before settling at $1.25 a year from now.
Even $1.45 would be well below the pound's long-term average value. Over the past 10 years it is $1.63; over 20 and 30 years it is $1.64; and over 40 years it is $1.67, according to former MPC member Andrew Sentance.
""Growth is much more influential for the MPC than currency and bond yield movements. If GDP softens enough, any support on the MPC for rate rises could fade away quite quickly,"" he said.

764,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",Euro generally back in favors vs dollar: FX strategists,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari Kishan
(Reuters) - Foreign exchange strategists in the latest Reuters poll have raised forecasts for the euro to a six-month high against the dollar, although the single currency is expected to edge down a little over the coming months. 
They warned, however, that a shock victory for anti-euro Marine Le Pen in Sunday's French presidential election could send the euro down 5 percent.
The single currency has gained close to 4 percent so far this year, breaking a three-year losing streak during which it shed about a quarter of its value.
While the latest poll of more than 65 strategists showed the euro would slip about 1 percent in the coming year from the $1.09 it was trading at on Wednesday, it would still be above where it ended 2016. 
""Political risks have had limited impact on the euro so it has kind of remained more resilient than anticipated,"" Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ currency economist Lee Hardman said.
The latest consensus forecasts in the Reuters poll are based on independent candidate Emmanuel Macron winning the French presidency on May 7.
Analysts were split on what margin Macron needs to win by for their forecasts to hold, with the range varying from as little as five percentage points to more than 20 percentage points. He has a roughly 20-point lead for now.
But if Le Pen, the anti-European Union candidate, wins, the euro will fall close to parity with the dollar, similar to predictions in last month's poll.
""I think we will get down closer towards parity if Le Pen was to win. Obviously there would be an initial kind of shock reaction,"" Hardman said.
At the beginning of the year, about a third of the Reuters FX poll panel was expecting the euro to either hit parity or trade below that by end-December, based on economic underperformance and a rising dollar. But only a handful see this happening now.  
Much of analysts' dollar optimism at the start of the year was down to the surprise election of Donald Trump as U.S. President and the reforms he promised to bring in, including infrastructure spending and sweeping tax cuts. 
But analysts are now skeptical about his ability to pass these through Congress after his failure to pass healthcare reform and a dearth of major successes in his first 100 days in office.
Speculators have left their long positions against the dollar unchanged and pared back short positions against the euro, according to recent CFTC data.
One reason why calls for a weaker euro have dwindled is the recent pick-up in euro zone economic data - the bloc's economy started the year by growing nearly three times faster on a quarter-on-quarter basis than the United States.
While the ECB is expected to remain on the sidelines this year, when asked about the next likely move, a majority of economists in a recent Reuters poll said it would extend its asset purchases program beyond December 2017 with a cut to the monthly spend.

That would probably push the euro up against the dollar.

765,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2017 09:30AM ET</span>",Pension reform vote clouds outlook for Brazil's currency: Reuters poll,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's currency will become more volatile in coming months as investors fear lawmakers could block key austerity measures ahead of next year's general elections, strategists said in a Reuters poll.
The Brazilian real is forecast at 3.25 per U.S. dollar in a year from now, 3 percent weaker than Tuesday's close but stronger than a forecast of 3.295 per dollar in an April poll, according to the median of 18 estimates in the survey.
Strategists also upgraded their outlook for other major Latin American currencies, with the Mexican peso forecast to trade at 19.20 per U.S. dollar a year from now and the Colombian peso projected at 2,971.0.
The Brazilian real has gained 10 percent since President Michel Temer took office nearly a year ago on hopes he would be able to get his allies in congress to approve a series of landmark economic reforms and help pull the economy out of a deep, two-year-long recession.
However, if he fails to win approval for an overhaul of Brazil's social security reform, the real could weaken to 3.65 per dollar this year, according to the median of eight alternative estimates that ranged between 3.30 and 4.00.
Uncertainty over the pension reform vote, Temer's no.1 priority, has grown as traders and investors watch the administration struggle to muster the 308 votes needed to pass the bill in the Lower House.
""Volatility will be the rule over the next months,"" said Jankiel Santos, chief Brazil economist at investment bank Haitong, in São Paulo. ""There's no way we can try to anticipate political events such as this one.""
Economists and investors see pension reform as the only way for Brazil to shore up its finances in the long run without resorting to massive tax hikes.
However, 71 percent of Brazilians oppose it as most would have to work longer to reach a minimum retirement age of 63 to 65 years and could earn less, according to a national Datafolha survey on Monday. [nL1N1I30L4]
Legislators, dozens of whom are under investigation for corruption, will face a tough campaign for re-election next year. Temer already watered down his original pension reform proposal to roughly three-quarters of the initial plan and faces at least a couple of months of further negotiations until a final vote.
In the meantime, the Brazilian real and other Latin American currencies could get an extra boost from the unusually benign global outlook for emerging-market currencies.
Commodities prices have risen as the global economy picks up steam, and interest rates in the United States are still set to rise only slowly from their historically low levels.
""The Brazilian economy is well-positioned considering the solid fundamentals of our external accounts,"" wrote Carlos Pedroso and Mauricio Nakahodo, economists with Banco de Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Brasil, in a note.
Brazil's trade surplus rose in April as commodities prices rose, the trade ministry said on Tuesday, forecasting a record surplus of over $55 billion for 2017. [nL1N1I41BT]

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan and Indian rupee are expected to weaken against the dollar over the coming year, a Reuters poll found, with the greenback supported by U.S. interest rate hikes, though analysts have trimmed their bearish bets on Asian currencies from the previous poll.
While markets do not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its policy meeting later on Wednesday, the central bank is tipped to lift rates twice more this year, with one likely as early as next month, which would be supportive of the dollar. [ECILT/US]
China's yuan  is up just around 0.7 percent so far this year, having lost nearly 7 percent in 2016. In November, the yuan hit an eight-year low following Donald Trump's shock election as U.S. President.
In the latest poll of 60 foreign exchange strategists, taken over the past week, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, is forecast to weaken to 7.07 against the dollar in a year from around 6.89, where it was trading on Wednesday.
""There will be moderate strengthening in the U.S. dollar, contributing to stability in the yuan and, by extension, other emerging market currencies,"" wrote Dirk Willer, EM strategist at Citi, in a note. 
""This is assumed to take place against the backdrop of moderately higher U.S. rates, consistent with our call for two more rate hikes from the Fed this year.""
A separate Reuters poll showed investors reduced bullish bets on most Asian currencies. They fell to the lowest in a month for the Chinese yuan. [ASIA/FXP]
Still, the latest predictions show less conviction in the dollar strength story than was the case last month, with the latest poll medians for the yuan slightly higher than April's poll.
While concerns remain over President Trump's policies, especially on Beijing's large trade surplus with the U.S., the new administration has refrained from declaring China a currency manipulator despite campaign promises to do so.
Separately, the Indian rupee  is forecast to weaken to 66.23 per dollar in the year, a more than 3 percent fall from where it was trading recently at 64.22.
The rupee has gained more than 5 percent against the dollar so far this year, reaching a 20-month high of 63.92 per dollar late last month.
The expected losses come despite the Reserve Bank of India having moved to a neutral stance earlier this year from an easing bias, although economists in a separate Reuters poll suggested the central bank's next move will likely be a cut towards the end of the year.

778,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2017 12:21PM ET</span>","Bitcoin soars above $1,400 to all-time high","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin surged to an all-time high above $1,400 on Tuesday, after more than tripling in value over the past year, with its most recent rise attributed to strong demand in Japan, where the digital currency has been deemed a legal means of payment.
Cryptocompare, a data website that analyses bitcoin trading across dozens of exchanges globally, said around 50 percent of trading volume over the past 24 hours had been on the bitcoin/Japanese yen exchange rate.
""The Japanese have recently warmed their approach towards bitcoin by treating it legally as a form of payment - a ratification and bringing into the regulatory fold,"" said Charles Hayter, the website's founder. 
""China's clampdown on exchanges can also be seen as a positive move for the industry too,"" he added. 
Chinese authorities have increased scrutiny of exchanges this year and have forced them to start charging trading fees, after becoming concerned about bitcoin speculation and its potential use in money laundering.
Bitcoin surged as much as 3 percent on Tuesday on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, where trading is dollar-denominated, to hit $1,437 , its highest since its 2008 launch. That marked a more than 200 percent increase from its price in early May last year. 
Its current levels put the total value of all bitcoins in circulation - the so-called ""market cap"" - close to $25 billion, putting its worth on a par with a large-cap company.

Bitcoin analysts said the price had also been boosted by a request by the BATS exchange that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission review its March decision not to approve a bitcoin-tracking ETF set up by the Winklevoss brothers.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.16% to 99.06.
The dollar was boosted after U.S. Congressional leaders reached a deal late Sunday to fund the government, averting a government shutdown later this week.
The deal, which includes a $12.5 billion increase for defense and $1.5 billion for border security, must now be passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate by Friday, in order to avoid the first government shutdown since 2013.
The dollar pushed higher against the yen, with USD/JPY rising 0.32% to 111.89.
The U.S. Department of Labor said Friday that the employment cost index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.8% in the first quarter, the largest increase since the fourth quarter of 2007.
The data offset another report showing that the U.S. economy posted its slowest growth in three years in the three months to March, with gross domestic product growing at a 0.7% annual rate.
The slowdown was due in large part to a near-stagnation in consumer spending, which grew by just 0.3%.
The yen’s losses were held in check as investors continued to monitor geopolitical developments around North Korea, following another North Korean missile test-launch on Saturday which Washington and Seoul said was unsuccessful.
The euro was a touch lower, with EUR/USD dipping 0.09% to 1.0886, but demand for the single currency continued to be underpinned by Friday’s stronger-than-forecast euro zone inflation data.
The annual rate of inflation in the euro area rose by 1.9% in April, Eurostat said, the highest level in over three years.
The data fueled expectations that the European Central Bank could adopt a more hawkish stance at its next policy meeting in June.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.1 percent to 99.205, but down 0.8 percent for the week and 1.1 percent for April.
The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.0863, but up 1.3 percent for the week and 2 percent for the month.
ECB chief Mario Draghi said on Thursday after the central bank's policy meeting that removal of the bank's easing bias was not discussed, stressing the barriers the ECB still faces before beginning to tighten its ultra-loose financing conditions.
However, he also said that euro zone's recovery was increasingly solid and downside risks had diminished.
""My feeling is that Draghi's statement will be an important factor to set the tone for the euro's movement next month,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. ""He said the ECB is unlikely to start its exit strategy this year."" 
Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar inched 0.1 percent lower on the day to 111.30 yen, up 1.9 percent for the week but still down 0.2 percent for the month.

Tokyo markets will be closed for three days from May 3 for a string of holidays known as the Golden Week, and some market participants take additional time off.
""Because of the holidays, we're not seeing the usual Japanese profit-taking or exporter selling on the dollar's rise, though some investors are still hoping for a chance to buy the dollar on dips,"" Ogino said.
Liquidity is likely to be thin next week, which market participants say could exacerbate any sudden moves. 
Traders continue to monitor tensions on the Korean peninsula, any escalations of which could give the perceived safe-haven yen a lift. 
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview on Thursday that a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic outcome to the dispute.
On Thursday, the BOJ kept monetary policy unchanged as expected, but offered its most optimistic assessment of the economy in nine years, signaling its confidence that a pick-up in overseas demand will help sustain an export-driven recovery.
Japanese economic data released early in the session showed Japan's core consumer prices rose at a slower than expected pace in March from a year earlier, but they posted their third straight month of increase, driven by rising energy costs.
Later in the global session, investors will get a first look at the preliminary estimate for U.S. gross domestic product in the first quarter. Economists polled by Reuters expected an increase of 1.2 percent, and any downside surprise would likely pressure U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 2.292 percent in Asian trading, not far from its U.S. close of 2.296 percent on Thursday. 

The dollar was steady against the Swedish crown at 8.8374 crowns per dollar, after it jumped on Thursday in the wake of a decision by Sweden's Riksbank extended its bond-buying. The central bank also predicted its first interest rate hike in mid-2018, later than previously projected.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Euro dips against U.S. dollar on dovish ECB tone,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the U.S. dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said policymakers did not discuss removing the bank's easing bias on monetary policy, while the dollar jumped against the Swedish crown after the Riksbank extended its bond-buying. 
The euro initially rose to a session high of $1.0932  on language in the ECB's statement, read by Draghi, which said the euro zone's recovery was increasingly solid and downside risks had diminished. 
But other parts of the statement and Draghi's replies to questions stressed the barriers the ECB still faces before beginning to tighten the ultra-loose financing conditions it has maintained for nine years.
""Draghi wasn’t as hawkish as people had hoped,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. 
""Upside event risk for the euro is gone,"" he added, noting that there was a tendency to bet against the euro in part given the likelihood of centrist Emmanuel Macron defeating anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen in the final round of France's presidential election. 
The euro was last down 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.0875, near a session low of $1.0852.
Sweden's Riksbank extended its bond-buying and predicted its first interest rate hike in mid-2018, later than previously projected. That sent the dollar as much as 1.3 percent higher against the Swedish crown to a session peak of 8.8730 crowns per dollar . 
The Bank of Japan also signaled it would maintain its massive stimulus effort, despite offering its most optimistic assessment of the Japanese economy in nine years. 
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda conceded that public perceptions of future price increases remained subdued, which disappointed some traders hoping for a more hawkish inflation outlook and pushed the dollar higher against the yen. 
""That lower inflation forecast would suggest continued accommodative monetary policy,"" said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
The dollar was last 0.2 percent higher against the yen at 111.22 yen after rising as much as 0.5 percent to a session high of 111.59. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.1 percent at 99.104. 

The dollar was down 0.8 percent against the Mexican peso at 19.0300 pesos <MXN=> after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the euro on Thursday after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, while Sweden's crown fell sharply after its central bank fed yet more money into its economy.
The ECB left its interest rates and policy stance unchanged as expected, keeping its unprecedented stimulus in place as inflation remains below target, even if growth is finally accelerating.
The dollar, earlier exhibiting weakness after disappointment over U.S. President Donald Trump's tax plan, edged higher versus the euro as the single currency dipped following the ECB's decision.
The greenback hit a day's high of $1.0921 against the euro, up 0.2 percent on the day after the Bank's decision, with investors awaiting a press conference from 1230 GMT for any signs of a drift at the bank towards reining in its stimulus program later this year.
The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of peers was up 0.1 percent at 99.097. (DXY)
""The focus (for the dollar) should be increasingly back to the Federal Reserve (policy), but at the same time when it comes to Trump and his announcements we believe that expectations have been falling to some extent when it comes to his potential to surprise,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist with  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
""From that point of view, we don't expect any dollar downside risks on the back of any disappointments with respect to Trump.""
Trump's plan would cut the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15 percent from 35 percent and reduce the top tax rate assessed on pass-through businesses, including small partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent.
The Swedish crown lost ground to the dollar and the euro following the Riksbank decision to keep interest rates on hold and extend its bond-buying program by 15 billion crowns. It was 1 percent lower to both, at 9.6530 crowns per euro and 8.8526 per dollar. (EURSEK=) <SEK=>
""Today's (Riksbank) announcement...should only soften the pace of crown appreciation against euro, but it will not prevent it,"" ING currency strategist Petr Krpata wrote in a research note.
""We still look for lower EUR/SEK over coming months/quarters and expect the cross to be gradually converging towards the 9.00 crowns per euro.""
The Canadian dollar and Mexico's peso bounced after Trump said he would not scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), easing concerns towards U.S. trade protectionism for now. The loonie was up 0.3 percent to C$1.3542 <CAD=D4> per dollar, while the peso <MXN=D2> strengthened 1.2 percent to 18.95 pesos per dollar.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar shed gains against major rivals on Wednesday after a White House tax reform announcement was viewed as lacking in new details, while the peso and Canadian dollar sank on reports that the U.S. is considering withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's plan would cut the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15 percent from 35 percent and reduce the top tax rate assessed on pass-through businesses, including small partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent.
The dollar hit its highest level of the month against the yen of 111.77 yen  just before the plan's unveiling, but pared gains after the announcement and last stood little changed against the Japanese currency at 111.15. 
Analysts said traders were disappointed by the lack of new details about the tax reform plan and on skepticism that any comprehensive tax changes will be approved by the House and Senate. 
""There was a bit of 'buy the rumor sell the fact,'"" said Vassili Serebriakov, foreign exchange strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York, in reference to the dollar's rise ahead of the statement and later moderation. ""It’s a long path toward this becoming a policy change, and markets recognize that,"" he added. 
The euro also trimmed losses against the dollar and was last down just 0.2 percent at $1.0900 after having fallen as much as 0.6 percent against the greenback to a session low of $1.0857 earlier in the day. 
The euro had touched $1.0950 in early trading to match Tuesday's 5-1/2-month high before facing selling pressure on hopes that the tax announcement would boost the dollar. 
The dollar surged about 2.4 percent against the Mexican peso to a more than one-month high of 19.2922 pesos <MXN=> and rose as much as 0.4 percent against the Canadian dollar to C$1.3623 <CAD=D4> after reports that the United States was readying an executive order to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a U.S., Mexico and Canada trade pact. 
A senior Trump administration official confirmed the possibility of the order, which was first reported by Politico,
""It just underscores how important the American economy is to both Mexico and Canada,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst with Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.2 percent at 99.018 (DXY).

842,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2017 04:28AM ET</span>",Euro hovers below five-month high; loonie lumbered with softwood tariff,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro edged back towards the previous day's five-month high on Tuesday after posting its biggest one-day rise since June, on growing confidence that the market-friendly Emmanuel Macron would beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen to become the next French president. 
The Canadian dollar -- or ""loonie"", in the trader jargon -- skidded to four-month lows after the United States slapped duties on Canadian softwood lumber . 
The centrist Macron won Sunday's French election first round, sending the euro surging above $1.09  as investors took heart from opinion polls showing Macron would soundly beat Le Pen - who has threatened to pull France out of the euro zone - in the run-off on May 7.
The euro was up 0.2 percent by 0820 GMT (4:20 a.m. ET) at $1.0891, less than half a cent from a high of $1.0940 hit after Sunday's election results, and after climbing 1.4 percent on Monday.
The first round outcome spared investors their worst-case scenario of Le Pen facing off against far-left euroskeptic Jean-Luc Melenchon, who had surged in the polls in recent weeks, though he never broke into the top two.
That the pollsters - who had been criticized for failing to predict last year's votes for Brexit and Donald Trump - had accurately predicted Sunday's result bolstered confidence in their projection that Macron would win the second round, by a margin of 20 percentage points or more.
This increased confidence meant that political risk was being priced out of the euro ahead of the second round, with implied volatility - an option used to hedge against big future price swings - having fallen sharply.  
""This (second round) is going to be a non-event for the market,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen.
""Markets have pretty much priced out the risk of a Le Pen victory, and rightly so, because the first round of the elections has shown that the polls in France were correct...and this increases the confidence in the polls for the second round...It's highly likely that (Macron) is going to win."" 
Nguyen added that focus around the euro would now increasingly turn to monetary policy. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, though it is not expected to announce that it is winding down -- or ""tapering"" -- its asset purchase program until later in the year, which should lift the euro. 
The Canadian dollar fell half a percent to C$1.3570, its lowest since December, against its U.S. counterpart, after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his agency will impose new anti-subsidy duties averaging 20 percent on Canadian softwood lumber imports.
Despite gains against most major currencies, the U.S. dollar index -- which is heavily exposed to the euro -- slipped 0.1 percent to 98.983 (DXY). 
Against the yen, it climbed nearly 0.6 percent to 110.40 <=JPY>, as the safe-haven Japanese currency edged broadly lower. 
""For the dollar to make a try for 112 yen, you'd like to see some type of positive news out of the United States and an easing in North Korea-related tensions,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2017 11:12AM ET</span>","Euro surges, yen dives as French election fears abate","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro surged against the U.S. dollar and the yen sank on Monday on relief over Emmanuel Macron's victory against anti-euro nationalist Marine Le Pen in the first round of France's presidential elections.
The euro was last 1.2 percent higher against the dollar at $1.0855, not far from the 5-1/2-month high of $1.0935 it reached after the initial indications from the Sunday vote gave victory to Macron, as predicted by weeks of polling. 
The same polls showed Macron defeating Le Pen by as much as 30 percentage points in two weeks' time, suggesting players can buy back into the currency. The euro's session high briefly put the currency up about 2 percent against the greenback.
Sunday's outcome reduced the prospect of an anti-establishment shock on the scale of Britain's vote last June to quit the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.
The euro's dip from its session high likely indicated profit-taking rather than doubts about a Macron victory over Le Pen in the second round, said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York.
""The news of Macron winning is now priced in,"" he said. ""The risks of a disintegration of the euro have been removed.""
Strategists at French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said their positioning measures showed the euro had been bought for most of the last week, suggesting that many players had already closed previous short bets against the currency. 
As markets globally were comforted by the results of the French vote, investors abandoned the perceived security of the yen. The euro was last up 2.1 percent against the Japanese currency at 110.41 yen (EURJPY=) and the dollar was up 0.8 percent against the yen at 109.92 yen  after touching a nearly two-week high of 110.62. 
The results of the vote were soothing in part because fears of a potential Le Pen runoff with far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, both of whom distrust the European Union, did not play out.
""That 'nightmare' scenario of Le Pen versus Melenchon is off the table,"" said Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio management at RiverFront Investment Group in Richmond, Virginia. 

The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last down 0.9 percent at 99.115 after touching a roughly 5-1/2-month low of 98.908.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell back on Friday, trading almost a cent off this week's highs as investors prepared for the first round on Sunday of a tight French presidential election race. 
Traders said an upbeat flash Purchasing Managers' Index survey from France and polls showing centrist Emmanuel Macron still in pole position ahead of the vote had helped settle nerves after a dip late on Thursday.
There was no obvious reaction to the shooting of a French policeman in central Paris overnight, an attack claimed by Islamic State.
But with options markets  suggesting investors are extremely concerned about the chances of strong results for far-right and far-left candidates Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Melenchon, the euro fell 0.2 percent against the dollar in morning trade in Europe.
""I think everybody is locked down,"" said Simon Derrick, head of the global markets research team at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. 
""It is kind of reminiscent of the big events last year where people know that it is a binary outcome so the best approach is to remain as cautious as possible.""

Other major currency pairs were stuck in tight ranges, with Britain's weakest quarterly retail sales number in five years doing minimal damage to sterling after a 4-cent surge earlier this week. 
The numbers provided further evidence of a weakening of the consumer demand that has propped up economic growth since the Brexit vote last June. But they come at a time when investors seem optimistic about Prime Minister Theresa May's shock decision to call an early general election for June 8. 
""We used to think that when the going got tough, the Brits went shopping, but this retail environment is too much for the hardy British consumer,"" said Jeremy Cook, an analyst with corporate and retail currencies provider World First. 
""If these poor numbers are a shock then you haven’t been paying attention.""
The big risk for currency markets is Le Pen's opposition to the euro and France's European Union membership but even if she makes it into the run-off as expected, the odds of her beating Macron or conservative Francois Fillon are rated as low. 
Mapping what it says have been tightly-correlated moves in the euro against the odds of a Le Pen presidency this year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts estimated the euro could appreciate to $1.13 if she is knocked out of the race in Sunday's vote. 
Conversely, an improvement in her odds of winning and a resulting sharp rise in the chances of France leaving the euro, could weaken the euro by around 5 percent, bringing it close to parity with the dollar, they said. 
Others, however, stress that should Le Pen perform broadly in line with polling to date, confidence she cannot win in the second round should see the euro appreciate. 
""Absent a shock result in the French election, the euro should rally,"" analysts from  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said in a weekly note.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2017 06:26AM ET</span>","What election? French yields fall, euro steadies as vote looms","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets appeared largely calm on Friday, the last day of trading before the first round of France's closely fought presidential election, with French bond yields hitting a three-month low and the euro treading water.
A fatal attack on police officers in Paris overnight caused investors some immediate jitters, with the gap between French and German 10-year borrowing costs -- a key indicator of election nerves in recent months -- rising sharply in the first few minutes of trading.
Traders said this was on concern the attack could sway the vote in favor of far-right anti-immigrant candidate Marine Le Pen, whose anti-European Union stance is of concern o many in the markets.
But that move reversed as the session wore on, with the yield on 10-year French government debt hitting its weakest since mid-January and the gap between it and its German equivalent falling to its tightest in three weeks.  [GVD/EUR]
Although falling yields usually indicate investors seeking safety, in the case of the election uncertainty lower French yields imply a more steady-as-she-goes approach to the future.
Investors seem relatively confident that while Le Pen might well win enough votes on Sunday to make the second round on May 7, she will then be comfortably beaten, probably by the market-friendly, centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron.
Having hit a three-week high close just below $1.08 earlier in the week, the euro was flat at $1.0717 . 
European stocks edged down a touch, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index down 0.1 percent by 0910 GMT. 
""So far markets have been pretty sanguine in the face of the (French) presidential election, which was flagged as one of the potential banana skins for markets in this year and I think that may be partly a result of political fatigue,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Laith Khalaf, in London.
But options markets  suggested investors remain worried about strong results for Le Pen and/or hard-left challenger anti-EU Jean-Luc Melenchon that would point to the risk of another major political shock for Europe in two weeks time.

Shares on Wall Street looked set to open marginally higher (ESc1) , with the main indexes having closed between 0.75 percent and 0.9 percent higher on rising expectations for first-quarter corporate profits. 
Asian stocks ended the week on a positive note, unscathed by a U.S. trade probe on Chinese steel exports. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) added 0.5 percent, but was down 0.4 percent on the week. 
Asian steelmakers were mostly steady or higher, as investors dismissed for now any negative impact from the launch of a U.S. trade probe against Chinese steel exporters, although Chinese companies shed some of their earlier gains. The move sent their U.S. counterparts surging over 8 percent overnight.
""The U.S. accounts for a small proportion of China's steel exports,"" said Yang Kunhe, steel analyst at Northeast Securities in Beijing, adding Northeast Asia and Africa have been growing markets for Chinese steel over the past few years.  
""But if Trump’s probe translates into actions, it would increase the chance of trade friction, and hurt market sentiment.""
Markets also mostly shrugged off White House comments that the U.S. may consider tit-for-tat tariffs on imports, and concerns raised by the International Monetary Fund that U.S. tax cuts could fuel financial risk-taking and increase public debt. 
Japan's Nikkei (N225) advanced 1 percent, posting a weekly gain of 1.6 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro held near a three-week high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as some traders shut down broad bets against the common currency ahead of the first round of the French presidential elections on Sunday.
The dollar shook off early weakness to trade little changed against a basket of major currencies as the latest data on domestic jobless claims and business activity in the mid-Atlantic region did not change traders' views of modest U.S. economic growth and low inflation.
Traders were taking their cues from polls showing French centrist Emmanuel Macron easily beating far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the second round two weeks later, analysts said.
""Markets are banking on (Macron's) ability to drive the country out of its misery,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst for Think Markets in London.
Pollsters forecast the most likely outcome of the first round is that Macron will go head-to-head against Le Pen in the May 7 second round.
""Euro bulls will definitely respond to positive news around Macron, but that dissipates as the reality of low turnouts sets in,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto.
""Everybody remembers the Brexit polls and even the U.S. election polls. After those misses it is going to take a lot to make the markets trust them again.""
The euro was up 0.09 percent against the dollar at $1.0719 after hitting a three-week high of $1.0777 earlier in the session.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, has fallen in recent weeks on weaker-than-expected economic data and worries about the Trump administration's ability to get tax and fiscal legislation passed. 
The dollar index (DXY), was up 0.06 percent at 99.796, after hitting a more than three-week low of 99.374 earlier in the session.
The greenback was pressured this week by a resurgent sterling after British Prime Minister Theresa May called an early general election ahead of Brexit negotiations. Sterling was up 0.29 percent at $1.2814.
Meanwhile, commodity currencies, including the Aussie  and the New Zealand  dollars recovered ground against the greenback. Canada's dollar  steadied after falling on Wednesday amid weakness in commodity markets.

Oil prices ended mixed after steep losses the previous session, as investors weighed rising U.S. production against geopolitical uncertainties and comments from leading Gulf oil producers that an extension to OPEC-led supply cuts was likely.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>",Mexico's peso could strengthen further: finance minister,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico's peso  is ""quite competitive"" and could strengthen further despite likely bouts of volatility, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said late on Wednesday.
The peso hit record lows following Donald Trump's victory in the November U.S. presidential election but has recovered in recent weeks to about 18.8 per dollar as recent comments from U.S. officials suggested a softer approach to Mexico. 
""At this rate, Mexico is quite competitive,"" Meade told Reuters on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank spring meetings in Washington. ""Conceptually, there is probably still room for some appreciation."" 
The current exchange rate is better aligned with the country's economic fundamentals, he added.
The peso slid to a record low in early January, days before Trump took office threatening to slap a tax on Mexican-made goods and to scrap a free trade deal with Mexico if he cannot rework it to benefit U.S. interests.
""What we saw at the beginning of the year was an exchange rate that was not linked to fundamentals,"" Meade said. ""That is what I think has driven most of the correction.
""But going forward, it is likely that we will continue to have and to see some volatility around the exchange rate.""
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and Trump's threats to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement that underpins commerce in the region sparked fears of a sharp downturn in the economy.
Lately those concerns have eased somewhat. [nL2N1H20IP]
In March, the peso surged to a nearly four-month high after new U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross suggested a new mechanism should be created to stabilize the currency's exchange rate.
Meade said a stable peso was important from a North American perspective, but ""at this stage there is nothing specifically we have in mind"" about such a mechanism.
Mexico's multibillion-dollar program to hedge state oil company Pemex's  crude sales against price fluctuations for 2018 has not started, Meade said.
He said he expected Mexico to achieve a primary budget surplus, which excludes interest payments, this year. 
""We are pretty confident that will meet our fiscal consolidation targets,"" he said. ""We will have a primary surplus for the first time since 2008, and we would likely exceed the target that we had committed to.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against the yen on Tuesday, with worries that U.S. currency manipulation complaints could touch Japan offset by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's favoring of a strong dollar in the long term. 
Mnuchin told the Financial Times that he agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump's view that the dollar's strength in the short term was hurting exports, but that he saw the currency's strength over the long term as a positive.
But upbeat words from the two sides after the first round of talks in Tokyo failed fully to quell worries among investors that Japan's long-running efforts to weaken the yen will affect the dialogue.
Concerns about North Korea and French presidential elections also kept a lid on the dollar against the yen, traditionally a haven for capital in the face of political and economic stress.
""There was quite strong thinking in the market that the U.S. would maybe put pressure on Japan in terms of currency manipulation ... on that front,"" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund FX sales at Mizuho in London.
The dollar was last flat at 108.870 yen after rising in Asian trade to 109.225. It had sunk into a five-month trough of 108.130 earlier on Monday amid rising tensions in the Korean Peninsula, which some analysts warned also brought a new dimension to the Japanese relationship. 
""Trump appears to have made a concession regarding China, a key player in the North Korean situation,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, referring to last week's U.S. Treasury's semi-annual currency report in which the Trump administration backed away from a key campaign promise and did not label China a currency manipulator.
""But at the same time, for the sake of his supporters, Trump has to stick with his pledge to tackle trade imbalances, and this raises the risk of his administration getting tough with Japan,"" Noji said.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2017 10:34PM ET</span>",Dollar hits five-month low vs. yen as North Korea tensions mount,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar dipped to a five-month low against the yen on Monday as rising tensions over North Korea kept the safe-haven Japanese currency in demand.
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was down 0.2 percent at 100.390 (DXY), weighed down following the release of Friday's weak U.S. retail sales and consumer prices data and as flight-to-safety drove U.S. Treasury yields to five-month lows.
The U.S. currency extended losses from the previous day and retreated to 108.135 yen , its lowest since mid-November.
The yen remained broadly bid against other currencies as well. The euro and the pound slid to five-month troughs of 114.955 yen (EURJPY=) and 136.05 yen (GBPJPY=), respectively.
Increasing geopolitical risks another notch, North Korea on Sunday made what was believed to be a failed missile test launch. Regional tensions have risen over the past weeks as U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a tough rhetorical line with Pyongyang.
""It is unclear whether the situation over North Korea will escalate into military action, but uncertainty is increasing and the dollar continues to edge lower. The dollar also looks shaky technically, after slipping below the 200-day moving average of 108.80 yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
Japan's proximity to the Korean Peninsula, however, means that the yen's safe-haven status could be eroded if tensions between Washington and Pyongyang escalated into open conflict.
""Right now the markets are still functioning, with the reaction to the situation being weaker equities, lower Treasury yields and the yen firming against the dollar,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""But it could be an entirely different matter should an international emergency actually take place,"" he added, reckoning that the dollar could benefit due to its position as the world's principal reserve currency.
With the bulk of the market's focus on how the standoff between the United States and North Korea will play out, the semi-annual U.S. Treasury currency report released late on Friday did not receive as much attention as some had initially expected.
The Trump administration declined to name any major trading partner as a currency manipulator in the highly-anticipated report on Friday, backing away from a key Trump campaign promise to slap such a label on China.
The U.S. Treasury, however, ensured that currency policies would remain a sticking point going forward by keeping China, Germany and Japan on a ""monitoring list.""
""Market reaction, if there was one, to the currency report has already faded. The U.S. Treasury does not look like it will take a strong stance on currencies. But in the case of the Trump administration the market will need to watch out for what his trade advisors may have to say on this issue,"" said Yamamoto at Mizuho Securities.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.0622 , having spent the previous session in a very tight range.
Wariness over the first round of the French presidential elections on April 23, another potential source of geopolitical risk keeping global markets nervous, was expected to cap the common currency this week.
The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to $0.7588  while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.4 percent to $0.7030 .
The risk-sensitive Aussie and kiwi fell to three- and one-month lows, respectively, in the middle of last week. But they have pulled back on upbeat local economic indicators and as the greenback fell broadly on Trump's comments that the dollar was getting too strong.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>","Asian economies escape 'manipulator' tag, but expect more pressure on trade","BEIJING (Reuters) - Asian countries escaped the currency manipulator label in the latest U.S. Treasury report, but remain wary of possible trade friction as President Donald Trump maintains his administration will seek to address trade imbalances. 
Trump has said some U.S. trading partners, particularly China, manipulated their currency, but has since backed off that claim and acknowledged that China had not weakened the yuan to make its exports cheaper. 
China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan remained on a list for special monitoring of currency practices, China by virtue of a massive trade surplus with the United States.
""Fixing trade imbalances will be an issue for the U.S. in its dialogues with China and Japan, while the manipulator threat has been put on the backburner,"" a Japanese government official told Reuters.
The semi-annual U.S. Treasury currency report released on Friday did not name any major trading partner as a currency manipulator, although it seemed to leave open the option for action in the future.
Trump has softened his rhetoric against China's trade practices as Beijing has intervened in foreign exchange markets to prop up the value of its yuan, and as he looks to China for help dealing with rising tension on the Korean peninsula.
""I think the United States decided to forego (labeling China a currency manipulator) this time because it wants China's cooperation on North Korea,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo. 
""Depending on how the North Korean situation develops, we don't know what will happen in half a year (when the next currency report is due to be published)."" 
NEW LANGUAGE
New language in the Treasury report citing a history of currency intervention in China, South Korea and Taiwan is in line with what experts say could be eventual changes to the criteria aimed at deterring future manipulation. 
With Washington pushing a trade agenda aimed at reducing deficits, experts say the most logical option is to lengthen the time period for reviewing currency market interventions from 12 months to several years.
""One thing we noticed was the report touched on the previous history of (currency manipulation). They're telling us not to do so in the future and we have no intention of doing so,"" a senior South Korean finance official said. 
""SCRUTINIZING"" CHINA
The report showed the high priority the administration puts on addressing trade imbalances and said it would be ""scrutinizing China's trade and currency practices very closely"".
The report came after China data showed its surplus with the United States was nearly unchanged in the first quarter compared to a year earlier at $49.6 billion, and cited China's market protection as an impediment to a balanced trade relationship. 
While Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week agreed to 100-day trade talks, U.S. business leaders in China have expressed concern about a lack of progress in gaining further access to the Chinese market despite years of negotiations.
JAPAN 
The Treasury report's language on Japan was similar to past reports, and focused on the need for structural reforms to improve domestic demand, analysts said. 
""The basic message is that Japan needs to expand its domestic demand and one can read this as them telling Japan to import more American goods,"" said Minami of the Norinchukin Research Institute.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit Japan next week for a bilateral economic dialogue, with U.S. officials signaling they would press Japan to remove non-tarrif trade barriers and buy more U.S. products. 
""The report won't have an impact on the upcoming Japan-U.S. economic dialogue next week. But the U.S. administration’s focus on the trade deficit is something to keep an eye on,"" said Nobuyasu Atago, chief economist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2017 03:06AM ET</span>",Dollar set for weekly losses as tensions with Pyongyang rise,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Friday, on track for a losing week as continuing tensions in North Korea underpinned the perceived safe-haven Japanese currency.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six rival currencies, steadied at 100.590 (DXY), slightly higher on the day but down 0.6 percent for the week.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that North Korea is a problem that ""will be taken care of,"" as China urged caution and speculation rose that Pyongyang might be on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. The Pentagon declined to comment on an NBC report about possible pre-emptive action against the rogue state.
The dollar rose 0.8 percent against the South Korean won , which last stood at 1,138.5.
In another part of the world, the U.S. military said on Thursday that it dropped ""the mother of all bombs,"" the largest non-nuclear device it has ever unleashed in combat, on a network of caves and tunnels used by Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan.
""The 'mother of all bombs' was intended to show the power of U.S. forces to North Korea,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.
""But maybe we won't see big market moves today, because the short-term players already have put on short-dollar positions, and now everyone is just waiting for the next trigger,"" he said. 
The dollar edged up 0.1 percent on the day to 109.15 yen , but was down 1.7 percent for the week.
Market liquidity was thinner than usual because of this week's Passover and Good Friday holiday observances around the world. The market for U.S. Treasuries finished trading early on Thursday, and will be closed Friday.
The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield skidded to its lowest levels since November on Thursday, after Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview published late Wednesday that he favoured low interest rates. He also said the dollar was ""getting too strong"" and would eventually hurt the U.S. economy. [US/]
""Yields declined, and we're seeing a softening of the dollar,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana.
""It's unique to see that level of focus coming from the White House on economic topics that haven't usually been the purview of the administration,"" he said, explaining why markets continued to focus on Trump's remarks. 
Trump also said his administration will not label China a currency manipulator in the Treasury Department's semi-annual report on currency practices of major trading partners which is due out on Friday, backing away from a campaign promise.
The move was seen as a possible quid pro quo, suggesting it might make Beijing more inclined to help resolve the escalating row with North Korea. 
""We have some U.S. economic data later in the day, which ordinarily would likely have some affect on U.S. yields and the dollar, but with U.S. bond markets closed, it might not have much impact,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust.
U.S. retail sales for March are expected to come in at a seven-month low of zero after edging up just 0.1 percent in February. [ECONOMUS]
The euro was steady on the day at $1.0611 . It was up 0.2 percent for the week, though concerns about the outcome of the April 23 first round of France's presidential election continued to limit its upside.

Against the yen, the euro slumped as low as 115.72 (EURJPY=) on Thursday, its lowest level since November, and was poised to drop 1.5 percent for the week. It last stood at 115.85 yen, up 0.1 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slumped broadly on Thursday, falling to a five-month low against the yen, after U.S. President Donald Trump helped accelerate its recent decline by saying the currency was too strong.
The greenback took a heavy hit after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the dollar ""is getting too strong"" and that he would prefer the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.
The comments were a fresh reminder of the president's protectionist trade rhetoric, which has been a source of concern for dollar bulls. 
""Trump's comments came at a time when some had begun to think that perhaps the president was not as supportive of a weak dollar as initially perceived,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""But he reiterated his view that a strong currency hurts U.S. competitiveness, adding fresh downward pressure on the dollar.""
The U.S. currency was 0.3 percent lower at 108.805 yen  after stooping to a five-month low of 108.730. In a bearish technical signal, the pair broke below its 200-day moving average of 108.75.
The dollar has shed 2 percent against the yen so far this week, with the safe-haven Japanese currency already on a bullish footing because of a rise in geopolitical tensions.
There are fresh concerns about the French presidential election and possible U.S. military action against Syria and North Korea. With investors viewing South Korea's sovereign notes as a riskier bet on the rising tensions, the premium for the country's credit default swap debt insurance has risen to a nine-month high.
That Trump seemed unmoved by the significant weakening of the dollar against the yen already in place increased nervousness toward the U.S. Treasury's semi-annual currency report due Friday, and next week's U.S.-Japan bilateral dialogue.
""It appears that the Trump administration is trying to make up for its internal policy shortcomings with a show of force in external policy, leading to a confrontational stance with trade partners,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Bank.
""Currencies rates and trade balance inevitably become themes to confront others countries with. So if you are in the forex market it requires a lot of courage to buy the dollar right now."" 
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.0669 , not far from a six-day high of $1.0675 reached overnight.
The dollar lost significant ground against the pound and Swiss franc as well, and as a result the dollar index versus a basket of major currencies lost about 0.7 percent to a two-week low of 100.040 (DXY).
The Australian dollar was given some breathing room as the greenback slumped. Stronger-than-expected domestic employment data also lifted the currency.
It was up 0.5 percent at $0.7567 , pulling away from a three-month low of $0.7473 plumbed the previous day when wide-spread risk aversion amid simmering geopolitical concerns took its toll on the Aussie.
The dollar was on track for its third straight day of losses against China's yuan , after rising to a one-month high at the start of the week.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) was at 2.234 percent after touching 2.221 percent, its lowest in nearly five months.

933,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2017 03:10PM ET</span>",Mexico economy starts year well despite Trump's threats,"By Dave Graham and Michael O'Boyle
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last year raised the specter of economic recession in Mexico, sent the country's peso into a tailspin, and threatened local industry such as car making. 
But four months on, Mexican automobile output is accelerating fast, unemployment is at a nine-year low, and the peso has been one of the world's best-performing currencies in 2017.
Since diplomatic ties reached a nadir in January with the cancellation of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's planned meeting with Trump, business confidence has slowly returned.
Fears that Trump could tear up the NAFTA trade treaty have subsided, and so far the hit to foreign investment has been slight, said Gilberto Fimbres, head of Mexican employers' federation Coparmex in the northern border city of Tijuana.
""The storm of the great talker, the big negotiator, descended on us,"" he said. ""Then it turns out that all these great things, the great threat, weren't so great in the end.""
Instead, Mexican auto production leapt 36 percent in March, capping the strongest start to any year since 2011. The same month, growth in new manufacturing orders was the highest in six months, the Markit Purchasing Managers' Index showed.
As a result, areas most exposed to the threat of a trade war are now looking ahead with cautious optimism.
Baja California, a major draw for manufacturers supplying the U.S. market, expects to book $2.7 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) this year, up from about $2.5 billion in 2016, said Carlo Bonfante, the border state's economy minister.
Companies investing in the state this year include China's Kunshan Eson Precision Engineering, Korea-based electronic components maker INZI DISPLAY, and U.S. drinks company Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) although its plans are facing opposition from local farmers worried about water supply.
In Guanajuato state in central Mexico, a car making hub, the industry is likely to create some 20,000 new jobs this year, an increase of about 10 percent from 2016, said Alfredo Arzola, director of the local automotive cluster.
Arzola declined to give specific examples, saying that ""absolutely all"" the auto sector companies in Guanajuato, which include General Motors (NYSE:GM), Honda and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), were adding jobs.
Broader surveys present a similar picture.
A poll of 868 foreign and domestic executives by consultancy KPMG showed 58 percent planned to expand operations in Mexico in the next three years, up three percentage points from a year earlier. Though published in March, the survey was conducted November-December at the height of uncertainty over Trump.
Maurizio Rosa, chief executive of Codan Rubber Mexico, a maker of hoses for the automotive industry, said his worries about Trump began to fade when U.S. clients persuaded him that Mexico was indispensable to their business.
""If you take away the low-cost parts the U.S. buys from Mexico, it's going to be very difficult for them,"" said Rosa, who expects Codan's sales to rise around 30 percent this year.
Rosa declined to name his clients, but said they included parts suppliers to global automakers including Nissan, Fiat Chrysler and Ford.
Risks to economic growth still loom, including government spending cuts, rising interest rates, low oil production, and lingering fears over Trump's plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, the United States and Canada.
Trump's threats to slap import tariffs on Mexican-made cars in the weeks after his victory pummeled the peso. However, the currency's slump helped spur a revival in exports and tourism.
Concern about NAFTA still clouds investment, and on March 31 the government cut its 2017 growth forecast by 0.7 points to around 1.8 percent.
Still, private sector economists who cut growth forecasts last year on fears Trump could choke the economy are starting to revise up estimates, citing stronger data and a softer tone from U.S. officials over trade in recent weeks.
Much depends on consumer sentiment, which hit a record low when Trump took office in January, the same month the government ushered in an inflation-boosting gasoline price hike.

But the more conciliatory U.S. tone, a drop in unemployment to its lowest rate since December 2007, and the peso's appreciation over the past 2 1/2 months have helped confidence rebound.

The flight to safety trade dominated market moves, as investors fled risk assets and poured into traditional safe-haven assets, which include the yen, on the back of uncertainty over the Trump administration’s policies and rising geopolitical tensions.
President Trump said Wednesday that he intends to repeal Obamacare before moving on to tax reform.
""We're going to have a phenomenal tax reform, but I have to do health care first,"" Trump said in an interview that aired Wednesday on Fox Business.
Trump and GOP house leaders failed to repeal and replace Obamacare last month, after a healthcare reform bill was pulled at the last minute, casting doubt on the president’s ability to deliver on other priorities, which include tax reform and infrastructure spending.
Meanwhile, U.S. – Russia relations remained in the political spotlight, as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was expected in Moscow on Wednesday to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and discuss a number of sensitive topics including the Korean peninsula, Syria and bilateral relations.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen hit five-month highs against the dollar, euro and sterling on Wednesday, as simmering geopolitical tensions checked risk appetite and put the safe-haven Japanese currency in favor.
Investors' flight-to-safety underpinned traditional safe-havens like the yen, U.S. Treasuries and gold, amid fresh worries over France's presidential election, and possible U.S. military action against Syria and North Korea.
""It cannot come as a surprise that the financial markets are fully focused on political developments and investors are increasingly looking for safe havens as a result,"" wrote Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategists in a research note. ""In the FX markets it is mainly the Japanese yen that is benefiting from this development - not exactly a major surprise.""
""What is more surprising is that the dollar, which is usually in demand in uncertain times, has not been able to appreciate. That is probably mainly due to the fact that the United States is at the center of these geopolitical risks.""
The dollar fell on Tuesday and added to those losses on Wednesday, edging down 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies (DXY) to 100.62.

The Japanese currency had gained over 1 percent on Tuesday, with the dollar falling below 110 yen for the first time since mid-November , and it extended those gains on Wednesday, trading as strongly as 109.35 yen to the dollar  in Asian trade. 
In European trade it had come off those highs but was still up 0.1 percent on the day, at 109.625. 
It was a little down against the euro after earlier hitting 115.91 (EURJPY=). 
""There was a lot of bids and option barriers lined up around 110 yen, so a breach of this level shows how widespread the latest dollar selling was,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The yen's gains against the euro also bears watching, with uncertainty toward the French presidential elections clearly the driving factor.""
And in a new twist to the French elections, a far-left veteran who had been written off as a long shot has now surged into the top four, pushing some pollsters to calculate the most extreme runoff scenarios.
The euro edged up against a struggling dollar to $1.0617 .

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators further reduced bullish bets on the U.S. dollar, pushing net longs to their lowest level since late February, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday and calculations by Reuters.
The value of the dollar's net long position totaled $14.67 billion in the week ended April 4, down from $15.27 billion the previous week. Investors have reduced long dollar bets for a second straight week and Friday's net long dollar positioning was a five-week low.
It has been an uncertain few weeks for the U.S. dollar, starting when President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans pulled their bill to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system due to a shortage of votes.
Investors were concerned that after the healthcare turmoil, the Trump administration would not be able pass the tax reforms that analysts believe would have a significant impact on the economy.
""The Trump administration has struggled to recapture the optimism of the post-election victory when the pro-growth policies were announced, and so far has not delivered,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. That has weighed on the dollar.
The healthcare debacle in Washington was followed by the Federal Reserve minutes of last month's monetary policy meeting which showed an internal debate on inflation and growth that has raised doubts about the Fed's pace of monetary tightening.
Investors still see two more interest rate rises this year, a far cry from the four hikes being priced in at the beginning of the year. 
Capping a turbulent week for the dollar were the U.S. air strikes on Syria and a U.S. nonfarm payrolls report that badly missed expectations. [USD/]
""Expect the market to remain very nervous after Trump's missile attack on Syria, with fundamentals taking a back seat while investor anxiety remains high,"" said Esparza
Net shorts on the Japanese yen, meanwhile, fell to 45,800 contracts, the smallest since December.

The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

The dollar initially dipped, after the headline payrolls number was weaker than expected but recovered to trade at the session highs, as investors continued to back a June rate hike amid a drop in the U.S. unemployment rate.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, Nonfarm payrolls grew by just 98,000 in March, well below expectations of 180,000, but the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, added 0.29% to 100.90 by 12:46 EDT.
The weaker than expected headline nonfarm payrolls print, had little impact on traders’ expectations of a June rate, as the majority of traders expected the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in June.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, the probability of traders that expect a June rate hike remained at 58%, unchanged from the previous day.
The dollar remained at highs, as investors poured into safe haven assets, as a slew of geopolitics events came to the fore, after the United States launched cruise missiles at an airbase in Syria while a terrorist attack was confirmed in Sweden, earlier today.
The U.S. military action in Syria came fresh off the heels of President Trump’s comments on Thursday, after Mr Trump blamed the chemical attack, earlier this week, on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
“I think what Assad did is terrible” President Trump said Thursday.
Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on the final day of a two-day summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2017 11:21AM ET</span>",Dollar gains after brief selloff following soft U.S. jobs report,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday as a drop in the U.S. unemployment rate for March despite a much lower-than-expected number of jobs created in the month kept the outlook for interest rates intact this year.
Investors still expect two more rate increases in 2017, analysts said, although the probability of a June hike has declined to 61 percent  from more than 70 percent late on Thursday.
U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, as the retail sector shed employment for a second straight month, the Labor Department said. That was far short of the increase of 180,000 jobs expected by a Reuters poll of economists. 
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, declined to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent in February.
""As long as we see the unemployment rate decline, we will see more rate hikes,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economic adviser at ZipRecuiter in New York. ""Since we just had one (hike), the Fed is just going to keep an eye on things and see what happens over the next few months."" 
The greenback initially sold off on the softer-than-forecast headline number, but since recovered. Traders said the market remained focused on geopolitical events after the United States launched cruise missiles at an airbase in Syria, an ally of Russia. As a result, the dollar has been supported by some safe-haven buying.
The dollar was last up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies (DXY).
The safe-haven yen, which had gained on the back of the strike on Syria, was flat against the dollar, which was last at 110.85 yen .

Estimates from top banks and research firms still suggest the currencies will probably give back part of their recent gains.

The 12-month forecasts strengthened for the Mexican peso to 19.875 per dollar from 20.87 in March and the Brazilian real to 3.295 from 3.35. Also gaining were the Colombian peso to 3020.0 from 3054.17 and the Chilean peso at 669.13 from 670.
Outlooks weakened for the Argentine peso, to 18.0 per dollar from 17.60 in March, and the Peruvian sol, to 3.38 from 3.36.
The Mexican peso has led gains among Latin American currencies this year, rebounding from all-time lows on hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump will not impose heavy tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States as he had threatened.
A series of interest rate increases by the Mexican central bank and its direct intervention in local currency markets with hedging contracts also explain the peso's newfound strength. As long as volatility remains low, higher interest rates should keep supporting the peso.
""Carry attractiveness has increased notably,"" wrote Rabobank senior strategist Christian Lawrence. ""This is particularly true compared to other Latin American currencies,"" including Brazil, Chile and Colombia, which have cut rates over the past year.
Volatility has also declined in Brazil to around record lows, central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn said this week, despite what he called an ""especially uncertain global outlook.""
A source of potential instability is the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has so far raised interest rates at a very gradual pace, with no surprises. An acceleration of rate hikes could drain capital from higher-yielding emerging markets such as Latin America.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 09:50AM ET</span>",Canadian dollar to weaken as policy path diverges with U.S.: Reuters poll,"By Anu Bararia
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar will weaken over the coming months, pressured by an uncertain economic outlook and the prospect of higher interest rates in the United States even as the Bank of Canada stays on the sidelines, a Reuters poll showed. 
While the loonie may gain a little in the short term on expectations of stronger first-quarter economic growth in Canada, the survey of close to 50 foreign exchange strategists showed it will weaken to C$1.35 per U.S. dollar in three months and close the year at the same level.
It is already 3 percent lower than at this time last year.
Even as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates in March - its second hike in three months - and plans to hike twice more this year, the Canadian central bank is not expected to boost rates until 2018. It cut them twice in 2015. [CA/POLL]
""It is essentially a policy differential story,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. 
""Some people have started ... thinking that perhaps with the Federal Reserve now appearing a bit more fully committed to raising interest rates, that may mean something for Canada in the near- to medium-term ... which I think is way too premature.""
Even though respondents expected the loonie to rise marginally in one month to C$1.34 from Wednesday's close of C$1.3434, the forecast range remained wide, running from C$1.28 to C$1.39.
""We are possibly looking at the early stages of a renewed sell-off in the Canadian dollar in the next few weeks,"" Osborne said. ""There is just a lot of uncertainty here at the moment that rather suggests to me, anyway, that some of the strength we have seen in the Canadian data over the past few weeks is probably not sustainable.""
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed that speculators have increased bearish bets on the Canadian dollar to the most since March 2016. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), the top forecaster in Reuters FX polls in 2016, expects the currency to weaken 5 percent over the coming year to C$1.41.
CAUTION AHEAD 
Despite a recent run of strong domestic data, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has maintained a cautious stance on monetary policy, saying a premature rate hike could cause a recession in Canada as the economy has not yet fully recovered from the shock of weak oil prices.
The price of oil, one of Canada's key exports, at around $55 a barrel, is still down over 50 percent from its mid-2014 high. Commodity analysts polled by Reuters are still unsure if output curbs by OPEC members will be enough to offset the increase in U.S. production. [O/POLL]
That does not support Canada's highly indebted households that on an average owed C$1.67 for every dollar of disposable income in the fourth quarter, much of it because of cheap mortgage borrowing to chase ever-rising house prices.
The property market has turned into a key vulnerability for Canada's financial system, posing a challenge to policymakers who can neither lower rates to stoke growth nor raise them to discourage further borrowing.
Another threat is rising anti-trade sentiment in the United States under President Donald Trump that has put the outlook for Canadian exports and the loonie under closer scrutiny.
Exports tumbled by the most in nearly a year in February, sending the loonie to a nearly three-week low of C$1.3455 on Tuesday, suggesting the monetary policy gap between the U.S. and Canada is unlikely to be plugged any time soon.
""The policy divergence story will be in play until the end of this year. We don't expect the Bank of Canada will raise rates until the first half of next year now,"" said Royce Mendes, director and senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.

""We still see that there has been little evidence of a sustainable acceleration in underlying export growth or investment spending, and that's a key component of the recovery we need to see for the Bank of Canada to really be comfortable with tightening policy.""

978,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 09:31AM ET</span>",Sterling's fate hangs on tone of Brexit negotiations: Reuters poll,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - How Britain's divorce negotiations with the European Union progress will decide whether sterling sinks possibly as low as $1.10 or bounces as high as $1.50 in the coming year, a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists found.
The pound  is down well over 10 percent since the surprise referendum vote on June 23 to leave the EU, following a short-term move in the currency that was correctly predicted by Reuters polls. It was trading around $1.248 earlier on Thursday.
If the divorce negotiations turn fractious, sterling will fall to $1.17, according to the median view. Several analysts said it would sink to $1.10 -- a level not seen since 1985, just before the United States devalued the dollar. 
Conversely if talks run smoothly, the median forecast was for it to bounce to $1.30 -- still below where it was trading at ahead of the June 23 referendum -- although one respondent said it would soar to $1.50.
""Sterling is not very closely linked to interest rate expectations at the moment -- it's really whether there is a soft or a hard Brexit driving sterling, and that is going to continue for a year or so,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 last week, starting a two-year countdown to Britain's departure from the EU, which it joined in 1973.
So far there is little clarity on what tone the talks will take, but concern over immigration from other EU member states was a major reason behind the leave vote and May has said she will respect those fears by halting freedom of movement.
Such a move would probably lead to denial of access to Europe's single market, hurting trade. 
May has said ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" and that she is prepared to walk away from the talks. But a parliamentary committee said earlier this week May must prove that by offering an assessment of the economic impact of leaving the EU with no agreement.
RANGE-BOUND FOR NOW
According to the regular poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken in the past week, sterling will trade between $1.22 and $1.24 in the next 12 months. Those medians were little changed from a March poll.
""While we believe headline risk will keep the market's bearish sterling bias intact this year, a stronger structural position supports our view of some sterling recovery in 2018,"" said Vassili Serebriakov at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
Sterling is likely to come under pressure from interest rate hikes in the United States. The Federal Reserve is expected to follow up on a March increase with two more rises later this year while the Bank of England is not expected to move until 2019 at least. [FED/R] [BOE/INT]
Across the channel, the European Central Bank will also be maintaining its ultra-loose monetary policy stance for the foreseeable future and the euro faces its own headwinds in the coming months.
Elections in Germany and possibly Italy could harm the euro project while a win for the far-right National Front candidate Marine Le Pen in the French presidential race could precipitate an eventual end to the common currency altogether. 
With French opinion polls suggesting Le Pen is unlikely to take up residence in the Elysee Palace, the Reuters poll found a shock victory for her would trigger an immediate 5 percent fall in the euro  against the dollar. [EUR/POLL] 

Medians show one euro (EURGBP=) will be worth 86.0 pence in a month and 88.0p in six months and a year, slightly more than predicted in the March poll. Earlier on Thursday a euro was worth 85.5p.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3377, Wednesday’s low and resistance at 1.3487, the high of March 15.
The U.S. Department of Labor said initial jobless claims decreased by 25,000 to 234,000 in the week ending April 1 from the previous week’s revised total of 259,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 8,000 to 250,000 last week.
The greenback had weakened after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting indicated that the central bank would likely begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet of Treasury and mortgage securities later this year.

In Canada, official data showed that building permits declined 2.5% in February after an increase of 5.8% in January, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated 5.4% gain.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 09:10AM ET</span>","Norwegian, Swedish currencies seen rising vs euro, dollar: Reuters poll","By Camilla Knudsen
OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian and Swedish currencies will strengthen against the euro and dollar in the next 12 months after a weak start to 2017, a Reuters poll predicted on Thursday.
A similar survey conducted in January also concluded the two Nordic currencies would rise, but a sluggish outlook for inflation, and still-dovish central banks, have so far held them back.
In oil-producing Norway, where below-forecast inflation was complemented by weaker crude prices in the first quarter, the central bank maintains an easing bias on monetary policy with a 40 percent chance of a cut in interest rates by mid-2017.
""We had two months where inflation was much lower than expected, and then oil prices fell, and all the speculators wanted to get out at the same time,"" DNB Markets economist Magne Oestnor said.
DNB believes the Norwegian crown is undervalued, however, and that the central bank will refrain from cutting its key policy interest rate from the current record low of 0.5 percent.
""We still expect a higher oil price this year, and that will probably determine the trend for the Norwegian crown in the long term,"" Oestnor added.
In Sweden, where underlying inflation in March hit its 2 percent target for the first time in six years, both the central bank and independent economists have concluded that it is unlikely to stabilize at this level yet.
But with solid economic growth and a tightening labor market, the central bank could still end its quantitative easing by summer, while the European Central Bank will likely extend its similar program into 2018, according to Nordea Markets.
""This means we could expect the currency to gradually strengthen from here,"" Nordea economist Torbjorn Isaksson said.
The Norwegian crown was seen strengthening to 8.75 against the euro and 8.10 versus the dollar in the next 12 months from current levels of 9.17 and 8.61.

Meanwhile, the Swedish crown would likely rise to 9.15 against the euro and 8.51 versus the dollar during the next year from 9.57 and 8.99 currently.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 09:00AM ET</span>",South Africa's rand expected to stabilize for rest of year: Reuters poll,"By Vuyani Ndaba
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's rand will be relatively stable against the dollar for the rest of 2017 as the impact of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's shock dismissal and a credit rating cut to ""junk"" is already priced in, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
The rand  is expected to weaken from a current 13.7375 per dollar to 14.00 in 12 months' time, 8 cents firmer than last month's median. In six months, the rand is expected to firm to 13.5 per dollar.
That follows a near 7 percent sell-off last week triggered by President Jacob Zuma's abrupt decision to recall Gordhan from a trip to London and sack him, then put into full swing by the subsequent ratings downgrade by Standard & Poor's. 
The rand has nevertheless been more resilient than in 2015 when Zuma sacked then-finance minister Nhlanhla Nene in 2015 and replaced him with a relatively unknown minister, analysts noted. 
""One has to remember that Nene-gate was a total shock. It came out of the blue,"" said Hugo Pienaar, economist at the Bureau for Economic Research. ""Whereas what has happened now, both the reshuffle and the ratings downgrade were not totally unexpected; to an extent they have been discounted.""
Indeed, two Reuters polls published last year had already found most analysts expected a ratings downgrade to junk, most likely by S&P, by the end of 2016.
In the week of Dec. 9 2015, after Nene's dismissal, the rand lost over 10 percent of its value against the dollar. But last week, the rand fell by less.
About this time last month, the rand was comfortably leading the pack of 20 emerging market currencies tracked by Reuters. But it has dropped to fourth spot since last week's turmoil.
Zuma has replaced Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba and the ruling African National Congress says it has confidence in him and that he will retain policies set under the outgoing minister, seen by investors as a totem of policymaking stability in South Africa.
However, Pienaar warned the market could take different view if other agencies also downgrade the country's ratings.
Moody's, which grades South Africa two notches above junk status with a negative watch, is currently reviewing its rating. Fitch, which also has South Africa on negative watch but just one step away from junk, has not set a date for its next review.
HANGING ON EMERGING MARKET SENTIMENT
Like emerging market peers, South African assets have rallied since last year. That is based in part on better terms of trade this year due to a pick-up in emerging market growth and expectations the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates only three times in this cycle. 
Piotr Matys of Rabobank said assuming the Fed raises rates gradually in the second half of the year, and once political tension subsides in South Africa, the rand may be able to trim some of its losses. 
A Reuters poll taken last month after the Fed lifted rates for the second time in three months, showed Wall Street's top banks see two additional rate rises this year. Most expect at least three more in 2018. [FED/R]
But Pienaar said: ""I don't buy this Trump story that he is going to be able to do a big fiscal stimulus ... I think the Fed will remain quite cautious and not be overly aggressive.""

Other strategists however have said the market is just hanging onto the global risk rally, and that political developments in South Africa could still shake the rand.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 07:36AM ET</span>",Euro to fall to near 15-year low if Le Pen wins French election: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The euro is likely to fall about 5 percent to near 15-year lows and close to parity against the dollar in the immediate aftermath should Marine Le Pen win the French presidency in May, according to foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters.
After falling more than 3 percent in 2016, the euro is up about 2 percent this year. But the poll of nearly 70 strategists showed on Thursday the currency is now expected to erase those gains over the next 12 months.
In the near-term, though, what happens during the French two-round presidential election at the end of the month and at the start of May is expected to drive the euro.
Bets are in favor of independent Emmanuel Macron to win the race but the far-right anti-European Union candidate -- Le Pen of the National Front -- could stage a surprise victory.
That possibility is heightened by a rise in nationalist sentiment worldwide as exemplified by Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's surprise U.S. election victory.
""(A) Marine Le Pen victory would significantly weigh on the euro as it is not priced in, and given that, it would (have) a very negative outcome for the future of (monetary union),"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
""Emmanuel Macron's victory is what the market is expecting. Thus, the impact of his victory would be positive but marginal.""
If Le Pen were to win, the euro is expected to fall 5 percent immediately, according to the median of the near 40 strategists who answered an extra question. The most pessimistic view was for the single currency to lose about 15 percent.
""Markets will shoot first and ask questions later on a Le Pen win,"" said Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at NAB.
The euro is otherwise forecast to drift lower against the dollar to $1.06 by the end of this month. Respondents then expect it to weaken to $1.05 in a year, a fall of almost 2 percent from $1.07 on Thursday.
Beyond the short-term outlook, the latest euro predictions were less pessimistic compared with last month. Even the calls for euro/dollar parity have dwindled on expectations the European Central Bank will pare back its expansionary policy.
But ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday there was no need to deviate from the central bank's policy path, which includes record-low interest rates and bond buying until at least the end of the year.
That suggests long-term expectations were driven by the view for the currency on the other side of the trade, the dollar.
DOLLAR DRIVES LONG VIEW
So far this year, the greenback has fallen against most major currencies on growing doubts about the U.S. administration's ability to deliver on any of the promised stimulus and tax cuts -- a big reason for the currency's gains since Trump's election victory in November.
""There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing, composition and magnitude of any fiscal stimulus. In our view, market participants may have priced in too much upside from President Trump and the Republicans in Congress,"" said Jean-François Paren, head of global markets research at CA CIB.
""While we do see the removal of overly burdensome regulations as a plus for growth, we expect little fiscal stimulus this year, nor is there any guarantee of a big boost in 2018.""
Currency speculators have also cut their bullish dollar bets for the first time in four weeks, according to the latest positioning data.
That comes despite hawkish-sounding minutes from the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, which showed most policymakers think the Fed should begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year and was on track for two more interest rate hikes in 2017.
Still, expectations were for the dollar to gain slightly in the year ahead over most major currencies.
But a strong dollar view was based on some form of fiscal stimulus and tax reforms from the U.S. administration in the year ahead, according to almost 80 percent of 65 strategists who answered an extra question in the poll.
""Our base case includes modest tax cuts but no tax reform and only directed/symbolic trade protectionist measures alongside cautious Fed rate hiking, which to a large extent appear priced by markets,"" wrote Marvin Barth, head of FX strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a note to clients.

""Alternative scenarios of a policy package that includes tax reform or nothing at all are plausible and result in considerably different USD outcomes.""

It had risen to a three-week high of 100.850 overnight on an upbeat ADP report on U.S. private sector employment. 
But the currency tumbled from the three-week high despite hawkish-sounding minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed most policymakers think the Fed should begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.
""Although the contents of the Fed minutes should have been supportive for the dollar, it was dragged down by ensuing price action in other markets, which saw equities react negatively to the minutes and Treasury yields fall,"" said Shusuke Yamada, senior strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Tokyo.
Wall Street shares reversed an earlier rally and slipped on Wednesday, with sentiment soured as the Fed's minutes showed some policymakers viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures.
""Geopolitical risks are also weighing on the dollar. The market is only starting to factor in recent developments regarding North Korea, and it now wants to figure out the geopolitical implications of the U.S.-China summit,"" Yamada said.
Regional tensions have risen after North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Wednesday, just a day before a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where North Korea's arms development drive will take center stage.
Financial markets are nervous over the summit because of Trump's constant criticism of China's economic policies.
That caution has crimped broader investor risk appetite this week, depressing U.S. Treasury yields and dimming the dollar's allure.
With the broader markets in a risk-averse mood, the Japanese yen gained on its perceived safe-haven status.
The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 110.500 yen , having slid from a high of 111.450 struck overnight.
""The dollar looks to remain under pressure, barring developments like a swift passage of the president's budget by the U.S. Congress or an agreement on tax reform,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.0674 .
The Australian dollar fell to a four-week low on nerves ahead of the Xi-Trump summit. The currency is sensitive to potential developments in China, Australia's main trade partner.
The Aussie was down 0.4 percent and near $0.7537, its lowest since March 10.

The pound was steady at $1.2479 , after rising overnight on data showing growth in Britain's services sector.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 07:54AM ET</span>","Dollar inches higher against yen, caps broader gains ahead of Trump-Xi meeting","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against the yen in European trading on Wednesday but fell short of broader gains after North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile ahead of a key meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders. 
Pyongyang's missile launch came a day before talks on economic and security issues between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, pressuring the dollar in Asian trade as investors sought refuge in the perceived safety of the Japanese currency.
The greenback turned positive in morning London trade, rising 0.2 percent to 110.99 yen , but remained far shy of last Friday's 10-day peak of 112.19 yen. 
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a trade-weighted basket of six peers, rose slightly to 100.54 (DXY), but anxiety about the upcoming U.S.-China meeting on top of a risk-off mood this week kept it from further gains. 
Trump's consistently harsh rhetoric on China has raised concerns about Thursday's summit among investors, as has speculation that the U.S. president will face challenges implementing his promised growth-boosting policies after his administration failed to pass healthcare reform.
""Part of the pressure we've seen on the dollar this morning was the firing of the missile by North Korea, which has been weighing on risk sentiment,"" said Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency analyst at Caxton FX in London.
""It's a combination of those factors and the ongoing questions about the Trump trade and how effective Trump's policies will be and how easily he'll be able to pass spending and tax measures.""
Investors were also on the watch for U.S. economic data and minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's March policy meeting for clues about the pace of future interest-rate rises.
Employment data from private data firm ADP, a services purchasing manager's index from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), and the Fed's minutes were due later on Wednesday.
The euro was off slightly, down 0.1 percent to $1.0670 .
Investors also kept a close eye on the Czech crown (EURCZK=) amid rising speculation that the Czech central bank could drop the currency's cap against the euro.
The cost of hedging against volatility in the crown against the euro over the next 24 hours jumped to its highest in over nine months.
""I think they (Czech National Bank) are telegraphing it (dropping the cap), so they must have an intention of removing it,"" said Stephen Gallo, currency strategist with BMO Capital Markets in London.
""I suspect that they're watching very closely the events taking place in France though, ahead of the presidential elections (on April 23 and May 7). I doubt they'll remove it before we get a result there.""

GBP/USD was up 0.27% to 1.2473 by 08.50 GMT from around 1.2435 earlier.
Financial data company Markit said its services purchasing managers' index rose to 55.0 last month, the highest reading since December 2016 from February’s 53.3.
Economists had forecast a reading of 53.5.
The report showed that businesses raised prices at the fastest pace in eight and a half years, indicating that inflation may rise above the 3% rate forecast by many economists this year.
“This was overwhelmingly linked to higher input costs during recent months. Survey respondents also noted that resilient demand had provided scope to pass on some of their increased costs to clients,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit.
The report also noted that the rate of job creation in the sector rose at the slowest pace in seven months.
Taken together with similar surveys of manufacturing and construction activity released this week the data indicated that that the economy could lose momentum in the first quarter as the economic headwinds of Brexit pick up.
“The survey data indicate that UK business activity growth regained some momentum after having slipped to a five-month low in February, but the upturn fails to change the picture of an economy that slowed in the first quarter,” Williamson said.
“The relative weakness of the PMI survey data compared to that seen at the turn of the year suggests the economy will have grown by 0.4% in the first quarter, markedly lower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen rose to a one-week high against the dollar and a 4-1/2 month peak versus the euro on Tuesday, as investors grew cautious about a possibly contentious meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump vowed during his campaign to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. 
(For graphic on world FX rates in 2017 click here: http://tmsnrt.rs/2kIQHol)
While that has not happened, a CNBC report last week said the Trump administration was reviewing the scope of its power to penalize countries whose currencies it perceives as undervalued. The report provided no details about how that would be done.
""In terms of U.S. trade policy and the Trump/Xi meeting, it's always difficult to know what components of FX the two will focus on or what specific measure they will be looking at in order to amp up the rhetoric on currency manipulator,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York.
He added that it was ""unclear if it will even come up this week at all given it's more of a Treasury function to call these things than it is a presidential function.""
Markets also reacted to a bombing on Monday in a St. Petersburg metro, had an eye on U.S. employment data this week and France’s presidential election later this month.
In late morning trading, the dollar fell 0.4 percent to 110.49 yen <JPY=>, after earlier sliding to a one-week low of 110.27.
Tuesday's data was largely positive for the dollar. The U.S. trade deficit in February narrowed more than expected to $43.6 billion in February, a number that could boost first-quarter growth.
U.S. factory orders in February also rose 0.1 percent, expanding for a third straight month.
The euro, meanwhile, dropped against the yen, off 0.5 percent at 117.78 yen. Earlier, the euro fell as low as 117.43, the lowest since Nov. 22.Japan's main Nikkei stock index (N225), which tends to move inversely to the yen, closed down 0.9 percent to a 10-week low. 
The euro <EUR=> fell to a three-week trough earlier and was last at $1.0657, down 0.1 percent.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to keep interest rates at a record low of 1.5 percent was a surprise. But the Aussie dollar fell after the RBA hinted it was not too confident about domestic labor and inflation conditions.

The Aussie hit a three-week low of U$0.7545 , having declined steadily over the past two weeks from a four-month high of U$0.7750.

1008,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2017 06:18AM ET</span>",Forex - South African rand lower after ratings downgrade,"Investing.com - The South African rand suffered fresh losses on Tuesday after the country’s credit rating was downgraded to junk status by ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.
USD/ZAR hit highs of 13.94, the most since November 1 and was last at 13.79, up 0.75% for the day.
The rand ended Monday’s session down more than 2% after S&P cut the country’s credit rating to BB+ with a negative outlook from BBB minus.
The ratings agency warned that political instability, including the recent sacking of finance minister Pravin Gordhan, was endangering the economy.
S&P also cited concern over government debt levels, in particular noting the high level of borrowing by state energy firm Eskom.
Gordhan was sacked by Prime Minister Jacob Zuma in a cabinet reshuffle last Thursday and replaced by home affairs head Malusi Gigaba.
The pair had clashed in recent months; with Gordhan under pressure from Zuma to increase government spending and borrowing that he says will help tackle racial inequality and widespread poverty.
The downgrade is likely to make it more expensive for South Africa to borrow money on the international financial markets, as lending to the country would be viewed by investors as riskier.
On Monday, ratings agency Moody's placed the country’s debt rating on review for a possible downgrade later this week.
South African government bonds were also sharply lower, as yields on 10-year bonds rose to 9.03%, their highest level since the aftermath of the U.S. election in November. Yields rise when bond prices fall."

Growth in housebuilding slowed to a seven-month low, offsetting a rebound in civil engineering and commercial construction.
Inflation pressures, which have built since the Brexit vote because of the fall in sterling and higher oil prices, eased.
The report also noted that “reduced Brexit-related anxiety and the resilient economic backdrop” was helping builders remain confident.
The data came one day after a similar survey showed that growth in the UK’s manufacturing sector slowed last month as rising inflation hit consumer demand.
The reports underlined concerns that the economy could be losing momentum as the economic headwinds of Brexit pick up.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week low against the dollar on Monday as mixed economic data coming out of Europe added to existing worries about political risk in the continent, driving investors to sell the single currency.
After moving in positive territory during morning trade in Europe, the euro turned lower minutes after noon in London, falling to a three-week low of $1.0650.

""Investors are still realizing that the risks going into the French elections are still quite considerable, so there's no real opportunity to express any bullish view on the euro at this stage,"" said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.

Markets were eyeing the U.S. non-farm payrolls report due on Friday for clues on the likely pace of interest rate rises from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
""The real focus is going to be in the week ahead given how much data we have coming out ... which of course is absolutely key in trying to assess whether we will see another hike from the Fed in June,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Christian Lawrence in London.
A spate of mixed U.S. economic data on Friday reinforced the Fed's view that the economy is growing at a steady but not rapid pace.
Investors also parsed comments from Fed officials on Friday, some of which pressured the greenback. Markets are currently pricing in more than a 50 percent chance that the central bank will hike interest rates at its June meeting, the second of the three increases expected this calendar year.

The index plumbed 98.92 last week, its weakest since November 10 in the wake of President Donald Trump’s failed healthcare overhaul bill.
The dollar index ended the first quarter down almost 3% amid growing doubts over whether the Trump administration's economic proposals would boost the U.S. economy and allow the Fed to tighten policy more aggressively.
Higher rates typically support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
On Friday, New York Fed President William Dudley said the central bank was in no rush to tighten monetary policy this year.
Separately, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also said on Friday they expect rate increases by the years end, but both were cautious on the economic outlook.
Data on Friday showing that U.S. consumer spending ticked up just 0.1% last month reinforced the view that the Fed will stick to a gradual pace of rate hikes.
The dollar was almost unchanged against the yen, with USD/JPY at 111.44, holding below Friday’s two-week highs of 112.19.
The Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey showed Monday that business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers rose to a one-and-a-half year high in March, signaling that the economic recovery is broadening.
The euro was a touch higher, with EUR/USD ticking up to 1.0663, still not far from Friday’s more than two-week lows of 1.0650.
The euro remained on the back foot as investors unwound expectations that the European Central Bank is moving closer to tightening monetary policy.
Sterling edged lower, with GBP/USD down 0.15% to 1.2528 ahead of UK manufacturing data which was expected to show that factory activity remained solid in March as the weaker pound offset uncertainty over Brexit."
1023,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2017 03:24AM ET</span>",Dollar dips as U.S. growth seen slowing,"Investing.com - The dollar eased Monday as U.S. economic growth expected to have slowed at the start of the year. The dollar index was off 0.11% at 03:00 ET at 100.31 after a high of 100.35. Major banks trimmed their forecasts for U.S. Q1 GDP annual growth to a range of 1.0%-1.5% from 2.1% in Q4. That came on the back of lower-than-expected U.S. personal spending in February. Fed member James Bullard said Friday he sees no need for ""preemptive"" hikes as inflation remains ""tame."" Fed members Dudley, Harker,  Lacker are due to speak later Monday. President Trump Friday signed two executive orders calling for a probe into trade surpluses and abuses. The orders came ahead of a meeting Thursday and Friday of Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The dollar was up 0.13% at 111.54 yen after the release of the BoJ's latest Tankan report. Major Japanese manufacturers see the yen averaging 108.43 against the dollar in the current fiscal year. Sterling edged lower but held above $1.25 ahead of U.K. manufacturing PMI data. The euro was steady below $1.07 before euro-zone manufacturing PMI. "

Meanwhile, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index rose to 57.7 in March from 57.4 in February. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion, whereas a reading below 50 indicates contraction.
Analysts had expected a Chicago PMI reading of 56.9.

The dollar's share of allocated currency reserves, or those reported to the IMF, rose to a record $5.05 trillion in the October-December period, or nearly 64 percent, according to the data.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Friday and was on track for its strongest week in seven with an almost 1 percent rise, benefiting from a weaker euro as solid U.S. economic data has contrasted with cooling euro zone inflation.
Over the quarter, though, the greenback has fallen 1.7 percent (DXY) against a basket of major currencies, its worst showing in a year, on doubts that U.S. President Donald Trump was not prioritizing - and did not have the necessary power - to push through Congress the economic reforms that had driven the dollar to 14-year highs at the start of the year.
It was up 0.1 percent at 100.46 on Friday, 3 percent down from January's peak. 
Revised U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday showed that U.S. fourth quarter growth slowed less than previously reported as consumer spending provided a boost that was partially offset by the largest gain in imports in two years.
In contrast, German and Spanish consumer price data disappointed on Thursday, showing inflation slowed more sharply than expected in March as oil prices slumped, offering some respite to the European Central Bank as it faces pressure to wind down its monetary stimulus.
The weaker inflation numbers, along with comments from ECB officials and sources suggesting that the market had moved too far in pricing in monetary tightening, have weighed on the euro, which has fallen almost 2 percent in the past four days. On Friday it edged up 0.2 percent to $1.0694 . 
""The combination of inflation disappointments as well as a consistent press of ECB rhetoric on market pricing has shifted people out of this very short term but long euro view,"" said Citi's head of FX strategy in London, Richard Cochinos.
""We also have the French elections at the end of the month, so I think it’s going to be difficult for the market to go and buy a bunch of euros until we get through that."" 
Inflation data for the euro zone as a whole was due at 0900 GMT . 
Later on Friday, Trump will sign executive orders aimed at identifying abuses that are causing massive U.S. trade deficits and clamping down on non-payment of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imports, according to his top trade officials.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters that one of the orders directs his department and the U.S. Trade Representative to conduct a major review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits, including ""currency misalignment"".
While the foreign exchange market's reaction to the news was muted, market participants were warily watching for developments. 
""From a risk-management perspective, it's definitely something on the radar,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo. 
The dollar rallied 1.3 percent against South Africa's rand to 13.470 <ZAR=>, its highest since early February, after President Jacob Zuma sacked finance minister Pravin Gordhan in a cabinet reshuffle following days of speculation that has rocked the country's markets and currency.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2017 11:32AM ET</span>",Dollar little changed; weak euro zone data offsets Trump report,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was flat on Thursday after weak reports on euro zone inflation took the edge off news that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was studying ways to ""penalize currency manipulators"" to fulfill a campaign pledge.
According to CNBC, the Trump administration is ""assessing the scope of its power to penalize countries whose currencies it believes are undervalued,"" which could drive the dollar lower. The report provided no details about how the administration would do this.
While campaigning, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day as president, but so far has taken no action.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, erased its gains for the day after the report, falling from a nine-day high. 
However, it largely retraced the move not long after. The index was last up 0.1 percent at 100.11.
""This is really just a bit more jawboning from the (Trump) administration and them trying to move the dollar in the direction that they want it to go,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities. 
""That’s been their operating mandate. They believe the dollar is too strong.""
The British pound  gained strongly against the dollar after the report, rising 0.7 percent to a session high of $1.2525. The dollar fell to its lows of the day against the Swiss franc, dropping to 0.995 franc.
The euro <EUR=> fell to its lowest since March 21 against the dollar and lowest since March 3 against sterling (EURGBP=).
German and Spanish consumer inflation slowed more sharply than expected in March, prompting worries that sluggish growth in the euro zone could persist.
The inflation numbers compounded a Reuters report on Wednesday citing sources close to the European Central Bank who said officials there were unhappy with a shift in market expectations toward tighter monetary policy and higher euro zone interest rates. 
""That sort of off-the-record briefing that came through yesterday and German inflation this morning do seem to have pulled the rug from under the euro,"" said Nick Parsons, a strategist with National Australia Bank in London.
Month-end flows, solid U.S. data and technical positioning also kept the dollar rangebound, analysts said.

The Commerce Department earlier reported that U.S. gross domestic product grew faster than previously reported in the fourth quarter last year thanks to robust consumer spending.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2017 02:45PM ET</span>","Dollar rises after Trump selloff, helped by Fed comments, ECB report","By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest in more than a week against a basket of currencies on Wednesday on outlooks for U.S. and European interest rates and as investors saw the selloff that followed U.S. President Donald Trump's healthcare setback as overdone.
Reuters reported European Central Bank policymakers were wary of changing their policy message after tweaks this month upset investors and raised chances of a surge in borrowing costs.
The euro  fell to $1.0741 following the report, its lowest since March 21. That boosted the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six rival currencies, to 100.130, its highest since March 21.
The dollar also got a boost from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who said he was in line with most of his colleagues in supporting further rate hikes this year. Evans is known as one of the Fed's most consistent supporters of low interest rates.
On Friday the dollar had fallen to its lowest in four months after the U.S. House of Representatives pulled a bill to rewrite the American healthcare system backed by President Donald Trump. Investors saw it as an indication Trump was likely to have difficulty with other parts of his agenda including tax reform and fiscal spending that are likely to increase U.S. inflation.
Those fears may have been overdone, analysts said, and with Fed officials still lining up to support further interest rate hikes, the dollar is on a solid footing.
""The selloff in the dollar that we saw in reaction to the news Friday was probably a bit of an overreaction,"" said Shaun Osborne, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""The underlying faith in the reflation trade is coming back a little bit today.""
Osborne also pointed to technical factors in the dollar/euro trade as the euro has approached the $1.09 mark.
""It really boils down to the fact that the euro rallied, it turned around and it's pretty expensive to be short dollars at this point,"" he said.
The United States has higher interest rates than the euro zone, which means traders lose money by holding positions that are long euro and short dollar. The Fed recently raised its overnight interest rate to a range of 0.75 to 1.00 percent while the ECB holds negative rates on some deposits.
Adding to pressure on European currencies, Britain invoked Article 50 on Wednesday, officially beginning its exit from the European Union.

Sterling  was down 0.25 percent at $1.2416.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2017 12:20PM ET</span>",Sterling seesaws as PM May triggers Brexit,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling slipped against the dollar after a choppy day of trading on Wednesday, receiving no clear direction from Britain's formal triggering of its exit from the European Union. 
Prime Minister Theresa May began Britain's divorce procedure from the EU earlier in the day, declaring there was no turning back and ushering in a tortuous process that will test the bloc's cohesion and pitch her country into the unknown.
The pound had touched an eight-day low of $1.2377  in Asian trading, before bouncing back to trade as high as $1.2478 after the confirmation that the EU's Article 50 - which kickstarts two years of negotiations between Britain and the bloc - had been triggered. 
By 1550 GMT (11:50 a.m. ET), though, sterling had slipped back to $1.2403 , leaving it down a third of a percent on the day and in the middle of the $1.20-$1.28 range it has broadly traded in over the past six months. 
""I think we'll continue to trade sideways until we get greater clarity on the European Union’s negotiating stance,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) currency strategist Alvin Tan. 
May's six-page Brexit letter to European Council President Donald Tusk set a positive tone for the approaching talks, though it admitted that reaching a comprehensive Brexit agreement within two years would be a challenge.
Within 48 hours, Tusk will send the 27 other EU member states draft negotiating guidelines and they will later meet in Brussels to discuss the situation.
Tusk told reporters on Wednesday that the EU's goal was to minimize the costs for EU citizens, businesses and member states, whose leaders should adopt the negotiating proposals on April 29.
""The triggering of Article 50 was well anticipated, but the fact negotiations are now live means financial markets may become more vulnerable to commentary from European and/or UK officials as to how well - or poorly - the initial discussions are going,"" said Michael Metcalfe, global head of macro strategy for State Street Global Markets. 
""Headline risk is back, if it ever really went away."" 
NEGOTIATIONS EYED 
Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) stock index - most of whose components get their earnings in foreign currencies - gained 0.4 percent as sterling fell. 
Most analysts said the key driver for sterling over the coming months would be how negotiations with the EU play out, and the health of the British economy going forward.
The head of global bonds at the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, said on Wednesday that he remains invested in the British pound, though he has concerns over the timeline for Brexit negotiations.
Sterling had hit an eight-week high at the start of this week as investors unwound record-high short positions against the currency, and brought forward their expectations for when the Bank of England might begin to tighten monetary policy amid rapidly accelerating inflation in Britain. ""Given the positioning, our bias would still be toward a stronger pound over the coming weeks,"" said Derek Halpenny, MUFG's European head of global markets research in London. 

Against a weaker euro, the pound rose 0.3 percent to 86.60 pence (EURGBP=D3), having earlier hit a 12-day low of 87.35 pence. The euro dropped sharply after sources told Reuters that European Central Bank policymakers are wary of making any new change to their policy message in April.

By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - While banks warn Britain's European Union divorce could drive the pound below $1.20, their option traders have cut the cost of insuring against further falls in the two years it has left inside the bloc.
A company wanting to insure its revenues or financial investments against further falls in the currency could pay 4.8 percent on Tuesday, back to late 2015 levels, for ""put"" options that start generating a profit if sterling falls to $1.20.
That compares to forecasts from major banks that range from $1.06 to almost $1.50, meaning a move in either direction of almost another 20 percent from current levels of around $1.25.
British Prime Minister Theresa May lodges Britain's official intent to leave the bloc on Wednesday and London's currency brokers say the pound's dramatic fall to levels not seen since the mid-1980s has made companies and ordinary Britons more fearful about sterling than at any time in recent memory.
In the heart of London's Canary Wharf financial district, dollars and euros were in high demand or sold out at several retail currency kiosks on Tuesday.
""Our average daily volume was up about 50 percent yesterday. We have people who are buying a house in Spain taking half of the amount out now just to make sure they lock in at these rates,"" Mark Horgan, chief executive of corporate and consumer foreign exchange firm Moneycorp, said.
And the use of currency hedging products by small businesses has risen by almost 60 percent since Britain voted to leave the EU in June, banking researchers East and Partners say.
Horgan, whose business tends to be focused on smaller firms and individuals exchanging money for personal needs, says for most that means a simple forward contract that essentially commits the user to paying the difference between UK interest rates and those in the euro zone or the United States. 
But corporate customers are less concerned than last year.
""There is a feeling that Brexit is priced in and a lot of companies have got their heads around it now and are planning properly,"" he said, while adding: 
""The big risk for me is that we get a precipitated walk out in the first stages of the talks. That could make it a long hard summer for sterling.""
STRADDLE HYPE
Allowing for the gap between UK interest rates and their U.S. equivalents, options market insurance against a rise in sterling is relatively more expensive. 
An at-the-money ""call"" option cost 7.1 percent on Tuesday. 
That adds up to an expensive 12 percent for a ""straddle"", the options structure hedge funds and other major investors use to bet on general volatility in the currency.
Mark Farrington, a portfolio manager with London-based hedge fund Macro Currency Group, argues that sterling's fall has been driven by excessive hyping of the risks by the government, the Bank of England and other institutions.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2017 11:50AM ET</span>",Dollar steady above four-month lows as markets await Fed speakers,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar steadied broadly on Tuesday, hovering above 4-month lows, as a general risk-off mood in currency markets offset comments from Federal Reserve officials that suggested the U.S. central bank was poised to continue its rate-hike cycle.
The dollar remained lower against the yen, however, edging just off its lowest since Nov. 18. The yen has gained 4 percent against the greenback in the last nine days as markets have lost confidence in the Trump administration's ability to deliver tax reform and a promised public spending boost.
That waning of confidence has sparked risk aversion in currency markets, analysts said, prompting traders to remove or reverse bearish bets on the safe-haven yen, accelerating its gains.
""You’re seeing risk reduction ... but you’re also seeing a flight to quality,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange. 
""Dollar/yen seems to be the path of least resistance given that there’s still a tremendous amount of positioning that’s long dollar/yen and so you’re getting shorts that are getting taken out of that.""
The dollar was down 0.4 percent against the yen <JPY=> at 110.26 yen.
Against the Swiss franc, another historically safe-haven currency, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 0.9835 franc. 
The greenback got a temporary boost from a stronger-than-expected reading on U.S. consumer confidence, which rose to its highest level since 2000. Those gains, however, were short lived. 
The index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies (DXY) was little changed from its opening at 99.190, just above Monday's dip that took the index to its lowest since Nov. 11.
Analysts pointed to support from appearances by Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan and Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans on Monday as putting the emphasis back on the prospect of more increases in U.S. interest rates.
""Clearly we shouldn't forget we are going to see at least two more hikes by the Fed this year and that there is still the potential for the next one to be pulled forward to June,"" said CIBC strategist Jeremy Stretch. 

On Tuesday, investors will hear comments from Kansas City Fed chief Esther George and further remarks from Kaplan, who will participate in a question-and-answer session with the Dallas Committee on Foreign Relations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest since November against a basket of currencies on Monday as investors lost confidence in prospects for a U.S. fiscal spending boost under President Donald Trump after his failure to pass a major healthcare reform bill.
Trump's inability to deliver on his campaign pledge to overhaul the nation's healthcare system marked a big setback for a Republican president whose own party controls Congress, and raised doubts over whether he will be able to see through tax reforms and a proposed spike in spending.
The dollar recovered broadly during North American trading, but remained down 0.45 percent on the day against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength (DXY). It earlier fell as low as 98.858, the lowest since Nov. 11.
""The assumption was that if you can’t get healthcare done that some of the other things on his agenda, mainly the tax reform, would be a harder sell,"" said John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus Inc in Washington.
The dollar index had risen to a 14-year high near 104.00 in early January when expectations for inflation-boosting stimulus under the Trump presidency were at their peak, with investors betting on the so-called ""Trumpflation"" trade.

""The British pound is still close to its weakest level in 30 years, so it has some upside especially since data out of the UK has been better,"" Doyle said. ""The Japanese yen has had a great run because stocks around the globe are down. So if you start breaking it down into each individual currency there's a good reason, but overall it's just a dollar negative day.""

The rand fell more than 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, bonds tumbled and banking shares slid more than 3 percent after Zuma's office said Gordhan had been recalled. It did not give a reason, but a government source said: ""The presidency did not give permission for the trip.""
The decision comes a day before a court is due to rule on a request by Gordhan for a declaratory judgment that he cannot interfere with decisions by banks to cut ties with businesses owned by the Gupta brothers, who are friends of Zuma. 
""Zuma has instructed the Minister of Finance, Mr Pravin Gordhan, and Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas to cancel the international investment promotion roadshow to the United Kingdom and the United States and return to South Africa immediately,"" the statement from the president's office said.
Business executives and union leaders had also accompanied Gordhan to London to woo potential investors for whom he is a reassuring figure given weak economic growth and tensions within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) that have put South Africa's investment-grade credit rating at risk.
Fraud charges brought against Gordhan and then dropped last year, prompting accusations of a political ""witch-hunt"", badly rattled financial markets, as did rumors before last month's budget speech that he might be moved from the Treasury.
Speaking in London, Gordhan said he was ""just asked to come back"", adding that he had planned to skip the U.S. leg of the roadshow and return home anyway.
Asked if he expected a cabinet reshuffle, Gordhan said: ""That's the boss's prerogative.""
Gordhan will return to South Africa on Tuesday morning, the Treasury said.
UNCERTAINTY
The main opposition Democratic Alliance said in a statement the decision to call back Gordhan ""is so bizarre that it appears, at best, calculated to humiliate the minister or, at worst, to suggest that the minister is about to be fired"".
The ruling ANC said the decision had not been discussed at its weekend meeting.
Jabulane Mabuza, head of Business Unity South Africa and chairman of Telkom, who was with Gordhan in London, said in a text message: ""It's true, minister has been called back home - at this point only presidency can give clarity on the why."" 
Analysts said Zuma's move could spell another bout of political uncertainty and possibly a cabinet reshuffle. South African media reports suggest Zuma and Gordhan have an uneasy relationship, though the president has denied suggestions he is ""at war"" with his finance minister.
""I believe today could be a test of the water to undertake a reshuffle,"" said Peter Attard Montalto, an emerging markets analyst at Nomura in London. 
Political pundits say Gordhan is the target of political pressure from a faction allied to Zuma, which has criticized his plans to rein in government spending as the economy stagnates and also rapped his running of the tax agency. Gordhan has wrangled for months with the head of the agency.
But ""any suggestion Zuma is interfering with Gordhan's business dealings will be a concern for investors and could signal political instability on the horizon,"" political analyst Daniel Silke said.
MARKET MOVES
A Pretoria court is due to hear on Tuesday Gordhan's request for a declaratory judgment that he cannot interfere with decisions by South Africa's major banks to cut their ties with businesses owned by the three Indian-born Gupta brothers. 
Gordhan has said the brothers have repeatedly asked him to intervene to have their accounts reopened.
Allegations that the Guptas wielded undue influence over Zuma were investigated last year by the Public Protector, a constitutionally mandated anti-corruption watchdog. Zuma has said the Guptas are his friends, but denies anything improper about the relationship.
Gordhan first served as finance minister from 2009 to 2014 and was reappointed by Zuma in December 2015 to calm markets spooked by the president's decision to replace respected finance minister Nhlanhla Nene with a little-known politician. 
Currently rated investment-grade, Africa's most industrialized economy is seen at risk of slipping into ""junk"" territory this year because of sluggish growth and political uncertainty. 
Moody's is due to review its Baa2 rating on April 7, while Standard & Poor's will review its BBB- grade - one notch above ""junk"" the beginning of June.
""Today’s market moves underline the importance of Mr. Gordhan to investor confidence in South Africa,"" Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note.
""And even if the minister is not removed, today's events show that President Zuma is totally unconcerned with the effect that his often erratic policymaking style has on markets.""

The U.S. dollar remained broadly weaker as doubts about the Trump administration’s ability to deliver on campaign economic pledges rattled investors.

The index had surged to almost 14-year highs in early January on the back of expectations for a strong economic recovery and higher inflation, the so called ‘Trump Trade’.
Gains for the loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known, were checked as oil prices fell towards $50 a barrel amid a lack of clarity on whether an OPEC-brokered output cut will be extended beyond June in a bid to support the market.
Friday’s lackluster domestic inflation data also weighed on the Canadian dollar.

1093,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 27, 2017 05:41AM ET</span>",What to expect from sterling as Brexit begins,"Investing.com - With British Prime Minister Theresa May poised to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Wednesday, the formal launch of the UK’s two-year divorce proceedings from the European Union will get underway.
The long term outlook for sterling will be determined by the final Brexit deal, but shorter term price action will be dictated by shifting possibilities as fresh political developments emerge.
Sterling plunged from highs of $1.50 to a 31-year low of $1.32 in the aftermath of the June Brexit vote and is currently down around 14% against the U.S. dollar since the referendum.
Triggering Article 50 is likely to crystalize Brexit risks and the EU response to May’s vision for Brexit has so far suggested that a smooth transition to divorce is unlikely.
May outlined her Brexit strategy in a speech in January and has said repeatedly since then that she is prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if she is dissatisfied with the terms on offer.
She aims to leave the single market and clamp down on immigration. She wants a “bold and ambitious” trade relationship with the EU, but also the freedom to negotiate trade agreements with other countries.
Politics will dominate, at least in the early part of negotiations. The EU negotiating team’s response to Article 50 should become clear by the end of April and the EU stance will be critical in setting the tone for exit negotiations and trade deals with the currency bloc.
Meanwhile, UK inflation is at its highest level in over three years, retail sales have faltered and pay growth has slowed significantly, despite continuing low levels of unemployment.
The steep drop in sterling since the Brexit vote, combined with a recovery in global oil prices has pushed prices higher in recent months, leading to fears that rising inflation will erode consumer spending, the main driver of growth in the UK economy.
The BoE has said it expects inflation will peak at 2.8% in the second quarter of next year but many economists say it is likely to hit 3%.
Rising inflation has fueled expectations that the BoE could hike interest rates more quickly than expected, particularly after the minutes of the BoE’s March meeting showed that one policymaker voted for a rate hike.
According to analysts at MNI, the chances of a rate increase later this year have nearly doubled since the hawkish minutes.
“The market is now pricing in a 44% chance of a 25bp rate hike in Nov 2017, up from 25% last Monday as Kristen Forbes calls for a 25bp rate hike due to rising inflation and better growth, while there was some hawkish undertones from some other members in the MPC minutes as well,” MNI said.
But analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note on March 21 that they think a rise in inflation driven by energy or by the sterling exchange rate is less likely to prompt tighter policy than rising pay growth or inflation expectations.
The prospect of another Scottish independence referendum also poses a risk to sterling, as it would lead to a prolonged period of political uncertainty on the domestic front.
Most forex analysts expect sterling to come under heavy selling pressure as the Brexit negotiations unfold. It could drop to parity with the euro and perhaps even against the dollar.
Currency analysts at Deutsche Bank said sterling could fall as low as $1.06 from around $1.2560 currently, as the Brexit process weighs.
In a special report on Brexit, they wrote ""we do not see sterling (currently) fully pricing a hard Brexit outcome. Combined with limited adjustment in the UK’s current account deficit and slowing growth, we see further downside, and forecast $1.06 in by year-end.""
Other forex analysts don’t expect the triggering of Article 50 to have a major short-term impact on the pound, predicting that the currency could rebound as markets react positively once there is greater clarity on the issue.
Analysts at ING Group said in a research note that while they believe the broader risks to sterling lie to the downside, they expect the triggering of Article 50 to have more of a symbolic impact on the pound.
“It will serve as a reality check that a tricky few years lie ahead as Brexit negotiations unfold and a new UK-EU economic relationship takes shape,” the March 14 note said.
ING sees one final leg of Brexit adjustment left. “We look for GBP/USD to form a cyclical base below $1.20, while expecting EUR/GBP to stabilize between 0.88-0.90.”
Morgan Stanley thinks the triggering of Article 50 is already priced into sterling.
“There may be many Article 50-related news headlines in the coming weeks but we believe that a lot of the negativity around Brexit-related economic data weakness is already in the price,” analysts at the investment bank said in a note to clients on March 2.
But Bank of America Merrill Lynch is bearish on the outlook for sterling as Brexit looms.
“We reject the notion that sterling has fully priced Article 50 and beyond. Risks to the currency remain to the downside on a disruptive start to negotiations,” analysts said in a March 2 note.
Meanwhile, political risks to both the dollar and the euro remain to the forefront.
The dollar dropped to four-month lows against a currency basket on Monday after the Trump administration failed to push through legislation to overhaul healthcare when it didn’t receive enough support from Republicans.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2017 03:29PM ET</span>",Dollar weak as investors await U.S. healthcare vote,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar hovered around a four-month low against the Japanese yen on Friday, ahead of a vote in Washington on new healthcare legislation that some investors view as a litmus test of whether U.S. President Donald Trump will be able to pass fiscal stimulus.
The dollar weakened slightly after Republicans in Congress said they lacked the votes to pass their proposed U.S. healthcare system overhaul, and a key committee chairman came out in opposition following Trump's demand for a vote in a gamble that could hobble his presidency.
""I think the market is going to wait till they get some final word on it one way or the other,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey.
Failure to pass the proposal would hurt the dollar, at least temporarily, Trevisani said. ""If this is emblematic of something that Republicans have been campaigning for seven years now and they can't get it done, it doesn't bode well for the next item, which is tax reform.""
With a risk-averse mood across markets, the greenback has slipped about 1.7 percent against the yen this week <=JPY>. On Friday, the dollar was down 0.14 percent at 110.77 yen.
Investors were split on whether a potential defeat for Trump would knock the dollar and stock markets - because it would suggest his inability to get reforms through Congress, or whether it would boost them - as he would then be able to move straight onto tax reforms.
""If healthcare does not pass I don't think it's USD negative,"" Brad Bechtel, managing director at Jefferies in New York, said in a note.
While there will be a knee-jerk reaction if the bill does not pass, it will not change the underlying economic picture, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a four-month low against the Japanese yen on Thursday ahead of a vote on a U.S. Republican healthcare plan seen as a litmus test of President Donald Trump's ability to pass key policies such as tax cuts through Congress.
Trump was set to make a final push in the House of Representatives to secure the votes to begin dismantling Obamacare, amid signs that enough Republicans might defect to jeopardize one of his top legislative priorities.
""It's really the big focal point as we sit here today,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana.
The dollar was down 0.32 percent at 110.78 yen, after dipping to a low of 110.64 yen  earlier in the session.
The greenback soared to a 14-year peak after Trump's election last year on expectations that he would cut corporate and other taxes and increase infrastructure spending, boosting economic growth.
That faith has been shaken since the turn of the year, and the dollar has fallen against all of its major peers in response.
If the House does not approve the healthcare proposal, ""it would be dollar-negative and somewhat negative also for general risk appetite,"" said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.

GBP/USD touched highs of 1.2528, the most since February 24, up from around 1.2472 ahead of the report.
Retail sales jumped 1.4% in February the Office for National Statistics said, easily beating economists’ forecasts for an increase of just 0.4%.
January’s figure was revised down to show a 0.5% drop, from the previously reported 0.3% decline.
But the underlying trend was more negative the OSN warned, as retail sales over the three months to February fell by 1.4%. It was the second straight monthly decline, the largest fall since March 2010 and only the second fall since December 2013.
""The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months,"" ONS statistician Kate Davies said.
The report came after Tuesday’s UK inflation report showed inflation rising back above the Bank of England’s 2% target for the first time since September 2013 in February.
Economists fear that rising inflation at a time when wage growth is slowing will erode consumer spending, the main driver of growth in the UK economy.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2017 02:48PM ET</span>",'Terrorist incident' in London causes only brief fall for sterling,"By Jemima Kelly and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling fell only briefly on Wednesday after an assailant stabbed a policeman and was shot by police just outside Britain's parliament building in London in what police described as a ""terrorist incident"".
Eyewitnesses said a car had crashed into pedestrians on nearby Westminster bridge shortly before the incident, in which Sky News said two people were killed. The total number of casualties was unclear.
The initial reports drove sterling to the day's lows against the dollar and euro, but as it emerged that an assailant had been shot, and with no reports of other separate incidents, the pound recovered to trade broadly flat on the day. 
By 1740 GMT, the pound was trading at $1.2482, having briefly fallen to as low as $1.2424, and up from levels of around $1.2450  before the news. 
It also recovered from the day's low of 87 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3) to trade flat at 86.62 pence. 
British government bond futures  fell back from the session high struck immediately after the incident.
""Maybe the market is not viewing this as sufficiently sizeable to hit the radar,"" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund FX sales at Mizuho in London.
""Some of these incidents don’t necessarily cause a massive exodus of investors from the currency. If you look at what happened in Germany and France in the last couple of years, you didn’t see a dramatic sell-off in the euro. People just get on with their business as normal.""
Jones added that the market was already in the midst of paring back big bets against sterling, and this, along with broad dollar weakness, was helping its recovery on Wednesday. Data showed net short sterling positions hit a record high in the week to last Tuesday. [IMM/FX]
""ELEMENT OF RELIEF""
""There's probably a little bit of -- if we can call it this -- relief, because of course we're still waiting to find out about the number of casualties, which of course is extremely sad, but ultimately it appears at this early stage to be a lone individual,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy CIBC World Markets. 
""It's not at this stage appearing to be a coordinated attack or something more substantive than that, so I think there's an element of relief in that regard.""
Stretch added that investors were refocusing on other factors, such as UK retail sales data due on Thursday, as well as a key healthcare reform vote in the U.S. Congress.
Sterling earlier hit a four-week high of $1.2507, having surged 3 percent in the past week on a downturn in the dollar amid rapidly accelerating inflation, and after Bank of England minutes last week one policymaker voted for a rise in rates. 
Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) and mid-caps (FTMC) share indexes both ended slightly off earlier lows, down 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin regained its footing on Monday, having suffered its heftiest falls since early 2015 between Thursday and Saturday as investors sold the digital currency on worries about its future. 
Having soared to an all-time high of $1,350  on the Bitstamp exchange on March 10, on speculation that regulators could approve the first U.S. bitcoin exchange traded fund the following day, the digital currency then slipped back. 
Its falls began accelerating on Thursday and it hit a five-week low of $944.36 on Saturday. But bitcoin recovered a little on Sunday and built on those gains on Monday, climbing around 2.5 percent to roughly $1,050 by 1815 GMT. 
Bitcoin experts said its steep losses were driven by a longstanding, and intensifying, row over whether - and how - to increase the capacity of the ""blocks"" that bitcoin transactions are processed in, so as to make sure there are no delays in transactions being finalised. 
""The bitcoin scaling debate is a risk for the network and highlights core issues in terms of governance and this is where more nimble crypto competitors see advantages in fleshing out their capabilities sooner,"" said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency analysis website Crytocompare, in London. 
At the same time that bitcoin was plunging, a newer, rival ""cryptocurrency"" was soaring: ether. The digital currency behind Ethereum - a project that some experts say holds more potential than bitcoin - has almost tripled in value this month, jumping to record highs of around $45. 
Some experts said traders were selling bitcoin and buying ether, which was exacerbating the falls in the original cryptocurrency. 
""Traders in the space are looking for better returns in the more risky and nascent cryptos such as Dash, Monero and Ethereum (and are) looking to replicate the extraordinary returns that bitcoin saw in its early days,"" added Hayter. 

U.S. regulators dashed Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss's bitcoin ambitions earlier in the month by rejecting their application to list an exchange-traded fund linked to the digital currency.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2017 11:23AM ET</span>",Dollar dips to six-week low as Fed rate outlook continues to weigh,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped to a six-week low against a basket of currencies on Monday, extending weakness from last week, following recent interest-rate guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve that was less ""hawkish"" than many had expected.
The greenback has been on the retreat since the Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates but stopped short of predicting a sharper pace of monetary policy tightening over the next two years.
""It's follow-through and a hangover from last week - the concept of a dovish Fed,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director at Jefferies in New York.
""Even though they hiked (rates), the perception was that they were mildly dovish. We are seeing continuing dollar sluggishness on the back of that,"" he said.
Group of 20 financial leaders at a meeting expressed renewed concern about the United States' global trade relations and by implication the Donald Trump White House's concern over the strong dollar.
The post-meeting communique retained language on avoiding currency manipulation, which has previously seemed aimed chiefly at Japan and China, but it omitted a call for free trade seen as opening the door to more overt efforts by Washington to shift the balance of its international relationships. 
The dollar index (DXY) fell by as much as 0.3 percent in Asian and early European trading before recovering some ground to stand just 0.05 percent weaker on the day at 100.25.
The greenback was helped by public comments from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans who said Federal Reserve was on track to raising interest rates twice more this year, analysts said.
""He is a dove and he is a voter. He sounded pretty comfortable with three Fed hikes,"" said Richard Franulovich, a forex analyst at Westpac. 
Meanwhile, sterling slipped from a three-week high against the dollar after a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would formally launch talks on leaving the European Union on March 29.
The pound , which had been up as much as a third of a percent against the dollar in London morning trade, reversed course, falling as low as $1.2368 following the statement, down 0.2 percent on the day.

""Perhaps some of the newly minted longs from the overnight session are being forced out here,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2017 10:17AM ET</span>",Big banks back off calls for euro-dollar parity,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. bank Citi has abandoned its prediction of a fall for the euro to below parity against the dollar, the latest major lender to capitulate on long-term forecasts for a historic change in one of the world's big currency equilibriums.
The shift, sent to clients in a strategy note late on Friday, follows revisions by other major dollar bulls including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), who last week again pushed out their timetable for a fall to $0.95 for the euro. 
Reuters historic polling data shows all of the currency world's top ten banks have now been forced substantially to back off the forecasts of a swift drop below parity which have been widespread since the dollar rallied strongly in late 2014. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts have both raised their 1-year forecast to 99 cents from 95 cents while other dollar bulls including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are at $1 or above. 
JP Morgan has the euro at $1.15 at year's end, while HSBC's David Bloom has been forecasting a bounce to $1.10 or beyond for months.
Cutting a number of its forecasts for the dollar, analysts from Citi, the world's largest currency trader, raised its target for the euro over the next 6 months from $0.98 to $1.04. 
It cited factors ranging from signs President Donald Trump's fiscal and tax plans may be delayed, to growing expectations of a tightening in European Central Bank monetary policy this year and the defeat of anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen in France.
""Our medium term forecasts still assume 3-4% $ upside globally with no little differentiation in spot terms between G10 and emerging market movements,"" the note said. 
""This is less than before reflecting the broadening of the reflation trade, expectations of tighter policies outside the US and some disappointment on the possible achievements of the Trump Administration.""
The euro gained for a fourth day running against the dollar on Monday to trade at $1.0753. 
TAIL RISK
The big remaining risk to the euro is a political surprise from one or other of major national elections scheduled or expected across Europe this year. 
JP Morgan strategist Paul Meggyesi is among the most downbeat on the dollar's prospects going forward but he points to French far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and others as having the potential to alter those.
The dollar has been falling steadily since the U.S. Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates but stopped short of signaling a faster monetary tightening was in store. 
""We’re comfortable with the way that things are unfolding. Western European growth appears on balance to be improving and, conditioned on European political uncertainty, we have probably seen the lows in euro dollar,"" Meggyesi said. 
""The price action confirms a key thesis in our forecast that the Fed hiking is not sufficient for the dollar to rally."" 
One element pointed to again by analysts over the past few weeks is the sheer weight of trade and central bank money favoring the euro month to month.
Germany's huge current account surplus has ballooned to more than 30 billion euros at month and data suggests the Czech and Swiss central banks have been accumulating around 13 billion euros a month each through market intervention.

U.S. futures market data on Friday showed bets against the euro still total more than $5.4 billion, but they are also now at their lowest levels since May of last year.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2017 07:36PM ET</span>","Dollar stays weak, but long-term outlook still upbeat","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a five-week low on Friday, remaining under pressure for a third straight session after the Federal Reserve quashed hopes for a further currency bull run by keeping a gradual rate-hiking pace.
""At the moment, the dollar remains in correction mode, which we had fully expected,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst, Forex.com in London. ""But we remain fundamentally bullish on the greenback because the Fed remains the only major central bank which is actively tightening its policy.""
James Chen, head of research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey, also pointed out that the pace of Fed rate hikes and policy outlooks can change extremely quickly.
He noted that only a few weeks before Wednesday's Fed announcement, expectations for a March hike were exceptionally low. But Fed officials made a concerted effort to warn the markets of the high likelihood of a Fed rate hike and expectations then soared to a near-certainty, Chen said.
""This same rapid change in expectations could very likely occur again at any time, assuming the Trump administration's fiscal plans begin to take root.""
With the Fed policy meeting out of the way, investors focused on Friday's G20 financial leaders meeting in Baden Baden. It will be one of the most closely-watched G20 meetings for the currency market.
Any hints of a broader push by Washington against an appreciating dollar are likely to weaken the currency.
The surge in the dollar in the weeks after the U.S. election last November was largely due to expectations of increased spending. But a higher U.S. budget deficit is likely to dampen that view.
Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank in London, said she sees the risk that any additional spending may not happen until the end of the year, or potentially 2018.
""That disappointment over the reflationary outlook could weigh on the dollar in the coming months,"" she added.
In late trading, the dollar index (DXY) slipped 0.1 percent to 100.30, after earlier falling to a five-week low. The index was down almost 1 percent overall for the week and 1.2 percent since the Fed raised rates on Wednesday.
Against the yen, the dollar fell to a two-week low and last traded down 0.6 percent at 112.68 yen <JPY=>.

The euro, meanwhile, fell against the dollar after a poll showed far-right anti-EU leader Marine Le Pen extending her lead over centrist Emmanuel Macron in the first round of France's presidential elections. The euro was last down 0.2 percent at $1.0740 <EUR=>.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro stood tall on Thursday after Dutch election exit polls pointed to a comfortable win by the prime minister over his far-right rival, while the dollar wallowed at a one-month low after the Federal Reserve sounded less hawkish than anticipated on future rate rises.
The euro climbed to a five-week high of $1.0746 on Thursday, after surging 1.2 percent overnight.
The common currency was boosted as exit polls showed the Netherlands' center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte roundly saw off a challenge by anti-Islam, anti-EU Geert Wilders in an election on Wednesday, alleviating concerns towards Holland opting to leave the EU. 
""The euro's rise was an initial reaction to the Dutch exit polls and the currency could rise further when the European 'mother market' comes into session later in the day,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""How much further support the euro can garner would depend on how the Dutch vote could now impact the French presidential elections, for example by eroding support for (Marine) Le Pen. We could see the euro gain further if spreads between French and German government bonds tighten today.""
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was down 0.2 percent at 100.560.
It slid more than 1 percent the previous day to touch 100.490, its lowest since Feb. 17.

Some traders had begin to suspect it would raise rates four times this year as the economy builds up steam.
U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply in reaction to the Fed's rate view for the rest of the year, prompting the dollar to fall more than 1 percent against the yen. The dollar, which went as high as 115.195 yen earlier this week, last stood at 113.420.
""Speculation of four rate hikes this year may have been excessive. The dot plot was left mostly unchanged, shaking out expectations among dollar bulls that had gone too far,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
The ""dot plot"" reflects Fed policymakers' interest rate projections.
The yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy and kept the 10-year government bond yield target of around zero percent, as the central bank's decision was well anticipated.
The focus is now on BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's post-meeting briefing at 0630 GMT for clues on the central bank's stance on whether and when to pull back its massive stimulus program.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 03:04PM ET</span>",Trump trade adviser strikes conciliatory tone on Mexico; peso firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Donald Trump's most protectionist trade advisers struck a more conciliatory tone with Mexico on Wednesday, saying he wanted the two countries and Canada to form a regional manufacturing ""powerhouse"" with stricter rules of origin.
White House National Economic Council Director Peter Navarro's comments on Bloomberg News helped boost Mexico's peso to nearly its highest level since Trump's election last November.
The comments indicate that Navarro, a strong voice behind Trump's calls during the campaign for steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and China to help reduce U.S. trade deficits, was now seeking to cooperate with Mexico to the benefit of both countries. Navarro said he wanted to strengthen manufacturing in the three countries through renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Navarro said the 23-year-old trade pact could be transformed into two parallel U.S. bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico, or a modernization of the current trilateral deal.
""We have a tremendous opportunity, with Mexico in particular, to use higher rules of origin to develop a mutually beneficial regional powerhouse where workers and manufacturers on both sides of the border will benefit enormously,"" Bloomberg quoted Navarro as saying. ""It’s just as much in their interests as it is in our interests to increase the rules of origin.""
In automotive products, the biggest area of manufactured goods trade between the United States and Mexico, vehicles must have 62.5 percent North American content to qualify for NAFTA's tariff-free benefits. Navarro has said that rule allows North American manufacturers to use too many Asian parts.
Both Mexican and Canadian officials say they want to renegotiate and modernize NAFTA. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he would trigger notification to Congress to start the NAFTA renegotiation process by late March, with substantive talks beginning later this year. 
The Mexican peso, which had fallen sharply after Trump's election on fears that trade between the two countries would be disrupted, had strengthened to below 19.5 to the dollar at midday.
With the Trump administration filling out with more voices on trade issues, it is unclear how much influence Navarro will have.
Ross has been designated to take a leading role on trade issues, while U.S. Trade Representative nominee Robert Lighthizer told senators in his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he would have full statutory authority to negotiate trade deals. 

Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and former USTR official in the 1980s, said he would ""sort out"" differences within the administration over trade.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 11:23AM ET</span>",Dollar slips as markets await Fed rate outlook,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower on Wednesday, as investors awaited a widely-expected interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve, but grew cautious about the rate outlook this year given lingering uncertainty with the Trump administration's fiscal policy.
Fed fund futures  have factored in a 94 percent chance of a rate rise on Wednesday. The focus has now shifted to whether the Fed is set for regular quarterly rate increases.
""There may be disappointment that the 'dot plots' are not going to rise much higher and therefore the language from the Fed may be more dovish than what they let on last week,"" said Jeremy Cook, head of currency strategy at FX payments company World First in London.
""There is still so much uncertainty toward fiscal policy in the United States,"" he added. 
The so-called ""dot plot"" refers to the Fed's interest rate projections. Currently, the Fed's ""dot plot"" calls for three hikes this year. 
In late morning trading, the dollar index slipped 0.1 percent to 101.57 (DXY) 
Cook said the market needs to see four members of the Federal Open Market Committee shift their outlook higher to get a significant change in the 2017 median ""dot plots.""
Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 114.74 , well below last week's 115.51 peak, its highest since Jan. 19, as expectations built for the rate increase.
The dollar drifted higher earlier after data showed a steady increase in inflation, with the consumer price index posting its biggest year-on-year gain in February in nearly five years.
In the 12 months through February, the CPI accelerated 2.7 percent, the largest year-on-year growth since March 2012. 
The Bank of Japan also began a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. It is expected to hold its policy steady and stress that inflation is nowhere near levels that justify talk of withdrawing its massive stimulus.
Sterling  gained to a week's high of $1.2258, rebounding from the previous day's eight-week low hit on worries of a painful and prolonged Brexit. The pound was last up 0.4 percent at $1.2202, although it dipped earlier below $1.22 after UK data showed wage growth slowed in the three months to January. 
The euro, meanwhile, rose 0.3 percent to $1.0629 , as concern about Wednesday's Dutch parliamentary election was offset by market speculation the European Central Bank may be ready to wind down its stimulus program.
The Dutch vote, taking place amid a diplomatic row between the Netherlands and Turkey, is being closely watched as a test of populist and anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe, before national elections in France next month and in Germany in September.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank turns less bearish on the euro,"LONDON (Reuters) - Currency analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), among the most gloomy on the euro's prospects against the dollar, now expect the currency to hold its ground in coming months before falling below parity with the greenback by the end of the year.
George Saravelos, the bank's global co-head of foreign exchange research, said on Wednesday he now sees the euro at $1.08  at the end of the second quarter and $1.03 at the end of the third, compared to $1.00 and $0.98 previously. 
There is a chance of a bounce to $1.10 in the coming months from $1.06 currently, before it resumes its slide towards Deutsche's long-held target of $0.95 by the end of the year, Saravelos said.
""We are now becoming more cautious on further near-term weakness. We are turning tactically neutral and see risks of a squeeze to $1.10 over the next couple of months,"" Saravelos said in a note on Wednesday.
Over the longer term, the divergence between U.S. and euro zone monetary policy will strengthen the dollar. The Federal Reserve may ultimately have to raise interest rates more than money markets currently expect, he said.
But the lack of clarity on the White House's tax reform plans and the potential for U.S. growth surprises to be on the downside in the near term could cap the dollar for now. 
On the European side, political risks surrounding the French and German elections this year appear to be ebbing, while European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has signaled a willingness to incrementally turn more hawkish, Saravelos said.

Deutsche is the world's fourth largest FX trading bank, seeing some 8 percent of the average $5 trillion-a-day flows, according to the last industry survey by Euromoney magazine.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",Sterling sinks to eight-week low,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling fell to an eight-week low against the dollar and the basket of currencies measuring its broader strength on Tuesday, hit by fears of a prolonged bout of political jousting over the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday won the right to launch divorce proceedings with the EU on Monday, beginning two years of talks that will shape the future of Britain and Europe.
Her spokesman dismissed as ""speculation"" media reports that she would launch the talks on Tuesday, and instead suggested it would be toward the end of the month.
Also on Monday, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon demanded the right to hold a second Scottish independence referendum either late next year or at the start of 2019.
Sterling initially climbed after that announcement, with analysts citing relief among investors that the vote would not be held this year plus known aspects of the EU exit process.
""The triggering of Article 50 has been well telegraphed and is unlikely to cause a major stir for sterling in itself,"" said John Wraith, head of UK Rates Strategy & Economics at UBS. 
""It does however increase headline risk, particularly
as the opening negotiating positions of the two sides are far apart. This may shift attention back to the UK's large current account deficit ... (it) does not bode well for sterling.""
Having ridden out the latest political headlines on Monday while the dollar was weak, a resurgence for the greenback in Asian trading and soon after opening in Europe sent sterling spinning as low as $1.2110.  
It fell as much as 0.7 percent against the euro to 87.85 pence (EURGBP=D3). 
Sterling has been the worst performer against the dollar among major developed-world currencies as a result, just as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to raise the official interest rate premium for holding dollars on Wednesday.
""As U.S. real yields edge higher and the prospect of further Bank of England/Fed de-coupling looms large, it seems inconceivable that sterling can avoid falling below $1.20,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. 

Several of the currency world's top 10 banks, who were more cautious on the pound at the end of last year, have been aggressive in the past fortnight in advocating more declines.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Tuesday ahead of an expected interest rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as political risks from Dutch and French elections to Britain's exit from the EU weighed on European currencies.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major peers - four of them European - climbed by a third of a percent to 101.67 (DXY). 
The euro, which on Monday hit a five-week high above $1.07  on the expectation that the European Central Bank is moving towards winding back its stimulus program, inched down to $1.0644, with dovish comments from ECB officials adding to a cautious mood.
Sterling slipped as much as 0.9 percent to $1.2110 , its lowest in eight weeks, as concerns increased over a second Scottish independence referendum and the triggering of Article 50, which will formally begin Brexit negotiations. [GBP/]
The Netherlands will vote on Wednesday in an election that is seen as a test of anti-immigrant, populist politics that swept across the West in 2016.
Polls suggest the government may lose about half its seats at the hands of the anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) party of Geert Wilders. Though Wilders has virtually no chance of winning enough seats to form a government, a PVV win would nevertheless send shock waves across Europe. 
""The worry is that PVV will do better in Holland on Wednesday than what's already priced in (and) you've got these tensions in the UK because of the Article 50 trigger,"" said BMO currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London. 
""So you've got a stronger dollar weighing on European currencies because the political outlook for Europe is so uncertain right now, and Fed messaging has not helped those currencies, with speculation that the March hike could be a hawkish hike,"" he added. 
With a Fed rate increase already seen as a done deal, investor focus was on what kind of a message the Fed would deliver after its two-day meeting starting later on Tuesday.
""It is a wait-and-see mood that is mostly prevailing in the market ahead of the Fed's decision,"" said Shin Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""Expectations for a hawkish dot plot was a factor that has pushed up the dollar recently, with hopes for the number of times the Fed could hike rates this year having increased to four from three.""
The ""dot plot"" is policymakers' rate projections and provides a view into their interest rate outlook.
Masashi Murata, senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo, said expectations for four U.S. rate increases this year look excessive, and that the Fed meeting could help cool exaggerated policy tightening expectations.
Investors also have their eyes on the Trump administration's fiscal 2018 federal budget plan, which will be released on Thursday, and on a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Germany on Friday.

But now it's back to $1,231, up 26% from its lows and about $60 below its preannouncement levels. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $1,327 on Friday morning.
""Based on the record before it, the commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,"" the SEC said in its statement rejecting the Winklevoss twins' ETF. ""Therefore, as the exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with respect to all previously approved commodity-trust ETPs — agreements that help address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market — the commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.""
2017 has been a volatile year for bitcoin. It gained more than 20% in the first week of the year before crashing 35% on rumblings that China would begin cracking down on trading.
But the cryptocurrency has shrugged off news that China's biggest exchanges started charging a flat fee of 0.2% per transaction in addition to  blocking customer withdrawals. It rallied more than 30% over the past month in the face of that news, putting in a high of $1,237 on Friday, as traders speculated that the SEC would approve at least one of the three bitcoin ETFs.
The SEC will rule on SolidX Management's proposed bitcoin ETF on March 30 and Grayscale Investments' at a later date.

LONDON (Reuters) - Buying from the start of European trade on Monday halted three days of losses for the dollar, the impact of higher U.S. market interest rates turning it positive on the day against both the euro  and a basket of currencies. (DXY)
A wave of profit-taking on some of the greenback's gains of the past fortnight has been encouraged since Thursday by signs the European Central Bank is beginning to think more about how to react to an improving euro zone economy. 
Some ECB policymakers last week raised the possibility of increasing interest rates before it ends its emergency asset purchases although the discussion was isolated and did not enjoy any broad support, sources said on Friday.
Friday's solid jobs number has still cemented the case for a rise in U.S. Federal Reserve rates this week that will long predate any European move and sees market rates far higher.
Belgian central banker Jan Smets also told the Wall Street Journal that the ECB had not taken a first step toward removing stimulus. 
""There was also always the chance that once we got a good payrolls number on Friday, the market would take some money off the table and that duly occurred,"" said Neil Mellor, a currency strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. 
""But the fundamentals are still behind the dollar. A lot is priced in but when you have a currency that is outstanding in terms of yield, the sell off was always going to limited.""
By 0840, the dollar had recovered around a third of a cent from lows hit in Asian time to stand flat on the day at $1.0680. The dollar index was marginally higher at 101.26. 
Fed fund futures prices showed investors pricing in more than a 90 percent chance of an increase in U.S. overnight interest rates and the market's attention is now firmly on the scale of tightening further out.
Money market pricing still stops short of three quarter-point rises this year. If the Fed can continue to move every three months, it will deliver four. 
A Reuters poll of 23 primary dealers showed a dozen of them expected the Fed to raise rates to 1.00 to 1.25 percent by its June meeting, while 10 of them expected a rate increase by its September meeting.

""Everyone wants to see the economic projections of FOMC members, to gauge whether they will indeed stick to a path of raising interest rates in both June and September,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo.

The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 115.21 yen, firming to its highest levels since Jan. 27, and up 1 percent for the week. 
""The dollar has risen as U.S. Treasury yields went up this week, but there appears to be some resistance on the upside around the middle of the 115-yen level,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.624 percent in Asian trading on Friday, its highest since Dec. 15, according to Reuters data, and well above Thursday's U.S. close of 2.598 percent as investors factored in a U.S. rate hike. 
The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.0594, but still down 0.3 percent for the week even after comments from European Central Bank head Mario Draghi pulled it off its session lows on Thursday. 
Draghi said the ECB removed a reference to using all available measures to induce growth and inflation ""because the sense of urgency is not there"".
He also said the Governing Council had discussed removing a reference to lowering interest rates in its forward guidance, and had increased its inflation and growth profile for the euro zone next year.
Against the yen, the euro rose 0.4 percent to 122.07, ascending to its highest levels since early February and up 0.8 percent for the week.
Draghi's optimism pressured the pound, which fell as low as $1.2134 overnight, its deepest trough since Jan. 17. It was last slightly lower on the day at $1.2160, down more than 1 percent for the week. 

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.1 percent to 101.90, and was on track to gain 0.4 percent for the week.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 04:20AM ET</span>",Higher yields drive dollar to three-week high vs yen,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a three-week high against the yen on Thursday, on course for a fourth straight day of broader gains after a strong ADP job number in the previous session broke 10-year U.S. government bond yields out of a long-held range. 
As the dollar struggled last week to make more progress on the back of a flip in money markets toward a rise in official U.S. interest rates this month, a number of analysts had pointed to muted moves in 10-year yields as one element holding the currency back. 
It broke above 2.52 percent for the first time this year on Wednesday and was trading at close to 2.58 percent in early trade in Europe on Thursday. That helped the dollar jet half a percent higher to 114.90 yen. 
Citi currency strategist Josh O'Byrne said that expectations of a positive shift in the European Central Bank's rhetoric on the economy ahead of a statement and news conference later on Thursday may also have played a role in those moves. 
""We broke 2.52 percent yesterday, which was the high of the range in recent weeks and certainly there seems to be some more optimism (around the dollar),"" he said. 
""Less dovish expectations on the ECB are helping diminish some of the pressure on long-end yields in the U.S. too and that is having more influence on the dollar against some of the higher yielders and dollar yen.""
The dollar was also marginally higher at $1.0547 per euro and traded above 102 on the index against a basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength.
The European Central Bank is set to keep monetary policy on hold on Thursday as it casts a cautious eye ahead to high-risk elections in the Netherlands and France during an upsurge in populist, anti-establishment sentiment.
But there is growing speculation in markets that improving growth and rising inflation will allow it to begin to withdraw its emergency stimulus for the economy at the end of this year. 
A German banking association said that the bank should begin on Thursday to prepare the ground for an exit from its ultra-loose monetary policy.
Oil- and commodity-linked majors including the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars and the Norwegian crown all hit multi-week lows after supply issues provoked a five-percent slump in oil prices on Wednesday. 
""The Canadian dollar has been a victim of hawkish interest rate expectations in the United States, lower oil prices and a Bank of Canada that has expressed concern over the outlook for the Canadian economy,"" analysts from currencies exchange LMAX said in a morning note.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2017 09:37AM ET</span>",Dollar index hits five-day high after strong U.S. payrolls data,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest level in five days, just below a two-month peak on Wednesday as data on U.S. private sector payrolls rose more than expected for February, increasing investor expectations of an increase to interest rates by the Federal Reserve later this month.
U.S. private employers added 298,000 jobs last month, well above the gain of 190,000 predicted by economists surveyed by Reuters. That pushed the dollar to its highest level since March 3 against a basket of currency rivals.
The euro also fell to a five-day low after the payrolls data and ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank Thursday that market participants expect will see policy kept loose despite rising inflationary pressures. 
While the dollar rose after the data's release, the gains were minimal, given it has already rallied by around 2.5 percent against a basket of major currencies (DXY) over the past five weeks.
""The market certainly got ahead of itself before the (Federal Open Market Committee meeting) next week,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.
Investors have now priced in a chance of around 90 percent of a U.S. interest rate hike this month, up from around a 30 percent chance early last week, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials last week have investors betting that a rate hike next week is essentially a done deal. 
The dollar index (DXY) was last up 0.2 percent at 102.03. The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen  to 114.74 yen, its highest since March 3, hovering just below a nearly one-month high.
There is little expectation that ECB President Mario Draghi will announce changes to the bank's monetary policy at its meeting on Thursday. 
""Draghi’s hands are relatively tied,"" Poppelwell said. ""He cannot be too aggressive or hawkish, despite inflation ticking up towards their desired levels, hence why the euro is basically trading in a tight range.""
However, a Reuters poll last week found economists expect the European central bank could signal a policy shift toward the end of this year or early next year. 

""We’re expecting them to change their assessment around the risks – at the moment they have them to the downside, but we have an out-of-consensus call that they’re likely to say either that downside risks have diminished or become more balanced,"" said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2017 05:30PM ET</span>",Canadian dollar steadies as exports rise; jobs data and Fed eyed,"By Alastair Sharp
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar held its ground against a broadly firmer greenback on Tuesday, as domestic data showed a third consecutive monthly trade surplus in January and investors awaited jobs data that could provide further direction.
The Canadian dollar  settled at C$1.3416 to the greenback, or 74.55 U.S. cents, barely weaker than Monday's close of C$1.3410, or 74.57 U.S. cents.
The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3383, while its weakest was C$1.3436, just one pip under the nearly two-month low the loonie touched on Friday.
""From here, there's a lot on the calendar that can still move dollar/Canada to where we see it going, which is the C$1.40 level by Q2,"" said Eric Theoret, a currency strategist at Scotiabank.
""This week it's the employment picture and then next week the highlight will be the Fed, obviously.""
Investors will be looking for strong U.S. employment growth in a private payroll provider's data on Wednesday and from nonfarm payrolls on Friday to cement the view that the Fed will hike interest rates when it meets next week and pick up the pace of future hikes.
Canadian jobs data is also due on Friday, although the Bank of Canada is broadly seen holding steady on monetary policy despite recent solid economic data.
The C$807 million trade surplus reported on Tuesday slightly exceeded analysts' forecasts of a C$700 million positive balance. Exports rose by 0.5 percent while volumes expanded by 1.0 percent.
""I think it provides some modest encouragement but I think it still leaves the Bank (of Canada) in data watch mode, remaining on the sidelines,"" said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
""Their big concern is the prospect of protectionism emerging from the U.S.,"" he said. ""Certainly, if anything on that front were to emerge, these tentative signs of improvement could get swamped by signs of policy initiative emerging from the U.S.""
Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States and could suffer badly if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through on promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or if a proposed border adjustment tax is implemented.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year (CA2YT=RR) dipped 6 Canadian cents to yield 0.800 percent, and the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) declined 24 Canadian cents to yield 1.738 percent.

The cryptocurrency was down about 1.5% at $1,260 a coin just after 6 a.m. ET before tumbling below $1,160 within 30 minutes. As of 7:12 a.m. ET it was down 5%, or $62, near $1,218 a coin.
While no headlines can be directly tied to the plunge, about two hours earlier a Bloomberg headline cited a People's Bank of China official as suggesting the recent bitcoin regulation wasn't temporary.
The PBOC recently announced it was cracking down on bitcoin trading, and China's largest bitcoin exchanges have since introduced a flat 0.2% fee on each transaction and announced a blockage of withdrawals.
Tuesday's sell-off could also be tied to nervousness over a coming Securities and Exchange Commission ruling. The SEC is expected to issue a ruling on whether it will approve at least one of the three proposed bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds by a Saturday deadline.
The price of bitcoin has rallied 27% in 2017 after gaining 120% in 2016. Bitcoin has been the top-performing currency in each of the past two years.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2017 07:11AM ET</span>","Dollar inches higher, eyes on trade numbers","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, still stuck below highs hit in December and January after two weeks in which expectations for a rise in U.S. interest rates this month have soared.
A fall for sterling to a seven-week low and a yo-yo performance for the Australian dollar after a meeting of the country's Reserve Bank grabbed the most attention in a morning session in Europe marked by minimal moves in major currencies.
The peaking of a year-long surge in metals prices has seen the Aussie fall back and it was the hardest hit of the major currencies in last week's swift move to price in a March rise in Federal Reserve interest rates. 
Against other currencies, however, the U.S. dollar has done less well, failing to break conclusively below $1.05 to the euro or 112 to the yen. 
""If you had told me (two weeks ago) expectations for a March hike would reach almost 100 percent I would have said we would have been well below $1.05,"" said Niels Christensen, a strategist with Nordea in Copenhagen. 
""The disappointment in that move caused more profit-taking on Friday but I don't see the euro moving much higher from here.""
The dollar index (DXY) rose less than 0.1 percent to 101.72 by 1100 GMT (0600 EST), trading broadly flat at 113.92 yen and $1.0576 per euro.   
Against sterling, buffeted by another round of downbeat signals on retail sales and consumer demand, it gained 0.3 percent to trade under $1.22  for the first time since mid-January.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Oliver Harvey said he expected the pound to suffer further in the next month as Britain launches talks with Brussels on its planned departure from the European Union.
""Market tension is starting to pick up again. The politics should be a catalyst, particularly if the negotiations start off on the wrong note,"" he said. 
""People have talked about a bounce back in sterling (since October), but really it has been a story of massive underperformance. It is the only major currency down against the dollar this year."" 
Comments overnight by Trump administration trade adviser Peter Navarro pulled attention back to concerns over the White House's attitude to trade and the dollar as officials prepare for Group of 20 meetings later this month.
Navarro said on Monday that the $65 billion U.S. trade deficit with Germany was ""one of the most difficult"" trade issues, and that bilateral discussions were needed to reduce it outside of European Union restrictions.
He has previously said an undervalued euro gives Germany an edge over its trading partners. 
Trump's policy pledges on domestic spending and taxation are generally thought to point to a stronger dollar but both the president and a number of his officials have indicated dissatisfaction with the current strength of the greenback. 
The U.S. publishes trade balance figures on Tuesday. One surprise during Asian time was a rise in China's currency reserves, which had been expected to fall again sharply in February. 
""Given negative valuation effects this suggests there wasn't any intervention to support the yuan in February,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. ""That helps Asian currencies for now, including the Aussie.""
The Australian dollar, up as much as 0.6 percent in Asian time, was just 0.2 percent higher at $0.7594 by 1117 GMT.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped in European trading on Monday, as investors took profits after the currency's boost last week on the expectation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month.
News earlier in the day of North Korea firing four ballistic missiles, three of which landed in Japanese waters, also pressured the greenback as investors bought into the perceived safe-haven yen . 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday said the U.S. central bank was set to lift its benchmark interest rate this month, provided jobs and inflation data hold up, which markets saw as cementing a hike at the bank's next meeting.
The comments, on the back of a string of hawkish commentary by Federal Reserve officials, saw the dollar slip on Friday as investors took profits from its fourth straight weekly gain against a basket of major currencies (DXY), and it slipped another 0.3 percent on Monday to a one-week low of 101.22. 
""It's a continuation of the price action we had on Friday in the wake of Yellen's speech,"" said  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) currency strategist Valentin Marinov in London, adding that he saw a positive outlook for the dollar over the long term.
""There is some concern in the market that the hike won't be accompanied by more hawkish forward guidance (that would suggest) the Fed would hike three or even four times this year.""
Fed funds futures pricing shows traders see around an 80 percent chance of a rate increase this month, up from just a one-in-three chance early last week, according to CME Group's Fed Watch tool.
Still, speculators reduced bullish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week ending Feb. 28, pushing net longs to their lowest since early October, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday and calculations by Reuters. [IMM/FX]
As risk appetite fell on the news from North Korea, the greenback dipped 0.4 percent against the yen to 113.68 , down from Friday's high of 114.75.
""North Korea is unpredictable, but it fairly frequently conducts missile tests,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.
""One difference now is that it is also hard to predict how President (Donald) Trump will respond to such tests,"" he said.
U.S. political developments also weighed on the dollar. Trump on Saturday accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping him during the 2016 election campaign, an accusation rejected by Obama and a top former intelligence official.
The euro rose to a two-week high of $1.0640 , as investors continued to monitor France's presidential race. 
Scandal-hit conservative candidate Francois Fillon said on Sunday he was staying in the race but left the door open to talks with senior members of his party who are increasingly anxious about his bid.

Latest polls show Alain Juppe, who is more centrist than Fillon, would reach the second round should he replace him as the Republicans candidate.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",What if the euro imploded? Six trade ideas,"By John Geddie and Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Frexit, Grexit or jitters about Quitaly - existential threats to the euro are remote but investors are still looking for clever ways to protect themselves against the risk of a euro dropout.
Pricing in arcane reaches of bond markets and elsewhere shows investors are not taking chances.
Headlines have focused on France, where far-right candidate Marine Le Pen has promised to take France out of the euro zone in the event she surprises and wins the presidential election.
Kokou Agbo Bloua, global head of flow strategy and solutions at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London said there had been a ""huge increase"" from clients in ways to protect against political risk ahead of the French elections. 
There are also renewed worries that the Greek crisis is about to rise up again and that Italy could see anti-euro politicians come to the fore in the next few years.
But traditional havens against such risk -- German bonds or the Swiss franc -- are already expensive, forcing investors to consider more inventive hedging alternatives. Here are a few:
1. Buy bonds linked to French inflation 
A senior bonds trader at one of the world's biggest investment banks said he was advising clients to buy bonds linked to domestic inflation in countries seen at risk of leaving the euro zone.
If a country like France abandoned the euro, its new currency would probably devalue, he said, asking not to be named. That would boost consumer prices and, with that, returns on bonds linked to inflation.
2. Check your CACs and your CDS.
As most French government bonds are governed by national law, redenomination should not trigger a default. However, many investors remain fixated on the details of bond contracts.
Strategists at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) said bonds with collective action clauses (CACs), which require a super-majority of investors to approve any changes to the debt, are in demand. CACs were inserted into all euro zone government bonds from 2013. 
Such bonds have been outperforming others since last autumn, senior rates strategist Kim Liu said.
Similar price performances have appeared in the credit default swaps (CDS) market, where investors buy insurance against a country defaulting on its debt. CDS contracts drawn up since 2014 are seen as more likely to pay out in the event of redenomination than older ones. 
3. Calendar spreads around French elections
One favored strategy is playing calendar spreads in the options market. This involves selling shorter-dated puts expiring in March or April, and buying longer-dated puts expiring in May and June.
A put option gives the option-holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a specified time in the future. The calendar-spread strategy effectively offers the investor protection around the election.
""Clients are doing this on French government bonds, the euro, and in credit,"" , Societe Generale's Agbo Bloua said.
4. Buy euro and Swiss franc volatility
According to think tank World Economics, the euro is 6 percent overvalued for France, so a ""Frexit"" would probably trigger an initial depreciation. 
A favored hedge among currency traders is to buy euro/dollar implied volatility via options protecting them against big price swings around the vote. Three-month implied volatility rose to match its highest levels since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in late February , as demand increased. 
Three-month implied volatility on the euro against the Swiss franc also jumped to its highest levels since Brexit last month , betraying some nervousness that the Swiss National Bank might not be able to prevent the franc from appreciating.
5. Buy Danish crowns
Currency traders are also seeking shelter in less traditional places, with Denmark -- among a handful of countries with a triple-A credit rating, and with a large surplus in its balance of payments -- seen as providing a safe alternative. 
Denmark's central bank was forced last month to defend its currency peg against the euro with the biggest intervention since Brexit, as investors the crown to an eight-month high (EURDKK=D3).[L5N1GF5XN]
6. Buy long-dated puts on bank shares
Since the euro zone debt crisis, shares of the region's banks have become the instruments of choice for equity investors to express a macro view on the broader market.
    Banks in Europe, which account for a much greater proportion of lending activity than their U.S. peers, are closely linked to the economic cycle. Shares are large and liquid enough to trade in and out of easily.
    In both of last year's major political events in Europe -- the Brexit vote and the Italian referendum -- bank stocks were the most heavily traded and most volatile. 

With global equity markets rallying to new highs and measures of volatility near record lows, options are cheaply priced. For investors looking to hedge against break-up risks, writing long-dated puts on euro zone banking shares could provide protection.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar stalled after two days of strong gains on Friday, with nerves around a speech by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen due later in the day adding to factors that have held back a broader rally this year.
A poll showing centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron moving ahead of far-right rival Marine Le Pen in first round voting intentions also further eased nerves around April and May's French presidential elections, prodding the euro higher.
The dollar is up around 1 percent this week, its fourth straight weekly gain on the trot, but a sour January means it is still well below highs hit on the back of optimism about the shape of Donald Trump's presidency in December.
This week's driver has been a swing in market expectations towards a rise in Federal Reserve interest rates on March 15. 
Money markets have gone from giving that a less than 20 percent probability two weeks ago to around 80 percent on Friday - yet the dollar is still short of even last month's highs against the euro and yen.
""The developments are clearly supportive for the US dollar, but it has strengthened only modestly so far,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of global market research with Japan's MUFG in a report listing nine reasons why the greenback was not rising faster.
""One key factor we believe is the fact that the euro is sitting around key technical support levels between $1.0400 and $1.0500 with a number of key events risks on the immediate horizon.""
Speeches from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer on Friday are now widely expected to be the final piece of the puzzle, along with next week's non-farm payrolls. In that time, the market also has next Thursday's European Central Bank meeting to contend with.
Halpenny and others also list nerves ranging from the lack of a substantial rise in longer-term U.S. Treasury yields to worries that Trump will not deliver on promised stimulus and tax reform as holding the dollar back. 
The greenback fell a third of a percent against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength in morning trade in Europe. (DXY)
It fell by more than half a percent against the euro, to $1.0564 , after the new poll and the withdrawal of support of one party for another Macron rival, Francois Fillon.
AUSSIE LOSER
The Australian and New Zealand dollars have been among the biggest losers against their U.S. counterpart, and they were both lower still on Friday, underperforming other major pairs. 
That pointed to some underlying concern both over what more aggressive rises in U.S. interest rates will do to global demand, finances and the Chinese yuan.
""People were not expecting the Fed to move in March, so last month they were putting on more (interest rate) carry trades in these currencies,"" said Bank of Montreal head of European FX strategy Stephen Gallo. ""That is clearly coming off.""
The Aussie was down 0.1 percent on the day at $0.7564 , having touched lows of $0.7543, its weakest since Jan. 31. A more than 1 percent fall for the week is its worst performance since mid-December. The kiwi dollar was also down half a percent at $0.7026.  
After poor Australian trade data on Thursday, some dealers pointed to a 5.5 point fall in the AIG performance of services index to below the 50-point line that points to a contraction.

""The Australian Dollar had been a clear outperformer in 2017 into this week, but could face more headwinds going forward if the Fed actually follows through,"" analysts from London-based currencies exchange LMAX said in a morning note.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 53.3 last month from a reading of 54.5 in January.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to 54.1.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that it was the slowest expansion in business activity since September 2016.
The report also highlighted that there was a softer rise in new work, although business optimism remained strong.
However, input cost inflation reached an eight-and-a-half year high.
“A further slowdown in UK business activity growth in February adds to evidence that the economy has lost momentum after the impressive expansion seen at the end of last year,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Combined with the other PMI surveys from manufacturing and construction, Williamson said the data points to growth of just 0.4% for the first quarter.
“Weaker consumer spending was a key cause of slower service sector growth, suggesting that household budgets are starting to crack under the strain of higher prices and weak wage growth,” this expert explained.
Williamson also noted that the ongoing upturn in costs suggested that inflation could likely breach 3% over the course of the next year.
Regardless, he suggested that the slowdown would give the Bank of England (BoE) ammunition to suggest that additional policy stimulus was needed.
“Policymakers are therefore likely to continue to stress the need to look through any further upturn in inflation and focus instead on the need to keep policy accommodative in the face of a likely further slowing in the pace of economic growth in 2017,” Williamson concluded.
Immediately following the report, the pound weakened. GBP/USD was trading at 1.2229 from around 1.2257 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8607 from 0.8582 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 139.73 compared to 140.11 previously.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 10:50AM ET</span>",Reuters Poll: Trump administration's dollar policy not clear - FX strategists,"By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The Trump administration's dollar policy is not clear, and further near-term strength will depend mainly on the speed of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes, according to a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters.
Since 2017 began, uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's economic policies has whipsawed the dollar, but continued promises of fiscal stimulus, without details, have sent stock markets to set record highs at breakneck speed. 
There has also been widespread confusion over whether the White House prefers a strong dollar, which analysts say is where its proposed policies logically lead. 
""We think the market is getting rather tired of the U.S. administration's flamboyant rhetoric and needs considerable clarity,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of FX strategy at UniCredit.
While on the campaign trail Trump voiced his preference for a weaker exchange rate, new U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a stronger dollar reflected confidence in the government's policies, even though they would probably have a limited impact this year.
""The Trump administration prefers a weak dollar, but its proposed policies - namely, fiscal expansion, limits on imports, and border taxes - will tend to make the dollar stronger,"" said William Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services in Pittsburgh.
That has left more than 80 percent of the poll's more than 60 strategists saying the dollar policy is not clear.
UniCredit's Gkionakis said Trump and Mnuchin had indicated they wanted their tax proposals to pass by August. 
""At some point, President Trump will need to put his money where his mouth is,"" Gkionakis said. ""Without clarity on the size, shape and timing of his 'phenomenal' plans, the market will become impatient, and the USD will see major headwinds.""
After starting the year with its worst performance in three decades, the dollar has retraced some of those losses. It hovered near a seven-week high on Thursday on increasing bets that the Fed is seriously considering raising interest rates this month.
UPSIDE OR DOWNSIDE RISKS?
That was reflected in the consensus in the latest Reuters poll taken over the past week, which showed moderate further gains for the dollar against most major currencies.
Asked about the risks to dollar predictions over the coming year, analysts were nearly split. Twenty-nine of 56 who answered said risks skewed more to the upside, and 27 said they tilted to the downside.
Before the January dollar sell-off, a strong majority of strategists were convinced the risks were more to the upside.
Fed officials over the past few days have suggested rates need to go up sooner rather than later to avoid falling behind the curve on inflation in the face of proposed aggressive economic fiscal stimulus from Trump's administration.
That resulted in a huge swing in market expectations for a March rate hike, from around 30 percent at the start of the week to roughly 70 percent on Thursday.
Several Fed policymakers have also warned that with the economy at a late stage of the recovery cycle, any expansive fiscal policy could result in a faster-than-expected pace of rate increases.
But almost three-fourths of the 59 strategists who answered an extra question said the near-term risks to their dollar predictions were skewed more to the downside if the promised fiscal stimulus is delayed to next year.
Currency speculators have increased outright bullish bets for the U.S. dollar for the first time in seven weeks, at the expense of the euro, according to the latest data.
While economic data suggests the euro zone economy is performing well, the currency has come under pressure in recent weeks.
Concerns that anti-European Union candidate Marine Le Pen could win the French presidential election in May and deliver a fatal blow to the euro project have pushed the single currency lower, as has a growing interest-rate gap between the region and the United States.
The latest Reuters poll consensus is for the euro to drift lower against the dollar to $1.04 in six months. Respondents then expect it to weaken to $1.03 in a year, a fall of almost 2 percent from $1.05 on Thursday.
Data on Thursday showed euro zone inflation rose to 2.0 percent in February, as expected, on higher energy prices, meeting the European Central Bank's target.
But with core inflation still stuck well below the central bank's target and significant risk of political upsets in upcoming elections in key euro zone countries, strategists expect the ECB to remain on the sidelines. [ECB/INT] [ECILT/EU]

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 09:58AM ET</span>",Dollar gains as U.S. March rate hike seen more likely,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained to seven week highs against a basket of currencies on Thursday, after hawkish comments by a Federal Reserve official late on Wednesday encouraged investors to expect a near-term interest rate hike.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard said an improving global economy and a solid U.S. recovery mean it will be ""appropriate soon"" for the Federal Reserve to raise rates, adding an important voice to the chorus of officials signaling rates may rise as soon as mid-March.
Those remarks come after New York Fed President William Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams rattled investors on Tuesday with more aggressive than expected language about raising rates.
""We’ve had this great run of data in the U.S. and the expectation on a March rate move has gone up,” said Steven Englander, global head of foreign exchange strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Futures traders are now pricing in a 78 percent chance of a Fed hike in March, up from 66 percent on Wednesday and from 35 percent on Tuesday, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer are both due to speak on Friday.
The dollar rose 0.38 percent against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) to 102.17, its highest since Jan. 11.
The greenback was last up 0.64 percent against the Japanese yen <JPY=> at 114.43, the highest since Feb. 15 and gained 0.41 percent against the euro <EUR=> to $1.0503.
The dollar has strengthened even as many analysts see limited further gains for the currency due to worries about the impact of higher rates and a stronger dollar on global growth.
High yielding emerging market currencies including the South Korean won , South African rand <ZAR=> and Brazilian real <BRL=> have also performed strongly this year despite the rise in Treasury yields.
Ten-year U.S. bond yields (US10YT=RR) have failed to hold over 2.50 percent for any prolonged period despite weakening dramatically since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November.
A sustained move higher, however, could weigh on emerging market currencies, said Citi’s Englander.

“If the numbers come in strong enough and the Fed comments come in strong enough to break the range, the question would be whether the optimism on emerging currencies would really be justified,” he said.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Czech crown (EURCZK=) could firm up more than 4 percent against the euro in the next 12 months as the central bank is expected to remove its cap on the currency, a Reuters survey showed.
According to a Feb 27-March 1 poll of 47 participants, the crown could become Central Europe's best-performing currency.
As inflation is rising, the Czech central bank could become the first in the region to start to reverse years of loose policy by removing its cap at 27 crowns per euro which it imposed in late 2013 to fend off deflation.
It has pledged to keep that regime in place until the end of March and has said it could remove the cap in mid-2017 as inflation has risen to levels around its 2 percent target.
In the poll, only one out of 21 analysts projected a firmer crown rate than 27 for the end of March.
The bank, which has almost trebled its forex reserves since 2013 by defending the cap, would probably like to get rid of the cap soon, but breaching its commitment would hurt its credibility, analysts said.
For the end of May, 8 out of 21 analysts forecast a firmer than 27 exchange rate.
That may not be the full number of those who expect the cap to disappear by then as the crown, heavily bought in recent months, may not strengthen right after the cap is abandoned.
The most likely date for scrapping the cap is the bank's May 4 meeting when it will also discuss its latest inflation report, said Komercni banka chief economist Jan Vejmelek.
""The risk scenario is for an earlier exit, i.e. in April,"" he said, adding that a rise in core inflation made a later exit unlikely.
For the end of August, almost all poll participants projected a firmer rate than the cap, with a median 26.45 versus the euro.
The consensus projection for the end of February 2018 was 25.9, compared with 25.84 in a poll a month ago. That would represent a 4.3 percent firming compared with Wednesday's close. 
Romania's leu (EURRON=) is expected to gain 1.1 percent and the zloty 0.4 percent on the same horizon, while the forint (EURHUF=) could ease 0.7 percent and the dinar (EURRSD=) 1.1 percent.
Analysts said a likely pick-up in economic growth could help currencies in the region but elections in key euro zone states including France and Germany this year could weigh, while investors watch out for reflation risks in the region.
""We expect that local central banks will start to tighten monetary policy either in 2017 (Czechs and Romania) or in 2018 (Poland and Hungary),"" said Krystian Jaworski, analyst of  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
""This, combined with expected announcement of QE (asset buying) tapering by the ECB in Sept 2017 should contribute to a strengthening (of the region's currencies),"" he added.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>",Poll: Sterling set for slow burn through initial EU divorce proceedings,"By Ross Finley
LONDON (Reuters) - The battered British pound is set for a slow burn lower along with diminished growth prospects once the UK government triggers official proceedings for divorce from the European Union as it is expected to do later this month, a Reuters poll found. 
While the survey forecasts no dramatic fall in the coming months for sterling - already down 17 percent against the dollar and 12 percent against the euro since the June 23 shock vote to leave the EU - there appears to be no hope for recovery, either.
Foreign exchange strategists from more than 60 banks and research institutions are pegging the pound at $1.23 in one month then roughly $1.21 in the three-, six-, and one-year horizons, unchanged from last month's poll. 
Against the euro, sterling is expected to trade between 85 pence and 87 pence at the same period-ends, of course with plenty of scope for volatility in between.
The forecasts suggest order in the pound's deterioration as Britain attempts to disentangle itself from several decades of being an integral part of the EU and then renegotiate a new arrangement with its biggest trading partner.
A sharply increased likelihood of a March Federal Reserve interest rate hike, spurred on by hawkish comments from a flurry of Fed officials over the past week, should also favor the dollar over sterling in coming months. 
""GBP/USD will come under further downward pressure on a Fed interest rate rise as the negative U.S-UK interest rate differentials widen,"" noted Richard Grace, FX analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
""The UK’s large current account deficit virtually ensures this development. Further Brexit developments are forthcoming, which we see as generating foreign direct investment capital outflows from the UK,"" he noted.
Separate Reuters polls of economists are less optimistic than the Bank of England on the prospects for growth this year, saying the tone of negotiations will dictate performance, but a consumer spending slowdown seems imminent.[ECILT/GB]
Stability in the pound would be a good sign for businesses. But it also implies that the initial boost to the economy through cheaper exports is probably over and the effects from higher consumer prices are now kicking in.
There is also little incentive for forecasters to make radical changes to their existing views until there is some sense of how well the EU negotiations will go. That may explain why the outlook remains relatively static in recent months. 
Most experts with experience working directly with or in the EU as well as current EU officials have been consistent in warning that the two years provided under the Article 50 framework will not be enough time to cover everything. 
The government's Article 50 bill is expected to pass through the House of Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, this month. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she intends to trigger those formal divorce proceedings by the end of March. 
But the end-March consensus forecasts imply no change by then to where the pound is trading, around $1.23. 
Analysts at Danske Bank, who say the pound will fall to $1.19 by month-end, said: ""We project a rewidening of the Brexit risk premium embedded into sterling over the coming months.""
The most pessimistic forecast is from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which sees sterling plunging to $1.14 by the end of March. NatWest Markets, on the other extreme, say the pound will rally to $1.29.
Looking on a 12-month horizon, the range of forecasts was wider still, from a low of $1.05 to a high of $1.35, far below the $1.50 the pound was trading at just before the referendum. 
Forecast ranges for euro/sterling were also wide on a 12-month horizon, from a low of 76 pence to the one forecaster seeing parity to the euro. There were no forecasts for the pound to reach parity to the dollar in the next 12 months.

Reuters polls before the referendum vote were accurate in predicting where the pound would go in the event of a vote to leave the EU, correctly forecasting a 9 percent drop in the immediate aftermath.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>","Yuan, rupee outlook sours on Fed interest rate hike bets: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The Chinese yuan and the Indian rupee are expected to weaken, although less than previously thought, reversing recent gains as rising chances of a U.S. interest rate hike this month boost the dollar, a Reuters poll found.
Since the start of the year, most Asian currencies have risen against the dollar, as uncertainty about President Donald Trump's economic policies hurt the greenback.
But the dollar bounced back this week after a few Federal Reserve policymakers raised expectations for a March rate increase.
Fed officials over the past few days suggested that rates need to go up sooner rather than later to avoid falling behind the curve on inflation in the face of proposed economic stimulus from Trump's administration.
That has dented the outlook for emerging market currencies more broadly, according to the latest poll of more than 60 foreign exchange analysts taken over the past week.
The view for a weaker yuan also stands alongside Trump's accusations that Beijing has devalued its currency to gain a trade advantage and as China struggles to stem capital outflows depleting its FX reserves.
The yuan, which has risen almost one percent so far this year, is forecast to weaken to 7.03 by the end of August, and eventually to 7.12 by this time next year - a fall of more than 3 percent from Tuesday's close of 6.88.
While those expectations were less bearish compared with the findings in the previous month's poll, if the 12-month consensus is realized, it would mark the lowest for the yuan in almost a decade - a view held for a few months now.
""With the dollar remaining the key driver of currency markets, the U.S. Fed rate hike profile remains pivotal to the outlook. Looking ahead, we expect CNY to depreciate against USD, albeit only as much as DXY (the dollar index) strengthens,"" wrote Elliot Clarke, senior economist at Westpac.
A separate Reuters poll confirmed trader sentiment toward most emerging Asian currencies worsened, with bets on the Chinese yuan turning slightly bearish, although positioning was still close to being neutral. Bucking the trend was the Indian rupee, with bullish bets increasing to the highest level since January 2015. 
Still, the latest poll showed the rupee, which has gained almost 2 percent this year, was forecast to weaken over 3 percent to 68.84 in a year from 66.72 it was trading on Thursday. 
But that consensus shows analysts are less pessimistic compared with a poll in February as the Reserve Bank of India surprised markets last month by keeping rates on hold.
The central bank also unexpectedly shifted its policy stance to neutral from accommodative, citing a build-up in inflationary pressures and could cap any sharp fall in the rupee.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",Egypt's pound weakens as importers prepare for Ramadan,"By Ehab Farouk
CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound weakened on Wednesday as importers geared up for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and foreign currency inflows into banks declined, bankers and economists said.
Banks were selling the U.S. dollar for between 16.1-16.2 pounds, up from around 15.8 one day earlier. They were buying greenbacks from clients at around 16-16.1 pounds per dollar .
""The pound's weakening today is due to a decline in foreign currency inflows into banks this week and because importers are increasing demand in preparation for Ramadan,"" said Hany Genena, head of research at Beltone Financial in Cairo.
Ramadan, Islam's holy month during which believers abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours, is set to start in May this year and often sees Egyptian families stock up on various food items and other goods.
""Its pre-Ramadan letter of credit opening time. People will start importing now in order for the goods to arrive in two months,"" said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage in Cairo.
That means selling pounds for other currencies.
Egypt's central bank abandoned its currency peg of 8.8 pounds to the U.S. dollar on Nov. 3, hoping to unlock currency inflows and bring back foreign investors who were driven away after the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak.
The float more than halved the pound's value to nearly 20 pounds to the dollar by December. It has since rallied, however, dipping below 16 per dollar in February on the back of lower dollar demand for imports.
Inflows of foreign currency into the banking system picked up last month as foreign investment returned, with Egyptian treasuries seeing a massive rally that was eventually tempered by the stronger pound.
Dollar liquidity may come under renewed pressure however following a central bank directive to allocate greater levels of excess hard currency to companies seeking to repatriate long-held profits.

Bankers said they expected the pound to further weaken after the central bank this week formally settled the dollar debt of small companies who incurred exchange rate losses as a result of the November float, part of a debt-repayment plan announced last month.

The report showed that there was a slight easing in inflationary pressures which had been rising in the wake of the steep drop in sterling following the June Brexit vote.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit its highest in seven weeks on Wednesday as signs from two influential Federal Reserve policymakers that interest rates could rise this month overshadowed President Donald Trump's first major policy speech to Congress. 
New York Fed President William Dudley, a permanent voter on the U.S. central bank's open market committee and close ally of chair Janet Yellen, said that the case for tightening monetary policy ""has become a lot more compelling"".
John Williams, President of the San Francisco Fed, said that a rate increase was very much on the table for serious consideration at the March meeting given full employment and accelerating inflation.
That drove the return for holding dollars on the debt market higher, with 10-year Treasury yields last up around 5 basis points at 2.411 percent. 
Money market futures were now pricing in almost a 70 percent chance of a rise in official interest rates in March, compared to just over 30 percent on Tuesday.
""The comments from other Fed officials this week have added to this relatively hawkish bias in rate markets and given the dollar some support,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategist Mitul Kotecha.
Tuesday's expectations that Trump would give details on stimulus plans that drove stellar gains in the dollar in November were largely disappointed. 
In a speech that contrasted with harsher rhetoric during his election campaign, Trump said he was open to reforming the U.S. immigration system and pledged massive tax relief for the middle class, but did not expand further. 
China's yuan, which has been a target for markets given Trump's previous aggressive talk on trade but which has risen for the past two months as the dollar's rally stalled, was down just 0.2 percent on the day.
The Mexican peso, seen as the most vulnerable to Trump's protectionist policies, also took his speech in stride. It was little changed at 20.066 per dollar.
""Today was 'good Trump' compared to the aggressive 'bad Trump' shown on Twitter,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.

The greenback was last up 0.7 percent at 113.60 yen. It gained 0.3 percent against the euro to $1.0544, generating a roughly half percent rise in the dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of six major peers.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 09:57AM ET</span>",Dollar weaker as investors await details on Trump tax plans,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was slightly weaker against a basket of currencies on Monday as investors worried that a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday would not provide many details on his economic agenda.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that Trump would use the event to preview some elements of his sweeping plans to cut taxes for the middle class, simplify the tax system and make U.S. companies more globally competitive, with lower rates and changes to encourage U.S. manufacturing.
Mnuchin said last week that he wanted to pass “significant” tax legislation by August, which is later than many investors had hoped.
Mnuchin’s comments “seemed to indicate the details of tax reform will be known probably closer to the latter half of the summer, and we can most likely expect 3 percent growth toward the latter end of 2018,” said Bipan Rai, senior macro strategist at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
“Both of those are somewhat at odds with what the market was hoping for in terms of near-term growth and more clarity around tax reform sooner rather than later,” Rai said.
The greenback was last down 0.19 percent against a basket of six major currencies at 100.90. It climbed as high as 103.82 on Jan. 3 as investors bet that Trump would enact policies that accelerate growth and boost inflation. (DXY)
The dollar dropped 0.40 percent against the euro <EUR=> to $1.0603 and was little changed against the yen at 112.23 yen <JPY=>.
The euro also benefited from polls showing that far-right anti-EU leader Marine Le Pen was losing traction in France's presidential race.
French independent candidate Emmanuel Macron would easily beat Le Pen in the second round of the election in May, two opinion polls showed on Sunday.

Sterling slipped to a 12-day low of $1.2382 on a report that Scotland was preparing to call another independence referendum when formal Brexit negotiations are triggered in March.

Meanwhile, Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s February meeting said it may be appropriate to raise rates again ""fairly soon"" if jobs and inflation data continues in line with current expectations.

Data on Friday showed that U.S. new home sales rose 3.7% to an annual rate of 555,000 units last month, falling short of forecasts for a 6.3% increase to a 570,000-unit rate.
The euro ticked lower against the dollar, with EUR/USD down 0.19% to 1.0556. The euro ended the week down 0.6% against the dollar, its third straight weekly decline.
Sterling was also weaker against the dollar, with GBP/USD falling 0.76% to 1.2461.
But the dollar fell to two-week lows against the safe-haven yen amid growing doubts over the likelihood of swift tax reform from the Trump administration.
USD/JPY was down 0.4% to 112.08, the weakest level since February 9 and ended the week 0.67% lower, its second weekly loss.
On Thursday U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he wants to see ""very significant"" tax reform passed before Congress' August recess, but indicated that much work was still needed.
Meanwhile, Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s February meeting said it may be appropriate to raise rates again ""fairly soon"" if jobs and inflation data continues in line with current expectations.
But the minutes also noted uncertainty over a lack of clarity on Trump's economic policies and pointed to the risks to the growth outlook from the stronger dollar.
In the week ahead, global financial markets will focus on Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday for further details on his promises of tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending.
The week is also peppered with a handful of Fed appearances, most importantly Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday.
Investors will also be watching a revised reading of fourth-quarter U.S. growth to gauge the strength of the economy. Private sector survey data from the UK and euro zone inflation data will also be in focus.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2017 06:30AM ET</span>","Bitcoin hits record high above $1,200 on talk of ETF approval","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin jumped to a record high above $1,200 on Friday, as investors speculated the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be issued in the United States is set to receive regulatory approval. 
Traditional financial players have largely shunned the web-based ""crytpocurrency"", viewing it as too volatile, complicated and risky, and doubting its inherent value. 
But bitcoin, invented in 2008, performed better than any other currency in every year since 2010 apart from 2014, when it was the worst-performing currency, and has added almost a quarter to its value so far this year. 
It soared to as high as $1,200 per bitcoin in early Asian trading on Europe's Bitstamp exchange , before easing to about $1,190. http://reut.rs/2lR1Mqk
That put the total value of all bitcoins in circulation -- or the digital currency's ""market cap"", as it is known -- at close to $20 billion, around the same size as Iceland's economy. 
Some analysts say regulatory approval of a bitcoin ETF would make the currency relatively attractive to the often more cautious institutional investor market. [nL8N1G85HI]
But despite potentially high returns, low correlations with other currencies and assets, falling volatility and increasing liquidity, there is scant evidence so far that most major players are considering investing in the digital currency. 
""Bitcoin is just not liquid enough for us to even think about,"" said Paul Lambert, fund manager and head of currency investment at Insight, in London. 
""We manage billions and billions of dollars – we'd need to be able to go into that market and trade in hundreds of millions of dollars at a time, and my sense is it's not like that."" 
Three ETFs that track the value of bitcoin have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for approval. 

The SEC will decide by March 11 whether to approve one filed almost four years ago by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. If approved, it would be the first bitcoin ETF issued and regulated by a U.S. entity.

1363,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2017 04:22AM ET</span>",Bitcoin hits record high on ETF approval speculation,"Investing.com – The bitcoin hit a new record high on Friday on the back of speculation that the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a U.S.-issued ETF on the digital currency, perhaps increasing its attractiveness for institutional investors.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency reached an intraday high of $1,206.60. That pushed the bitcoin past the prior all-time record of $1,165.89 set in November 2013.
It was last up only 0.33% at $1,182.25 by 4:18AM ET (9:18GMT).
On the New York-based itBit exchange, bitcoin inched up by 0.03% to $1,187.82, pulling back from an intraday high of $1,215.93.
Other big exchanges such as Bitfinex, Kraken and BitStamp showed mixed trade in the cryptocurrency.
The digital currency reached record highs on speculation that pointed to the fact that the SEC would approve at least one of the three proposed bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds by an upcoming deadline.
The SEC will decide by March 11 whether to approve one filed almost four years ago by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. If approved, it would be the first bitcoin ETF issued and regulated by a U.S. entity.
Hopes are that the SEC regulation would not only backstop confidence in the digital currency, encouraging institutional investors to place money in the asset, but that those institutions would provide a bit of stability to trades.
According to Reuters, over the past year, bitcoin's biggest daily moves have been about 10% in a mark of extreme volatility when compared to other currencies. 
Prices of the virtual currency are up more than 17% so far this year.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers."
1364,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2017 04:00AM ET</span>",Dollar slips as 'Trumpflation trade' fades,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Friday and was set for its first week of falls in three, after the new U.S. finance chief poured a little cold water on the ""Trumpflation trade"" that had taken the greenback to 14-year highs earlier this year. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that any steps that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration takes on policy would probably have only a limited impact this year, though he wants to see tax reform passed before by August.
The comments -- made in his first televised interviews since taking office last week -- suggested that much work was still needed on key elements of the sweeping tax reform plan, which Mnuchin called his ""No. 1 priority"".
The dollar fell on the comments and was trading down 0.2 percent against a basket of other major currencies on Friday at 100.82 (DXY), leaving it slightly down on the week. 
""Mnuchin's comments were less belligerently reflationary than they could have been, in a dollar strength context, and that probably did much of the damage (to the dollar),"" said UBS Wealth Management currency strategist Geoffrey Yu, in London.
""But ultimately outside of the U.S. there is reflation happening and data is looking strong, so perhaps it’s time to just take some dollar longs off the table... We need additional information to sustain (the 'Trumpflation trade')."" 
The dollar was also knocked earlier in the week after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, which were less hawkish than some investors had expected.
The minutes showed many policymakers felt it was appropriate to raise interest rates again ""fairly soon"", but many saw only a ""modest risk"" that inflation would increase significantly and that the Fed would ""likely have ample time"" to respond if price pressures emerged.
""There seem to be two different camps in the reading of those minutes - whether they introduced a more hawkish tone, or a more dovish tone - and it appears the doves are winning that battle,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer for the private client group at U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana.
The euro was off this week's six-week lows at just above $1.06, lifted by a new alliance between French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron and fellow centrist Francois Bayrou, which helped French 10-year government bond yields to their biggest weekly falls in two months .
Digital currency bitcoin hit a record high of $1,220 in Asian trade on speculation that a bitcoin ETF is set to get approval from the U.S. regulator, before edging back to trade at around $1,170 by 0835 GMT (3:35 a.m. ET) .

LONDON (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin hit its highest levels in more than three years on Thursday and came within $3 of an all-time peak, on speculation that the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set to receive approval from the U.S. financial regulator.
Traditional financial players have largely shunned the web-based ""cryptocurrency"", viewing it as too volatile, complicated and risky, and doubting its inherent value. 
Having already risen about 17 percent this year, it added 3 percent more on the day to hit $1,160 per bitcoin on Europe's Bitstamp exchange, just shy of an all-time high of $1,163 reached in November 2013 . 
Some analysts say regulatory approval of a bitcoin ETF would make the currency relatively attractive to the often more cautious institutional investor market.

The SEC will decide by March 11 whether to approve one filed almost four years ago by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. If approved, it would be the first bitcoin ETF issued and regulated by a U.S. entity.
""If approved this would certainly give a dramatic condoning of bitcoin by the authorities and powers that be,"" digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare CEO, Charles Hayter, said. 
""Perhaps key would be the institutional money which would flow into bitcoin. This would bring a certain amount of stability eventually but could see short-term exuberance by retail traders,"" he said. 
Over the past year, bitcoin's biggest daily moves have been about 10 percent - very volatile compared with traditional currencies, but far lower than the daily swings of up to 40 percent seen in 2013.

Bitcoin climbed 125 percent in 2016, outperforming every other currency, as it did every year since 2010 bar 2014. The S&P 500 stock index rose 9.5 percent last year.

New U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network that any policy steps the Trump administration takes would likely have a limited impact this year and told CNBC that he wanted to see tax reform passed before Congress' August recess.
That was in line with comments by other politicians over the past month, but seemed to some investors to dial back Trump's own recent promises.
""While it remains very difficult to pin down a fixed schedule for Trump tax reforms, it now appears anything phenomenal will now be delayed,"" said Adam Myers, a currency strategist with Commonwealth Bank in London. 
""Such policy drag should, at some stage, open up stock markets to disappointment and limit dollar strength.""
Concerns over the potential risk of a Le Pen victory in France pushed the euro lower against currencies other than the dollar, including the yen, said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.
The euro was higher against the dollar, despite a poll showing Le Pen was only 10 points behind conservative Francois Fillon but 22 points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron in the potential second-round run-offs.. 
Wednesday's Fed minutes, which showed that there was less urgency among voting members to raise interest rates, also kept the dollar depressed against its major rivals. 
""People were expecting slightly more hawkish minutes yesterday,"" Scalone of TJM Brokerage said. 
Fed funds futures on Thursday implied traders saw just a 22.1 percent probability that the Fed would hike rates in March, up from Wednesday's 17.7 percent probability but still low, data from CME Group's FedWatch showed. 

The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.2 percent at 101.020.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 04:25AM ET</span>","Political noise, Fed pushes euro below $1.05","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell briefly below $1.05 for the first time in six weeks on Wednesday, hit by a combination of concern over France's presidential election campaign and growing expectations for a rise in U.S. interest rates. 
So far, concern that anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen could win in May and deliver a fatal blow to the euro project have played out chiefly on the options market, where investors pay less to bet on the currency falling. 
Three-month risk reversals - the weight of bets against the euro over bets on its strengthening - hit their most negative in more than a year, surpassing levels seen after Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year. 
Implied volatility for the next three months, which allows investors to protect themselves from swings in the currency - or bet on such volatility - rose to the highest since mid-December. 
Those moves are also beginning to seep into spot prices of the euro, which are down around 2 percent in the last three weeks and fell as low as $1.0497 in morning trade in Europe. 
""This is politics as well as markets increasingly betting on an imminent rate hike by the Fed,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Thu Lan Nguyen.
""Volatility is rising as investors start to prepare for the elections. I think investors are going to play this (the elections) on the options market. If you go short euro and you are wrong, it is too directional.""
The dollar was stronger for the second day running, gaining around a third of a percent against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. (DXY)
But it dipped around a third of a percent against the yen, which tends to benefit when investors grow more worried about global political risks.  
Against sterling, the dollar gained 0.1 percent to $1.2466.  
U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes due later on Wednesday could either reinforce or undermine recent hawkish comments from central bank policy makers that have raised bets on a rise in rates as early as next month. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said late on Monday in a speech in Singapore that she would be comfortable raising rates at this point if the economy maintained its current performance.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker also told reporters on Monday that he would support a rate increase at a mid-March policy meeting as long as inflation, output and other data continued to show the U.S. economy is growing. 
""The dollar was pushed up by the Fed talk, but its upside (was) heavy in the Asian session, due to factors including Japanese companies' seasonal repatriation,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 
""We're all waiting for the minutes, to see if members talked about reducing the Fed's balance sheet,"" he said.

""The market is concerned that they’re all going to have the same tone, which is mildly more hawkish than the February statement,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Ltd in New York.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2017 04:42AM ET</span>","Risk-on mood, signs from French left prod euro higher","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro recovered some ground against the dollar on Monday after weekend talks aimed at finding a leftist unity candidate for France's presidential election showed little sign of progress.
News that Socialist Benoit Hamon and hard-left rival Jean-Luc Melanchon were discussing cooperation in their bid for the presidency weakened the euro and supported the yen on Friday.
Investors believe such a tie-up could either backfire and propel far-right, anti-globalization candidate Marine Le Pen into the Elysee palace or succeed and land France with a far-left president pursuing deficit-boosting economic policies. 
But policy proposals outlined by Melanchon on Sunday underscored the gap he would have to bridge with Hamon to find a common platform for the April and May polls also helped boost the euro.
""If they did unite then any outcome would be a bad outcome from the market's point of view,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London. 
""It was what caused the risk-off move on Friday, although the interesting thing was it seemed to play out more on dollar-yen than the euro. In general the market does seem very nervous.""
The common currency rose around 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent respectively against the dollar and yen in early trade in Europe  (EURJPY=) while the dollar also rose 0.1 percent to 113.08 yen, having given back some of its overnight gains. 
The start of 2017 on currency markets has been dominated by disappointment with U.S. President Donald Trump's early fiscal and tax policies, turning back a reflation trade on the dollar that had bet on swift moves to encourage repatriation of capital to the United States and boost spending. 
Millennium's Benson said Trump's State of the Union speech in 10 days time might be crucial for those trades. 
Trade on Monday will be cooled by the absence of U.S. markets for the Presidents Day holiday. 
The opening in Europe saw equity markets rise, pointing to a broadly more positive mood globally after a solid Asian session. That tends to benefit several of the major currencies at the expense of ""safe havens"" like the yen and Swiss franc. 
""After last week's robust performance from the S&P index, Asian equities are modestly higher, commodity prices mostly knocking around at the higher end of ranges and in FX, that translates into a yield-hunting market,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analyst Kit Juckes. ""The yen is the obvious loser.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Falls for the euro and the pound dominated trade in the major global currencies on Friday, hit by a combination of nerves over upcoming French elections and signs British consumers are beginning to struggle in the face of the Brexit effect. 
A week of trading dominated by fairly tight ranges and discussion of the outlook for U.S. inflation and interest rates looked set to end with the sixth loss in eight weeks for the dollar, quelling hopes of a new rally in the greenback.
But it was a report that suggested the French left could unite behind one candidate in presidential elections, possibly knocking centrist and right-leaning nominees out of the race in the first round, that grabbed the attention in the European morning.
The yen -- investors' favored safe haven for capital in times of global and political uncertainty -- rose 0.4 percent against the dollar  and 0.6 percent against the euro (EURJPY=) on the day. 
The euro dipped around a quarter of a percent to $1.0648.
""It seems like a broader, but fairly small, risk-off move,"" said Josh O'Byrne. 
""We saw the odds for a Le Pen victory move a bit higher this morning. That seemed to drive a bit of weakness in (bond prices in the euro zone) periphery as well.""
Sterling meanwhile hit a 10-day low against the euro after a surprise third monthly fall running in British retail sales pointed to weakening consumer sentiment as the government gets ready to launch talks on leaving the European Union.
Shoppers have driven a relatively robust performance for Britain's economy since last June's Brexit vote but sales volumes fell 0.3 percent month-on-month in January - much weaker than forecasts for a 0.9 percent increase.
Those were just the latest signs of fatigue among households facing the impact of a 20 percent fall in the value of sterling and rising fuel prices.
""Retail was the beating heart of the UK economy in 2016, so with consumer spending expected to slide in the coming months we could see the pound push lower against both the euro and the dollar,"" said Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at broker Xtrade.
U.S. government bond yields, rising steadily over the past 10 days, hit a wall on Wednesday and barring a broader revival in U.S. time, the dollar index was on course for another small weekly fall. (DXY)
Many banks still expect the greenback to make more progress in the months ahead, but the signals on policy emerging from Washington have not engendered further confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to reflate the U.S. economy.
A combative presidential news conference on Thursday followed the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn this week and had analysts again wondering how effective the administration will be in pushing through its legislative agenda.
""Despite the relatively strong data we have seen, the dollar is not doing better and I think that is that moderation of expectations on Trump,"" Citi's O'Byrne said. 
""Yesterday’s news conference perhaps was also an additional factor moderating that Trump theme.""

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2017 04:20AM ET</span>",Dollar knocked back after 11 days of gains,"By Yumna Mohamed
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar broke an 11-day winning streak on Thursday, falling back against the euro, yen and the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength after hitting its highest in a month a day earlier. 
Analysts pointed to a mixture of unexpected drops in U.S. industrial output and home builder sentiment on Wednesday and a retreat of U.S. treasury yields from recent highs as possible drivers of the dollar fall. 
That all ran counter to signals from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, and a strong rise in January inflation numbers, which spoke for a rise in U.S. interest rates within months.
""Because the market is very reluctant to price more Fed tightening for this year and next, nominal yields are not rising as fast as inflation expectations are and therefore U.S. real yields have not moved in the dollar's favor in spite of the better data,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategist Sam Lynton-Brown said.
The dollar index was down 0.4 percent (DXY) in early European trade, falling to 100.81 from a peak of 101.76 on Wednesday after the better-than-expected U.S. inflation numbers and retail sales data. 
Traders price in a 31 percent chance of a rate increase at the Fed's March meeting, up from 13 percent on Monday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
Yellen hinted on Tuesday that more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two percent goal.
Meanwhile, New York Fed President William Dudley on Wednesday reinforced the central bank's cautious optimism that President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress would not derail plans for gradual rate hikes in the months and years ahead.
Expectations Trump would deliver tax reforms and rises in infrastructure spending that would reflate the U.S. economy and spur the Fed to more action were at the heart of a surge for the dollar in the month after his election on Nov. 8. 
But the dollar has struggled since, due at least in part to concerns over Trump's protectionist views and signs he may favor a weaker currency. 
""We don’t have much choice but to wait and see what details on trade, tax and fiscal policy the new government will provide and to then try and evaluate the possible consequences and the Fed’s reaction,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note.
Markets will get another chance to check the U.S. economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
The dollar came off a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 <JPY=> marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down almost half a percent at 113.66 yen.
The euro edged up over 0.3 percent at $1.0632, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 <EUR=> touched on Wednesday.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2017 10:40PM ET</span>",Dollar hovers near 3-1/2-week high after Yellen testimony,"By Yuzuha Oka
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held gains near a 3-1/2-week high on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes.
Yellen told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee the central bank will likely need to raise interest rates at one of its upcoming meetings, although she expressed caution amid considerable uncertainty over economic policies under President Donald Trump's administration.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against its six major peers, was last up 0.1 percent at 101.26. The index rose to 101.38 on Tuesday following Yellen's remarks, the highest since Jan. 20.
""Investors didn't expect Yellen to be that hawkish, so the dollar gained,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
""There are no big factors preventing the Fed from raising rates in March. Unless the emerging markets become volatile or the U.S. economic data shows weakness, the March rate hike is highly plausible,"" Sera added.
U.S. interest rates futures   implied traders saw about a 20 percent chance of three rate increases in 2017, up from less than 10 percent on Monday. 
Since the end of the 2007-09 recession, the Fed has raised rates once in December 2015 and again in December of last year. 
President Trump has announced a rollback of financial regulation though details remain scarce, and markets are yet to get clarity on the size and scope of the tax cuts he has promised. 
""Changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook,"" said Yellen, underscoring the uncertainty over economic policy.
Yellen is scheduled to appear before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee later on Wednesday.
""Yellen doesn't seem to have changed her stance on rate hikes. Bids on a March rate hike still remains to be a minority,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
""The dollar/yen was weak last week, so investors bought back the dollar on Yellen's comments,"" Murata said.
The dollar was fetching 114.32 yen , not far from the two-week peak of 114.49 yen touched on Tuesday. The dollar recovered from a 10-week trough of 111.59 touched last week.
The euro was last down 0.1 percent at $1.0572, wallowing near a one-month low of $1.0559 plumbed on Tuesday amid political risk and disappointing regional economic data.
The euro has come under pressure from concerns about France's presidential election and Greek bailout talks. Polls showed National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who has promised to pull France out of the euro zone and hold a referendum on European Union membership, is leading in the first round of the French presidential runoff.
Greece was aiming to conclude the drawn-out review of the country's international bailout on Feb. 20 to coincide with a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. 
However, Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Tuesday that Greece and its international lenders are not expected to reach agreement by next Monday, noting ""the IMF must also be on board"".
Talks between Athens, its European Union lenders and the International Monetary Fund over labor and energy reforms, fiscal targets and debt relief have dragged on for months, rekindling fears of a new crisis in the single-currency bloc.
Investors are eyeing a batch of U.S. economic data due out later on Wednesday, including consumer price index (CPI) and retail sales, for any fresh catalysts.

The CPI is expected to have risen 0.3 percent in January after a similar gain in December, while retail sales are likely to have risen 0.1 percent in January after advancing 0.6 percent the previous month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a three-week peak against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as investors raised their outlook on a faster pace of U.S. rate increases following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.
Yellen's remarks reinforced recent remarks from other Fed policy-makers who like to see a faster adjustment to rates seen appropriate at this point of the economic expansion.
""The tone is overall more hawkish than what the market had expected. The market seems to be under-pricing an upcoming rate hike,"" said Omer Eisner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc in Washington.
U.S. interest rates futures  implied traders saw about a 43 percent chance of at least three rate increases in 2017, up from 33 percent on Monday, CME Group's FedWatch program showed.
""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, the first of her two-day testimony before Congress.
Yellen is scheduled to appear before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Wednesday. 
In overnight trading, the dollar index (DXY) slipped after U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn quit in a controversy relating to Russia.
Flynn's resignation raised worries about the Trump administration's ability to implement its economic policies, including planned tax cuts, which have been seen as bullish for the greenback and stocks.
The gauge of the greenback versus six major currencies (DXY) pared its initial losses after data showed U.S. producer prices posted the largest monthly rise in more than four years in January, supporting the view that domestic inflation is approaching the Fed's 2 percent goal.
The dollar index reached a three-week high at 101.38, reversing from a earlier drop to 100.90. It was last at 0.35 percent at 101.32.
The greenback hit a two-week peak of 114.47 yen , erasing an earlier decline against the Japanese currency. It was last up 0.6 percent at 114.42 yen. 
The euro fell 0.3 percent against the greenback  at $1.0567 amid political risk and disappointing regional economic data.
The euro has come under pressure from concerns about France's presidential election and Greek bailout talks.
Investors have grown jittery about a possible repeat of Brexit as polls showed National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who has promised to pull France out of the euro zone and hold a referendum on European Union membership, is leading in the first-round of the French presidential runoff.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2017 11:27AM ET</span>",Dollar index hits three-week high on hopes of U.S. tax cuts,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a near three-week high against a basket of currencies on Monday, lifted by hopes of U.S. tax cuts to stoke corporate profits and investments as well as bets on whether the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more quickly.
The greenback last week booked its strongest gain since mid-December after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday promised a ""phenomenal"" tax plan that the White House said would include tax cuts for businesses and individuals. 
Investors hope that signals that the focus of day-to-day remarks by Trump and his aides is shifting away from trade protectionism and security, and toward economic growth. 
""People seemed to be more comfortable with the fiscal policy outlook. It's been friendly for stocks and also for the dollar,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd in New York.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other currencies, reached 101.07, its strongest level since Jan. 20. It was last up 0.2 percent at 101.04. (DXY) 
The dollar advanced to a two-week peak against the yen following reports that Trump did not even discuss the currency or its strength during weekend talks with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. It was last up 0.7 percent at 113.94 yen .
The outcome of their meeting was an affirmation for Japan in the face of challenges such as China's maritime expansion and North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development.
Investors are also focused on testimony by Fed Chair Janet Yellen before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday in the wake of hints from other policy-makers who are leaning toward more hikes in interest rates this year than the two currently priced in by markets prompted by signs of looser fiscal policies.
""Markets are pricing only a 22 percent probability of a March Fed move, the question is whether she wants to nudge it closer to 50 percent,"" said Nick Parsons, head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank in London.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank's policy-setting group, will meet on March 14-15. [FED/DIARY]

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2017 11:23AM ET</span>","Dollar jumps on hopes for Trump-Abe meeting, U.S. tax reform","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Friday on expectations of a constructive meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while Trump's comments on tax reform Thursday continued to support the greenback.
Expectations that Abe could signal increased Japanese investment in the United States underpinned optimism surrounding the meeting between the two leaders, while Trump's promise on Thursday of a ""phenomenal"" tax reform plan over the next two or three weeks continued to support the dollar against most of its major rivals.
The euro touched $1.0608 <EUR=>, its lowest level against the dollar since Jan. 19, while the dollar touched 113.85 yen <JPY=>, its highest against the Japanese currency since Feb. 1.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose as much as 0.3 percent to an 11-day high of 101.010. The index later pared gains and was last up about 0.2 percent at 100.880.
While Trump may discuss his concerns over a strong dollar with his Japanese counterpart, it is expected that whatever is said publicly after the meeting will focus on trade and investment deals.
There was little expectation Trump would reiterate his recent accusation that Japan was one of several countries devaluing their currencies to the disadvantage of the United States.
""It looks as if Abe is coming in determined to maintain the U.S.-Japan relationship,"" said Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at CitiFX in New York. ""It would be a big surprise if Trump were to complain about dollar/yen.""
Trump's tax promise on Thursday, made during a White House meeting with airline executives, continued to calm some of the nerves that have dominated currency markets for weeks and put the focus back on Trump's efforts to boost economic growth. That reinvigorated dollar bulls.
""This was seen as a pivot back to the economic agenda,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York, in reference to Trump's statement on tax reform. ""Today is a continuation of that move.""
Dealers also said Trump's backing down on surprise early criticisms of China's ""One China"" policy helped boost risk appetite globally.

The dollar hit its lowest level against the Russian rouble since late July 2015 of 58.4486 rubles <RUB=>. Englander of CitiFX said gains in oil prices on Friday boosted the rouble given Russia's role as a crude exporter.

In late January, Trump and trade adviser Peter Navarro had criticized Germany, Japan and China, saying the three key U.S. trading partners were engaged in devaluing their currencies to U.S. disadvantage. (Full Story)
Asian currencies have also been supported by the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not be in a rush to raise interest rates.
U.S. jobs data released last week had shown disappointing wage growth, bolstering expectations that the Fed would wait until the second quarter to raise interest rates. (Full Story) (Full Story)
Market positioning in the Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS turned marginally bullish. It was the first time investors were estimated to be long the yuan since mid-August, though the change was marginal.
Signs of improved sentiment toward the yuan came even after data showed that China's foreign exchange reserves fell below the closely watched $3 trillion level in January for the first time in nearly six years. (Full Story)
The poll of 20 market participants, including analysts, traders and fund managers, showed that long positions in most Asian currencies increased compared to two weeks ago.
Bullish bets on the South Korean won KRW=KFTC, Taiwan dollar TWD=TP, Indian rupee INR=D2 and Thai baht THB=TH all rose to the highest levels since mid-August.
Bullish bets on the Indonesian rupiah IDR= also increased compared to two weeks ago and reached the highest level since late September.
Bucking the broader trend, investors were estimated to have slightly increased bearish bets against the Malaysian ringgit MYR= and the Philippine peso PHP=PDSP.
The very marginal bearish bets against the Singapore dollar SGD=D3 also increased a tad.
The poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar SGD=D3, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso PHP=PDSP, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2017 03:09PM ET</span>",Dollar gains broadly after Trump says to announce major tax plan,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose across the board on Thursday, posting its best one-day gain against the yen in three weeks, after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that he would make a major announcement on a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next few weeks.
The greenback advanced against the euro in three of the four last sessions, as well as climbing to more than one-week highs versus the Swiss franc. Gains were boosted by Thursday's upbeat U.S. economic data.
Investors have been waiting impatiently for details on Trump's campaign trail pledges to inject the U.S. economy with large-scale fiscal stimulus through additional spending and tax cuts.
In a meeting with airline executives, Trump said on Thursday his administration will announce ""something phenomenal in terms of tax"" but offered no details. 
""It's been a broad-based dollar rally driven by the headlines that Trump plans to announce something phenomenal on taxes in the next few weeks, in his words,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of BK Asset Management in New York. 
""That was really the crux of the dollar rally shortly after his election and I think investors are getting really excited about that again.""
The dollar (DXY) gained more than 5 percent against a basket of major currencies in the month and a half after Trump's election but has been on a downtrend this year as Trump has focused more on trade and immigration than fiscal stimulus. 
His cabinet picks also have drawn stiff opposition and his travel ban for refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries was met with large protests around the world.
That gave investors pause as many worried his fiscal agenda would take a back seat or face more stringent opposition in Congress. But Thursday's announcement helped push the dollar back on an upward track.
In afternoon trading, the dollar rose 1.2 percent against the yen to 113.27 , after hitting a high of 113.29, its strongest level since Feb. 3.
The greenback was also bolstered by U.S. data showing initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week to a near 43-year low, while inventories at wholesalers surged in December for a second straight month.
The dollar index gained 0.4 percent to 100.64 (DXY), with the greenback rising 0.6 percent to 1.0012 Swiss francs .
The New Zealand dollar  suffered major losses, falling more than 1 percent after its central bank signaled that any rate tightening might be at least two years away.

The euro  also dipped against the dollar, down 0.4 percent at $1.0656 with political risks, most notably France's upcoming election, nudging it toward its worst week in nearly two months.

1485,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 08, 2017 05:18AM ET</span>",Bitcoin slumps 2% as China holds closed-door meetings with exchanges ,"Investing.com - Prices of web-based digital currency Bitcoin slumped on Wednesday, as reports that China’s central bank was calling in several of the country’s exchanges for closed door meetings.
Officials from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will meet Wednesday afternoon with representatives of bitcoin exchange platforms, according to people familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg.
The report increased worries that the PBOC will heighten regulation of digital currencies and Bloomberg sources suggested that money laundering was one of the topics for discussion.
Bitcoin fell by 1.77% to $1,033.50 by 5:02AM (10:02GMT) on the New York-based itBit exchange, pulling back from an intraday low of $1,020.50 hit after the news hit the wires.
Other big exchanges such as Bitfinex, Kraken and BitStamp also showed the cryptocurrency falling by a similar amount.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency dropped 2.00%, to $1,031.53.
Elsewhere, yuan-denominated Bitcoin prices on Shanghai-based BTC China lost 1.84% to ¥7,275.00 (approximately $1,058).
Bitcoin prices jumped Tuesday to $1,070, their highest level since January 4, after China's forex reserves dropped below $3 trillion for the first time since February 2011.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.
However, Chinese authorities have reportedly begun considering heightened regulation of the bitcoin market as its citizens have become principal players in the digital currency as they hunt for alternative assets.
Bitcoin, the value of which more than doubled in 2016, was one of the best investments of the year and the best-performing currency, which experts often attribute to the fear of capital controls in China.
The PBOC warned investors on January 6 to take a rational approach to investment in the cryptocurrency that had shown “abnormal fluctuations”.
Coming after a 20% crash on January 5, the central bank cautioned against potential risks in platform operations and asked them to carry out ""self-inspection"" according to the law."
1486,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2017 04:38AM ET</span>","Political risks weigh on euro, yen gains","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell another third of a percent against the dollar on Wednesday, as concerns around a resurgence in political risk to the single currency project drove its worst run of daily losses in almost two months. 
The yen, however, was up another quarter of a percent at 112.12 per dollar, a move towards the perceived security of Japan pointing to the growth in concerns around global political risks and the Trump presidency that has dominated recent days.
The dollar was wobbling at the start of this week, a low wages number having quashed bets on a rise in U.S. interest rates in March and cooled expectations for the scale of monetary tightening this year. 
Concerns over the impact on the world economy of President Trump's protectionism and immigration policy have also weighed on the greenback, along with the new administration's hints that it would prefer a weaker dollar. 
Over the last two days, however, that has all played second fiddle to France's presidential election race and question marks over further international financial support for Greece. The dollar index had its best day in a month on Tuesday and it was up another 0.3 percent in early deals in Europe on Wednesday.
""The French political noise has brought the euro down and that has given the dollar a reprieve,"" said Gavin Friend, a strategist with National Australia Bank in London.
""Markets know that if Trump was to come out and start talking about tax reform and infrastructure spending, the dollar would go up. The dollar rose a long way at the end of last year, it has come back, now we are sitting around waiting for the next steer.""
Having fallen as low as $1.0643 in Asian time, the euro traded 0.2 percent lower on the day at $1.0660  by 0850 GMT.
Uncertainty about the two rounds of the French presidential election on April 23 and May 7 drove the premium that investors demand for holding French over German government debt to its highest in more than four years.
Centrist Emmanuel Macron was forced on Tuesday to deny an extramarital affair and conservative Francois Fillon pressed on with efforts to salvage his reputation after accusations that he used taxpayers' money to pay his wife for work that she may not have done.
Opinion polls show Macron slightly ahead of Fillon in the first round, but behind far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who has vowed to pull France out of the euro zone and hold a vote on its membership in the European Union.
Against the yen, the euro lost half a percent to 119.48, its lowest since Dec. 5.
Both the dollar and yen have drawn some support from a return of nerves around China's yuan following the new year holiday. Beijing's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below the $3-trillion level last month for the first time in nearly six years. 
""After the difficult first few weeks of the year, we see more strength for the dollar coming through,"" said Alessio de Longis, a portfolio manager and macro strategist with Oppenheimer Funds in New York. 

""My goal would still be the euro approaching parity over the course of this year.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a more than one-week high on Tuesday as it gained for a fifth straight session, bolstered by technical buying after recent losses as well as political uncertainty in Europe with a slew of elections this year.
The greenback posted its best one-day gain since mid-January, rising at the expense of the euro, which has struggled on renewed worries about Greece's debt problems and signs that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen is gaining momentum before France's presidential election. 
""The dollar is benefiting from mounting political uncertainty ahead of a number of crucial elections in the euro zone and from buying by bargain hunters, looking to pick up the greenback following its worst start to the year in 30 years,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2017 09:55AM ET</span>","Trump's policies to drive FX, but strong dollar here to stay: Reuters Poll","By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The dollar will resume its upward climb in the coming year, but extreme near-term moves in either direction are possible, driven more by U.S. President Donald Trump's expected fiscal stimulus than by his words, a Reuters poll found.
After mostly gaining over the past three years, the dollar hit a wall in January, marking its biggest losses in three decades on concerns about the Trump administration's preference for a weak dollar and a radical policy on immigration.
In 2016, the dollar was down less than one percent until the U.S. election on Nov. 8. It then reversed course to end the year over 4 percent higher, something FX strategists polled by Reuters had not predicted before the vote.
Instead, they had said the dollar was likely to fall in the immediate aftermath if Trump were to win.
So far this year, concern over Trump's attitude to the dollar and global trade has pushed the currency down over 2 percent and pushed Treasury yields lower.
Speculators also cut bets in favor of the dollar for the fourth straight week. Net long positions fell to their lowest since last October, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters showed. 
Still, the latest poll of over 60 FX strategists, taken Feb 3-6, showed the bias was towards a stronger dollar over the coming year once the fog clears around the White House's tax and spending plans.
Six of the top 10 most accurate forecasters in Reuters polls last year are still forecasting broad dollar gains.
The dollar will also be aided from a divergence in monetary policy between the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is set to raise rates this year, and other major central banks, which are expected to keep rates low.
""The policy of the incoming U.S. administration, both actual and expected, are consistent with the U.S. dollar strength,"" said Erik Nelson at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), the most accurate FX forecaster in Reuters polls on major currencies last year.
""Fiscal easing, whether that comes in the form of increased spending or reduced taxes, is going to represent a pretty stark shift from the more austere fiscal conditions we have seen over the past couple of years. So a mix of policies - both monetary and fiscal - surely are consistent with U.S. dollar gains.""
Around 70 percent of the strategists, who answered an extra question, said Trump's policies would drive currency markets over the next two months.
Among those who chose Trump's policies, a slim majority said his protectionist policies could weigh on forex trades. The rest cited Trump's fiscal stimulus plan.
TRUMP TO TRUMP EURO ZONE POLITICS
Only a few strategists picked a potential upset in euro zone national elections as the big driver of currencies. But jitters before the coming French presidential election pushed the euro to a one-week low against a broadly weaker dollar on Monday.
The latest consensus is for the single currency, which is up around 2 percent this year, to weaken nearly 3 percent against the dollar to $1.04 in a year from $1.07 on Tuesday.
That median 12-month forecast matches January's which was the lowest since the February 2016 poll. Back then ,the Fed was widely expected to tighten further after taking rates higher in December 2015 for the first time in nearly a decade.
But those bearish views dissipated as expectations on the timing of Fed rate hikes see-sawed through the rest of the year. 
Now, a bullish dollar view is driving strategists to once again predict euro weakness.
""It is all about the USD and about President Trump's policies,"" wrote Athanasios Vamvakidis, FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). ""We continue to expect EUR/USD to weaken. Focusing on Europe, the elections in France and Germany, and potentially early elections in Italy, suggest substantial EUR risks.""
However, the proportion of strategists calling for euro/dollar parity or lower is little changed compared with last month.
Sterling is also forecast to resume falling, having gained around 1.5 percent this year, once Britain begins talks on leaving the European Union. [GBP/POLL]
When asked which currency will gain from market uncertainty over the next three months, a majority of strategists chose the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, both usually considered a safe bet when markets are in turmoil.
After around a 3 percent loss in 2016, the dollar fell against the yen to its lowest since late November on Tuesday, down about 4 percent so far this year. Yen short positions also declined to their lowest since early December.
Still, FX analysts are clinging to their favored bet - a weaker yen outlook, and the Japanese currency is now forecast to weaken about 7 percent to around 120.0 in a year from Tuesday.

Bitcoin rose 2.5 percent to as high as $1,050 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since Jan. 5.
Bitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to anyone wanting to get around capital controls, such as China's. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.
In recent months, bitcoin and the yuan have frequently traded in an inverse relationship. It has also occasionally traded in line with safe-have assets such as gold and top-rated government debt.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Emerging market FX to slip once Trump economic plans are clearer: Reuters poll,"By Vuyani Ndaba and Silvio Cascione
JOHANNESBURG/BRASILIA (Reuters) - The latest rally in emerging market currencies is unlikely to last long, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, with recent gains expected to be curtailed as soon as the economic policies of U.S. President Donald Trump become clearer.
Sentiment has been buoyant since Trump's arrival in the White House last month on hopes that a fresh round of economic stimulus will boost commodities prices and help sustain economic growth, even as trade barriers appear.
But currencies such as the Brazilian real, the Russian rouble and South Africa's rand are nevertheless set to give up gains over the next six months, according to the median forecasts of strategists in the poll taken Feb 2-6.
In six months, the real is expected to lose almost 6 percent to 3.29 per dollar, while the rand is forecast to give up 7 percent to 14.25. Russia's rouble is set to shed 3 percent to 60.90 per greenback, supported by rising oil prices.
Trump has kicked off his first few days in office mostly focusing on foreign policy and immigration and markets are awaiting more detail on his economic policies.
""We are not really seeing any dramatic shift in policy yet from the U.S. that impacts emerging markets in a negative way,"" said Peter Attard Montalto, an economist at Nomura in London.
""But that should come through (in) the next couple of months when we get the U.S. budget coming together.""
With the U.S. economy already bumping up against full employment, Trump's promises on fiscal stimulus and tax reform could quickly spur higher inflation as would imposing tariffs on Mexican imports.
Most Fed officials see three rate hikes this year, a pace considerably faster than in 2016 and 2015. Higher U.S. interest rates usually weaken emerging currencies against the dollar.
João Pedro Resende, an economist with São Paulo-based bank Itaú Unibanco, also mentioned upcoming elections in Europe as a potentially risky event for emerging currencies in general, especially in France, where candidate Marine Le Pen promises to leave the currency union. The first-round vote will be in April.
Even the Mexican peso has gained in recent weeks, bouncing off record lows after it was bruised by Trump's rhetoric on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he has threatened to ditch, and his promises of building a wall funded by a hefty border tax.
With most strategists betting that Mexico will fend off a credit rating downgrade in 2017, the peso is expected to stay stronger than its record low of 22 per dollar despite some losses projected for the next 12 months, the poll showed, with chances of a short squeeze soon.
The lira <TRYTOM=D3>, already one of the worst performing emerging market currencies this year, is expected to see more pain ahead, with strategists putting it at 3.88 in the next 12 months, from 3.67 now.
The lira is down around 4 percent this year, adding to double-digit declines last year and the year before. It has been hit by concerns about a slowing economy, political uncertainty, and the central bank's ability to tame inflation given that President Tayyip Erdogan is opposed to higher interest rates.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2017 01:40AM ET</span>",Yuan to fall as outflows overshadow Trump FX rhetoric: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - China's currency is expected to fall to a near decade-low in the year ahead, according to a Reuters poll of FX strategists, as authorities struggle to stem capital outflows and despite the central bank's surprise short-term interest rate hikes.
The bearish views on the yuan come against U.S. President Donald Trump's accusations that Beijing has devalued its currency to gain a trade advantage and his open displeasure at the United States' historic strong dollar policies.
The poll of over 50 foreign exchange analysts this week showed further losses for the yuan, also known as the renminbi, were possible over the next 12 months.
Jason Daw, head of emerging market FX strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said that emerging market currencies, like the yuan, ""require a positive narrative"" to sustain a recovery.
""Risk premia should remain elevated as the market grapples with U.S. policies, with Asia in particular risk from protectionism,"" he noted. 
""Beijing's ultimate goal is to let the (yuan) reach a market clearing price sooner rather than later, albeit without a major one-off devaluation during the process. This is already challenging enough and now the potential policy mix from the Trump administration has further complicated the task.""
China's central bank has spent hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves to keep the yuan from falling further and has taken several measures in recent months aimed at making it more difficult for Chinese individuals and companies to send money abroad.
Despite this, the closely-managed yuan  fell almost 7 percent last year, marking its biggest loss against the dollar since 1994, in part due to an uncertain outlook on China's economy.
The currency has found some support in recent developments, such as a revival in government borrowing and spending.
The central bank also raised short-term interest rates last week in a surprise move and set a firmer official midpoint than markets had expected on Monday, which pushed the yuan higher to 6.86 against a subdued dollar.
But while the currency is forecast to trade around that level to the dollar by the end of the month, it is then expected to fall to 7.18 in a year, which would mark its lowest level in nearly a decade if reached.
""A rising dollar and an unrelenting desire for FX diversification by local residents means more (yuan) depreciation pressure,"" added Societe Generale's Daw.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro slid to a one-week low against the dollar on Monday on concerns over French politics ahead of the presidential vote in April as well as other impending elections in Europe in a year of political uncertainty. 
""Political risk is serving to dampen the euro after last week's stumble from the $1.08 area,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto.
German factory orders rose 5.2 percent in December, the biggest monthly increase in 2-1/2 years, but the data hardly mattered. 
Investors were largely focused on French politics, as far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen launched her presidential bid, vowing to fight globalization and take France out of the euro zone.
The yield spread between French and German 10-year yields, as a result, rose to their highest since late 2012, ""reflecting the increasing risk that ... Le Pen poses to the European political establishment,"" said Andres Bergero, director of foreign exchange trading at Bank of the West in San Ramon, California.
Bergero added that Italian-German yield spreads have widened as well, as election season in Europe gets underway, which could indicate more volatility in the currency market.
Dutch elections are in March, French in April and German in September. In Italy, another presidential election looms, even as former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said he was willing to shelve his push for early voting. 
In late trading, the euro fell 0.4 percent against the dollar to $1.0742 . It dropped to $1.0705, its weakest level since Jan. 31.
The dollar, however, slid to two-month lows against the yen amid a drop in U.S. Treasury yields. The spread between U.S. two-year and Japanese two-year debt yields contracted to around 136 basis points on Monday, the narrowest in two months, a positive for the yen.
The dollar was last down 0.7 percent at 111.81 yen , and had earlier fallen to 111.63, its lowest since late November.
Robust equity markets and the strength of U.S. economic data, meanwhile, continue to back last year's bullish U.S. dollar calls, analysts said.
But a lack of details on expected pro-dollar tax-and-spending initiatives by President Donald Trump's new administration and concerns over the White House's attitude on the dollar and global trade have kept the currency under pressure, for now.
Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York, said she expects further dollar softness ""until we see more concrete progress on the budget, tax cuts and infrastructure spending"" from the U.S. government.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's former currency czar Eisuke Sakakibara said the dollar could fall below 100 yen by year-end on U.S. President Donald Trump's perceived support for a weak dollar, but cautioned that any yen-selling intervention by Tokyo might be counterproductive.
Sakakibara, who was known as ""Mr Yen"" in the 1990s when he actively led currency intervention to stem a strong yen, said Tokyo should avoid intervention even if yen rises are rapid as doing so would not be supported by the United States.
Sakakibara, now a professor at Aoyama Gakuin University, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that gradual yen gains will be beneficial for Japanese firms with production bases overseas.
Trump's U.S. election victory in November initially brought benefits to Japan as dollar gains fueled by hopes for his stimulus policies weakened the yen in a boon to its exports.
But his recent criticism against a weak yen has cast him into one of the biggest risks to Japan's export-reliant economy, with the dollar hitting a two-month low of 112.08 yen last week.
Trade and currency policy are likely to be high on the agenda during the summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump later this week. The president has criticized the lack of access to the Japanese auto market for U.S. producers and said Tokyo is using monetary policy to devalue its currency.
""Trump attaches great importance to domestic employment, which means that he needs to boost exports. In order to do so Trump is leaning to a weak dollar policy by, for example, criticizing Japan for adopting weak yen policy,"" Sakakibara said.
Trump's perceived weak dollar policy will help drive down the U.S. currency and possibly spur expectations of slower Federal Reserve rate hikes and an end to the Bank of Japan's aggressive monetary stimulus, he said. 
Last year, the dollar fell to as low as 99 yen on Brexit fears, but it rebounded to above 118 yen after Trump's election - close to around 120 yen seen at the start of the year. It was fetching 112.70 yen on Monday.
JAPAN-U.S. SUMMIT
At this week's summit, Sakakibara said Abe must firmly convey that Japan does not use monetary policy to target exchange rate, adding Tokyo need not compromise on trade issues.
It's ""impossible"" to resolve trade imbalances through currencies, said Sakakibara, who represented Japan as a member of bilateral forum on insurance sector negotiations in the 1990s.
""These are old-yet-new issues, which have never been resolved,"" he said, referring to Japan-U.S. trade issues.
""We revalued the yen a lot through the (1985) Plaza Accord, assuming that would decrease Japan's exports, but our trade surplus and U.S. deficits have persisted despite the dollar's weakening,"" Sakakibara said.

""Experiences showed that trade imbalances have not been resolved by adjusting currency rates.""

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2017 04:28PM ET</span>",Trump makes Mexican peso great again; investors see more gains ahead,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico’s peso has improbably been the world’s top-performing currency since Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, and an increasing number of emerging market fund managers said it could rebound further from its nosedive following the U.S. election.
Even before its inauguration comeback, a number of emerging market fund managers were betting that the peso had seen its worst days and was poised to outperform in 2017 along with other Mexican assets.
""We've gone from an outright short late last year to an overweight position relative to the index, just because there’s a lot of bad news priced in,"" said Jim Barrineau,  Schroders  (LON:SDR)' head of emerging markets debt and portfolio manager for its multi-sector bond fund.
""The real exchange rate is very, very cheap relative to history, and at this point, the bond yields are competitive with the higher yielding countries in EM.""
The peso was up 8 percent since Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 despite his proposal last week of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican imports and the collapse of a scheduled face-to-face meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
The peso also made a technical breakout Friday, rallying through a resistance point at the 20.56 level, around where it closed on Thursday. That level marks a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its sell-off since the Nov. 8 election.
""Perceiving the 20 percent import tax comment as a starting point for negotiations, the market took some solace because it could have been much higher, say 30 percent or 35 percent,"" said Gordian Kemen, global head of emerging market fixed income strategy for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The peso has continued its tear even as Trump has reiterated concerns about the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying on Thursday he would like to speed up talks to either renegotiate or replace the deal.
Kemen said investors were relieved Trump did not move to unilaterally withdraw from NAFTA or rule out talks entirely.
PRICED IN
And though investors have in the past wagered at their peril that Trump's often extreme rhetoric would not be matched by his real-world actions, many are betting that the current price of Mexico's peso already reflects the worst of any potential U.S. action against the country.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) asset managers said earlier this week they believed the peso had hit a near-term bottom.
Similarly, Michael Gomez, PIMCO's head of emerging markets portfolio management, said that while he expects the background to remain noisy, ""Mexican assets and the peso specifically already incorporate much of the expected downside risk.""
UBS strategists recently said in a research note that even the border tax had been 70 percent priced into the peso's value.
That's not to say big risks do not remain, especially given the recent bounce.
""The peso is cheap certainly and absent a big unfavorable change to NAFTA, you will make great money investing in Mexican bonds. But a change to NAFTA that's unfavorable, and who knows,"" said Kieran Curtis, investment director at  Standard Life  (LON:SL) Investments in London, adding that he still sees Mexico as a ""deteriorating credit.""
Each firm calculates a currency's ""fair value"" differently, but generally valuations are derived by comparing the ability to buy the same goods in different countries or measuring the value of income and investment an economy takes in against what it spends.
Fund managers interviewed by Reuters largely agreed that the peso was at a level inconsistent with the reality of its economy, but some remained wary of further Trump-related surprises.
While he holds slightly overweight positions in Mexican debt, including local currency bonds, Gorky Urquieta, co-head of emerging market debt at Neuberger Berman, said aggressive unilateral U.S. imposition of tariffs or an unwind of NAFTA would likely hit the peso again.
""As much as we think the currency is undervalued, it could become even more undervalued before it begins a sustained recovery,"" he said.

U.S. officials said the sanctions, the first issued against Iran in more than a year, didn’t violate the landmark nuclear agreement Tehran reached with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015. President Donald Trump issued a cryptic tweet after the sanctions.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2017 11:54AM ET</span>",Dollar weakens as data shows soft U.S. wage growth,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday in choppy trading after the U.S. employment report showed a smaller-than-expected rise in wages last month despite strong jobs gains, likely prompting the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in raising interest rates this year.
The greenback has struggled amid concerns about the Trump administration's preference for a weak dollar. It posted its worst January in percentage terms in 30 years. 
So far this week, the trend continues to be lower. The dollar was down 2.3 percent against the yen this week, on track for its worst weekly performance since late July.
Further compounding the dollar's anemic trend this year was Friday's report showing that January non-farm payrolls rose by 227,000 jobs, the largest gain in four months. But the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent and wages increased modestly, suggesting there was still some slack in the labor market that would keep inflation in check.
As a result, Fed fund futures priced in a slim chance of a rate hike in March on Friday after the jobs data, according to the CME Group's FedWatch. Rate futures have instead priced in a June hike, with a probability of more than 60 percent.
""Tempered Fed expectations are ultimately the biggest market takeaway we get from the report,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston.
""This is not to say that we read this report as indicating a weaker employment situation, just the existence of more slack than the headline unemployment rate would point at. And the less aggressive rate hike profile feeds into a weaker dollar,"" he added.
Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent, lower than the market's forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase. There was also a downward revision to the December wage growth. 
In midday trading, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus six top currencies, slipped 0.1 percent to 99.666 (DXY).
Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.3 percent at 112.46 yen . The euro, meanwhile, was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.0784 .
January's U.S. non-manufacturing index also showed a reading of 56.5, slightly lower than the market's 57.0 forecast.
However the number remained higher than the 54.9 average for the whole of 2016, according to High Frequency Economics. 

""A little lower then expected, but still fairly strong, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""The data suggests good upward momentum.""

The reading came in at 51.0 in January, down from December's 47-month record of 51.9 and below a Reuters' poll forecast for 51.8. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below signals contraction.
AUD/USD slipped after the data to as low as $0.7638 from $0.7660 before the release. China is a key market for Australia's exports of raw materials, tying its economic prospects to the mainland.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2017 07:46AM ET</span>","Dollar falls after Fed, Aussie soars on record trade surplus","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest since mid-November on Thursday after the Federal Reserve disappointed investors hoping for a clear sign of a March interest rate rise, while the Australian dollar rallied after data showing a record trade surplus.
Money markets had shown a 20 percent chance of a rise in U.S. rates next month but that slipped to as little as 15 percent despite the Fed sending a broadly upbeat message on the economy.
Aggressive language from the United States on Iran and a refugee deal with Australia also put the focus back on the geopolitical risks from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration rather than the expectations of higher inflation that dominated markets' initial thinking last year.
""The market has become increasingly sensitive to comments made by Trump himself or his advisers,"" said Alexandre Dolci, a strategist with BBVA (MC:BBVA) in London.
""We have seen more and more anti-dollar jawboming from officials, especially targeting Germany, China and Japan. That has undermined the dollar in the past few days and is the main driver of dollar underperformance since the start of the year.""
The dollar index has fallen steadily since the Fed raised rates in December (DXY) and it hit a 12-week low in morning trade in Europe, although traders stressed it was not obvious it would fall much further ahead of U.S. jobs numbers on Friday.
""If anything had come along last night to reinstate the Fed element of the equation the dollar would have rallied,"" said Neil Mellor, a strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. 
""But there are overriding fears about what the Trump administration is or isn't prepared to do about all these antagonistic issues. Until we know, worries about his attitude to the dollar are going to weigh on the market.""
Against the yen, normally chief beneficiary of nerves about global security or political risk, the dollar fell 0.8 percent to 112.27 , moving closer to Tuesday's low of 112.08. The euro hit an 8-week high of $1.0819 .
""We're still seeing long-term guys buying the dollar on dips, expecting it to eventually recover on interest rate differentials between Japan and the U.S.,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. ""But sometimes, it's a short-term market.""
The weekly reading of client flows run by the market's biggest player, Citi, showed hedge funds selling the dollar chiefly for the euro or emerging currencies in the past week.

The Aussie  added to gains in Asia to stand more than 1 percent higher on the day, driven by a recovery in exports in the fourth quarter that sent its current account surplus soaring and headed off any thoughts of a dip into recession.

GBP/USD fell 0.62% to 1.2583, after rising to highs of 1.2706 earlier, the most since December 14.
The BoE said it now expects economic growth of 2.0% this year, higher than economists had expected and up sharply from its previous forecast of 1.4%.
The economy is expected to grow 1.6% in 2018, compared with 1.5% forecast in November and the forecast for 2019 was raised to 1.7% from 1.6% previously.
""The upgraded outlook ... reflects the fiscal stimulus announced in the chancellor's Autumn Statement, firmer momentum in global activity, higher global equity prices and more supportive credit conditions,"" the bank said.
The bank said it expects inflation of 2.0% in the first quarter of 2017, 2.7% in early 2018 and 2.6% in early 2019, compared to November forecasts of 1.8%, 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.
The BoE’s monetary policy committee voted 9-0 to keep rates on hold at 0.25% on Thursday, in line with forecasts.
Policymakers also agreed to leave the bank’s asset purchase program unchanged at £435 billion.

In its latest monetary policy statement, the Fed stuck to its view that the economy is strengthening and policymakers also see economic growth continuing.
But the Fed gave no clear signal on the timing of its next rate hike as officials wait to assess the possible economic impact of the Trump administration’s protectionist policies and recent remarks about currencies.
The euro surged on Tuesday after President Trump’s top trade adviser accused Germany of currency exploitation, saying it is using a “grossly undervalued” euro to exploit the U.S. and its trading partners.
In separate remarks, Trump criticized Japan and China, saying they devalued their currencies to the disadvantage of the U.S.
The remarks indicated that the dollar exchange rate could have a prominent role to play in Trump's 'America First' agenda.
The dovish Fed statement hit sentiment on the greenback despite a raft of solid U.S. economic data being released on Wednesday.
The Institute for Supply Management reported that its index of manufacturers rose to more than two-year highs in January and the ADP nonfarm payrolls report showed that the private sector boosted hiring last month.
In the euro zone, the European Central Bank said Thursday that it will look through the recent spoke in inflation and keep its stimulus program in place as underlying inflation remains sluggish.
The ECB said in its economic bulletin that very substantial monetary accommodation was needed to bring back inflation to its target of close to but just below 2% and keep it there.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2017 07:27AM ET</span>",Dollar struggles after worst start to year in decades,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered a little ground on Wednesday after recording its worst start to the year in three decades on concerns the United States was poised to ditch its two-decade-old ""strong dollar"" policy. 
The greenback skidded 2.6 percent against a basket of major peers (DXY) in January, its worst showing since 1987. It fell first on worries over signs of protectionism from U.S. President Donald Trump and then on mounting unease that the new administration is set on talking down the currency. 
A senior trade adviser to the president, Peter Navarro, said on Tuesday that the euro was ""grossly undervalued"", sending the single currency soaring above $1.08 for the first time since early December  and knocking the dollar index down almost 1 percent to a seven-week low.
Navarro's comments were followed by Trump himself, who complained that ""every other country lives on devaluation"" while the United States ""sit(s) there like a bunch of dummies"". 
""The market is concerned about what it is he’s prepared to do to take care of these concerns about the dollar – that’s the issue that’s going to hang over the market,"" said Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) currency strategist Neil Mellor. 
""In some ways I think we’re heading for a mini re-run of last year, albeit for different reasons: everyone was geared up for dollar strength and then in the first quarter saw the dollar down.""
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt, said currency markets would be relatively calm on Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, though with Trump grabbing much of the headlines, the meeting has been relegated to the sidelines.
The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged in its first policy decision since Trump took office, as the central bank - along with the market - awaits greater clarity on his economic policies.
The lack of clarity over Trump's promised fiscal stimulus has been another factor that has weakened the dollar since the start of the year. 
It had hit 14-year highs on the view that his policies would boost growth and inflation, leading to a faster pace of interest rate hikes, but it has fallen over 4 percent since then and is now trading less than 2 percent above its pre-election levels. 
The dollar index traded less than 0.2 percent above the previous day's seven-week low on Wednesday, while the euro traded flat on the day just below $1.08.
Against the yen, though, the dollar was 0.4 percent higher at 113.25 yen <JPY=>. 
Despite Tuesday's comments, which increased the prospect of Washington reversing the ""strong dollar"" policy advocated by presidents dating back to the Clinton administration, the U.S. currency still attracted demand. 
""Trump is providing an opportunity for bargain hunters. The dollar ends up being sold on his statements, but ultimately it finds downside support as Treasury yields do not fall that much,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.

GBP/USD was up 0.21% to 1.2609 from around 1.2575 earlier.
The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index ticked down to 55.9 in January from December’s two-and-a-half year highs of 56.1, in line with forecasts.
Output rose at the fastest rate since May 2014, as new order intakes expanded at a robust pace, the report said.
But the report also pointed to ballooning price pressures, as input costs rose at their fastest rate in 25 years, pushed up by the almost 20% drop in sterling since June’s Brexit vote and higher costs for commodities, such as steel and oil.
This prompted manufacturers to raise the prices they charged for goods at the fastest rate since April 2011.
""With cost pressures increasingly feeding though to higher selling prices at factories, it looks inevitable that consumer price inflation will rise further in coming months,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit.
""The question is whether increased cost ... pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was on course for its worst start to a year since 2008 on Tuesday as concerns over the broader shape of policy under President Trump outweighed the expectations of higher U.S. inflation which dominated the end of last year.
The dollar dipped another 0.2 percent against the yen after falling 1 percent on Monday as Trump's ordering of a ban on travelers from seven largely-Muslim states spurred protests worldwide and across the United States.
The euro, hit by a combination of marginally weaker-than-expected German inflation numbers and nerves over French politics in the previous session, also jumped against the greenback after strong French and Spanish numbers.
""You have a French CPI upside surprise and a massive Spanish surprise. So you do have a more positive European inflation story. Bund yields are up and that is pulling the euro higher,"" said Richard Cochinos, head of European G10 FX Strategy at Citi.
""We do have the month end which is creating a dollar flow. Our quant team has put out a note saying that should be a dollar negative flow.""
The dollar fell 0.1 percent on the day to 113.90 yen per dollar <JPY=> in morning trade in Europe, recovering from lows hit in Asian trading. It was down 0.1 percent at $1.0708 per euro <EUR=>, having traded as weak as $1.0725.
That all put it on course for a fall of 1.9 percent on the month against a basket of currencies. (DXY)
Investors bought the dollar strongly after Trump's victory last November on the assumption that he would spur repatriation of capital to the United States, spend aggressively on infrastructure and encourage a rise in inflation.
But that enthusiasm has waned in the absence of much detail on fiscal policy in his first 10 days in charge, with currency markets also unnerved by signs both the president and his nominee for Treasury Secretary would prefer a weaker dollar.
""Trump's travel ban - and his associated decision to fire the acting Attorney General - dominates sentiment and remains good for Treasuries, the yen and gold, but bad for bonds and the dollar,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist with  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
""My bias is still that we'll get back to the Trump economic program, and the implications for Fed policy, before too long. More prosaically, markets will focus on the US jobs data due Friday.""
The Fed starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday and any improvement in the board's view of the economy in its statement on Wednesday would be liable to trigger bets on another rise in interest rates within months.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2017 08:28AM ET</span>",Euro hits 11-day low after German inflation data miss,"By Jemima Kelly and Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slipped to a 11-day low against the dollar on Monday after German inflation data came in slightly weaker than expected, which took some pressure off the European Central Bank to wind down its stimulus program. 
Having earlier traded lower on concerns over a travel ban implemented by U.S. President Donald Trump, the euro's fall helped the dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies - climb half a percent to above 101 for the first time in 10 days (DXY). 
The latest figures showed German consumer price inflation hit 1.9 percent in January. While that was the highest in three-and-a-half years, it was slightly below forecasts for a 2 percent annual rise.
A sustained recovery in German inflation would give Bundesbank President and ECB rate-setter Jens Weidmann more scope to argue for winding down the ECB's bond-buying program more quickly. 
Against the yen, though, the dollar remained weak, trading down 0.4 percent at 114.27 yen  by 1300 GMT, as investors sought the traditional security of the Japanese currency after U.S. immigration curbs put the spotlight back on Trump's protectionist bent and the risks it poses for the economy.
""The euro move may be related to the German data, which were a fair bit softer than expected... The euro would normally go up in a risk-off environment,"" said RBC Capital Markets currency strategist Adam Cole, in London. 
""Dollar/yen is still lower which is consistent with markets being risk-off,"" he added, pointing out that currencies usually seen as more risky, like the Australian and New Zealand dollars  , were still down on the day. 
Trump's temporary ban on entry of refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries faced mounting criticism over the weekend, even from some prominent Republicans, and sparked protests that drew tens of thousands in major American cities. 
A stronger dollar was one of 2017's big calls for many investment banks and asset managers at the end of last year, but that faith has been undermined by worries about how U.S. trade and diplomacy will pan out under Trump's presidency.
At the top of the list are concerns that the new administration may actively pursue a weaker dollar as part of efforts to change its trading relationship with China and others.
The dollar had also been weakened by weaker-than-expected U.S. economic growth data on Friday. 
""The weak U.S. GDP is doing the dollar no favors. But it also takes courage to keep buying the dollar, considering what Trump has said about the kind of a currency policy he could pursue,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Bank in Tokyo.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2017 04:37AM ET</span>",Dollar climbs more after Trump's Mexico comments,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered another half a percent against a basket of currencies on Friday after President Donald Trump suggested he would push ahead with a 20 percent border tax on Mexico.
The dollar has climbed for two days as markets refocused on Trump’s pro-business policies and expectations the greenback would gain from a rise in border tariffs, lifting the currency off seven-week lows hit on Wednesday and leaving it flat for the week.
Some academic studies have suggested that a 20 percent border tariff on imports would be likely to provoke up to the same amount of strengthening on the dollar side as the economy adjusted and more capital was forced back to the United States.
On the other hand, there are concerns that a trade war with major trading partners might have other effects that unnerve markets and prompt investors to head for safe-haven currencies like the yen or the Swiss franc.
The 4 percent fall in the dollar in the three weeks from Jan. 3 reflects more doubts about how the new president’s policy mix will play out for the currency, particularly after both Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin hinted at concerns over its strength.
But many analysts cast it as a necessary adjustment to market positioning before the dollar can deliver on what were widespread expectations of a strong rally in 2017. 
""The market is back on this positive story about Trump's tax and spending policies. It is gaining on a broad basis,"" said Antje Praefke, a strategist with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. 
""(Whether) this politics is positive for the dollar in the long-term may be a different story. You need more information about what he will actually do and how that will play out and impact the dollar. But for now the market buys the growth story.""
The dollar index (DXY), which measures its strength against six major peers, gained 0.3 percent to 100.66 in early European trade, up from a seven-week low of 99.793 hit on Thursday.
It was steady on the day at $1.0678 per euro <EUR=> and half a percent higher at 115.14 yen. <JPY=>
The franc, held down by intervention by the Swiss National Bank in recent months, hit a seven-month high on Thursday on news of Johnson & Johnson's $30 billion takeover of Actelion.
""There was a lot of chatter about this deal yesterday,"" said a dealer with one bank in London.
""Whether they are actively doing it at the moment we can't say but the franc has certainly proved far stronger than other currencies against the dollar as well.""

“If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.”
The tweets came after Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders, one authorizing the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and the other to significantly boost the U.S. Border Patrol.
Hours later, Peña Nieto said he ""regrets and rejects"" Trump's orders because ""Mexico does not believe in walls.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar struggled near seven-week lows on Thursday on growing concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies including an executive order to construct a U.S.-Mexican border wall. 
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last down 0.2 percent at 99.839. It dipped to 99.835 on Wednesday, its lowest level since Dec. 8.
The dollar was generally weaker despite U.S. shares gaining and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closing atop the 20,000 mark for the first time. (N)
Trump has made several business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday, including signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines.
However, the president's broad but divisive plans to reshape U.S. immigration and national security policy rattled some investors partly as the U.S. needs foreign capital to finance its large current account deficit.
Trump on Wednesday ordered construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants while mulling restoring a CIA secret detention program.
""Amid concerns over Trump's protectionism, the correlation between U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar has gotten weaker,"" said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank.
The dollar last stood at 113.21 yen  against the yen, near two-month low of 112.52 yen touched on Tuesday even as U.S. Treasuries yields stayed near four-week highs.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields last stood at 2.510 percent (US10YT=RR), close to a 4-week high of 2.538 percent hit on Wednesday.
""It's similar to the U.S.-Japan trade conflicts in 1990s. Back then, the dollar was weak despite the high U.S. interest rates. Dollar would remain weak if Trump pushes his protectionist rhetoric,"" said JPMorgan Chase's Tanase.
Sterling was last down 0.1 percent at $1.2627 after hitting a six-week high of $1.2638  on Wednesday. The pound was helped by hopes for a trade deal between Britain and the United States, which Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday would ""put UK interests and UK values first.""

USD/TRY touched highs of 3.82 following the decision and was last at 3.78, up 0.87% from Monday’s close.
Turkey’s central bank kept the benchmark repo rate steady at 8%. Economists had been hoping for a rate hike of at least 50 basis points to stem the lira's falls.
The bank raised the overnight lending rate to 9.25%.
Turkey’s central bank uses multiple rates to set policy.
""Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered,"" the bank said in a statement.
""Moreover, necessary liquidity measures will be taken in case of unhealthy pricing behaviour in the foreign exchange market that cannot be justified by economic fundamentals.""
The lira has fallen almost 8% against the dollar so far this year, making it one of the worst performing major emerging market currencies.
The lira touched an all-time low on January 11, when it traded at just below four lira to the dollar.
Emerging markets have been hard hit since Donald Trump’s surprise U.S. presidential election victory in November, as the prospects of rising U.S. interest rates prompted investors to pull cash out of developing economies.
Turkey has become particularly fragile because of high levels of political and economic risk and relatively low central bank reserves to defend its currency.
A string of terror attacks in Turkey, uncertainty over the outlook for economic growth and worries about political instability have all pressured the lira lower.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has frequently urged the country’s central bank to keep interest rates low, despite sharp declines in the lira, saying that access to cheaper credit would help bolster the economy."

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2017 07:45PM ET</span>",Dollar tumbles to seven-week low on Trump uncertainty,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slumped to a seven-week low against a currency basket on Monday, weighed by concerns about the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration that have so far been marred by protests, a protectionist inauguration speech, and angry comments on Twitter. 
The safe-haven yen has been the main beneficiary of U.S. political uncertainty, rising for a second straight session against the dollar. The yen has gained nearly 3 percent since the start of the year.
Trump's ""America first"" message was followed over the weekend by coordinated protests in U.S. cities, testy exchanges between members of his top staff and media and confirmation that key trade pacts were heading for the shredder..
All these fed uncertainty about the direction Trump's policy will take and pointed to a bumpy few months ahead for the new president.
In late trading, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major rivals, fell 0.6 percent to 100.16 led by 1.4 percent drop versus the yen to 113.01 yen . The dollar's fall against the yen was the largest in more than two weeks.
""There is general unease after Trump's very aggressive, mercantilist, mostly protectionist-focused speech,"" said John Hardy, head of forex strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.
""The fear is that while some specific notions and ideas will be dollar-supportive, a mercantilist approach and Trump's recent mention of currency policy and China's currency policy as being too weak, could trigger the idea that Trump will use (this) policy to bully other nations toward a weaker dollar.""
The dollar index (DXY) rose about 4.2 percent between Trump's election in November and the end of last year, but has since given back more than 2.5 percent.
The dollar's steep rally following Trump's victory was spurred by expectations the new administration would focus on pro-growth fiscal stimulus, tax cuts, and regulatory reform that would likely lift inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly this year. 
Sterling, meanwhile, was the other big gainer, hitting a six-week peak as investors bet Britain's Supreme Court would rule on Tuesday that the government needs parliamentary approval to trigger formal Brexit talks.
It climbed as high as $1.2506 , its strongest level against the dollar since Dec. 16. The pound also rose to a two-week high against the euro. (GBPEUR=).

The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.0751, posting its seventh daily rise in the last nine.

According to Reuters, the country's three largest bitcoin exchanges announced plans to begin  charging a flat fee of 0.2% for each transaction. Releases from BTCC, Huobi, and  OkCoin reportedly said the fees were being implemented to ""further curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.""
Bitcoin has had a wild start to 2017. The cryptocurrency rallied by more than 20% in the opening days of 2017 amid huge interest from China, which accounts for  nearly 100% of trading. In fact, data from  Cryptocompare found, ""In the first 24 hours of the new year, over 5 million bitcoins were bought in Chinese yuan, equating to $3.8 billion. In contrast, just 53,000 bitcoins were bought in US dollars.""
The early gains vanished in a matter of days, however, as bitcoin tumbled 35% on concerns that China was going to crack down on trading, with Beijing having announced it had begun  investigating bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai on suspicion of market manipulation, money laundering, unauthorized financing, and other issues.
But bitcoin has managed to work its way off support in the $750 area, and it is trying to break out of resistance in the $880/$920 area that has defined trade for the past week.
Monday's announcement could reduce some of the market volatility, as bitcoin traders in China won't be allowed to buy and sell without paying the new transaction fee."

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>",Pound eyes $1.25 as traders bet British government to lose Brexit case,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have largely priced in the British government losing its Supreme Court appeal on whether it can trigger Brexit talks without parliamentary approval, but traders - both human and computer models - will scour the ruling for clues on whether regional assemblies will get a say. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May will learn at 0930 GMT on Tuesday whether the court has upheld a High Court decision in November that her government must get approval from fellow lawmakers before triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the formal means of exiting the bloc.
The government is widely expected to lose its appeal - online spreadbetter Betfair is showing a 90 percent probability that the Supreme Court will uphold the previous ruling. 
But analysts said the ruling could contain many as-yet-unknowns, meaning sterling volatility - which has been elevated in recent months and drove the biggest one-day rise in the currency since the 1990s last week - is likely to spike around the time of the court ruling. 
Key words that algorithm-driven trading models - which take up an increasingly large slice of currency markets - have been programmed to react to in a binary manner are likely to act as the initial sterling triggers, with human traders, who need more reaction time, following behind. 
""It's not just a case of which way they rule – the exact wording of what sort of involvement parliament will have will be important,"" said MUFG currency strategist Lee Hardman. 
""The knee-jerk reaction will probably be to see the pound strengthen, but the upside would probably be fairly modest on the back of that,"" he added. 
Crucial among the unknown risks in Tuesday's ruling - and therefore likely trigger points, analysts said - would be whether the Supreme Court rules that lawmakers not just in Westminster but also in devolved parliaments across Britain would have to approve Article 50 being triggered. 
While the thrust of the case centers on whether the British parliament has to give its assent, the judges also heard arguments from the Scottish government and lawyers for Northern Irish challengers that Britain's devolved assemblies must give their approval too.
Should the court agree - an outcome ministers believe is unlikely - an ongoing political breakdown in Northern Ireland could derail May's timetable, following the collapse of the province's power-sharing government.
""A key risk would be if the court were to give Scotland’s and Northern Ireland's assemblies a say, as that could trigger a potential constitutional crisis,"" Citi currency analyst Nishtha Asthan wrote in a note to clients. 
If that ruling were to simply lead to a delay in the triggering of Article 50, however, without a crisis, investors said that could boost the pound. 
""Anything that’s going to disrupt (the government’s plans) would be sterling-positive,"" said Ian Gunner, currency fund manager at hedge fund Altana. 
STERLING AT 5-WEEK HIGH 
May has said she will trigger Article 50 by the end of March, and last week detailed her vision for a clean break with the EU by quitting its single market. 
Though that effectively meant Britain would undergo the ""hard Brexit"" many investors have feared, May's relatively conciliatory tone and the fact that she had removed a layer of uncertainty was interpreted as a positive by markets - sterling soared by 3 percent on the day of the speech against the dollar . 
It was up as much as 0.8 percent on Monday at a five-week high of $1.2472  ahead of the Supreme Court ruling. 
Against the euro, sterling rose 0.4 percent to 86.16 pence (EURGBP=D4).
""While the Supreme Court ruling that the parliament needs to approve Article 50 is probably in the price, should the Supreme Court rule that parliament needs a say in the exit strategy details, sterling could get a further lift,"" said ING's global head of EMEA research, Chris Turner. 

""We are very bearish on sterling/dollar this quarter, but are wary that this week could see a correction into the $1.25-26 region.""

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dropped 0.31% to 100.79. USD/JPY changed hands at 114.59, down 0.24% after the speech and market close, while GBP/USD rose 0.23% to 1.2374 as the United Kingdom prepares to exit the European Union trade bloc and strike stronger trade ties to the U.S.

""Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Thursday as solid U.S. data reinforced a theme of robust U.S. economic growth, while the euro fell after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi alluded to sagging inflation and the need for further monetary policy assistance.
The euro  fell below $1.06 to its lows of the day as Draghi spoke at a news conference, while the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against the euro and five other major currencies, added to its gains.
The ECB announced it would maintain its negative interest rate policy and maintain a record pace of asset purchases to stimulate tepid growth. 
Draghi described the current euro zone recovery as ""dampened by the sluggish pace of structural reform"" and said a ""very substantial degree"" of monetary policy stimulus was still needed.
That helped the dollar add to Wednesday's gains that followed remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen who said a ""few"" increases in U.S interest rates could be appropriate this year.
The greenback gained as much as 1 percent on Wednesday after Yellen's speech, which turned investors back to the narrative of strong growth and rising inflation in the U.S. that drove the currency higher.
""Clearly there’s policy divergence between the two central banks,"" said Peter Ng, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. ""Just based on the fundamentals, things are looking good in the U.S. You’ve got firmer rates, strong labor market and the yield differential supports U.S. assets.""
The euro fell to a session low of $1.0590 against the dollar and to a 10-day low of 86.11 pence against sterling (EURGBP=).
The dollar also was bolstered by rosy reports on U.S. jobless claims and housing starts. 
The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell to the lowest levels in decades, while the Commerce Department said homebuilding jumped more than expected in December, showing the housing market may have been a major contributor to economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The dollar rose to a nearly one-week high against the yen <JPY=> as investors laid bets on further dollar strength. The greenback moved to 115.29 yen, its highest since Jan. 13.

The dollar also booked gains against the Swiss franc , rising to 1.0115 franc.

Buying in the opening days of the year lifted its price more than 20% and above $1,000 for the first time since November 2013. However, rumblings about a crackdown on trading in China have caused jitters as of late. Beijing announced it had begun  investigating bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai on suspicion of market manipulation, money laundering, unauthorized financing, and other issues. The price crashed 35% to nearly $750 before finding support and working its way back up to resistance in the $900 area.
Thursday's action has to alleviate some concerns regarding the trading environment in China as Beijing announced it was  tightening capital controls even further. While the rules were aimed at outbound investments by centrally-controlled state firms, it is still notable that bitcoin has so far been spared.

EUR/USD touched lows of 1.0590 before pulling back to 1.0616, off 0.12% for the day.
Speaking at the bank’s post-policy meeting press conference, Draghi played down the significance of the jump in euro area inflation in December, saying that underlying inflation pressure remains “subdued.”
The annual rate of inflation in the euro area rose to 1.1% last month, the highest rate in more than three years.
The increase in inflation was mainly driven by energy prices and Draghi said the ECB would be monitoring whether rises in energy prices feed through to other prices.
He acknowledged that the growth outlook for the euro area has improved, but reiterated that quantitative easing can be increased if the outlook becomes less favorable.
He said that risks to euro area growth outlook remain tilted to downside due to global factors, adding that the outcome of the economic analysis ""confirmed the need for the continued, very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.""
At Thursday's meeting, the ECB kept its overnight deposit rate steady at -0.40%.
The main refinancing rate was unchanged at zero, while the rate on the marginal lending facility stayed at 0.25%.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2017 09:40AM ET</span>","Further sharp yen falls would concern Japan, adviser says","DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Further sharp falls in the yen would be a concern for the Japanese government, William H. Saito, an advisor to the Japan government, said.
The BOJ has several tools to counter further falls in the currency, Saito told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. He didn't elaborate.
The following are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: What is the expectation on the yen? Do you see it falling further in 2017?
A: The exchange rate is going to be difficult to read given the uncertainty in the U.S.. However, I think if it falls further than this in a similar or more dramatic way, this will also become a GoJ (Government of Japan) concern, so it's going to be a hard call. If the yen falls further/faster, this is an interesting problem, but I believe there are several tools in the toolbox (for the scenario) that haven't been used yet.
Q: Japan PM Shinzo Abe has resisted heavy spending even when the BOJ's shock-and-awe has sputtered. How soon can the third arrow be shot and what might it entail?
A: The biggest activity I see here is emphasis on the ""third arrow"", plus, how we improve the economy through industry investments and more women in the workplace.
One of the items being emphasized is the better utilization of ICT (information and communication technology). Japan currently has the lowest productivity and efficiency amongst the G7 countries. Thus, the topic of a fourth industrial revolution and what that entails is actually being discussed in the PM's committee. Not jumping to the fourth industry immediately, but becoming honest at what we are lacking to lead up to this; everything from education to corporate spending etc.
Q: How will plans to boost spending challenge Abe's budget-balancing promise?
A: This is the challenge, but I don't think all the plans require spending. Some can definitely use deregulation and to unwind taxes and other onerous overheads.
Q: How does the government plan to counter the trifecta of rising debt, an aging population and negative yields eroding savings income?
A: It's too early to see how (BOJ Governor) Kuroda's policy will work out. It is definitely palpable at the corporate level to put their cash to better use. We're definitely seeing more investment activities in the planning toward the next fiscal year in Japan. In terms of government initiatives, there is a lot of activity in this area, to see how we can execute some plans that have been worked out. Meaning, there are lots of great plans and ideas, but the issue has always been the ability to execute them due to various bureaucratic reasons. However, we see a whole new line of ministers who have been empowered to get things done.
Q: There has been some vocalization on the need to hike wages by corporates. How is that working on ground?
A: There is ""shaming"" by the GoJ to push this (wage hikes by corporates), but frankly, unemployment is coming to a mathematical low and the natural supply/demand is already having a positive effect on this.
Q: Do you see Tokyo being an unexpected beneficiary of Trump's protectionism?
A: Japan Inc has become very resilient in the last decade or so because of the wild swings in the yen. Thus, having shifted production to the U.S., in a sense we are a bit more insulated than many think. Furthermore, the FDI (foreign direct investment) into the U.S. has started bearing fruit and there is a lot of direct ideas being proposed in this area to the new administration. Japan Inc is definitely not standing still, but is taking a proactive stance versus recent history.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2017 07:45AM ET</span>",Dollar recovers some ground after five days of falls,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded on Wednesday after falling for five days in a row against its currency basket, as investors awaited a speech by the head of the Federal Reserve later in the day and looked to U.S. inflation data for clues on the path of interest rates. 
After a volatile Tuesday on which sterling rose more than 3 percent for its best showing against the dollar since at least 1998 , currency markets were calmer on Wednesday, with most of the previous day's moves reversing some of their course. 
Sterling retreated 1 percent. The dollar, which hit a seven-week low of 112.57 yen in early trade in Asia, climbed 0.8 percent to 113.19 yen  after seven straight days of falls.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures it against a basket of six major peers, stood at 100.68, up 0.4 percent, after falling to 100.26 on Tuesday, its lowest since Dec. 8.
The dollar had surged at the end of 2016 on expectations that fiscal stimulus proposed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would boost growth and inflation and lead to a faster pace of U.S. interest rate rises, but it has lost more than 2 percent over the past two weeks. 
""We went a bit far on dollar weakness yesterday, so it’s natural to have a correction once in a while (but) the downward trend is intact,"" said UBS currency strategist Daniel Trum, from Zurich. 
""Markets are finally becoming aware of the potential negative effect of Trump's policies on the U.S. dollar - at the beginning we had lots of positive sentiment... but now we see that the focus is shifting more toward potential trade disputes and potential difficulties in Trump implementing his policies."" 
One of the reasons given for the greenback's weakness this week was a comment from Trump in a weekend newspaper interview, in which he said U.S. companies could not compete with China because the dollar was too strong against the yuan, which was ""killing"" them. 
From London, RBC Capital Markets currency strategist Adam Cole said the comments might have helped to weaken the dollar at the margins, but they had not been a major factor as Trump had shown a lack of understanding of currency markets. 
""The fact that he talks about China manipulating the currency is just not credible... so that reduces the credibility of what he says about the currency, because it’s clearly at odds with anything that’s actually happening,"" Cole said. 
He added the dollar's recent weakness had been primarily driven by positioning, which had built up heavily in favor of further dollar gains and was therefore vulnerable to exaggerated falls on negative news.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech later on Wednesday, to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, could offer clues about the direction of monetary policy.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said on Tuesday he saw a ""good case"" for three rate hikes this year even without fiscal stimulus, but if the economy accelerated, the Fed would need to raise rates faster.
Investors also awaited the U.S. consumer price index, expected to show inflation at 0.3 percent last month, compared with 0.2 percent in November.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2017 02:20PM ET</span>",Brexit outline gives pound something to cling to - for now,"By Marc Jones and Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - After months of Brexit uncertainty, the first faint outlines of a plan from Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday have given investors in Britain's pound something to work with at last - although substantial risks remain of the currency falling again.
May confirmed what most Westminster watchers had come to expect, that Britain will pull out of the European Union's single market when it exits the bloc and not look for a compromise deal to retain some of its benefits.
But, perhaps sensing that a Supreme Court decision would force her hand anyway, she said that parliament would get a vote on the Brexit deal and that firms would be given time to make the transition to the new arrangements.
Traders said the almost 3 percent rise in sterling  against the dollar that followed - its biggest daily gain since at least 1998 - looked mainly like a squeeze on those who had already made money in six often chaotic months rather than conviction that its fall may be coming to an end.
Stefan Hofrichter, chief economist for giant German asset manager Allianz (DE:ALVG), said that in principle sterling at Tuesday's levels around $1.23 was significantly undervalued. But he remained reluctant to recommend buying it.
""It depends on the valuation measure but (it is) probably in the area of 20 percent (undervalued), which you could say is an argument to go long. But there are still a lot of uncertainties around it,"" he said. 
""For the time being we still don't know exactly what Brexit means.""
DECLINING SHORTS
Prior to Tuesday's action, sterling had fallen 20 percent against the dollar and 14 percent against the euro (EURGBP=) since the Brexit vote last June.
That decline has come in often violent stages. It gained almost 6 percent against the dollar from late October to early December but then fell all the way back in an unbroken succession of weekly declines.
Investment bankers have grown more divided along the way. While many expect more weakness into the launch of Brexit talks in March, only 18 of the more than 50 economists and strategists polled by Reuters at the start of this month expected sterling to weaken to $1.18 or less within the next six months. [FXPOLLS]
The measures of positioning run by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission as well as the currency world's big banking players all point to a large reduction in net bets against sterling from their peaks in mid- to late October. <1096742NNET>
That could be read as an indication of improving sentiment.
But it could also be seen as a sign that there is more space within the capital limits of big investors to bet heavily against the pound again.
""Despite the price move last week, clients have been slow to return to selling sterling,"" said Richard Cochinos, head of European G10 FX Strategy at Citi, the world's single biggest currency trader.
""Three out of Citi’s four client types were net GBP buyers last week, with leveraged GBP net selling so small it’s hardly worth mentioning. ... Ample room exists on the positioning & flow side to rebuild shorts.""
As companies factor sterling's fall into their prices, inflation bounced back to 1.6 percent in December, and it is expected to accelerate in the months ahead.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney hinted on Monday that there may be limits to how much price growth the bank can accept without responding with relatively tighter monetary policy, which would support the pound.
Finance minister Philip Hammond, speaking at the same time as May, warned that currency volatility may dampen investors appetite for funding Britain's large public debt.
""Clients are taking their time building positions, there is no firm conviction at the moment. In the short-term they are reassessing the drivers of the trends now,"" said Ned Rumpeltin, head of European FX strategy at TD Securities. 

""A key level is $1.2430, also $1.2540-70. If cable trades above there, we are looking at a much more extended recovery.""

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2017 10:00PM ET</span>",Scholar says free-floating yuan is nothing to fear: paper,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China should overcome the ""irrational fear"" of allowing the Chinese yuan to float freely, an influential government researcher said on Tuesday, as markets seek clear policies in an increasingly complex financial environment. 
Yu Yongding, a scholar at the China Academy of Social Sciences and former central bank adviser, made the comments amid a growing debate among Chinese economists about whether the yuan should be allowed to trade more freely.
With no clear direction from the central bank, traders have been closely scrutinizing the comments of influential academics such as Yu for a sign of any future policy movements. 
""How the future exchange rate will go depends on central bank policy and I have no way of reading their minds, but I want to say that we should overcome the irrational fear of a free-floating yuan,"" Yu was quoted as saying by the official Shanghai Securities News.
Yu's comments notwithstanding, traders said it was unlikely that Chinese authorities would loosen their grip on the exchange rate in the near future, noting that there was no clear consensus on what the equilibrium rate would be, for example.
Yu told a forum on Monday that China has a huge trade surplus, $3 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, the world's fastest economic growth, and a strong government. 
""(China) should be the country least afraid of a fluctuating exchange rate,"" he was quoted as saying.
Yu has also advocated that China stop intervening in currency markets and instead preserve its dwindling foreign exchange reserves.
He suggested the central bank set a ""bottom line"" of 25 percent for the yuan to depreciate. 
China's foreign exchange reserves fell to near six-year lows in December, but held just above the critical $3 trillion level, as authorities stepped in to support the weakening yuan ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
Though economists insist Beijing has been trying to prop up rather than weaken its currency, Trump has threatened to declare China to be a currency manipulator and slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2017 10:43AM ET</span>",Hard Brexit fears hit pound ahead of May speech,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound fell on Monday as concern mounted that the country was heading for a ""hard"" Brexit from the European Union and its single market, a day before a speech by Prime Minister Theresa May on the government's plans.
Some British newspapers have billed May's speech on Tuesday as a push away from preferential EU single market access and a hardening of the UK's stance toward an economic bloc that accounts for roughly half its exports and imports.
A spokeswomen for May, who will also attend a gathering of the world's economic elite in Davos, Switzerland, this week, called the reports about the planned tone of her upcoming speech ""speculation"".
That helped steady sterling in London trading but couldn't repair all the damage. The pound at one point had dropped below $1.20 to a three-decade low against the dollar, barring its 'flash crash' in October, and as much as 2.5 percent against the Japanese yen. (GBPJPY=) [/FRX]
""It’s clear that sterling is still very vulnerable to 'hard' Brexit fears,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. ""The uncertainty is itself also a negative factor, and I think perhaps that’s one of the reasons for Theresa May’s speech on Tuesday, to provide a little bit of clarification."" 
With May expected to trigger Article 50 by the end of March, which will start formal EU separation proceedings, the battle lines are already being drawn.
British finance minister Phillip Hammond also gave a thinly veiled warning in a German newspaper interview at the weekend that the UK could use corporate tax as a form of leverage in Brexit negotiations.
""If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short term,"" he said. ""In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model.""
However, he added that Britain did not want to close its doors completely to EU citizens who wanted to work in the UK.
May's spokeswoman said on Monday her boss shared Hammond's view on Britain's tax framework. She added, though, that she did not recognize comments from Sunday Times sources that May's office was expecting a ""market correction"" after her speech. 
POUNDED
Later on Monday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has delivered a string of warnings about the potential impact of Brexit, will give a speech at the London School of Economics on the policy issues affecting the bank. 
The central bank cut British interest rates to a record low and pumped fresh stimulus into the economy shortly after the Brexit vote, but it is now seeing inflation accelerate as a result of sterling's slide.
The pound has fallen almost 20 percent against the dollar  and nearly 14 percent against the euro (GBPEUR=) since the vote. By 1400 GMT on Monday, it was down almost 1 percent at $1.2060 and 0.6 percent at 87.80 pence per euro, while demand to hedge volatility was at its highest since July.   
London's stock market (FTSE) continued to benefit, however: the FTSE was the only major European index not in negative territory. It has surged 25 percent since Brexit, partly because the pound's slump helps internationally-spread companies that earn in dollars and euros.
Benchmark UK government bonds, gilts, (GB10YT=RR) also gained and outperformed, as the Europe-wide sell-off in stocks left investors moving to traditional areas of stability [GVD/EUR]. 
May has so far given very little away about what deal she will be seeking, frustrating some investors, businesses and lawmakers.
Tuesday's speech will stress the need for Britons, who voted for Brexit by 52 to 48 percent in last June's referendum, to unite around common goals such as protecting and enhancing workers' rights, her Downing Street office said in a statement.

""Now we need to put an end to the division and the language associated with it – 'Leaver' and 'Remainer' and all the accompanying insults – and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain,"" May is expected to say.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2017 10:41AM ET</span>",Sterling skids to three-month low as 'hard Brexit' fears bite,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling skidded to its lowest levels - bar a ""flash crash"" in October - in 32 years on Monday, hit by fears that Prime Minister Theresa May will say on Tuesday Britain is set for a ""hard"" Brexit out of the EU and its single market. 
The pound fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar and 2.5 percent against the yen. That shifted the spotlight away from the greenback, which has come under pressure in recent days as investors ponder U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's likely economic policies after he takes office on Friday.
The pound plunged to $1.1983  in early trade in Asia, depths not seen since a short-lived ""flash crash"" briefly wiped 10 percent off the currency's value in a thin market on Oct. 7. Apart from that, it was the lowest level since May 1985. 
By 1450 GMT (9:05 a.m. ET) sterling had steadied around $1.2075, down around 0.8 percent on the day. 
Dealers said the market was reacting to various media reports over the weekend that said May would signal plans for a ""hard"" Brexit in her speech on Tuesday, saying she is willing to quit the European Union's single market in order to regain control of Britain's borders.
""Every time there's 'hard Brexit' headlines, that triggers a fresh bout of selling sterling,"" said MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman, in London. 
""It's almost impossible to see Europe allowing the UK to remain a full member of the single market if it wants to regain control of the border and the laws and wants to strike its own agreements.""
Hardman and other London-based analysts said the weekend reports did not add much to what was already known - May's government has consistently pointed towards giving priority to immigration controls over keeping preferential single market access. They said that was why sterling had not fallen further in European trading hours. 
U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King day, meaning there was generally less action on other major pairs. Reuters data showed sterling volumes topped 200 percent of monthly averages in the European morning before collapsing to just 59 percent by 1400 GMT. 
Citi's head of European G10 currency strategy in London, Richard Cochinos, said Britain's hefty current account and budget deficits meant it was heavily dependent on foreign capital. The more uncertainty investors feel over Britain's place in Europe, he said, the more investment dries up. 
May has said she will trigger Article 50 - starting the formal EU withdrawal talks - by the end of March. But until now, she has revealed few details about what kind of deal she will seek, frustrating some investors, businesses and lawmakers.
""SAFE-HAVEN"" YEN 
The euro climbed as much as 1.5 percent against the pound to a two-month high of 88.53 pence (EURGBP=), before retreating to 87.85 pence, still up 0.7 percent on the day. 
Against the yen, which is perceived as a safe haven, sterling fell as much as 2.3 percent to a two-month low of 136.48 yen (GBPJPY=), before recovering to trade down around 1.4 percent lower on the day by 1230 GMT. 
The Japanese currency gained broadly as a risk-off mood permeated through markets, hitting a six-week high of 113.61 yen to the U.S. dollar . 
The dollar index was up 0.4 percent (DXY), having racked up its worst performance last week since Trump's election in November, a reflection of the reversal of the market consensus backing the dollar at the end of last year and, some say, concerns over policy.
The new administration is expected to embark on stimulus to boost growth and inflation, prompting the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. But Trump's protectionist stance has also added to some investors' worries over protectionism and global geopolitical risks.
""The Trump presidency ... has boosted business confidence but unsurprisingly, key data points like employment and retail sales since the election haven't been that exciting,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. 
""Maybe (Trump's) Inauguration gets markets looking forwards again though perhaps more in equities than FX.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global growth could be better than expected in 2017, though many uncertainties remain that could impact expansion, with the biggest of them being steep gains in the U.S. currency, Allianz's Mohamed A. El-Erian said on Monday.
The outlook for the global economy in 2017 will be similar to that for 2016, but with an upside risk, with the world expanding below 3 percent and the U.S. economy outperforming that with a growth of 2.5-3 percent, El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Europe's largest insurer, said at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong.
The U.S. outperformance is expected to bolster the dollar, but the currency could be lifted even further as the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at least three times under a baseline scenario for 2017, not two as the market is pricing now, he added.
""If the baseline materializes, we get at least three hikes. That attracts more capital,"" El-Erian said. ""That is the major risk for the baseline, that the dollar gets too strong, too quickly and what you get is the repeat of what we've seen in the past, which is a very strong dollar breaks something in the system.""
U.S. dollar gains could, in turn, increase the risk of default in emerging markets for businesses that have borrowed heavily in foreign currencies to benefit from record-low borrowing costs.
""Most emerging economies have been tempted at one time or another to borrow in dollars because the cost is perceived to be lower,"" he said. ""Sovereigns have learned the really hard way and have stopped doing this. Corporates have not.""

""The biggest risk right now of the dollar movement is on the mismatch of corporates. That's where the breakage happens and then the question becomes - does the corporate problem become a sovereign problem?""

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2017 09:50PM ET</span>",China should stop intervening in FX market and let yuan float: researcher,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China should stop intervening in the foreign exchange market, devalue the yuan and let it float freely to restore stability, a senior researcher at a government-backed think tank said.
Xiao Lisheng, a finance expert with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, made the remarks in an article on Monday in the official China Securities Journal amid a growing debate among the country's economists on whether authorities should let the closely-managed currency trade more freely.
The yuan lost 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, the biggest annual loss since 1994.
""The more the government delays the release of depreciation pressure, the greater the impact and destructive power of the release of depreciation pressure will be,"" Xiao wrote.
The authorities should ""let the yuan exchange rate have a one-off adjustment to realize a free float"" of the currency, he said.
The yuan is allowed to trade in a band of 2 percent on either side of a daily reference rate managed by the central bank.
Authorities have said repeatedly there was no basis for continued depreciation of the unit, but many currency strategists predict a further weakening this year if the U.S. dollar remains strong, spurring further capital outflows from China.
Xiao said the current mid-point formation mechanism, adopted in 2015, is still immature and in transition, although it has eased depreciation pressure and curbed sharp declines in the country's foreign exchange reserves.
""But any foreign exchange rate mechanism without a free float cannot fundamentally reach a market clearing (price),"" he wrote.
The mechanism for setting the daily reference rate was adopted after a one-off devaluation of the yuan in August 2015. It is opaque, but factors in the closing price from a day earlier and the movements of various other currencies.
Yu Yongding, a former central bank adviser, has also advocated that China stop intervening to help preserve its dwindling foreign exchange reserves, and suggested the central bank set a ""bottom line"" of 25 percent for the yuan to depreciate.
China's foreign exchange reserves fell to near six-year lows in December, but held just above the critical $3 trillion level, as authorities stepped in to support the weakening yuan ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.

For 2016 as a whole, China's reserves fell nearly $320 billion to $3.011 trillion, on top of a record drop of $513 billion in 2015.
