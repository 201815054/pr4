BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - With interest rates sky-high and the economy heading for recession, Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is running short of options to stem a slide in the peso, economists say, leaving the battered currency at the mercy of volatility in emerging markets.
Macri's government has already taken a series of measures to restore confidence in the peso since it came under pressure in May, reviving memories of a painful 2002 economic crisis in Latin America's third-largest economy. 
The peso, which has fallen around 40 percent so far this year, rivals the Turkish lira as the world's worst performing currency in 2018. 
Argentina's central bank hiked interest rates to 40 percent in May, and Macri sealed a $50-billion deal with the International Monetary Fund in June - removing the need for outside funding and briefly steadying the peso. His government has since announced more than $2 billion in budget savings. 
But jitters returned in recent weeks as Turkey's financial crisis roiled emerging markets, after Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump. Emerging market investors were already unnerved by the U.S.-China trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's tightening.
Confidence in Argentina was also shaken by a major corruption scandal in the construction sector, expected to damage economic growth already hit by a drought that crippled vital agricultural production.
The peso has tumbled 8.5 percent against the dollar in the past two weeks despite Argentina's central bank again hiking rates to 45 percent. On Wednesday, the bank was forced to sell $781 million in reserves to support the peso, before tightening reserve requirements a day later.
Such dizzying interest rates and the fiscal measures would normally be enough to halt a currency run but sentiment was being dictated by global events, said Alberto Bernal, chief strategist at XP Investments in New York.
""Seventy percent of the problems facing Argentina are external in nature,"" Bernal said. ""Macri needs luck ... He needs Trump to go easier against China and Europe. He needs Erdogan to come to his senses and he needs a weaker dollar, which means he needs the U.S. Federal reserve to be a little less aggressive in its policy guidelines.""
While economists are urging Turkey's Erdogan to adopt a series of policy measures to restore confidence in the economy - including strengthening central bank independence, raising interest rates and fiscal tightening - business-friendly Macri has already announced many of these.
A major challenge for Argentina is that interest rate rises have limited impact in fighting inflation because consumers and businesses use little credit after years of financial crises, economists say. Inflation jumped to 31 percent in June.
Last year, private sector credit made up just 16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in Argentina, compared to 113 percent in neighboring Chile, according to World Bank figures.
Similarly, on the fiscal front Macri's options are limited. He has already suspended a reduction in soy export taxes and unveiled other fiscal measures worth around $2.2 billion in savings.
Yet a weakening economy leaves Macri with few policy levers to pull without inflicting further damage. Despite high expectations at the start of 2018, the currency crisis and drought have slammed Argentina's $640 billion economy into reverse.
After growing 3.6 percent in the first quarter, the economy shrank 5.8 percent in May when the crisis struck, according to official statistics. It is due to re-enter recession in the third quarter, economists say, only two years after it returned to growth. 
With Macri expected to seek a second four-year term next year, major spending cuts and tax rises are politically unpalatable. 
Diego Ferro, partner and portfolio manager at Greylock Capital in New York, said that until recently investors had been happy with Argentina's gradualist approach, but market turmoil had made them impatient for results from Macri's government.
“They have shown that they are on the right path and under normal circumstances this would be enough,"" said Ferro. ""But after the disappointments they have suffered and the overall concern about emerging markets, it might not yet be enough to prompt a turnaround in the market.""
POLITICAL PRESSURES 
Some investors are also concerned that political pressures in Argentina will make it difficult to implement reforms. The changes to soy taxes have already proven unpopular with the farm lobby, a key base of his support.
Riot police were needed to control demonstrators in December when Congress passed pension changes. Unions have protested over planned labor reforms that have now stalled in the legislature, where there is resistance to the fiscal tightening required by the IMF deal.
Macri agreed with the Fund to cut Argentina's fiscal deficit from 3.7 percent of gross domestic product last year to 2.7 percent in 2018 and 1.3 percent in 2019. 
Many ordinary Argentines blame Macri for worsening inflation after cuts to public utility subsidies - a key plank of his economic platform - drove water and heating bills higher.
Macri admitted on Friday that poverty would rise this year because of high inflation.
""He's very constrained because of the social tensions that are blowing up due to the slowing economy,"" said Buenos Aires-based economist Gustavo Ber.
Economists expect the economy to contract 0.3 percent this year and grow 1.5 percent next year, according to the most recent central bank survey.
Macri has defended his gradual approach to reform, saying it was needed to shelter ordinary Argentines from a drop in living standards.
Yet for some, Macri squandered an opportunity for sweeping change after he was elected in 2015 amid frustration with outgoing President Cristina Fernandez's administration of 12 years of leftist rule.
""Macri is doing the right things but he's doing them two years too late,"" said Guillermo Nielsen, an economist and former finance secretary in the left-leaning government of Nestor Kirchner. 

""He did not make the changes that the Argentine economy needed to get back to growth,"" he said. ""I don't see Argentina coming back anytime soon.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will be more tightly monitored after it exits its bailout program than other euro zone countries that received similar loans, the head of the bloc's rescue mechanism told a Greek newspaper on Sunday.
Athens is set to exit its latest bailout on Aug. 20 and rely on bond markets thereafter to refinance its debt after a near nine-year debt crisis that shrank its economy by a quarter and forced it to implement painful austerity measures.
""Greece is exceptional. It has received much more loans from us than any other country,"" European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Managing Director Klaus Regling told Ethnos newspaper in an interview.
Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus, which borrowed from the ESM, were also monitored after the end of their assistance programs.
""No other program country has received anything comparable. Therefore, the monitoring will be tighter than in the other cases and this will take the form of the so-called enhanced surveillance,"" he said.
Since its debt crisis erupted in early 2010, Greece has relied on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros lent by its euro zone partners and the IMF.
Regling told the paper that enhanced surveillance, which was agreed by the European Commission in July, aims to ensure there will be no backtracking on reforms and the fiscal path agreed with Greece's lenders.
Under the tight monitoring, officials from European institutions including the ESM will visit Athens every three months for an assessment.
""As Greece's biggest creditor by far, the ESM also wants to make sure that we will be repaid. We are a very patient creditor. But we do want to be repaid. So we will follow developments in Greece very closely,"" Regling said.
Regling said he got ""a lot of extra gray hair"" in the summer of 2015 - the toughest period of the nine-year debt crisis - given the big clash between the leftist-led Greek government and its euro zone partners which led Athens to the brink of crashing out of the euro.
But, he said, Greece can be a ""success story"" just like Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Cyprus as long as it continues to work on restoring its partners' trust.
""(The end of the bailout) is great news! The Greek people should celebrate. From my visits to Athens, I have come to really appreciate Greek wines. But tomorrow, I will celebrate it with a good glass of ouzo,"" Regling told the paper.

2,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Trade War Won’t Dent China’s GDP,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Analysts are trying urgently to evaluate the potential impact of a full-fledged trade war on the Chinese economy. This typically involves estimating how much various tariff scenarios will reduce China’s GDP growth, with current estimates ranging from the minimal, 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points, to the substantial -- as much as 2 percentage points.
This is probably the right way to evaluate the impact of external shocks on other countries. For China, however, it’s wholly inappropriate. The fact is that Chinese GDP will be unaffected by a trade war with the U.S., no matter how severe, because the government will do whatever it takes to meet its growth targets.
That doesn’t mean higher tariffs won’t damage the Chinese economy. The pain will instead show up instead mainly in the form of a more rapid rise in debt. The harsher the war’s impact, in other words, the more debt China will need to achieve its growth target.
China’s Debt Bomb
To understand why, one needs to appreciate the difference between GDP growth as a system output and as a system input. In most economies, GDP is a measure of output generated by the economy. At the end of every period, during which the economy does what it does subject to standard economic constraints, government statisticians measure the relevant changes in activity and this is reported as the amount by which GDP expanded or contracted.
This isn’t what happens in China, as even Chinese leaders will occasionally admit. In China, the government sets the GDP growth rate early in the year at a level thought adequate to accommodate its social and political objectives, among which is to keep unemployment low. The political nature of the target modifies the standard economic constraints, encouraging local governments to generate whatever additional economic activity is required so that, along with the economic activity of the private and real-estate sectors, the target is reached (within a few tenths of a percentage point).
Two factors unique to China are critical for this system to work. First, till now local governments haven’t been subject to hard budget constraints. They can engage in near-unlimited amounts of non-productive economic activity unconstrained by worries about remaining solvent.
Second, and necessary for the first, local governments control most credit creation within the banking system. Because such loans are directly or indirectly guaranteed, banks don’t have to write down loans when the projects they fund cannot service the debt. This allows the banks to extend as much new credit as local governments need to meet their targets.
If, as is widely acknowledged even by the government, the amount of debt written down in every period is less than the amount of non-economic loans extended during that period, recorded GDP growth will rise, regardless of whether the underlying economy can or can’t generate enough activity on its own.
As long as China has debt capacity, and the government is willing to use it, China can achieve any GDP growth target it wants. Thus, while GDP numbers may tell us something about the government’s social and political priorities, they’re a poor measure of the underlying performance of the economy. They tell us even less about the impact of trade war on the Chinese economy.
This doesn’t mean there’s no way to evaluate the adverse impact of a trade conflict. As any systems analyst knows, while an input can never tell you anything about the performance of a system, an output can. What analysts need to examine is the appropriate output data, such as the amount of new credit needed to generate additional economic activity. This will show how much unproductive activity is required to reach the growth target. 
There’s one silver lining. Chinese leaders seem determined to get debt under control, which will ultimately require either giving up the growth target or lowering it considerably. A trade war, then, could be used politically, to overcome internal resistance to allowing GDP to slow. Pain is inevitable. The only question is whether China seeks to hide it, or use it to its long-term advantage.

3,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things To Watch This Week,"Investing.com - Trade talks between the United States and China are likely dominate market headlines in the week ahead following reports that the two countries are reportedly working on a plan to end their ongoing trade dispute.
U.S.-Sino trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies having an impact on economic growth.
Staying on the trade front, European trade officials will meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington Monday, while U.S. talks are expected to continue with Mexico, with a resolution appearing close in the long-running NAFTA saga.
The turmoil in Turkey, where markets are closed for most of the week for Eid al-Adha, could also remain a focus amid ongoing jitters over a currency crisis there due to a deepening diplomatic rift between Washington and Ankara.
Meanwhile, global financial markets will be fixated on the annual meeting of top central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Friday.
There is also the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting on Wednesday.
On the data front, a report on U.S. durable goods orders for July comes out on Friday, which should give further signs on the strength of the American economy at the start of the second half of the year.
Elsewhere, in Europe, market players will eye flash survey data on euro zone business activity for August - the most up-to-date snapshot of activity - to gauge if the region's economy is merely encountering a soft patch or entering a more lasting decline.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. U.S.-China Trade Talks
A nine-member delegation from Beijing, led by Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, will hold meetings with U.S. officials led by the Treasury undersecretary, David Malpass, in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday.
The lower-level trade talks offer financial markets a glimmer of hope that the globe's two largest economies could end trade tensions.
Chinese and U.S. negotiators are reportedly working on a plan to hold talks to end a trade dispute that would result in meetings between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a summit in November, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.
Washington and Beijing have been locked in escalating rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs since the start of the year, with $34 billion in goods targeted by each country and another $16 billion slated to go into effect this week.
Trump has threatened further tariffs on exports worth as much as $500 billion, as he tries to reduce a trade deficit and protect intellectual property rights.
Recent market action has suggested that so far China has been the big loser from the escalating trade conflict between the world's two largest economies - China's Shanghai Composite has lost around 20% this year, while the Chinese yuan is close to falling below 7.00 per dollar for the first time in over a decade.
The ongoing weakness in the yuan has prompted speculation that policymakers in Beijing are allowing their currency to weaken in order to offset the impact of U.S. trade tariffs.
2. Jackson Hole Summit
An annual meeting of top central bankers and economists hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is set to take place from Thursday to Saturday, with a keynote speech from Jerome Powell in the spotlight.
Fed chair Powell is due to deliver a speech titled ""Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy"" at 10:00AM ET Friday.
His comments will be closely watched for fresh policy signals from the world’s most powerful central bank.
In the past, Fed chairs have used speeches at the Kansas Fed-sponsored conference to signal future U.S. central bank policy moves.
3. Fed FOMC Meeting Minutes
The Federal Reserve will release minutes of its most recent policy meeting on Wednesday at 2:00PM ET.
The U.S. central bank held interest rates unchanged as was widely expected following its meeting on August 1 and gave an upbeat assessment of the world's biggest economy, staying on course to gradually lift interest rates.
The Fed has signaled to markets it will hike interest rates two more times this year, in September and December.
Against this backdrop, the U.S. central bank is shrinking its balance sheet by allowing maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet without replacing them.
4. U.S. Durable Goods Orders
The Commerce Department will publish data on durable goods orders for July at 8:30AM ET Friday.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show orders for durable goods declined 0.3% last month, following a gain of 0.8% in June.
Core orders are forecast to rise 0.5%, after increasing 0.2% a month earlier.
Besides the durable goods report, this week's rather light economic calendar also features U.S. data on existing and new home sales.
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Fed will raise rates twice more this year, with the next move higher coming at its September meeting.
Elsewhere, on Wall Street, the second quarter earnings season has wound down, but results are expected from a few mall-based retailers, including  Target  (NYSE:TGT), TJX (NYSE:TJX), Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS), L Brands (NYSE:LB), Gap (NYSE:GPS), and  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL).



5. Flash Euro Zone PMIs
IHS Markit's composite flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone is due at 0800GMT (4:00AM ET) on Thursday, amid expectations for an unchanged reading of 54.3.
The index measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors and is seen as a good guide to overall economic health.
Ahead of the euro zone PMI's, France and Germany will release their own PMI reports at 0700GMT and 0730GMT respectively.
The European Central Bank aims to end its bond purchasing program by the end of the year and has signaled a possible interest rate hike next year.
However, worries that growth in the region appears to have peaked, combined with concerns over a trade dispute with the U.S., have brought the ECB pessimists out of the woodwork in recent weeks.

4,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>","Tariffs Will Hurt U.S. More Than Rest of World, Maersk Says","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy will be hit many times harder than the rest of the world by an escalating global trade war, according the the chief executive officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S.
Soren Skou, who runs the world’s biggest shipping company from Copenhagen, said the fallout of the current protectionist wave “could easily end up being bigger in the U.S.” Tariffs could slow global annual trade growth by 0.1 to 0.3 percent, though for the U.S. the effect could be “perhaps 3 or 4 percent,” he said at Maersk’s headquarters on Friday. “And that would definitely not be good.”
The company transports about 20 percent of the world’s seaborne consumer goods, putting it in a unique position to gauge the fallout of tariffs on trade flows. Maersk has in the past broken with its culture of steering clear of any political debate to criticize the trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Maersk focuses on trade flows between Europe and Asia and so far its industry hasn’t been directly hurt by tariffs. In fact, demand grew 4 percent in the second quarter. But Skou says that may change if the U.S. starts targeting consumer goods.
“The first thing the American importers would do if tariffs are put on Chinese consumer goods would be to buy in Vietnam, in Indonesia or elsewhere in Asia,” Skou said. “Big U.S. consumer brands like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) produce in all of Asia, not just in one country, so there will be a substitution effect.”
The U.S. put duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month, citing unfair trade practices by the world’s second-biggest economy. The Trump administration has said it will impose tariffs on a further $16 billion on Aug. 23, and even signaled it won’t shy away from targeting the entire $500 billion in Chinese exports to the U.S.
“The other factor is that there’s a lot of stuff that’s now imported into the U.S. that just isn’t produced anywhere within the U.S.,” Skou said. “You can’t get Nike sneakers or iPhones that are produced in the U.S. So it will end up being pushed on to the consumer.”

5,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 04:27AM ET</span>",China regulator asks financial institutions to support infrastructure investment,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking and insurance regulator has asked financial institutions to give more support to infrastructure investment, importers and exporters, and creditworthy companies experiencing temporary problems.
In a statement posted on its website late on Saturday, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission also called on the institutions to raise the proportion of medium- and long-term loans to avoid placing strain on borrowers at the end of the month or quarter.
The move comes amid a period of uncertainty for China's economy, in part because of an intensifying trade row with the United States. China almost quadrupled the value of fixed-asset investment projects approved in July from the previous month as it looks to accelerate infrastructure spending.
On Saturday, the regulator called on banks and insurers to address ""weak points"" in China's infrastructure sector and cooperate with local governments to identify their needs but be careful about raising their hidden debt levels.
It also said financial institutions should not ""blindly"" withdraw funding from companies that have a good credit record but that are experiencing ""temporary operational difficulties,"" without naming any such firms.
Support should also be given to foreign trade and export-oriented firms affected by the situation on the international market and going through problems but retain good development prospects, it added.
Growth in China's exports and imports accelerated in July despite fresh U.S. tariffs, while its trade surplus with the United States remained near record highs.

Earlier this month, the regulator said it would guide financial institutions to expand financing, including to qualified private companies and small businesses.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 12:57AM ET</span>","Promises, promises, Imran Khan raises Pakistani hopes sky high","By Saad Sayeed and Drazen Jorgic
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - From creating 10 million jobs to building an Islamic welfare state and restoring Pakistan's tattered image abroad, new premier Imran Khan is facing a problem of his own making: runaway expectations raised by his lofty rhetoric.
A cricket legend and firebrand nationalist who is hero-worshipped by supporters, Khan swept to power in last month's election on a populist platform vowing to root out corruption among a venal elite and lift people out of poverty.
But he inherits control of a volatile nation facing mounting problems at home and abroad, including a looming economic crisis and a fracture with historic ally the United States over Pakistan's alleged links to militants. Ties are also fraught with neighbors Afghanistan and nuclear-armed rival India.
Opponents in parliament talk of forming a grand coalition against Khan, dubbing him a ""puppet"" and accusing him of entering into a Faustian Pact with the powerful military, which has a history of ousting prime ministers and clashing with civilian governments over control of foreign policy.
Khan denies all accusations that the military covertly helped him win the election.
And in his victory speech, Khan offered an olive branch to India and called for mutually beneficial ties with the United States.
Whether Khan can become the first Pakistani prime minister to complete a full five-year term in office will depend on his relationship with influential generals, analysts say.
If his ideas on foreign policy differ from theirs, analysts say Khan would suffer a similar fate to other civilian leaders who have failed to see out their term.
""Then his future will be the same as anybody else's,"" political commentator Aamer Ahmed Khan said.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
Forced to rely on smaller parties for a razor-thin majority in parliament, and with the opposition controlling the Senate, Khan's coalition government could struggle to push through legislation without major compromises. An increasingly assertive judiciary could also hold it back.
Yet the mood in the country is one of unbridled optimism, especially among Khan's young supporters, who believe he can build a corruption-free and prosperous ""New Pakistan"" for the country's 208 million people.
""His biggest challenge is managing expectations among his followers and voters because he's almost promised them the moon,"" said Raza Ahmad Rumi, the editor of Pakistan's Daily Times newspaper.
During Independence Day celebrations this week, when flag-waving Pakistanis flooded the streets of Islamabad, many voiced confidence that Khan would deliver on promises to build world class hospitals and improve education in a nation where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent.
""I have moved my daughter (from a private) to a government school, because we are confident that Pakistan is going to change,"" said Sheikh Farhaj, 40, who volunteered for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party during the elections.
Others were delighted Khan has broken the decades-long dominance of the two dynastic powerhouses, the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party of jailed former premier Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of the Bhutto family.
""We have great expectations from Imran Khan,"" said Shah Sultan, 38, a roadside flag seller. ""We are lower class people and I voted from Khan because what the politicians have done to our country. They have left it with nothing.""
LOOMING ECONOMIC CRISIS
But Khan's campaign pledges are likely to be checked by a worsening economic outlook, analysts say, especially his vow to build a welfare state.
The central bank has devalued the rupee four times since December, but the current account deficit is still carrying the currency toward a crisis, while the fiscal deficit has ballooned to 6.8 percent of GDP.
Economic growth is running at nearly 6 percent, but given the unsustainability of these deficits it is easy to predict Pakistan's growth is heading for a fall.
Khan's government must urgently decide whether to request more loans from China, deepening Islamabad's economic reliance on its neighbor, or ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for what would be its 15th bailout since 1980.
Both lenders are likely to ask for more fiscal discipline, requiring drastic spending cuts.
Shafqat Mahmood, Khan's new education minister, said the economic woes pose a major problem but the party is determined to deliver a welfare system and enact badly-needed reforms.
""Everyone in the party realizes we will have to work overtime to meet these huge expectations,"" Mahmood said.
Mahmood said Khan's image as a politician untainted by corruption could boost faith in the government and convince more people to file taxes in a nation where less than 1 percent of the population pays income tax.
Khan has touted his ""100 Day Plan"" but many of the reforms PTI is proposing, from turning around loss-making state-run enterprises to reforming the tax collection bureau, will take far longer to accomplish. 
Ending government corruption outright, or repatriating plundered wealth, is also unlikely.
""(Khan's supporters) have a simplistic idea that if there is a clean man on top, the entire machinery becomes clean. That's never the case anywhere in the world,"" said Rumi.

“We’re determined to ensure that we get behind our farmers and help them,” Turnbull said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. “This is the worst drought in this part of the country, in New South Wales in particular, since the 1960s.”
The dry spell has already taken a toll on the country’s grain producers, with a report by INTL FCStone Inc. showing wheat exports in 2018/19 are likely to be the lowest in 11 years. Dry conditions are set to continue well into the southern hemisphere spring, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest climate outlook published last week.
Among the measures included in the new package are as much as A$75 million in handouts distributed across sixty drought-affected councils in the east coast states of NSW and Queensland for spending on local infrastructure, and a doubling in the amount of low-interest loans available to farmers. Turnbull also announced the appointment of a national drought coordinator to work with farmers and local organizations.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe says the drought is having a negative impact on the economy, telling a parliamentary committee on Friday that the dry conditions will limit farm production."
8,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 10:32PM ET</span>",Venezuelan shopkeepers alarmed by Maduro's latest economic moves,"By Mircely Guanipa and Anggy Polanco
PUNTO FIJO/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - After Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's 60-fold increase to the minimum wage, storeowners on Saturday wrestled with an anguishing decision: Close up shop or hit customers with steep price hikes at the risk of sinking the business.
In a set of sweeping announcements that shocked many Venezuelans, the socialist Maduro on Friday ordered a 96 percent currency devaluation, pegged the bolivar currency to the government's petro cryptocurrency and boosted taxes as part of a plan aimed at pulling the OPEC member out of its economic tailspin.
The measures especially spooked shopkeepers already struggling to stay afloat due to hyperinflation, government-set prices for goods ranging from flour to diapers, and strict currency controls that crimp imports. Many stores were closed on Saturday as owners hunkered down to consider the implications.
Economists warned that some companies would go under, unable to shoulder the massive increase in monthly minimum wage from 3 million bolivars to 180 million bolivars, or roughly $0.5 to $30. That will likely increase unemployment and further fuel mass emigration that has overwhelmed neighboring South American countries.
Jhonny Herrera, 41, owner of a hardware store on the windswept Paraguana Peninsula in northern Venezuela, said he would have to fire two employees because he cannot afford to pay them, leaving him with just one worker. When Venezuela was enjoying a decade-long oil bonanza, he had 10 employees.
""I have thought about closing for good and leaving, all the more so now with these increases. I have held back due to my 14 year-old-son, who I would leave here because I need to emigrate first,"" said Herrera, surrounded by stores that have been shuttered after their owners fled the country.
To soften the blow, Maduro vowed that the government would cover three months of the wage increase for small and medium-sized companies. But he did not provide details and it remains unclear how his cash-starved government would afford such a hefty payout or whether the chaotic administration has the logistical capacity to pay wages on time.
The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for an explanation of the plan. Venezuela's opposition called for protests and a national strike on Tuesday, although
recent attempts by the fractured coalition to rally Venezuelans have had little impact.
Venezuela's main business chamber, Fedecamaras, said it did not have any estimates on the effects of the measure yet, although local economists predicted a heavy toll.
""A minimum wage of 180 million bolivars in this current situation implies the closure of thousands of companies and the unemployment of many people,"" said economist Luis Oliveros.
Bakery owner Luis Carballo, a 59-year-old who has worked in the bread sector for 45 years, said he would try to stay afloat but was full of dread.
""I have to increase prices ... And if I don't sell, production drops, and I have to suspend some of my employees. I feel really badly,"" said Carballo, as he handed loaves to customers in the Andean city of San Cristobal.

Outside another bakery in San Cristobal, security guard Victor Martinez fretted with a friend about the measures.""This is worsening the situation. I'm scared of losing my job,"" said Martinez.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>","Greek central bank chief warns over backtracking, turbulence post-bailout","ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's central bank governor warned the country not to backtrack on commitments to its lenders after it exits the last of its three bailouts next week, saying markets would abandon it.
Yannis Stournaras told Sunday's Kathimerini newspaper any backpedalling could leave Greece facing major risks at a time when it would be particularly vulnerable to financial turbulence in neighboring Turkey, Italy and beyond.
Athens is set to exit its latest bailout on Aug. 20 and rely on bond markets thereafter to refinance its debt after a nearly nine-year debt crisis that shrank its economy by a quarter and forced it to implement painful austerity.
""If we backtrack on what we have agreed, now or in the future, the markets will abandon us and we will not be able to refinance maturing loans on sustainable-debt terms,"" Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras told the paper.
Since the debt crisis exploded in early 2010, four successive governments fought to keep bankruptcy at bay, relying on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros lent by Greece's euro zone partners and the IMF.
Shut out of bond markets after a fiscal derailment, Greece officially asked for a bailout in April 2010 with the International Monetary Fund and its euro zone partners granting 110 billion euros in loans to avert a financial meltdown. Two more aid packages followed.
Athens returned to sovereign debt markets in July 2017 with a 3.0 billion euro bond sale that marked a milestone in its return to economic health.
""If there is strong international turbulence, either in our neighboring Italy or Turkey or in the global economy, we will face difficulties in tapping markets given that the sensitivity coefficient of Greek bonds remains high,"" Stournaras said.
But this, the second risk, is more manageable, he said, and should wane as long as markets become convinced that Greece is pursuing the right economic policy and keeping its promises.
""Let's not forget the euro zone still has gaps in its architecture. The banking union has not been completed, thus any convulsion affects its weaker member-states more,"" he said.
Post–bailout, Athens has committed to attain demanding primary budget surpluses - excluding debt servicing outlays - of 3.5 percent of GDP until 2022, and 2.2 percent until 2060.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Greek newspaper To Vima that the goal of Greece's economic adjustment programme was the country's return to normality and that its bailout exit is a ""great success.""
But the agreed commitments must be adhered to. 

""The commitments assumed by Greece for the future are clear, particularly on primary surpluses and the maintenance of the reforms momentum. I have no doubt that they will be respected,"" the minister was quoted as saying.

Iran has been trying to implement standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental organization which underpins regimes combating money laundering and terrorist financing. It hopes it will be removed from a blacklist that makes some foreign investors reluctant to deal with it.
In June, FATF said Iran had until October to complete the reforms or face consequences that could further deter investors from the country, which has already been hit by the return of U.S. sanctions.
Hardliners in parliament have opposed legislation aimed at moving toward compliance with FATF standards, arguing it could hamper Iranian financial support for allies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which the United States has classified as a terrorist organization.
The Guardian Council, which vets legislation passed by parliament for compliance with the constitution, objected to four items in the anti-money laundering amendments and returned the measure to parliament, spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei was quoted by the judiciary's news agency Mizan as saying.
Kadkhodaei did not give details of the four items, according to Mizan.
Earlier this month, the Guardian Council approved legal amendments on combating the funding of terrorism.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in June parliament should pass legislation to combat money laundering according to its own criteria.
Foreign businesses say legislation that includes FATF guidelines is essential if they are to increase investment.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro announced on Friday a single exchange rate pegged to his socialist government’s petro cryptocurrency, effectively devaluing by 96 percent in a move economists said would fan hyperinflation in the chaotic country.
In one of the biggest economic overhauls of Maduro's five-year government, the former bus driver and union leader also said he would hike the minimum wage by over 3,000 percent, boost the corporate tax rate, and increase highly-subsidized gas prices in coming weeks.
""I want the country to recover and I have the formula. Trust me,"" Maduro said in a nighttime speech broadcast on state television.
But economists expressed doubts that Venezuela’s cash-strapped government, which faces U.S. sanctions and has defaulted on its bondholders, would succeed.
Venezuelans will see their meager salaries further erodedand companies will struggle with major increases to both taxes and the minimum wage, they said.
“Amid this aggressive devaluation and monetary expansions due to salaries and bonuses, we are expecting a much more aggressive stage of hyperinflation. All the more so in a context where the elimination of excessive money printing is not credible. The worst of all worlds,” said Venezuelan economist Asdrubal Oliveros of consultancy Ecoanalitica.
The International Monetary Fund has predicted that inflation in Venezuela would hit 1 million percent this year.
After a decade-long oil bonanza that spawned a consumption boom in the OPEC member, many poor citizens are now reduced to scouring through garbage to find food as monthly salaries amount to a few U.S. dollars a month.
Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have emigrated by bus across South America in one of the region's worst migration crises.
""World champions in economic disasters!"" opposition leader Henrique Capriles tweeted after Maduro's announcement. ""No Venezuelan deserves to live this tragedy or that these incapable people destroy our nation!""
'PETROLIZING'
Maduro said he would overhaul Venezuela's disparate exchange rates and peg salaries, pensions, and prices to the petro, a cryptocurrency launched by the government earlier this year.
It was not immediately clear how the government intended to carry out the financial changes and the Information ministry did not respond to a request for details.
Cryptocurrency experts have cast doubt on the petro as a functional financial instrument, citing a lack of clear details on how it operates and U.S. sanctions that make it off limits.
President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order barring any U.S.-based financial transactions involving the petro, with officials warning that the Venezuelan cryptocurrency was a “scam.""
Venezuela's government has not provided a clear breakdown of petro investors or how much they have collected from the cryptocurrency's sale.
Maduro argues that he is the victim of a Washington-led ""economic war"" designed to sabotage his administration through sanctions and price-gouging. He has vowed that the petro will abolish the ""tyranny"" of the dollar and lead to an economic rebirth in Venezuela, home to the world's biggest crude reserves.
Economists, however, point to Venezuela's strict currency controls, botched nationalizations, and excessive money creation as the root causes of its economic crisis.
Maduro said on Friday that one petro would equal $60 and have the equivalent of 360 million bolivars. That implies a new exchange rate of 6 million bolivars per dollar, broadly on par with widely used black market exchange rates, entailing a 96 percent devaluation compared with the current official DICOM rate of 248,832 bolivars per dollar.
""They've dollarized our prices. I am petrolizing salaries and petrolizing prices,"" Maduro said. ""We are going to convert the petro into the reference that pegs the entire economy's movements.""

Maduro added that the minimum wage would amount to ""half a petro,"" baffling some Venezuelans and sparking the Twitter hashtag #BlackFriday.

The hearings will be held Aug. 20-24 and on Aug. 27, from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. EDT (1330-2200 GMT), the USTR said in a statement. The agency released a list of 359 people who will present testimony, representing a wide swath of U.S. companies producing goods ranging from home building supplies to technology products, bicycles and apparel.
Most are companies that have registered complaints about the higher costs they say they will face due to the tariffs, which are expected to take effect in late September after a public comment period ends on Sept. 5. 
President Donald Trump has threatened 25 percent tariffs on the $200 billion list of Chinese imports because of China's retaliatory tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. products in the two countries' escalating trade war.
The latest U.S. list will hit consumer products harder than tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese components now in place and $16 billion worth of semiconductors and other products that will take effect on Aug. 23.

The list includes a wide range of consumer goods including car tires, furniture, lighting and wood products, suitcases, dog and cat food, baseball gloves and bicycles.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 05:28PM ET</span>","Venezuelans rush to shop, fill tanks before monetary overhaul","By Shaylim Castro and Isaac Urrutia
CARACAS/MARACAIBO (Reuters) - Jittery Venezuelans on Friday rushed to shops and lined up at gas stations on concerns that a monetary overhaul to lop off five zeros from prices in response to hyperinflation could wreak financial havoc and make basic commerce impossible.
Shoppers sought to ensure their homes were fully stocked with essentials such as food and dry goods and their tanks full before the measure decreed by President Nicolas Maduro takes effect on Monday.
Inflation hit 82,700 percent in July, according to the opposition-run congress, as the country's socialist economic model continued to unravel, meaning purchases of basic items such as a bar of soap or a kilo of tomatoes require piles of cash that is often difficult to obtain.
""I came to buy vegetables, but I'm leaving because I'm not going to wait in this line,"" said Alicia Ramirez, 38, a business administrator, leaving a supermarket in the western city of Maracaibo. ""People are going crazy."" 
The change appears unlikely to generate the chaos of December 2016 when Maduro removed the largest note in circulation without providing a replacement for it. That led to protests, lootings and hundreds of arrests as the country was effectively left without legal tender.
Drivers also rushed to fill up on Venezuela's heavily-subsidized gas, the world's cheapest at around 2,896 gallons per U.S. penny. Some drivers were worried about paying for gas come Monday as there will be no new legal tender small enough to pay for a full tank. 
Maduro also said this month that gas price should be increased, but has not provided a timeframe for the price hike. A half-dozen sources at service stations said they had not been briefed about any changes and were not expecting an imminent rise in prices. 
""It's better to be safe than to try to go out during the weekend and not to find open gas stations... I think people are more sad than angry about this,"" said teacher Ana Perez, 50, as she lined up in a station in the once industry-filled city of Valencia. 
Maduro, who has said the country is victim of an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries, said the new monetary measure would bring economic stability to the struggling OPEC nation.
But his critics have said the move is little more than an accounting maneuver that would do nothing to slow soaring prices. They blame inflation on failed socialist policies and indiscriminate money printing.
Because many transactions now happen via debit cards over point-of-sale terminals, many worry that the change - which banking industry leaders have said was carried out too quickly - could collapse financial networks.
Maduro has declared a public holiday for Monday, when a new set of bills will be introduced with the lower denominations. Internet banking operations will be halted for several hours starting on Sunday evening. 
But the primary difference between the upcoming change and Maduro's 2016 currency decision is that in this instance, most of the current ones will coexist with the new notes for an undetermined period while the new bills come into circulation. 
That will in some circumstances leave consumers in the confusing situation of having to use old bills with face value of 1,000,000 bolivars to make purchases valued at 10 bolivars in the new denomination.
Poor Venezuelans without bank accounts have for months been carrying wads of cash to make basic purchases. 
Buying one kilo of cheese, worth the equivalent of $1.14 at the most widely used exchange rate, requires 7,500 notes of 1,000 bolivar denomination - a note that was only brought fully into circulation in 2017.
One bar of soap, which sells for the equivalent of $0.53, requires 3,500 of the same notes.

""This is going to be complete disaster, we don't have information,"" said Yoleima Manrique, 42, assistant manager of a home appliance store in Caracas. ""It's going to be crazy for the clients and for us.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday he hopes to conclude by the middle of next week outstanding bilateral issues with the United States surrounding the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
""Hopefully we will be able to close up no later than the middle of the week,"" Guajardo told reporters outside the U.S. Trade Representative's office, adding that Canada could then rejoin the talks to rework the trade pact.
Most of the issues between Mexico and the United States are ""advancing well,"" the minister added.
Some areas related to auto rules of origin remain unresolved, including the time frame to implement changes in the new rules, while a ""sunset clause"" that could kill NAFTA after five years has not yet been discussed, Guajardo said.
Mexico's foreign minister Luis Videgaray, in Washington with Guajardo for meetings with U.S. officials, also struck an optimistic note, saying ""we are getting close"" when asked about the likelihood of reaching a breakthrough.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday had expressed hope for a breakthrough in the coming days. U.S. President Donald Trump, however, said alongside him he was in ""no rush"" to conclude talks on NAFTA, which he wants renegotiated in favor of the United States. 
Trump argues the 24-year-old pact has facilitated an exodus of manufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexico, but NAFTA's supporters say it has kept the region competitive. 
The renegotiation has now dragged on for a year.

Mexican and U.S. ministers will meet again on Tuesday, Guajardo said, after a sectoral meeting on Monday to discuss financial issues related to government action.

In a statement posted on its website on Friday, the UN Human Rights Committee said it has ""requested Brazil to take all necessary measures to ensure that Lula can enjoy and exercise his political rights while in prison, as candidate in the 2018 presidential elections."" After losing an appeal against his conviction for corruption and money-laundering, Lula is serving a 12-year prison sentence. Under Brazilian law, he is ineligible to run for election.
In a sign of the increasingly febrile atmosphere surrounding Brazil’s elections, supporters of the ex-president said the committee’s recommendation strengthened their argument that Lula’s conviction is politically motivated, while opponents insisted it ignored Brazilian law.
Implemented during Lula’s presidency, the so-called ""clean slate law"" bars Brazilians convicted of criminal offenses by an appeals court from running for office during eight years. Despite the fact Lula now falls foul of this law, leaders from his Workers’ Party insist that he will be their candidate in October’s elections. On Wednesday, tens of thousands marched on Brazil’s top electoral court to support the registration of his candidacy.
Itamaraty, the Brazilian foreign ministry, issued a statement shortly after the publication of the UN Human Rights Committee, clarifying that the Committee consists of individual specialists operating in a personal capacity and not nation states. It added that the conclusions of the committee are recommendations and do not have any ""legally binding effects"".
Nevertheless, it stated that the Committee’s deliberations would be sent to Brazil’s judiciary."

American negotiators dropped their demand in the last week to erect barriers against seasonal imports of a wide variety of Mexican farm goods, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing private negotiations. Two of them said the countries may agree to narrower restrictions on some Mexican produce, such as tomatoes.
The Trump administration, under pressure from growers in Florida and Georgia, had sought since September to limit imports of Mexican agricultural products like strawberries and blueberries. The Mexican negotiating team had considered the original U.S. proposal to be unacceptable and a violation of World Trade Organization rules.
The press offices of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo didn’t return emails seeking comment on the development.
Car Manufacturing
The countries are also making progress on the thorny issue of car manufacturing, as the Trump administration pushes for a deal that would boost factory jobs in America. The U.S. has proposed tightening regional content requirements for car production and having a certain percentage of a car manufactured by higher-paid workers.
Negotiators are now focused on the amount of time companies would have to transition to the new rules, according to two other people, who asked not to be named discussing private discussions.
The progress comes as the two countries race to finish working out changes to the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been under negotiation for a year. The U.S. and Mexico are pushing for an agreement this month that would give the countries time to sign the pact before Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office in December.
‘Very Close’
Canada, the third partner in Nafta, has been absent from face-to-face talks in recent weeks. The Trump administration has said an agreement with Mexico will put pressure on Canada to soften some of its demands.
“We’re very very close to a deal with Mexico,” Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Friday on Fox Business Network. “There are a few sticking points, but there’s been so much progress made.”
Guajardo also sounded an optimistic note Friday, where he wrapped up his fourth straight week of discussions with Lighthizer.
“We are advancing,” the Mexican economy minister told reporters in Washington. “Most of the agenda -- Mexico-U.S. -- has been advancing well, and we still have to be back next week.”

The kingdom’s oil production averaged 10.2 million barrels a day in 2017, down from 10.5 million barrels in 2016, Saudi Aramco said in its annual review published Friday. Crude oil reserves stood at 256.74 billion barrels and condensates were 4.1 billion. Natural gas production rose to 12.4 billion standard cubic feet a day, up from 12.03 billion standard cubic feet in 2016.
Saudi Arabia led the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ decision to cut oil production in January 2017 to shrink global inventories and bolster international crude prices. In June, after the market started to re-balance, OPEC and its partners, including Russia, decided to increase production by around 1 million barrels a day to meet consumer demand.
The price for benchmark Brent crude rose about 41 percent over the past 12 months. Aramco accounts for all of Saudi Arabia’s oil output because a production zone it shares with neighboring Kuwait is closed.
Upstream discoveries last year included two oil fields and one gas deposit, compared with one gas field and two oil deposits in 2016, the company said.
""Saudi Aramco is moving steadily to build a world leading position in the downstream segment of the business,"" Chairman Khalid Al-Falih, who is also Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, said in the review.
Saudi Aramco, which plans to sell a stake of around 5 percent in an initial public offering, signaled another potential delay for what could be the world’s largest IPO after it began talks last month to buy a strategic stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp., known as Sabic, from the country’s sovereign wealth fund.
Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive officer, told Arabiya television in an interview that “a potential Sabic deal would affect the timeframe for Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering.”

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - More Argentines are likely living in poverty now compared with last year, President Mauricio Macri said on Friday, as the country's economy slides toward recession following a currency crisis and a severe drought that harmed farm output.
Argentina's economy has taken a beating in 2018 after the run on the peso currency prompted the government to secure a $50 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund. The peso touched record lows again this month as investors fled emerging market assets due to concerns about Turkey's economy.
""This devaluation brought a rebound in inflation, and inflation is the largest driver of poverty, and regrettably, we are going to lose some of the gains we have made in poverty reduction,"" Macri told a news conference in the northwestern province of Jujuy. 
Argentina's 12-month inflation rate was 31.2 percent in July.
Poverty in Argentina decreased last year to 25.7 percent from 30.3 percent in 2016, according to Argentina's official statistics agency, Indec.
Indec is expected to publish statistics on poverty for the first half of 2018 at the end of September. The Argentine Observatory of Social Debt, a think tank affiliated with Argentina's Catholic University said last month it expects a 2-3 percent increase in poverty rates in 2018.
Economists expect the economy to contract 0.3 percent this year and grow 1.5 percent next year, according to the most recent central bank survey.
""Next year the economy will grow,"" Macri said. ""Not much, but it will grow.""

Macri's government began publishing poverty statistics in 2016 in a reversal from the former populist government, which stopped publishing poverty rates in 2013. At the time, the government said just 5 percent of Argentines lived in poverty, a rate lower than Germany's.

The Turkish Grain Board is planning to issue international tenders to buy the grain, according to an official at the country’s state buyer. The purchases may be made immediately after next week’s Bayram national holiday, he said.
Benchmark wheat prices in Chicago have climbed by about a third this year amid concerns over supplies after drought and extreme weather hurt crops in the top grain-exporting nations. A correction in prices over the past two weeks has already attracted major importers to the market, with the world’s biggest buyer, Egypt, taking the unusual step of accelerating purchases by tendering for two deliveries.
Turkish flour millers, local traders and the state grain board met Wednesday to assess the market situation, the official said. While the board, known as the TMO, hasn’t decided on the timing and the quantity of the wheat purchase, it’s working on the tender procedures, he said.
Turkish importers are under extra pressure after the lira renewed its slide Friday to trade near a record low against the dollar as a deepening rift with Washington plunges the economy into turmoil. Turkey has undertaken a series of measures to try to stabilize prices and rein in double-digit inflation.
Releasing Stockpiles
To shore up wheat supplies, the government has allocated 750,000 metric tons of imports to be duty-free until May 2019. The decree is a step toward ""attaining price stability in the market,"" the board’s Chairman Ismail Kemaloglu said in a tweet earlier this week.
The TMO has also started the process of selling domestic wheat stockpiles, the official said. The move may forestall hikes by domestic sellers, who are seeking to raise prices in lira to match more expensive dollar-denominated grain.
“Domestic prices are expected to increase after Bayram in line with international prices,” said Gulfem Eren, chairwoman of Turkey’s Grain Suppliers Association.
The purchases by the TMO would be part of an effort secure supplies for local companies and curb inflation, Veysel Kaya, the founder of Sunseedman, a consultancy and brokerage based in Edirne, Turkey. All signs point to TMO being “at the scene with the international tenders soon,” he said.
Turkey, the world’s top flour exporter, imported about 6.2 million tons of wheat in the year ended June, according to International Grains Council estimates."
20,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them:
1/SE7EN
The Chinese yuan is under pressure, and close to falling below 7.00 per dollar for the first time in over a decade. It got some respite this week as talks planned for later this month between lower-level officials from Beijing and Washington offered a glimmer of hope that the two superpowers may work towards a solution to their escalating trade conflict. Chinese policymakers are not taking any chances, though, banning some offshore lending to discourage short-selling and support the yuan.
The currency has lost around 10 pct since March, with trade tensions adding to worries about a slowing economy. Fixed asset investment, industrial output and retail sales data in the past week were all on the soft side. 
A light schedule of data releases this week should take some pressure off the yuan. But global aversion towards emerging markets might still push it towards the 7.00/$ level that many see as a line in the sand Beijing authorities will defend to prevent further currency weakness and capital outflows.
China's slowing growth: https://reut.rs/2vQy20q
2/YEAH, I'M GOING TO JACKSON HOLE
It's that time of year again. Jackson Hole time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Friday, Aug. 24, at the annual global central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He will speak on monetary policy in a changing economy at the start of the two-day conference. In the past, Fed chairs have used speeches at the Kansas Fed-sponsored conference to signal future U.S. central bank policy moves. 
The Fed has signaled to markets it will hike interest rates in September and possibly December. Against this backdrop, the U.S. central bank is shrinking its balance sheet by allowing maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet without replacing them. 
Some analysts and investors say the Fed could mention the balance sheet in its latest minutes, to be released Aug. 22, and that could also be a major focus at Jackson Hole. And what about the waves of Turkey-fueled risk aversion crashing around global markets? Will Powell nod to that or the damage higher U.S. rates and a rising dollar are doing to emerging markets?

3/BEWARE THE EM BEARS
The grizzly conditions in emerging markets will remain front and center. Emerging stocks have just entered bear market territory, the Turkish lira and Argentine peso are locked in turmoil, the yuan and Chinese tech stocks are wobbling and the three R's - the South African rand, Russian rouble and Indian rupee - are all flashing a deep shade of crimson.
There are a number of events watch out for next week. Chinese and U.S. officials meet in Washington, just before new U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods are due to take effect. 
Turkey's markets are closed for most of the week for eid al adha, which could make things volatile because the U.S. Treasury has warned Ankara to expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson. A Turkish court on Friday rejected an appeal for his release.
There could also be progress in the long-running NAFTA saga that has been hanging over Mexico. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed hope on Thursday that a breakthrough could be made in the coming days, though his Mexican counterpart Ildefonso Guajardo cautioned flexibility will be needed.
Emerging market FX: https://reut.rs/2L0XBk4
4/KING DOLLAR
The dollar's status as the go-to currency in times of market turbulence has been reinforced by the Turkish crisis and fallout. It's risen to its strongest level in over a year, but few analysts are prepared to call the peak just yet. 
It's up a blistering 8 pct since mid-April, and few currencies have been left unscathed: countries with big current account deficits have taken a beating, the offshore yuan had slid to a 19-month low, while the euro, sterling and Australian dollar are all at their weakest in more than a year. 
The Fed's interest rate hikes and buoyant U.S. economy have boosted the greenback, at the same time inflicting increasing damage on emerging markets. As the Bank for International Settlements said last month: ""When the dollar is weak, there tends to be greater appetite for risk, but a stronger dollar often goes hand in hand with the reversal of risk attitudes.""
U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter this week to proclaim that money ""is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before."" There may be more upside ahead.
Dollar on a roll: https://reut.rs/2L0H4gc
5/REMEMBER 'EUROBOOM'? 
The days of #Euroboom seem far behind us, with trade wars, a weakened Angela Merkel and crisis in Italian politics bringing the euro zone pessimists out of the woodwork in recent months. What's more, growth appears to have peaked.
On the other hand, the euro's slide to $1.13, its weakest in over a year, will be welcomed in the corridors of power in euro zone capitals and ECB Towers in Frankfurt. Purchasing managers index data, the most up-to-date snapshot of activity, should tell us whether growth is picking up or not. 
ECB watchers will be paying close attention. Signs of resilience in the euro zone economy will allow the ECB to go ahead with its gradual withdrawal of stimulus. Signs of weakness, especially against a backdrop of severe emerging market volatility, might make them think twice. Mario Draghi may share his thoughts on this and more at Jackson Hole.

21,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Trump, Erdogan, Bezos – Jackson Hole Rogues: Economy Week Ahead","(Bloomberg) -- Who are the biggest source of trouble for the Federal Reserve?
U.S. President Donald Trump for launching a trade war? Turkish President Recep Erdogan for roiling emerging markets? Or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). founder Jeff Bezos and other corporate titans for contributing to a decline in market competition?
The Jackson Hole symposium, the Kansas Fed’s annual retreat which starts Aug. 23, will be provide an opportunity for policy makers and academics to consider those questions. Finding answers will be harder to achieve.
For investors, Trump’s trade war is back on the agenda as China prepares to send Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen to the U.S. later this month to resume talks. That in itself was enough to lower the temperature in China’s markets, with the yuan halting its slide toward seven to the dollar. Still, another U.S. duties on $16 billion of Chinese products are set to take effect next week and lawmakers will hold hearings on another $200 billion.
For the Fed, there’s a scenario where a combination of high tariffs and an economy operating at full capacity shifts inflation dynamics. The current tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports, though, are too small to move the dial. It would take a step change in protectionism to command serious attention from monetary policy makers.
In his own hole and still digging, Erdogan is also captivating the market. For the Fed, though, the inability of the emerging market tail to wag the advanced economy dog means the focus of attention will be elsewhere. Emerging markets as a share of global gross domestic product, imports, and equity market capitalization are on a falling trend.
That leaves Bezos and other corporate titans as part of a larger discussion on reduced competition. The symposium is titled ‘Changing Market Structure and Implications for Monetary Policy’ – a hint at the way dominant firms like Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). are changing dynamics across the economy.A 2017 paper authored by David Autor and others found that the rise of superstar firms with very high productivity resulted in a fall in the labor share of income. A 2018 paper by Jason Furman and Peter Orszag pointed in the same direction, and suggested that reduced competition is contributing to lower productivity growth and increased inequality.
For the Fed, those trends – pointing to structural drivers of low growth and muted inflation – are certainly alarming. At the same time, the forces driving reduced competition are largely outside of the control of monetary policy. If superstar firms are the new villains of the economy, the tools to catch them won’t be crafted at a Fed symposium.
Here’s a rundown of some of the key events in the world economy next week and Bloomberg Economics’ take on them:
U.S.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s Friday speech on ‘monetary policy in a changing economy’ will be the main attraction at the Jackson Hole summit. Powell could largely avoid commenting on near-term prospects for the economy or monetary policy, barring the mention of substantial progress made toward the central bank’s dual objectives and the Fed closely watching recent global developments.

June retail sales, released on Wednesday, likely expanded at a faster pace than in May. Sales have been trending up after a weak first quarter, supported by rising wages and strong employment gains.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Leftists rattle rand with plan to nationalize South Africa's central bank,"By Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Wendell Roelf
JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Opposition firebrand Julius Malema introduced a bill to nationalize South Africa's central bank, raising pressure on the ruling ANC to go through with a plan it shelved this year and rattling markets wary of threats to the institution's independence.
The rand fell more than 1 percent overnight after parliament released details on the bill late on Thursday, including clauses to ""make the state the sole holder of the shares in the bank"" and ""provide for the appointment of certain board directors by the (finance) minister"".
Most central banks around the world are state-owned. But markets have been worried about moves to bring the privately-held South African Reserve Bank into government control - particularly after the past administration was accused of meddling in appointments and decisions.
Malema's far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party - with only 25 out of the country's 400 parliamentary seats - would have no chance of pushing the bill through on its own.
But the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has backed the smaller party's bills before - including divisive legislation in February pushing to expropriate white-owned land without compensation.
The ANC promised on Friday to study the proposed privatization - a policy it had said it would pursue in December, calling the central bank's ownership status a ""historical anomaly"". The party put the plan on the back-burner three months later, saying it needed more consultation.
""The ANC will ... consult with the leadership of the caucus as well as the organization to determine its desirability based on ANC resolutions and policies on the matter,"" said the ruling party's parliamentary caucus spokeswoman, Nonceba Mhlauli.
The currency closed at 14.7275 versus dollar on Thursday and weakened further on Friday, driven by an emerging markets sell-off.
""With the independence of the central bank once again potentially in question, this combined with all of the other investor unfriendly headlines locally, (is) likely to keep the local unit on the back foot,"" Nedbank analysts said.
NATIONALIZATION
On top of market concerns, the central bank has also warned buying-out private shareholders would be expensive as some existing investors are likely to sell their stakes at a premium.
South Africa's central bank has been privately owned since it was established in 1921. But its shareholders have no control over monetary policy, financial stability policy or banking regulation.
Malema and his party did not make an immediate statement on their bill. But they have regularly argued for the nationalization of a wide range of assets - including mines and banks - and said the central bank should not be owned by private shareholders without a direct interest in the country.
The party - launched after Malema was expelled from the ANC in 2012 - has been pushing its plans to nationalize assets and to redress racial disparities in the build up to elections in 2019.
Despite the split, it has cooperated with the ANC on past legislation.

Together, the ANC, EFF and other small opposition parties could muster the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional change to allow for land expropriation without compensation.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>","Hungary seen holding rates despite CPI rise, forint jitters","By Sandor Peto
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Analysts see Hungary's central bank NBH keeping its record-low interest rates on hold again at its meeting on Aug. 21, despite a pick-up in inflation and increased currency (EURHUF=) volatility in the wake of Turkey's currency crisis. 
In an Aug. 13-16 Reuters survey, all 16 analysts said the base rate could stay unchanged at 0.9 percent.
Eleven analysts said that the bank would keep its overnight deposit rate on hold at -0.15 percent.
The bank's unconventional tools, swap facilities which provide banks with additional liquidity, could stay unchanged, too, KBC analysts said in a note.
""And the (bank's post-meeting) statement will repeat that monetary tightening may come in the next 5 to 8 quarters as the NBH may reach its inflation target in a sustainable manner in the middle of next year,"" they added.
The NBH took a step back from its ultra-dovish rhetoric two months ago, after a dive of the forint to multi-year lows, saying that loose monetary conditions could no longer prevail until the end of its policy horizon. [nL8N1TL1YQ]
Worries that the currency's fall could further boost accelerating inflation knocked the forint to record lows by early July, after months of selling in emerging markets including Central Europe due to a rally of the dollar.
The global sentiment improved later, but investors again sold off the forint and its regional peers in the past week to cut losses suffered due to a plunge of Turkey's lira .
The forint, trading around 323.5 versus the euro on Friday, was still well off its record lows beyond 330, and market participants said it may get support from a possible upgrade in Hungary's sovereign rating in a review late on Friday.
Annual inflation rose to a 5-1/2-year high of 3.4 percent in July.
But annual average inflation is unlikely to rise much above the center of the NBH's 2-4 percent target range in the next years according to the median poll forecasts, which projected a rise to 3.2 percent by 2020 from about 2.75 percent this year.
Some analysts said the bank may start already later this year to reduce the additional liquidity pumped into the banking system.
The median forecasts do not see a change in either the base rate or the overnight rate this year, but some analysts expect a gradual and slow rise from next year, around the time when the European Central Bank may also increase its own rates.
Some analysts believe the bank could keep rates low even longer.
""Inflationary pressure based on underlying indicators support (unchanged rates beyond 2019),"" ING analyst Peter Virovacz said.

The poll projects that the 3-month interbank BUBOR rate , now 0.19 percent, could gradually rise to 0.73 percent in the next one year, compared with a 0.93 forecast in a survey conducted a month ago.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Investors flee risk as bear markets multiply: BAML,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pulled billions from equities this week, shifting into bonds and high dividend-yielding sectors as Turkey's currency crisis sparked a global selloff and emerging markets entered bear territory, an analysis of fund flows showed on Friday. 
The market was shifting into defensive mode, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) (N:BAC) strategists said, noting investors pulled money out of U.S. equities, technology and financials.
Global equities suffered $3.6 billion of outflows while bonds saw $2.3 billion inflows as investors moved out of riskier assets, the BAML strategists said, citing data from EPFR, a fund flows data provider. 
U.S. equity funds saw outflows of $2.6 billion, a turnaround from the previous week when U.S. funds were leading in terms of inflows. Funds investing in large-cap stocks were the main victims of selling, with $2.3 billion lost.
Tech funds had $500 million of outflows, their biggest since the February global market selloff, in a sign of increased caution around the sector which drove much of last year's stock market gains and accounts for 30 percent of MSCI's emerging markets index (MSCIEF).
China's Tencent (HK:0700) this week slipped after reporting its first quarterly profit decline in nearly 13 years, sparking renewed concerns the tech boom may be slowing.
Cumulative flows into the sector were showing signs of peaking, too, strategists said.
HEALTHCARE PREFERRED
Financials saw $1.2 billion of outflows while energy funds lost $600 million, another sign of investors' growing caution over sectors more correlated with the business cycle. 
Defensives such as consumer staples, utilities, real estate, healthcare and telecoms, seen as safer for their high dividend payouts, have been the top-performing U.S. sectors for the past three months.
Healthcare stocks drew $800 million of inflows this week, driving the total to $5.5 billion over the past three months and making the sector one of the most ""overbought"" according to BAML. 
Pressure on European equities was unrelenting: Europe had its 23rd straight week of outflows with $2.9 billion pulled from the region's equity funds. Japan, meanwhile, was the sole region to see inflows, with $300 million. 
In a week where MSCI's emerging markets index entered bear territory, down 20 percent from the January peak, EM equity funds saw just $200 million of outflows, while $500 million left EM debt funds.
Bear markets were multiplying with European banks, European autos and copper in that category. 
BAML strategists also noted more than half the stocks in MSCI's world index <.dMIWD00000PUS> (1,254 out of 2,273) are in bear territory. By contrast overbought assets were U.S. equities and U.S. high-yield bonds, as well as healthcare stocks. 
Most oversold were European credit, global financials and materials stocks, as well as Italy, China and Turkey.

The Turkish lira was by far the worst-performing currency, while Turkish equities were 42 percent below their 200-day moving average.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Germany looks at easing immigration laws to fill skilled labor gaps,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German cabinet will soon decide on a proposal to make it easier for skilled workers from outside the European Union to move to Germany to take a job, a paper seen by Reuters shows, as Germany seeks to alleviate chronic labor shortages.
Such plans could be sensitive in a country where anti-immigration sentiment has helped drive support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and a row over asylum policy almost toppled Chancellor Angela Merkel's government in July.
The new proposal mainly addresses relaxing migration policy for professionals outside the EU, since EU citizens enjoy free labor movement in the bloc.
A lack of skilled labor and a shortage of young people willing to commit to on-the-job training for up to 3-1/2 years have become big concerns for managers in Europe's largest economy.
Germany bet on more than a million refugees who arrived in 2015 to fill workforce gaps, but a lack of German-language skills and the inability of most refugees to prove any qualifications has slowed the process.
A record 1.2 million jobs remain unfilled in Germany, the Federal Labour Office said earlier this month.
The German Interior, Labour and Economy ministries agreed to recruit more foreign skilled labor to Germany, the paper seen by Reuters showed.
They have sent the proposal paper to the rest of the cabinet, which will take a decision on it soon and changes to it are still possible, two government sources said.
""We will adjust the federal government's concept of skilled labor and focus on three areas: domestic, European and international skilled worker potentials,"" the paper, on which Interior Minister Horst Seehofer took the lead, said.
Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), takes a hard line on immigration and asylum issues. He vowed in July to present a migration law for professional workers by autumn.
Seehofer faces a tough regional vote in Bavaria in October, when the AfD is expected to win seats in the state assembly. The anti-immigrant AfD's popularity has surged since the migrant influx and it became the country's third largest party in September's election.
Germany already has a ""blue card"" system that makes it easier for companies to hire foreign academics and professionals.
The paper proposes that the government will no longer insist that companies give preference to German citizens in filling vacancies before looking for non-EU foreigners.
Graduates and workers with vocational training will have an opportunity to come to Germany to look for a job within a certain period of time if they meet qualification and language requirements.
They will not have access to social welfare benefits during that period but will be allowed to work in jobs for which they are overqualified so they can earn some money, the paper added.
Qualification recognition procedures in Germany will become faster and easier, the paper said, adding that the government is planning an advertising campaign in selected countries.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers meeting in Grand Teton National Park next week plan a deep dive into the root causes of stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and tepid productivity gains, all of which have dogged growth in the United States and other developed economies for years.
The Kansas City Fed, which each year in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, puts on one of the world's most attentively watched economic symposiums, won't publish the program for the event until it starts next Thursday evening. 
But on Friday it released a description of topics to be discussed, including how increased market concentration in many industries may be slowing productivity and wage growth, and how a shift to online retailing may be making it harder for firms to raise prices. 
""Understanding the implications of these changes for inflation, pricing dynamics, productivity and growth is vital for policymakers as they seek to promote conditions that can best foster long-run sustainable growth with stable prices,"" the Kansas City Fed said. 
Powell, who headlines the conference with a talk on monetary policy next Friday morning, has called low wage growth a ""bit of a puzzle,"" given 3.9 percent unemployment and an economy growing much faster than the less than 2-percent annual pace many economists believe is its natural speed limit. 
Hourly U.S. earnings grew 2.7 percent last month from a year earlier, only slightly faster than the current rate of inflation of around 2 percent. 
Labor activists opposed to Powell's interest-rate increases plan to put on their own academic panel on slow wage growth just outside the conference venue, a few hours before the symposium typically gets started with cocktails and dinner. 

Organizers want the Fed to stop raising rates, designed to slow hiring and investment to prevent the economy overheating, because they believe the labor market needs the boost that continued low borrowing costs can deliver. They say they have invited conference participants to attend, though it is unclear how many will.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 06:52AM ET</span>","Greece set to exit bailout, still faces daunting challenges","By George Georgiopoulos and Lefteris Papadimas
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece exits the last of its three bailouts on Aug. 20 and hopes to be able to borrow again in international markets after a nearly nine-year debt crisis that shrank the economy by a quarter and forced it to implement painful austerity measures.
The crisis has proven deeply traumatic for Greeks who had enthusiastically swapped drachmas for euros in 2001. Adoption of the single currency ushered in an era of cheap credit that funded a splurge in private consumption and public spending that sent Greece's budget and current deficits ballooning.
Since the debt crisis exploded in early 2010, four successive governments have fought to keep bankruptcy at bay, relying on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros lent by Greece's euro zone partners and the IMF.
As Athens now eyes a return to normality and reclaiming its economic sovereignty, the scars remain - banks are saddled with huge bad loan portfolios and Greece's public debt load is still the highest in the euro zone, at 180 percent of national output.
But sunshine is breaking through the clouds. The economy, which shrank by 26 percent in the crisis years, has started to grow, tourism is booming and unemployment is slowly coming down - to 19.5 percent from a peak of almost 28 percent.
""If there is a lesson that we learned from the crisis it is that, under any circumstances, you must try to protect macroeconomic stability,"" said Panos Tsakloglou, chief economist of the previous coalition government. 
""Populist policies that may win some votes today and have disastrous effects some years down the road must be avoided at all costs. Otherwise, sooner or later we will end up in the situation we are in now,"" he said.
OUT OF INTENSIVE CARE
Greece's economy grew for a fifth straight quarter in January-to-March, the expansion picking up pace to a yearly 2.3 percent, a sign the recovery is gaining traction, helped by net exports. The EU Commission sees 1.9 percent growth this year.
But skepticism remains, including at the International Monetary Fund which sees the recovery strengthening and growth reaching 2 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2019, but says that ""external and domestic risks are tilted to the downside"".
Post–bailout, Athens has committed to attain primary budget surpluses - excluding debt servicing outlays - of 3.5 percent of GDP until 2022, and 2.2 percent until 2060.
Debt relief agreed with Greece's euro zone partners in June, which extends maturities on some loans and softens the interest rate burden on others, will help cushion the country's return to markets.
These debt relief measures, coupled with a 24 billion euro cash buffer, will help to improve debt sustainability over the medium term, facilitating Greece's access to markets.
But the IMF says long-term sustainability remains uncertain and a ""realistic"" rethink is needed on assumptions for primary balance targets and economic growth.
""I don't see a reason for jubilation concerning our exiting the memorandum (bailout) because ... you may be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire,"" said Thanos Veremis, emeritus professor of history at Athens University.

""Most people have been taxed dry, people are completely immersed in paying the tax man, with little money left on the side to put into your business and therefore improve and grow.""

28,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, August 17:
1. Turkish lira dives on threat of new sanctions
Turkey remained in the spotlight as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s announced that the U.S. is prepared to slap Turkey with more sanctions if its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses the quick release of an American pastor.



Trump later tweeted that the U.S. “will pay nothing” for the release of the pastor Andrew Brunson, who is on house arrest in Turkey over terrorism charges.
The Turkish lira took a dive in early morning trade, falling more than 7% against the dollar, now having lost two-thirds of its value since the beginning of the year.
At 6:12 AM ET (10:12 GMT), USD/TRY was up 5.6% at 6.1608.
2. Global stocks flinch as Turkish woes return
Global stocks were mostly lower on Friday as a renewed decline in the Turkish lira brought risk aversion to the forefront. The currency tumbled against the dollar on Friday as the U.S. stance over pastor Andrew Brunson’s arrest hit market sentiment.
U.S. futures extended losses as the lira fell in early morning trade. At 6:15 AM ET (10:15 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures lost 39 points, or 0.15%, S&P 500 futures fell 5 points, or 0.18%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 16 points, or 0.21%.
Elsewhere, European shares also extended losses as fears over the region’s banks’ exposure to Turkey sent buyers fleeing.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed mixed on Friday. While Japan’s Nikkei 225 seemed content to follow earlier gains on Wall Street, China’s Shanghai Composite ended lower as caution reigned ahead of further trade talks between Beijing and Washington.
3. U.S. consumer in focus
As a slow week for top tier economic data comes to a close, traders will focus on the consumer mindset later on Friday.
The University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of August consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that the index rose to 98.1 from 97.9 in July.
Earlier in the week, July retail sales gave a better-than-expected reading, upping optimism for the American consumers’ capability to continue to support the solid economy.
The consumer has also been showing strength if the latest batch of retail earnings are anything to go by. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) was the latest to post strong numbers, sending its stock soaring on Thursday and contributing to the bullish sentiment in stocks.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was also gave a solid showing in quarterly numbers after Thursday’s market close, sending its stock surging in extended hours.
4. Mixed earnings signals to end the week
As mentioned, market participants were expected to react positively on Friday to Nordstrom’s strong earnings. The department store reported a same-store sales increase that smashed expectations and increased its profit guidance for the year. Shares surged more than 9% in pre-market trade Friday.
Tech stocks however, would likely be under pressure as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled 4.06% ahead of the open after the company issued a softer-than-expected guidance when it released quarterly results after Thursday’s close.
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) was also expected to add to the carnage with shares sinking 5.69% after the chipmaker forecast weaker-than-expected earnings per share for its fiscal fourth quarter.
Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) will be Friday’s spotlight on the earnings front as the company reports before the opening bell.
5. Oil headed for 7th weekly decline ahead of rig count
Oil prices managed to eke out a second day of gains of Friday, paring yet another sharp weekly decline.
The recovery occurred on the back of hopes that a meeting between Chinese and U.S. officials later in August will seek to offset recent tensions.
Markets were worried a potential full-blown trade war between the U.S. and China would slow global economic growth and curb energy consumption, while a standoff between the U.S. and Turkey subsequently sparked fears of contagion among emerging markets.
U.S. crude was headed for a drop of 3% this week and Brent was on track for weekly losses of 1.7%.
Later on Friday, Baker Hughes will release its most recent data on U.S. crude production.
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by 10 to 869 last week, the highest level since March 2015, according to the oilfield services firm."

(Reuters) - Foreigners turned net buyers of Asian bonds in July after three months of aggressive selling, but the escalating trade dispute between China and the United States and Turkey's economic crisis paint a gloomy outlook for continued regional inflows.
Data from central banks and bond market associations showed foreigners bought a net $3.02 billion of bonds from India, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia in the last month.
South Korea and Malaysian bond markets led the region with inflows of $1.3 billion and $984 million, respectively.
Foreign flows into Asian bonds: https://reut.rs/2vPvWOm
Efforts by the United States and Europe to resolve difference over trade propped up money flows in July, though investors are more worried this month, with another round of trade tariffs between China and Untied States kicking off next week.
""We are just at the beginning phase of the trade war, and as tariff barriers rise they will pressure currencies for further weakness, and both these factors will pressure prices higher, thus further souring investor sentiment for the bond market,"" said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING in Singapore.
From Aug. 23, new U.S. tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods would take effect, along with an equal amount of retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.
Angara's diplomatic rift with the United States has sent the Turkish Lira <TRY=> reeling this month, also affecting other emerging market currencies with large current account deficits such as the Indian rupee <INR=> and Indonesian rupiah <IDR=>.
Analysts said currency crisis in Turkey has prompted investors to shift funds from emerging markets to developed markets.
The Indian rupee hit a record low this week, while the Indonesian rupiah touched its lowest in nearly 3 years.
Asia current account balance: https://reut.rs/2K5OQFP
On Thursday, Turkey's Finance Minister Berat Albayrak assured international investors that the country would emerge stronger from its currency crisis, insisting its banks were healthy and signaling it could ride out a dispute with the United States.
Although Ankara appears to be committed to mitigating the current crisis, this does little to boost confidence in Lira as the US threat of more sanctions could be in for further contagious selloff, said ING's Sakpal.
""I am expecting continued volatility in flows ahead, with investors possibly avoiding high risk countries like India, Indonesia and Philippines,"" he said.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","BOJ may be 'stealth tapering' in stock markets, analysts say","By Tomo Uetake
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's central bank appears to be growing more comfortable with larger declines in the country's stock prices, a sign it may have begun in the share market what analysts describe as ""stealth tapering"" of its massive monetary stimulus.
The Bank of Japan refrained from buying stocks on two days this week when the Topix (TOPX) index was down more than 0.4 percent by midday, a departure from a previous pattern in which it bought exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on days when the index fell more than 0.2 percent.
The BOJ already has a precedent of stealth tapering in its bond buying and similar moves in its stock market operations come after it said last month it would make its asset purchases ""more flexible"".
That change met stiff resistance from some BOJ board members, highlighting the massive internal challenges it faces in maintaining radical stimulus policies.
At its July 31 decision, the BOJ said it ""may increase or decrease its stock buying depending on market conditions"".
The tweak is part of a wider shift to make its reflationist monetary policy, which includes large asset purchases in financial markets, more flexible as it seeks to lift Japan's stubbornly low consumer prices.
Since the last meeting, the BOJ bought ETFs on only two days -- Aug. 10 and 13 -- when the Topix fell 0.6 percent and 1.7 percent in morning trade, respectively.
For a graphic on BOJ's buying in Japanese shares, click https://reut.rs/2L1QB6q
It did not step into the market on Wednesday and Thursday this week when the Topix declines in the morning session were 0.43 and 0.42 percent, respectively.
""This is not so much an alert as a red-hot warning that it is going to whittle down its purchase bit by bit,"" said Shingo Ide, chief equity strategist at NLI Research Institute. ""I would say that is the whole purpose of putting that line in the statement.""
It also refrained from buying in when the drop in the Topix was between 0.2 to 0.4 percent earlier this month.
In debt markets, the BOJ has reduced its bond buying over the past two years despite statements that it aims to increase its government bond holdings by 80 trillion yen ($722 billion) a year.
For a graphic on BOJ's JGB buying, click https://reut.rs/2L0XFQJ
The BOJ dabbled in changing its unwritten policy on stock market support in April and May, allowing greater price declines without buying, though it switched back to its old script in late May.
However, not everyone sees signs that stealth tapering has begun.
""Even if it doesn't buy when the market is down 0.4 percent, it's still possible that the BOJ will have bought 6 trillion yen by the end of the year,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
BOJ bought nearly 3.5 trillion yen of stocks in the first half of this year, more than a half of its annual target of 6 trillion yen, meaning it needs to buy less in the second half.
""If the BOJ is really reducing buying, that is going to have a considerable impact. I suspect the BOJ will try to reduce it gradually,"" he said.
While a small reduction in market intervention is unlikely to have a tangible impact on inflation, it could reduce support for Japanese share prices and marginally strengthen the yen. 
Since 2013m the BOJ has bought almost 20 trillion yen of Japanese stocks, making it by far the biggest buyer of Japanese stocks.
But that has raised concerns among market participants that the BOJ's ownership of Japanese companies may become too big -- a factor that many investors say prompted the BOJ to make its latest policy modification.

Buying 2.5 trillion euros worth of public and private bonds over the past three years, the ECB has pushed borrowing costs to record low levels, hoping to stimulate borrowing and spending, all with the ultimate aim of boosting inflation.
Although the scheme worked more slowly than expected, household and corporate lending are both near post-crisis highs, so the ECB agreed last month to wind down the bond purchases, satisfied that inflation is finally moving back towards its target of just under 2 percent.
In the second quarter, banks saw increased demand for corporate, housing and consumer loans and said credit standards -- internal guidelines or loan approval criteria -- also eased for all three categories, the ECB said.
Its comments were based on a survey of 149 lenders.
""Banks’ overall terms and conditions on new loans continued to ease across all loan categories in the second quarter of 2018, driven mainly by a narrowing of margins on average loans,"" the ECB said.

It added that competitive pressures and risk perceptions contributed to an easing of credit standards in the second quarter, while banks' risk tolerance, their cost of funding and balance sheet constraints had a broadly neutral impact.

Concluding the two agreements would wrap years of talks, which in the case of Indonesia have dragged on since 2010, stalling along the way as diplomatic tensions between the two sides flared.
""I think by the end of this year we'll conclude successfully an FTA with Indonesia, an FTA with Hong Kong,"" Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo said at a business lunch in Sydney, when asked about the outlook for the next 12 months.
He gave no further details on timing, though a deal with Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy but only Australia's 13th-largest trading partner, could come as soon as next month when Australia's Prime Minister is scheduled to visit.
Ciobo, who has already sealed Australian trade deals with Peru and with the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership this year also said U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric had made his counterparts elsewhere more willing negotiators.
Since Trump's election, there has been a ""desire from a number of countries to double down"" on trade pacts, Ciobo said, helping him to seal deals.
He added he was ""hopeful"" of also signing Australian agreements this year with the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trade bloc and with the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
A deal with Hong Kong, Australia's 12th-largest trading partner, has been under negotiation since last year.

Two-way trade between the pair is worth roughly A$16.3 billion ($12 billion) according to Australian figures, nearly the same as Australia's two-way trade with Indonesia.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's top financial regulators took to the stand at an inquiry into financial-sector misconduct on Friday to defend their low-key enforcement of laws designed to protect the country's A$2.6 trillion ($1.9 trillion) pension system.
Under questioning at the Royal Commission of inquiry, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said its ""behind-the-scenes"" approach to dealing with breaches by large institutions was to limit damage to pension fund members.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the corporate regulator, was also accused by a barrister assisting the inquiry of ""bluffing"" rather than acting to stop malpractices by the country's top financial institutions.
The inquiry has exposed widespread wrongdoing and predatory behavior at Australia's top financial institutions, shocking the country and piling pressure on the government to do more to check finance-sector greed.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe lambasted the country's biggest banks in comments before a parliamentary economics committee in Canberra on Friday.
""I have to say that I have been incredibly disappointed and in many, many cases appalled by what has come out from the Royal Commission,"" the central bank chief said.
ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell told the inquiry there was a ""very high likelihood"" that it would soon launch proceedings against banks and other institutions which had wrongfully taken about A$1 billion from their customers without providing services, dating back to 2008.
Hodge also sought an explanation from ASIC about why the corporate regulator had only ""bluffed"" and not launched legal action against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), which has sold over A$3 billion worth of complex pension products without proper advice to customers.
After an investigation that started in 2014, the regulator drafted court documents in May 2017 but the bank agreed to stop the practice and the lawsuit was never filed.
""This was a bluff was it? You weren't actually going to commence proceedings if they were going to give you an EU (enforceable undertaking)"" Hodge said.
ASIC senior executive Tim Mullaly accepted that was the case, saying an undertaking would have been a faster way to stop the bank. As part of the undertaking, ANZ has promised to stop the practice from Aug. 18.
SOFT TOUCH
Under questioning, APRA Deputy Chairwoman Helen Rowell said that in the past decade, in its role as the superannuation watchdog, it had not taken court action against any entity for failing to act in the best interests of members.
""The reason we take the behind-the-scenes approach is to try and get the issue addressed ... without having that in the public domain causing more adverse impact on those members,"" Rowell said.
In hearings over the past two weeks the quasi-judicial inquiry has revealed several examples of major breaches, dishonorable conduct and fee-gouging by institutions that hold retirement accounts for about 12 million workers.
Rowell was pressed over APRA's light-touch approach to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), after it found out the country's largest bank had misled members when trying to sell them high-fee products.
""Surely it is unacceptable from a regulator's perspective,"" said Michael Hodge, a barrister assisting the inquiry.
""It would be preferable if there was complete disclosure to the members"", she answered.
Lawyers assisting the inquiry asked Rowell why APRA had not considered whether National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB), CBA and other firms that had charged excessive fees or not delivered services as charged, were breaching laws that required them to act in the best interest of its members.
Rowell said APRA did not want to intervene in an industry-wide investigation being done by corporate regulator ASIC.
Hodge responded that ASIC's responsibilities were limited to breaches of the Corporations Act and licensing of financial institutions, and not for determining whether entities like pension funds were acting in the best interest of members as required under trust law.
Commissioner Kenneth Hayne, a former High Court justice leading the inquiry, could recommend prosecutions and sweeping reform of the financial system.
The country's major banks are already preparing for change by spending more on compliance and governance, provisioning for fines, selling wealth management businesses and returning to core lending.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer inflation rate likely picked up slightly in July but due mostly to rising energy costs rather than robust demand, a Reuters poll showed, further evidence the central bank is making little headway in reaching its price target.
Subdued wage and price growth have forced the Bank of Japan to extend its massive stimulus program despite the rising risks of the policy, such as the hit to bank profits from near-zero rates.
The BOJ last month conceded that inflation will miss its elusive 2 percent target until early 2021 and took steps to make its policy framework more sustainable.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes fresh food prices but includes fuel costs, likely rose 0.9 percent in July from a year earlier, a Reuters poll showed, edging up from a 0.8 percent gain in June.
""We expect inflation to accelerate for the second straight month as energy prices are rising again and import price falls are moderating due to the yen's recent weakness,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The government will release the CPI data on Aug. 24 at 8:30 a.m. (2330 GMT, Aug. 23).
Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in the first three months of this year thanks to robust household and business spending.
Real wages rose at their fastest pace in more than 21 years in June, offering policymakers some hope that consumption will gain momentum and encourage firms to hike prices.
Some companies are indeed raising prices as they see their profits squeezed by labor shortages, fueled by solid economic growth and a shrinking working-age population.
Discount barber shop QB Net Co (T:6571) said it will raise the price of a hair cut by 10 percent from February next year due to rising labor costs.
Hideo Hayakawa, a former BOJ executive who is now senior economist at Fujitsu Research Institute, said labor shortages will heighten pressure on companies to raise prices ahead.
""It's true consumer inflation has been pretty weak during the spring. As a trend, however, inflation will gradually pick up from here as labor shortages won't go away.""

35,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",Australia central bank governor signals lower for longer rates,"By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's top central banker made an explicit case on Friday for rates to remain at record lows for some time yet as inflation stays lukewarm while there is still some spare capacity in the labor market.
""The Board's view is that it is likely that we will hold steady for a while yet,"" Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said before a parliamentary economics committee in Canberra.
The RBA last cut rates to 1.50 percent in August 2016 and has since remained on the sidelines, making the current stretch of stable policy the longest in modern history. 
""It is likely to be some time before we are at full employment and the inflation rate is comfortably within the target range on a sustained basis,"" Lowe added. 
The RBA has previously said an unemployment rate of around 5 percent is a sign of full employment in the Australian economy and the point at which wage pressures start to build. The unemployment rate is currently near a six-year low of 5.3 percent while inflation has remained below its 2-3 percent target for more than two years now. 
""We are prepared to maintain the current monetary policy stance until these benchmarks are more clearly in sight,"" he said.
Financial markets have got the message: interest rates futures <0#YIB:> do not fully price in a hike in the cash rate until 2020.
The Australian dollar  is also off its peak and down more than 7 percent since the start of this year. It was last up 0.1 percent at $0.7268, not far from a more than 1-1/2-year low of $0.7203 touched earlier this week. 
But Lowe insisted further ""moderate"" depreciation in the exchange rate would be helpful for Australia's export-heavy economy. 
BIG DRY 
Lowe used ""gradual"" or ""gradually"" six times in his opening remarks, indicating authorities are willing to stay patient on policy. He predicted wage growth and inflation will pick up ""gradually"" over the next couple of years as the labor market continues to tighten.
""With the central scenario being for the economy to continue on its recent track, it is more likely that the next move in interest rates will be an increase, not a decrease,"" Lowe added.
The last time the RBA increased the cash rate it was in late 2010. 
Australia's A$1.8 trillion economy looks to have grown strongly in the first half of the year, Lowe said noting one offsetting factor was a severe drought that has wasted vast tracts of grazing and crop land in eastern parts of the country.
Australia recorded its fifth-driest July on record last month. It was the driest January-to-July period in the state of New South Wales since 1965 and marked seven consecutive months of below-average rainfall.
Lowe said the board had discussed the drought at its last meeting on Aug. 7 and even looked at rainfall maps.
He also highlighted the ongoing slowdown in Australia's once-booming housing market, saying the pull-back in prices was a ""welcome development.""
Australian home prices suffered their sharpest monthly fall in July since late 2011.
That has reduced mortgage demand. There has also been some tightening in the supply of credit as banks tighten lending standards in response to an ongoing high-level inquiry into financial sector misconduct, Lowe said. 
He was scathing in his criticism of the country's biggest banks after the so-called Royal Commission unearthed a series of malpractices and predatory behavior in the sector.
""Like most Australians, I've been following what's been happening very carefully,"" Lowe said.

""I have to say that I have been incredibly disappointed and in many, many cases appalled by what has come out from the Royal Commission.""

The premier said further measures should be adopted to boost private investment.
""Our economy is showing a stable performance with good momentum for growth.

37,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",China Purges 40 Officials in Widening Vaccine Fallout,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s powerful Politburo announced disciplinary action Thursday against more than 40 officials, state media said, in the latest fallout over a vaccine scandal that has undermined trust in the ruling Communist Party.
The 25-member body led by President Xi Jinping ordered an investigation into the country’s former top food-and-drug regulator, Wu Zhen, the official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday. The body also demanded the resignations of the mayor of the northeastern city of Changchun, Liu Changlong, and the vice minister of the State Administration for Market Regulation, Bi Jingquan, Xinhua said.
Xi’s personal involvement in the punishment of relatively low-level officials illustrates the leadership’s concern over a scandal that has led protesters to picket government offices and rattled the country’s $120 billion vaccine industry. The president last month called allegations that Changsheng Bio-Technology Co. and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Co. produced low-quality vaccines “shocking” and demanded action against those involved.
The vaccine scandal -- along with an economic slow down and a tanking stock market -- has helped feed discontent in the world’s second-largest economy. The episode has exposed new doubts about Xi’s leadership, months after setting himself up for indefinite rule by abolishing presidential term limits.
“General Secretary Xi Jinping has attached great importance to the matter and issued several sets of instructions,” calling for thorough investigation and punishment according to the law, Xinhua said, citing the Politburo’s decision. The Politburo also called for improving long-term oversight mechanisms for vaccine production, upholding public safety and safeguarding people’s health.
Shares of Changchun-based Changsheng Bio-Technology have plunged 79 percent since July 13. The company’s shares fell 5 percent Thursday to 5.2 yuan a share.

38,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",The Makers of iPhones and Laptops Are Prepping for a Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- From iPhones to computers, the manufacturing powerhouses behind much of the world’s electronics are preparing to move chunks of production away from China and toward such far-flung locales as Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.
Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Terry Gou -- who became a billionaire by dint of making Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s gizmos -- started the ball rolling when he opened a $10 billion display plant in the heart of America, a move that now seems prescient. As tensions between the world’s two largest economies escalate, a growing cohort of his Taiwanese peers have drawn up plans to shift production abroad or devising contingencies for costly new facilities.
Taiwan’s largest corporations form a crucial link in the global tech supply chain, assembling devices from sprawling Chinese production bases that the likes of HP Inc. and Dell then slap their labels on. In the past week, corporate leaders, including the chief executives of Pegatron Corp. and Inventec Corp., declared on earnings calls they’ve come up with ways to mitigate the impact of a trade war. While Donald Trump hasn’t zeroed in on consumer electronics, the fear is they’ll be included among the next $200 billion of Chinese-made goods -- wiping out already razor-thin margins in the process.
“We have kicked off a mechanism to reduce our current risks stemming from trade disputes,” said Liao Syh-Jang, chief executive of iPhone maker Pegatron. In the short run, it may add capacity in the Czech Republic, Mexico and at home. Longer term, the company may set up shop in India or Southeast Asia, Chief Financial Officer Charles Lin added.
Taiwan’s six largest contract electronics makers -- Compal Electronics Inc., Foxconn flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta Computer Inc., and Wistron Corp. -- raked in NT$9.11 trillion ($296 billion) of revenue in 2017, or roughly the gross domestic product of Pakistan. While government data shows Taiwanese companies’ investments in China peaked in 2010, they remain a formidable presence: 15 of the top 20 exporters from the Asian country to the U.S. in 2016 originated in Taiwan, according to a state-run customs data website. Every one of those 15 were subsidiaries of the six contract manufacturers.
Their impending moves echo a trend that’s quickened in recent years. Rising labor costs led many to consider alternatives, including setting up smaller-scale facilities elsewhere to get closer to regional markets. Now those beach-heads serve as expansion bases.
“It will be important for Taiwanese companies to diversify their production as trade disputes between U.S. and China are not going away soon,” said Wu Chung-shu, president of Taipei’s Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.
Others preparing to take the leap include Inventec, an important Apple supplier, as well as Quanta and Compal. The latter two, which make laptops for most of the world’s major brands, said they can add capacity in existing non-Chinese facilities when necessary.
Compal Vice Chairman Ray Chen said assembling notebooks outside of China could cost at least 3 percent more per unit. But the alternative is unsavory: its gross margin stood at slightly above 3 percent last quarter, wafer-thin profitability that tariffs could wipe out. It’s an industrywide phenomenon: rival Quanta’s was about 4.5 percent.
“We are making dynamic adjustments so even if new tariffs on the $200 billion Chinese exports hit, we will be able to minimize damage,” Inventec executive David Ho told analysts on Tuesday. Ho oversees the unit that makes AirPods and HomePods as well as smart speakers for Sonos Inc.
To be sure, many contingency plans haven’t been finalized, and executives are wary about committing given the challenges in moving production permanently, both logistical and political. Many Taiwanese firms are reluctant to provoke China, which for the most part has been a welcoming host to corporations from an island it considers part of the country. And there’re few signs for now of a full-scale exodus. Inventec for one is adding at least one new facility in China that’ll begin production next year, Ho said.
But Trump’s sabre-rattling is definitely getting them thinking. Quanta Chairman Barry Lam said his company can boost manufacturing in California and Tennessee or Germany. Compal’s Chen said the same for Mexico, Poland, Taiwan or Vietnam.
“Amid the tariff rhetoric, moving investment south is a solution that makes sense for companies as Chinese incentives gradually fall, the Taiwanese government promotes its southbound investment policy and Chinese labor costs get increasingly higher,” said Angela Hsieh, regional economist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank in Singapore.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:05PM ET</span>","USTR Lighthizer eyes NAFTA 'breakthrough,' Mexico urges flexibility","By Jason Lange and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday expressed hope a breakthrough could be made in coming days on reworking the NAFTA trade deal, though his Mexican counterpart said flexibility was needed to reach agreement.
Lighthizer was speaking in Washington during the latest round of high-level talks between U.S. and Mexican officials to rejig the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, with a deal still elusive a year after the renegotiation began.
""I'm hopeful that in the next several days we'll have a breakthrough,"" Lighthizer said in response to a question from U.S. President Donald Trump on how talks were progressing during a U.S. cabinet meeting at the White House.
Trump himself said he was in ""no rush"" to conclude the talks, repeating his oft-stated complaint that the 24-year-old trade agreement had been a ""disaster"" for the United States.
""We have much better alternatives than that. So if you can't make the right deal, don't make it,"" Trump told Lighthizer.
Departing from morning talks at Lighthizer's offices, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo suggested there was still work to be done before agreement could be reached.
""Everybody has got to show flexibility,"" he told reporters.
Guajardo last month expressed hope that there could be a preliminary NAFTA deal by the end of August, but he has since appeared to pull back from that position.
NAFTA talks ground to a halt in late May in the run-up to the presidential election in Mexico on July 1.
After the election, U.S. and Mexican officials began meeting again without the third member of the pact, Canada, in an effort to tackle difficult issues, including revamped automotive sector rules and a sunset clause that could kill NAFTA after five years if it is not renegotiated.
""We have everything on the table, there are no preconditions and we'll see at the end how the whole thing falls into place,"" Guajardo said as Thursday's meetings concluded.
He added that they would resume talks on Friday, but the sunset provision would be among the ""very last items"" to be dealt with in the talks.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said he was more optimistic a deal on NAFTA would be reached after a recent phone conversation with Lighthizer.
""Ambassador Lighthizer has been making some phone calls and without talking about the specifics I am pretty optimistic, more optimistic than I have been in a while,” Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol, adding that this would calm anxiety among farmers and businesses over Trump's trade disputes.
AUTO TARIFF ISSUES LINGER
Some auto industry executives have said the United States and Mexico are close to a deal to increase North American automotive content thresholds, with substantial requirements for content produced in high wage areas, namely the United States and Canada.
But preserving Trump's ability to levy national security tariffs on Mexican-produced autos that either do not comply with the new rules or from newly built auto plants has been a thorny issue in recent weeks. 
Industry officials said on Thursday that the administration still has not agreed to remove the threat of ""Section 232"" tariffs on vehicles built at new plants nor specified whether passenger vehicles that do not comply with the rules would face a higher tariff than the current 2.5 percent. 
Trump has driven the U.S. negotiating process, threatening to dump NAFTA if it is not renegotiated in favor of the United States.

The U.S. president has argued the deal has facilitated an exodus of manufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexico, but NAFTA's supporters say it has kept the region competitive.

The move comes a day after the government failed to lure as many investors as it sought into the longer-term securities it was offering in place of short-term central bank notes it wants to scrap. That left billions of additional pesos in investors’ hands -- money that analysts expect will be used to buy dollars. By pushing up the minimum reserve requirement on big banks by 3 percentage points, the central bank is offsetting some of that surge in cash in the financial system.
“This measure will help absorb 60 billion pesos,” the central bank said. “A stronger control of liquidity in the market is fundamental to reinforce this institution’s anti-inflationary commitment.”
The peso didn’t show much of an immediate reaction to the latest measure, edging up 0.7 percent Thursday to 29.8 per dollar.
The currency has plummeted 37 percent year, one of the worst performances in emerging markets, as investors grew nervous about a widening current account deficit, accelerating inflation and what many viewed as an inadequate response by policy makers, especially at the central bank.
Authorities, concerned the weakening peso would fuel inflation already running at 30 percent, this week jacked up interest rates that were already the highest in the world, revamped a method for selling dollars in the local market and came up with the plan to get rid of the short-term central bank notes that fueled volatility.
The new reserve requirements will apply to almost 20 of the country’s biggest banks or their local units, including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
The central bank is encouraging investors to move their pesos to one-year notes known as Nobacs as it moves to phase out its short-term securities, Lebacs. A surge in Lebac issuance in the past few years have created a monthly headache for policy makers when they have to roll over sometimes as much as 500 billion pesos of the securities. Argentina has promised to phase them out as part of a $50 billion credit line with the International Monetary Fund.

“We’re talking to China, they very much want to talk,” Trump said Thursday at a cabinet meeting at the White House. “They just are not able to give us an agreement that is acceptable, so we’re not going to do any deal until we get one that’s fair to our country.""
Earlier, Trump’s top economic adviser welcomed China’s announcement that it will send Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen to the U.S. for talks in late August with David Malpass, undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department.
“It’s a good thing that they’re sending a delegation here -- we haven’t had that in quite some time,” National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC Thursday. “The Chinese government in its totality must not underestimate President Trump’s toughness and willingness to continue this battle to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers and quotas to stop the theft of intellectual property and to stop the forced transfer of technology.”
Kudlow said the Chinese economy and currency “are slipping, as you all know, but let’s just see what happens.” Discussions can produce better outcomes than expected, and talking is better than not talking, he added.
The Chinese delegation led by Wang will meet with an American group led by Malpass at the invitation of the U.S., China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website Thursday. It will be fourth round of formal talks since trade tensions flared this year, but the first session since early June.
“This will be ‘talks about trade talks,’” said Gai Xinzhe, an analyst at the Bank of China’s Institute of International Finance in Beijing. “Lower-level officials will meet and haggle and see if there is a possibility for higher-level talks.”
Necessary Concessions
To restart trade negotiations with the U.S., China must offer a package of measures, according to Jacob Parker, the vice president for China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. China needs to make an offer that slashes the bilateral trade surplus, lowers import tariffs, provides better protection for intellectual property and stops forced technology transfers, Parker said earlier this month.
The two nations had appeared to have reached a deal in May after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He -- President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser -- led a group of officials to Washington. But Trump backed away from the agreement soon afterward, and ever since the two sides have been locked in a standoff as they slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office said on Thursday it had extended public hearings on its proposal to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to six days starting Aug. 20, from four days initially. As many as 370 people are expected to testify. Those tariffs, which China has vowed to retaliate against by levying duties on $60 billion of U.S. goods, could take effect after a public comment period closes on Sept. 6.
The Trump administration already imposed duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month, a move that prompted immediate retaliation from Beijing. Levies on another $16 billion in goods take effect Aug. 23.

To make matters worse, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threatened more sanctions if the nation didn’t release a U.S. pastor.
In a rare half-hour long conference call, Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told about 6,000 global investors that he won’t impose capital controls. He also underscored the need to rein in inflation and narrow the worst current-account deficit in years. Turkey’s lira jumped after his remarks, while giving back most of its gains after Mnuchin said he had more sanctions at his disposal. The nation’s stock gauge slid to an 18-month low.

""The real issues are the economic policies,"" said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging-market debt at AllianceBernstein in New York. ""The reaction to the sanctions from the U.S. would have been very different if the government was following orthodox policies.""
Albayrak’s comments provided a glimpse into the new economy chief’s thinking as a spat with Washington over a detained U.S. pastor roils Turkish markets. The lira lost as much as a quarter of its value within two weeks of U.S. sanctions against members of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government. Turkish investor anxiety, as measured by the lira’s one-month implied volatility, fell by the most in almost two months on Thursday.
It’s unlikely that Turkey will take steps such as tightening fiscal policy, raising rates to control inflation and restoring the independence of the central bank, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Inc. She expects more sanctions.

Sound familiar?
No, it’s not Russia. This time, it’s Turkey — and that could spell even bigger trouble for financial markets.
Turkey’s stash of U.S. Treasuries declined for eight consecutive months through June 30, the longest stretch since at least 2002, Treasury Department data showed this week. At $28.8 billion, the country’s holdings are down by more than 50 percent during that eight-month period and no longer meet the $30 billion threshold to be considered a major holder for the first time since 2012. 
Like Russia, Turkey is a relatively small player in the $15 trillion Treasuries market. Most investors focus on flows from China and Japan because they each hold more than $1 trillion of U.S. debt. But unlike Russia, Turkey is in the middle of an economic crisis, spurred by tensions with the Trump administration, that’s caused its currency to weaken sharply. Persistent dumping of Treasuries only limits its ability to defend the lira and for dollar borrowers to make their debt payments. 
“Given the pace of the decline, this could increase investor concern around Turkey’s ability to make good on its foreign currency obligations in the coming months,” BMO Capital Markets strategists said in a report Thursday.
This week, at least, those fears seem to be abating. It was looking downright scary when the Turkish lira traded at more than 7 per dollar on Monday. But since then, it’s come down to about 5.8 per dollar after the central bank used stealth tactics to raise borrowing costs and Qatar pledged $15 billion to support the economy.
The foreign-exchange rate is still high relative to history, though, and comes after years of explosive debt growth. According to the Institute of International Finance, nonfinancial corporate borrowers in Turkey have increased debt 132 percent over the past decade, to $543.3 billion from $233.6 billion. Financial corporations’ obligations have surged 220 percent, to $216.6 billion from $67.7 billion.
Businesses may need to refinance at least $16 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currencies that are due by the end of the year, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Turkish companies have a net foreign exchange debt pile of $217 billion, according to central bank data. 
An easy way to obtain an influx of dollars, of course, is by selling U.S. Treasuries, which is why the months of offloading should raise some red flags. It’s one less tool to help quell concern about a rash of debt defaults. To a lesser extent, it also weakens Turkey’s hand in negotiating with the U.S.
Russia’s mysterious selling, on the other hand, appears to have been driven by an effort to diversify away from American securities after new U.S. sanctions. Its central bank is instead ramping up purchases of gold, bringing the share of bullion in its international reserves to the highest of President Vladimir Putin’s 18 years in power.
For Russia, it’s clear the selling seems to at least be partially strategic. But in Turkey’s case, any further significant dumping will most likely be forced, and that’s never a good position. "

50,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:56AM ET</span>","Weekly Comic: Potential ‘Perfect Storm’ Brewing Amid China, Turkey Turmoil","Investing.com - Jitters over a deepening currency crisis in Turkey combined with ongoing trade tension between China and the United States kept global financial markets on their toes this week.
The Turkish lira dropped to an all-time low of 7.1289 on Monday amid growing concern over a deepening diplomatic rift with the U.S. over Ankara's detention of an American pastor, whom Turkish authorities accuse of supporting a failed coup attempt in 2016.
While the lira has since pulled back from record low levels - finding support following reports on Wednesday that Qatar would invest $15 billion in Turkey - fear of full-blown crisis is far from over amid worries about President Tayyip Erdogan's growing influence over the economy, and his reluctance to raise interest rates despite rising inflation.
The lira is down almost 18% since the start of August. For 2018, it has lost approximately 50%.
Meanwhile, market focus stayed attuned to developments surrounding the brewing trade war between the U.S. and China.
China's Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday that it had received an invitation from the U.S. for talks to be held with U.S. Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass.
The announcement by the Chinese commerce ministry of the planned meeting in late August comes after a lull in talks between the two sides.
The last official round of talks was in early June when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing.
Despite the positive developments Thursday, analysts remain cautious about the outlook for global financial markets, particularly those outside of the U.S. that have looked vulnerable whenever investors get nervous.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","Lebanon banks suck in dollars to maintain peg, but economy stagnates","By Lisa Barrington
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese banks are pulling out the stops to bring in dollars as the country strives to preserve a two-decade old currency peg, offering high returns to customers willing to change their hard currency into long-term Lebanese pound deposits.
    It is one sign of Lebanon's determination to maintain monetary stability as political leaders' warnings of economic crisis have fueled rumors that have led the central bank to issue repeated assurances about the peg's soundness.
But the central bank's high interest rates that keep money flowing into banks are increasing risk within the financial system and strangling an already depressed economy. That all comes at a time of renewed political uncertainty as Lebanon nears three months without a government.
With growth low and traditional sources of foreign exchange - tourism, real estate and foreign investment - undermined by years of regional tension, Lebanon is now relying more on the billions of dollars expatriate Lebanese deposit in local banks. 
The banks buy government debt, which finances the country's eye-watering public indebtedness, and deficits.
There is broad agreement that Lebanon - the world's third most indebted state - needs urgent fiscal reform to help the economy and reduce dependence on central bank operations described as unconventional by the International Monetary Fund.
But since parliamentary elections in May, politicians have failed to form a government that could tackle the deficit, reinforce confidence in the financial system and unlock billions in donor financing. 
Focusing on high interest rates has come at a price.
    ""The priority today for the central bank is to raise rates to attract capital and preserve capital in foreign currency in Lebanon so we can continue with the policy of stabilizing the pound, which is the top priority,"" Raed Khoury, Lebanon's caretaker economy minister, told Reuters last month.
    ""It is the reason for Lebanon's political and monetary stability and confidence in Lebanon. Of course these factors don't come at a low cost. The cost is high for our economy.""
Ordinary Lebanese are feeling the effects of the weak economy. Lending is down and business activity is falling along with prices in a real estate sector that was once a pillar of the economy. 
Annual growth rates have fallen to between 1 and 2 percent, from between 8 and 10 percent in the four years before the Syrian war, and Lebanon's debt-to-GDP ratio hit more than 150 percent at the end of 2017, the IMF said.
The central bank last hiked interest rates at the end 2017, by 2 percentage points in response to the crisis caused by Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's resignation, later rescinded. 
But almost two months ago banks began telephoning customers asking if they had foreign currency – locally or abroad – they could deposit to earn interest rates of up to 15 percent on five-year term Lebanese pound deposits.
Other offers heard by Reuters include 10 percent on one-year and 11 percent on two-year terms, with minimum deposits ranging from $20,000 to $50,000.
The weighted average interest rate on Lebanese pound deposits was 6.7 percent in June, the highest since December 2009. The average rate on dollar deposits was 4.1 percent, the highest since February 2008. 
And since the Hariri crisis, the average term of Lebanese pound deposits increased from 40 days in October to 120 days today, Bank Audi chief economist Marwan Barakat said. 
Banks convert customers' cash into local currency and deposit the dollars in the central bank which, a number of complex operations later, gives the banks even more attractive returns. 
""There is now a lot of competition between banks to attract deposits,"" BlomInvest Bank's head of research Marwan Mikhael said. ""The central bank is trying to suck all the dollars in the market."" 
But the increasing reliance on bank deposits to fund the state - and the increasingly high exposure of banks to sovereign debt this entails - is making Lebanon and its banks more susceptible to political shocks.
""The situation of banks has become fragile, vulnerable to the situation of the public sector,"" said Toufic Gaspard, an economist and former adviser at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He said half of the banks' balance sheets are deposits at the central banks.
""Two thirds of their balance sheets are loans to the public sector, defined as the central bank and government, as illustrated by treasury bills,"" Gaspard said. 
Gaspard last year wrote a paper saying the central bank's policy of offering high interest rates on dollars was resulting in ""mounting losses"" for the central bank and ""negative net reserves"". 
The scale of these losses is, however, not publicly known as ""the central bank hasn't published its profit and loss statements since 2002"", Gaspard told Reuters.
In an unusual move, the central bank responded to the report and said its interest rate policies were in line with Lebanon's risk profile. On the subject of the non-publication of its annual reports, the central bank said it is required annually to report its balance sheet and profit and loss accounts to the finance minister, and said the central bank ""continues to generate sustained and substantial profits"".
Lebanon's vulnerability to political shocks was demonstrated in November, when Hariri unexpectedly resigned during a visit to Saudi Arabia, causing a temporary outflow of funds from his country.
The crisis was resolved in a matter of weeks when Hariri canceled his resignation, but the currency peg came under pressure. The central bank's foreign assets, excluding gold, recovered what they had lost defending the pound to reach $44.4 billion at the end of July.
The cost of borrowing for ordinary Lebanese has also been pushed up since the central bank, concerned about the amount of Lebanese pound liquidity entering the market, started in October to pare back the incentive and subsidy schemes it had used for years to boost bank lending to housing and other economic sectors.
Although welcoming central bank efforts to maintain deposit inflows in the face of the many pressures on Lebanon, the IMF has said Lebanon's debt is ""unsustainable"" and ""immediate and substantial fiscal adjustment"" is needed.
Many in Lebanon are asking why politicians do not put their differences aside to put the economy on a sounder footing. 

""If we continue like this, eventually we are bound to have a financial crisis,"" said Gaspard.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swept along by super-easy money, investors have debated for years how world markets will react when this central bank largesse inevitably ends. Now the liquidity tide is about to turn, and they have only a few months to adjust.
The world's four biggest central banks - the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and the Bank of England - have pumped around $13 trillion into the global economy since the crisis year of 2009, sharply expanding their own balance sheets of financial assets:
https://tmsnrt.rs/2vWTPCE
Central bank assets: https://reut.rs/2KUqn5K
While markets reached dizzying heights during the easy money era, that flood will dry up by the year-end. For the first time since 2011, the central banks are expected to suck out more cash in 2019 than they pump in. 
The ECB will stop additional bond buying at the end of this year, and while the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet for almost a year, it will step up the pace from October, removing $50 billion a month from markets. Bonds worth $470 billion will roll off its balance sheet next year
After a near decade of money-printing and zero interest rates, the shift for markets will be momentous.
Steve Donze, senior macro strategist at Pictet Asset Management, estimates a net $100 billion will be removed from global liquidity next year.
Central banks will go from generating half a trillion dollars this year on an annualized basis, ""to zero by the end of 2018, then negative next year...a definite tipping point"", he said. ""That makes 2019 a dangerous year for financial assets.""
Central bank assets: https://reut.rs/2KRliv3
Weaning markets off the easy money may be tricky. The central bank liquidity torrent has penetrated every nook and cranny of markets, from fine wine and art, to real estate, junk-rated bonds and emerging markets. It drove bond prices so high in many countries that yields turned negative and has sustained an equity bull run into its 10th year.
Cracks are already appearing in markets, already stressed by a Turkish currency crisis and trade tensions between the United States and China. Emerging equities have plunged 20 percent since January and world stocks are set for the biggest monthly fall since March (MSCIEF) (MIWD00000PUS).
Average yields on junk-rated corporate dollar debt have risen 50 basis points this year <.IBLUS0004>. 
Robust company earnings have supported Wall Street so far but the SKEW index - which gauges the cost of put options on the S&P500 index relative to calls (SKEWX) - signals rising unease.
SKEW is near the highest since March, showing the strength of demand for ""puts"" - options that offer the chance to sell an asset in future at pre-agreed prices.
PAIN AFTER GAIN 
On equities, Pictet calculates that a $1 trillion liquidity injection by the big five central banks - including the People's Bank of China - corresponds to a 20-point rise in the MSCI global index, and a similar-sized fall if the same amount is withdrawn. Assuming a net $100 billion liquidity loss in 2019, the index should pull back slightly.
Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, isn't yet calling the end of the equity rally but has lightened equity and emerging market allocations. 
""We need to go though a period of adjusting in sentiment and valuation terms to a more mixed reality when you don't get both economic recovery and cheap money,"" he said. ""Investors will have to adjust for that over the next couple of months.""
Emerging markets rely more on liquidity, especially those like Turkey and South Africa which depend on foreign capital. Among developed countries, Italy has benefited hugely from ECB stimulus, meaning its beaten-up bond markets should feel more pain. 
""Any proactive reduction in the total global liquidity pool runs the risk of having a deleterious impact on a very broad set of global economies,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock chief investment officer for global fixed income, said. ""The events in Italy of recent months highlight that dynamic.""
U.S. SHRINKS, CHINA PRINTS
According to consultancy CrossBorder Capital, 90 percent of central banks now run tight policies, led by the Fed which has raised interest rates seven times. Rates rose this month in Britain too, while emerging markets are likewise generally tightening.
Emerging market central banks are hiking again : https://tmsnrt.rs/2MupTVW
That has slowed global liquidity growth to 2.1 percent on a three-month annualized basis from 20 percent a year ago, CrossBorder Capital calculates.
Central bank liquidity is not the only game in town. The U.S. tax reform is draining dollars from world markets by encouraging companies to bring home profits earned abroad; about $300 billion was repatriated in the first quarter of 2018.
US companies repatriated about $300 bln in Q1: https://reut.rs/2vL1yEX
Liquidity removal could still be slow. The Bank of Japan recently confounded expectations that it would signal a timeframe for policy tightening.
U.S. private banks, boosted by the tax cuts, are generating $600 billion a year in liquidity, Pictet's Donze said, offsetting Fed tightening. Even the Fed might decide to move more slowly because of the trade wars and emerging market selloffs 
Finally, China has started pumping cash into its economy to ease trade-linked strains, accelerating loan and money supply growth there could drag on global liquidity tightening

""What we are seeing in markets is slow strangulation rather than a sudden liquidity panic attack,"" Donze added.

53,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:59AM ET</span>",U.S. banks teach financial literacy with hands-on experience,"By Rishika Dugyala
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last year, Abbey Jones’ high school routine had a twist. For 45 minutes each week, she became one of 15 student tellers at the Community Spirit Bank branch at Red Bay High School in Red Bay, Alabama. 
Her job? To handle her peers' transactions and market the bank’s student-specific accounts. 
Community Spirit has used a digital platform to teach Red Bay students financial concepts for roughly five years. But since January 2017, students who receive parental permission can also open checking and savings accounts for a $1 fee to keep until they are 24.
“The easy access to come and deposit your money, it's just made us a lot more willing to take control of our finances,” said Jones, 17. 
Recent research suggests that pairing financial literacy efforts and tangible experience has a greater impact on positive money management: higher credit scores, less debt and higher savings rates. But there is some disagreement about how to measure that impact. 
Initiatives are popping up all over the United States to help young people, lower-income communities and those lacking a formal banking relationship improve their interactions with the financial services industry. 
For instance, Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) sends two empowerment mobiles to provide financial education and access to loans for low- and moderate-income community members within the bank's markets, which include Illinois, Tennessee and Ohio.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Co, Santander (MC:SAN) Bank, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and others partner with nonprofits and the public sector to provide easy access to accounts for summer youth employment program participants as they are coached on their finances.
In 2017, nonprofits America Saves and the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund together saw more than 73,000 participants direct deposit into financial accounts through their summer employment programs. Fifth Third received more than 1,800 loan and product referrals through its empowerment mobiles in 2017. Following its launch, Community Spirit's in-school branch saw more than 200 accounts opened and $77,000 in deposits.
ACHIEVING IMPACT 
For decades, financial literacy efforts centered on digital learning modules, workshops and classroom lessons to teach people about managing money. Now some institutions are exploring new metrics to measure how adding the hands-on experience is changing behaviors. 
San Francisco-based nonprofit MyPath attempted to do that with a program, supported by JPMorgan Chase, that provides financial coaching with real-world banking exposure. Of the 121 of 18-to-24-year-olds who participated for 2017, 85 percent improved their FICO credit scores, even those with damaged credit. 
But most programs are not tracking the long-term financial health of participants, including growing emergency funds, contributing to retirement savings or saving for college. 
Customers are wary of the system, too. The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer found just 53 percent of the informed U.S. public trusts the financial services sector, a 20-point drop from last year. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's biennial survey, roughly 9 million United States households in 2015 were ""unbanked,"" meaning no one in the household had a checking or savings account. 
Another challenge: Big financial institutions worry that a heavy-handed sales pitch will push customers away. 
“We really do not try to sell PNC when we’re teaching people,” said Cathy Niederberger, managing director of Community Development Banking at PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC). “I can only imagine what a turn off it would be for somebody who thought they were coming in for good education and they feel like they got a hard sell.” 
JPMorgan Chase Office of Nonprofit Engagement head Courtney Hodapp said programs managed by nonprofits, like the summer employment ones, are more attractive. She explained that consumers in these programs can choose from a variety of banks and account offerings that have been validated by the third-party nonprofit. 
It is a tricky line to walk, said Santander Bank's community partnership manager Toby Baba, but there is no other way to have ""true line of sight"" on impact. 

“When we’re teaching people about the different account options and banking services, naturally they want to know, ‘Okay, what does Santander offer?’” he said. “I think when it’s done right, coupling the two can help with trust.”

The U.S. Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday that China-based Dalian Sun Moon Star International Logistics Trading Co. Ltd and its Singapore-based affiliate SINSMS Pte. Ltd had netted more than $1 billion a year by exporting alcohol and cigarette products to North Korea.
The department also sanctioned Russian-based Profinet Pte Ltd and its director general, Vasili Aleksandrovich Kolchanov, for providing port services on at least six occasions to North Korean-flagged ships.
Kolchanov was personally involved in North Korea-related deals and interacted directly with North Korean representatives in Russia, the department said.
""The tactics that these entities based in China, Singapore, and Russia are using to attempt to evade sanctions are prohibited under U.S. law, and all facets of the shipping industry have a responsibility to abide by them or expose themselves to serious risks,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.
The sanctions mandate that no U.S. citizen can deal with any of those designated in the order, and any of their properties in the United States ""must be blocked"", the Treasury said.
The United States has been pressuring North Korea via sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons program.
BEIJING AND MOSCOW PROTEST
China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Beijing has always strictly enforced United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea and did not allow Chinese firms or individuals to engage in activities that violated them.
""At the same time, China's position on opposing countries enacting unilateral sanctions on other countries and ‘long-armed jurisdiction’ is consistent and clear,"" it added, without elaborating.
When asked for comment, Liang Ye, a legal representative of Dalian Sun Moon Star International Logistics Trading, said the matter was still unclear and that the Chinese company had not received any notification.
China's official Xinhua news agency said the United States needed to back off pressuring North Korea if it was serious about wanting lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
""Washington should be reminded that the 'maximum pressure' approach on Pyongyang is not in keeping with the current situation on the Korean Peninsula and it needs to consider easing sanctions,"" Xinhua said in a commentary.
Such commentaries are not statements or official positions, but can be read as a reflection of government thinking.
Though China has repeatedly said it enforces U.N. resolutions on North Korea, it has also said it has the right to conduct what it calls ""normal trade"" with the country in areas that fall outside the scope of the sanctions.
It has been angered in the past by unilateral U.S. sanctions on Chinese firms and individuals.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that the United States had acted without evidence on the basis of groundless accusations when imposing sanctions on the Russian company.
Moscow was working on retaliatory measures, added Ryabkov, saying the Russian leadership would decide whether to hit back.
Vasili Kolchanov, the head of the port services agency affected, told Reuters he had worked with North Korean vessels as a transport agent, but said the sanctions against him and his firm were illegal.
He only helped prepare documents for the vessels, he said, and was not involved in trading anything.

""It's not our concern who fuels the vessels, who sells that fuel, who they buy the cargo and oil products from,"" he said. ""We do not load vessels. As an agent, I only need to check that they have permission from customs.""

55,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China central bank bars some offshore lending in latest move to support yuan,"By Winni Zhou, Zheng Li and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has banned banks in its ground-breaking free trade zones from certain lending activities to ease pressure on the yuan currency in offshore markets, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The move comes as nervous global financial markets wait to see how much further China will allow the yuan to fall, after it weakened against the dollar for nine straight weeks, reviving memories of its jolting devaluation in 2015.
The restrictions, announced by the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday morning, have closed off channels used to deposit and lend yuan offshore through the trade zones as the currency plumbs 15-month lows, the sources said.
They prevent commercial banks from using some interbank accounts to deposit or lend yuan offshore through free trade zone schemes, the people said.
The notice to banks said the measures followed significant recent volatility in the offshore yuan , and are effective Aug. 16.
The move was aimed at tightening offshore yuan liquidity and making it more expensive to short the Chinese currency, traders said.
Bets on further losses in the yuan had jumped to an all-time high in late July as it continued to skid, according to a Reuters poll[ASIA/FXP], but investors have grown slightly more cautious this month after the PBOC tightened rules on trading currency forwards.
The yuan has been pressured by worries about the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war and signs of slowing in China's economy. Rising U.S. interest rates are also giving a sustained boost to the dollar against most emerging market currencies.
The Shanghai branch of the PBOC did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on the matter.
Analysts and traders said that the value of offshore yuan loans and deposits affected by the new restrictions is unclear.
But Qi Gao, Asia FX strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore, said that ""the signal is very clear, because if they prevent this (channel) it will push up ... offshore yuan funding costs.""
He compared the PBOC's action to the recent moves by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to push up Hong Kong dollar borrowing rates by reducing banking system liquidity, which in turn supports the Hong Kong dollar.
""The mechanism and the impact is similar, pushing up funding costs to defend the CNH exchange rate,"" he said. 
LINE IN THE SAND?
The offshore yuan  has fallen more than 10 percent from late-March highs, while its onshore counterpart  has fallen nearly 10 percent over the same period.
Several traders said news of the restrictions drove the offshore yuan higher on Thursday, as market participants rushed to purchase one-year forwards. One year dollar/yuan forwards in the offshore market  jumped to 820 points, the highest since June 29.
However, onshore liquidity remained ample, with onshore forwards for the same tenor  staying in negative territory.
As of 0914 GMT Thursday, the offshore yuan  The restriction on offshore yuan deposits and lending applies to some Free Trade Accounting Unit (FTU) businesses, though it is not meant to affect cross-border capital flows that reflect real demand, according to the notice. FTU businesses were introduced through financial reforms in the Pilot Free Trade Zone in Shanghai, and are managed by Chinese banks separately from their ordinary domestic accounts. The zones have been touted as landmarks for China, serving as test-beds for financial reforms and its goal of further opening up the economy.  MULTIPLE MEASURES The restrictions introduced on Thursday are the latest in a series of moves by the PBOC to support the yuan, which has lost about 5.7 percent against the dollar so far this year. While there have been no indications of the central bank stepping into the market directly, it has sought to manage market expectations about the yuan. In late July, traders reported seeing large state-run Chinese banks swapping large amounts of dollars for yuan in currency forwards, tempering depreciation expectations by containing the price of yuan in the forwards market. State-run banks are widely believed to often act on behalf of the PBOC in the market. The PBOC has also required banks to keep reserves equivalent to 20 percent of their clients' foreign exchange forwards positions from August 6, and said it would take counter-cyclical measures to keep foreign exchange markets stable. Such moves are seen as likely to give support to the yuan in the near term, but market watchers say trade tensions between the U.S. and China will continue to weigh on the onshore and offshore yuan. ""Without a trade deal achieved between the U.S. and China, such kinds of measures can only slow the yuan depreciation, but cannot turn the direction (around),"" Gao said.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:27AM ET</span>","Retirement success: focus on the paycheck, not a savings number","By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Steve Vernon is an expert on numbers - but please do not ask him for your “number” - that is, the amount you need to save to insure a successful retirement.
Vernon thinks that is the wrong question. A leading retirement educator, by training he is an actuary - meaning he is an expert in measuring and managing risks and uncertainty. 
In a new book, Vernon lays out a strategy for developing retirement security that begins by thinking beyond your “retirement number.” Instead, he focuses on how to cover basic living expenses by setting up a series of “retirement paychecks” that are guaranteed to last the rest of your life. Any remaining savings are the gravy - use them for discretionary expenses like travel and entertainment.
Vernon worked for years as a consultant to large corporate retirement plans before starting his own California-based firm that provides consumer retirement education. He is a research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity, and writes a column for CBS MoneyWatch. In ""Retirement Game-Changers: Strategies for a Healthy, Financially Secure, and Fulfilling Long Life,"" he focuses on helping older workers navigate the critical decisions they need to make as they transition from employment to retirement.
The challenges are mounting. Rising longevity, declining availability of traditional defined-benefit pensions and rising healthcare costs make navigating retirement more complicated than it was for previous generations.
But Vernon’s formula is straightforward. “The big picture is to get a feel for what your basic necessities are each month, and your discretionary expenses,” he told me in an interview. “Then, you want to insure an income that exceeds your basic expenses.”
Many retirement planning software programs and advisers focus solely on income generation - very often this is expressed using the rule-of-thumb that you must replace 70 to 80 percent of pre-retirement income with retirement income. But a careful look at expenses is warranted, too, Vernon thinks. “The rule of thumb doesn’t take into account the ways that your living expenses can change during the course of a long retirement,” he said. “It also assumes that you won’t, or can’t, make any changes in your lifestyle.”
Instead, Vernon recommends evaluating whether it is possible to reduce spending. “Ask yourself what you’ll need to be happy in retirement,” he said.
Next, match up your projected living expenses with a series of what he calls “retirement paychecks.” Here is a look at the key paycheck types, along with Vernon’s tips on how to manage them.
SOCIAL SECURITY
For most retirees, Social Security will be the foundational paycheck - especially for those who can delay their claim beyond full retirement age to maximize monthly benefits.
Vernon subscribes to the “money ahead” approach to claiming strategies, which goes beyond the “break-even” point many people want to analyze - that is, the age when their total lifetime benefits received would be equal to using a different claiming age (https:// Taking benefits early works out to your advantage if you do not live to the break-even age. You also come out ahead if you delay benefits and then live beyond the break-even point. The losing scenario is delaying benefits and dying before reaching the break-even age.
In most cases, a thoughtful money-ahead claiming strategy can boost lifetime income by $100,000, Vernon estimates. 
PENSIONS
Additional paycheck sources can include any defined benefit (DB) pension you might have coming. Most state and local government workers still receive traditional pensions, but they are on the decline in the private sector. If you do expect a DB pension, ask your employer for an estimate of the future monthly benefit. Many plans also offer online calculators these days that let you estimate how much your benefit will increase by delayed claiming.
Finally, if your employer offers a lump sum benefit, Vernon urges you to resist the temptation. “Most people will receive more lifetime income by electing the monthly annuity payments,” he said.
ANNUITIES AND REVERSE MORTGAGES
If you still face a paycheck shortfall after factoring in Social Security and pension income, Vernon recommends checking into a low-cost, no-frill annuity from an insurance company, such as a single premium income annuity. Vernon even thinks that a reverse mortgage, structured to make monthly payouts, can make sense. Taken together, these checks should match monthly nondiscretionary expenses.
GET AN EARLY START
No matter how you build your retirement paycheck portfolio, it is critical get an early start, Vernon said. “We all know there are medical procedures you’re supposed to do when you turn 50, and there is a similar set of financial diagnostics you should do about five years before you retire - or by the time you turn 60,” he said.

A realistic assessment, he thinks, will prompt many to revise their plans. “A lot of people will realize they need to try to work longer, or reduce their standard of living,” he said. “The choices are not easy, but people should be thinking about it.”

57,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 05:48AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Thursday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, August 16:
1. China and U.S. to Resume Trade Talks
China said it will hold a fresh round of trade talks with the United States in Washington later this month, offering a glimmer of hope for progress in resolving a conflict that has set world markets on edge.
A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet with U.S. representatives led by Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website.
The upcoming meeting, which is lower-level compared with four previous rounds of talks, comes at the invitation of the U.S., according to the statement.
The world's two largest economies have implemented several rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs on each others goods since the start of the year and have threatened further tariffs on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
2. Fresh Trade Talks Spur Relief Bounce in Global Stocks
Global stocks were mostly higher, following the positive overnight developments between the U.S. and China on the trade front.
Asian shares ended mostly lower, but pared some of the steeper losses seen earlier amid easing fears of a trade war. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down around 0.6%, having earlier fallen by as much as 1.9%.
In Europe, nearly all of the region's major bourses were trading higher, with the exception of Italy, as appetite for riskier assets improved on hopes of a trade war thaw.
Italy's FTSE MIB sank 1.6% to its lowest level since April 2017 as shares in motorway operator  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) plunged 25% following the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa earlier this week.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures surged, suggesting a rebound from the previous session’s sharp decline.
The blue-chip Dow futures indicated a gain of 105 points, or around 0.4%, by 5:45AM ET, the S&P 500 futures rose 11 points, or around 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to an increase of 42 points, or roughly 0.6%.
Major indexes fell sharply on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 posting its biggest percentage drop since late June.
3. Walmart Reports Earnings
Walmart is one of the last notable names slated to report fiscal second-quarter results before U.S. markets open, as the earnings season continues to wind down.
The retail giant is expected to report earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $126.03 billion, according to estimates.
U.S. same-store sales are expected to rise 2.2%, excluding gas.
Investors will be closely watching the results to see whether its efforts to take on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the online retail space have paid off.
Shares of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) were trading little changed in premarket.
Other companies reporting results ahead of the opening bell include JC Penney (NYSE:JCP), and MSG (NYSE:MSG).
After the close, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) are on deck.



4. Dollar Slips From 13-Month High
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar eased from 13-month highs against a basket of major currencies, as risk aversion eased on news that a Chinese delegation will travel to the U.S. in late August to hold trade talks.
The U.S. dollar index was down 0.15% to 96.45, pulling back from 96.76 on Wednesday, which was the most since June 27, 2017.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices ticked lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield ticking up to 2.88%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note rose to 2.625%.
On the data front, investors will get the weekly report on initial jobless claims as well as data on manufacturing activity from the Philly Fed and a report on housing starts and building permits for the month of the July.
Elsewhere in foreign exchange markets, the euro pulled away from Wednesday’s 14-month lows, with EUR/USD advancing 0.2% to 1.1370.
Many emerging market currencies, such as the South African rand and Russian rouble also rose, clawing back some of Wednesday's losses thanks to easing fears over the knock-on effects from a slide in the Turkish lira.
The lira rose for a third straight session against the U.S. dollar supported by reports that Qatar would invest $15 billion in Turkey.
China's offshore yuan, which has been rough barometer of risk sentiment and fallen in recent months on concerns about the impact on its economy of the trade conflict with the United States, gained 0.7% to 6.9001. That compared to the 6.9500 touched overnight.
5. Copper Leads Commodities Rebound
In commodity markets, industrial metals, such as copper, rebounded after a hammering on Wednesday as the potential for a breakthrough in the trade standoff between China and the U.S. boosted appetite for riskier assets.
Copper futures jumped 1.8% to $2.606 a pound, the biggest increase in more than three weeks. The red metal slumped to a 14-month low of $2.552 a day earlier.
Gold was also higher at $1,186.30 an ounce, having dropped to an overnight low of $1,167.10, a level not seen since January 2017.
Oil prices also recouped some of the previous day's losses, though gains were limited amid worries over a slowdown in global demand.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","China, U.S. to hold lower-level trade talks in late August","By Michael Martina and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China will hold a fresh round of trade talks with the United States in Washington later this month, Beijing said on Thursday, offering a glimmer of hope for progress in resolving a conflict that has set world financial markets on edge. 
A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives led by Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website.
While the engagement was seen by analysts and business officials as positive, they cautioned that the talks were unlikely to lead to a breakthrough given they are among lower level officials and led on the U.S. side by the Treasury Department, not the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).
There also remains a wide gap between the two sides over Washington's demands that Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for U.S. companies, and slash a $375 billion trade deficit with China.
""The lower rank of the delegation suggests that both sides remain far apart, and an agreement reached for this visit is very unlikely,"" Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office at investment bank Everbright Sun Hung Kai, wrote in a note.
News of the meeting gave a lift to the yuan and helped cap losses in China's stock markets.
The world's two largest economies have been locked in escalating rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs since the start of the year and have threatened further duties on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
The meeting would end what had been a lull in talks between the two sides, but it is unclear whether it will take place before or after Aug. 23, when Washington is due to activate additional tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods.
Beijing has said it will retaliate in kind.
The last official round of talks was in early June when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing.
There was no immediate response from the U.S. Treasury to the announcement from Beijing.
LOW EXPECTATIONS
The upcoming meeting will be held at a lower-level compared with four earlier rounds of talks. 
Having made little progress in the previous meetings, the White House said on Aug. 3 that the United States is open to further talks with China on how to resolve the festering trade dispute.
Four U.S. and Chinese sources in the business community said they had low expectations for the talks, particularly if officials from USTR were not involved. The invitation for talks may have been intended to steady markets, they said. 
The U.S. Treasury Department led by Steven Mnuchin has been viewed as most opposed to tariffs among key Trump administration agencies, espousing a more moderate approach to China than trade hardliners such as USTR's Robert Lighthizer.
After negotiations in Washington in May, Beijing believed it had assurances from the U.S. that tariffs were off the table, with Mnuchin saying the trade war and tariffs were ""on hold"".
But less than 10 days later, the White House said it would push forward on planned tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports and press ahead with restrictions on investments by Chinese companies in the U.S.
""This looks like it will be a waste of time for the two govts (esp China’s)...Who thinks US Treasury Dept is empowered to make THE deal to end the trade war?"", Scott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote on Twitter.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 05:33AM ET</span>","In eye of the storm, Turkey's new finance chief faces credibility test","By Humeyra Pamuk
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak faces a key credibility test on Thursday when he hosts a conference call with global investors to reassure them that policy makers can contain the country's worst currency crisis since 2001.
Albayrak, President Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law, was named finance minister just over a month ago and is a relative unknown for international investors, who fear Turkey's economy is increasingly hostage to political interference.
The lira has lost nearly 40 percent against the dollar this year, tumbling to a low of 7.24 on Monday, fueled in part by Erdogan's relentless calls for lower interest rates despite soaring inflation. The slump has led to fears of contagion across emerging markets.
Some 3,000 investors and economists have registered for Thursday's call, due at 1300 GMT. Albayrak is not expected to take questions, but investors will be looking for signs he has the strength to act independently of his father-in-law.
""The big strike against him is his being Erdogan's son-in-law,"" said Paul McNamara, an investment director at GAM London Limited. ""Even if he was the best man for the job, the optics are Third World.""
The lira firmed 3 percent on Thursday ahead of Albayrak's presentation, partly on the back of liquidity measures by the central bank to try to stabilize the currency without resorting to an outright hike of its benchmark interest rate.
Albayrak, married to Erdogan's daughter Esra, studied banking and finance in the United States and worked for Turkish conglomerate Calik Holding, seen as close to Erdogan's ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party. He rose to become chief executive officer before entering politics three years ago.
Within months he was elevated to the cabinet as energy minister. In July, after Erdogan was re-elected with sweeping new executive powers, the president named him to head the newly established Treasury and Finance Ministry, putting him in charge of a portfolio previously divided between two ministers.
Turkish academics and newspaper columnists who attended a briefing with him in July portray Albayrak, 40, as well-equipped for the job of steering the Turkish economy, casting him as hands-on and willing to listen to contrary views.
International investors have so far been less convinced.
The lira lost nearly 3 percent within minutes of his appointment, with investors worried by the departure of former deputy prime minister Mehmet Simsek and former finance minister Naci Agbal, both seen as market-friendly figures in a country pursuing increasingly unorthodox economic policies. 
""The issue here is that he lacks credibility,"" Piotr Matys, an emerging markets strategist at Rabobank, said of Albayrak. ""The market doesn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt"".
""CLOSER TO THE MARKET""?
Investors are likely to want to see more detail from him than he delivered last Friday, when, from a hall in the ornate Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace on the shores of the Bosphorus, he outlined the government's new economic plan in a powerpoint presentation to Turkey-based bankers and business leaders.
He promised central bank independence, tighter budget discipline, structural reform and ""sustainable and healthy growth"". But the lack of detail or clear action worried markets.
In the presentation ""he was dealing with the right issues"" but was still talking about future action, said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging markets strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). 
""But it's too long. We need something right now,"" Tresca said. 
Albayrak has echoed Erdogan's assertion that the currency crisis is the result of an ""economic war"".
But while he may be little known to foreign investors, he has held a series of meetings in Turkey with business people, academics and civil society groups since becoming finance minister.
Kerem Alkin, an economics professor and writer at the pro-government Sabah newspaper, described him as ""energetic and open to all kinds of opinions"", citing a meeting he held with a group of academics in late July.
""He only made a short introductory speech and took notes tirelessly for two and a half hours... He welcomed opinions from people not close to the government,"" Alkin said.
Under constitutional changes that took effect after the July election, the post of prime minister was scrapped, narrowing the circle of influence around Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 15 years and who has branded interest rates the ""mother and father of all evil"".
The last time Turkey's central bank held an emergency meeting to hike rates, in May, it was then-prime minister Binali Yildirim who convinced Erdogan of the need for drastic action, people familiar with the matter said.
Whether Albayrak would be willing or able to do the same is an open question for investors.
Erdal Saglam, a columnist for Hurriyet newspaper who attended a July briefing with Albayrak, said the minister's thinking was ""closer to the market"" than many people imagine.

""But given his situation (as Erdogan's son-in-law), how much room he has to maneuver in implementing what he has in mind is difficult to gauge,"" Saglam told Reuters.

60,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",China and U.S. to Resume Low-Level Talks in Bid to Resolve Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- China will dispatch Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen to the U.S. for low-level trade talks in late August, the first official exchanges since earlier negotiations broke down two months ago.
The Chinese delegation led by Wang will meet with an American group led by David Malpass, under secretary for international affairs at the Department of the Treasury, at the invitation of the U.S., China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website on Thursday.
The news buoyed risk sentiment in Asian trading, with futures on the S&P 500 Index rallying as much as 0.4 percent. The offshore yuan gained against the dollar for the first time in seven days.
“This will be ‘talks about trade talks,’” said Gai Xinzhe, an analyst at the Bank of China’s Institute of International Finance in Beijing. “Lower-level officials will meet and haggle and see if there is a possibility for higher-level talks.”
While the talks are at a relatively low level for now, the market reaction clearly shows that people and investors in Asia are hopeful for successful negotiations. Before the deal collapsed in May, China agreed to ""significantly"" increase purchases of U.S. goods and services, and that may provide a guide for the next round of discussions.
Necessary Concessions
To restart trade negotiations with the U.S., China must offer a package of measures, according to Jacob Parker, the vice president for China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. China needs to make an offer that slashes the bilateral trade surplus, lowers import tariffs, provides better protection for intellectual property and stops forced technology transfers, Parker said earlier this month.
Caution is warranted, according to Gai. ""Even if the senior officials reach a deal, things could still change, as President Trump can easily flip-flop. We have been there.""
China’s equity market has suffered declines and the yuan has been on a losing streak for more than a month. Chinese authorities, bracing for economic fallout, have introduced measures to support growth ranging from shifting toward a more accommodative monetary policy to boosting fiscal spending.
The two nations had appeared to have reached a deal in May after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He -- President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser -- led a group of officials to Washington. But Trump backed away from the agreement soon afterward, and ever since the two sides have been locked in a trade standoff as they slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods.
The commerce ministry reiterated in the statement that China is against trade protectionism and won’t accept any unilateral trade restrictions. “China welcomes communications and dialogue on the basis of reciprocity, equality and integrity,” it said.
The Trump administration imposed duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month, a move that also prompted immediate retaliation from Beijing. Another $16 billion in levies will be effective later in August. Earlier this month, China announced a list of $60 billion worth of U.S. imports it plans to apply tariffs on, after Trump ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate.
Wang, who is the key official leading China’s trade talks worldwide, led an advance team to Washington in May. In a July interview, he told Bloomberg that he didn’t understand why the U.S. quickly reversed its course.
“Good faith negotiation is required,” Wang said then. “For any talk to be successful, no party should point a gun at the other party.”
Economists weren’t expecting much from the planned talks.
“Malpass has no trade authority,” said Derek Scissors, chief economist at the China Beige Book. “But nice for Chinese stocks.”

China approved 17 fixed-asset investment projects in July, worth a combined 77.69 billion yuan ($11.24 billion), Zhao Chenxi, an official at the National Development and Reform Commision (NDRC), told reporters on Thursday.
That compared with 20.8 billion yuan of fixed-asset investment projects approved in June, Reuters calculated from official data.
The government is accelerating plans to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects as its economy shows signs of cooling, with investment growth slowing to a record low and consumers becoming more cautious.
The NDRC also pledged on Wednesday to keep debt levels under control, one day after China reported surprisingly weak economic data, as Beijing tries to strike a balance between shoring up slowing growth and keeping up with the debt clampdown.
China has signed 1.73 trillion yuan worth of debt-to-equity swap agreements as of the end of July, but only 352 billion yuan has been transacted, said Chen Hongwan, another official with the NDRC.
Under debt-to-equity swap schemes, investors get equity stakes in firms and the firms are able to lower their debt burden, though the specifics of each deal are different and often complex.
This highlighted the difficulty authorities face in accelerating market-based debt-to-equity swaps in its multi-year deleveraging campaign even with July's fresh liquidity released by the central bank to quicken the program.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:03AM ET</span>",Japan ships fewer cars to U.S. as export growth slows,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export growth slowed more than expected in July as shipments to the United States fell for a second straight month, with the automotive sector down sharply and global trade disputes casting doubts over foreign demand.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Thursday showed exports rose 3.9 percent year-on-year in July, far below a 6.3 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. The rise followed a 6.7 percent year-on-year gain in June.
Japan's exports to the United States fell 5.2 percent year-on-year in July, down for a second straight month, due to a 12.1 percent decline in car shipments.
""The drop in U.S.-bound car exports was in reaction to brisk sales seen there a year ago, boosted by the solid U.S. economy and declines in oil prices,"" said an MOF official in charge of compiling the data.
""We cannot say whether it was affected by trade tensions with the United States.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has made the threat of heavy tariffs a core part of his agenda, with an eye on the U.S. auto sector's trade deficit with countries such as Germany and Japan, raising speculation about restrictions on U.S.-bound car exports.
Japanese carmakers have so far shown no sign of rushing to boost car shipments to the United States, which would happen if they anticipated higher tariffs were to be imposed on their products in coming months.
""While caution is heightening over U.S. trade policy, U.S. car sales are leveling off, causing Japan's car exports to the United States to level off as well,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""If capital outflows from emerging economies accelerate on top of this, it would cause a marked slowdown in global economy, further weighing on Japan's exports."" 
Imports from the United States rose 11.0 percent in the year to July, led by crude oil, motors and liquefied petroleum gas.
As a result, Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 22.1 percent year-on-year to 502.7 billion yen ($4.55 billion).
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 11.9 percent in July from a year ago.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, rose 8.0 percent, led by semiconductor production equipment and electronics parts for China and sales of steel to Thailand.
Overall imports rose 14.6 percent in the year to July, roughly matching economists' median estimate, resulting in a trade deficit of 231.2 billion yen, vastly exceeding the expected 50 billion yen.
Thursday's trade figures came after gross domestic product (GDP) data last week showed Japan's economy, the world's third largest, rebounded in the second quarter from a January-March dip.
Analysts say global economic growth is likely to support Japan's exports, but international trade conflicts are an ever-present risk to Japan's export-reliant economy.
The impact on the broader economy from higher U.S. tariffs on Japanese automotive exports would be significant, they say.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.9 percent in the second quarter on the back of household and business spending, recovering from an earlier contraction.

Earlier, the government cut its jobs outlook, expecting the Asia's fourth-biggest economy would add only 180,000 jobs this year, down from 320,000 estimated earlier. 
""The job market is the worst since financial crisis. The government's big challenge is how to support the job market through fiscal policies,"" Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said in a speech. 
""The polarization issue is very perplexing. From my point of view, economic growth and innovation would be difficult to sustain without addressing the issue,"" he said. 
Kim said next year's budget spending increase will be far higher than the 5.7 percent rise set earlier, noting that tax revenues will be robust until next year. 

Kim said the government would increase spending on research and development to support private firms' efforts to advance artificial intelligence, big data and hydrogen vehicles.

64,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>","Trump Says Tariffs Will Revive U.S. Steel Industry, WSJ Reports","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump believes his tariffs on steel will rescue the industry and is still considering an interview by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, he said in an interview Wednesday with the Wall Street Journal.
People may complain that steel prices are “a little bit more expensive” but they will eventually fall and the duties will protect an industry that is essential to national security, Trump said.
The result, the president said, will be competition that is “internal, like it used to be in the old days when we actually had steel, and U.S. Steel was our greatest company.”
Trump said he hopes the special counsel’s investigation will end and is considering whether to talk to Mueller. “We’re looking at it,” he said, though he asserted the inquiry has been “badly discredited.” Trump and his allies have frequently criticized the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump’s lawyers are still negotiating with Mueller’s team, hoping to limit the scope of the investigators’ questions. His lawyers last week rejected the latest offer from Mueller.
The president also defended his decision to revoke former CIA Director John Brennan’s security clearance and his public warning that he is looking into doing the same to other former national security officials who have been critical of him, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey.
“I don’t trust many of those people on that list,” Trump said. “I think that they’re very duplicitous. I think they’re not good people.”
Brennan wrote on Twitter that the removal of his security clearance was “part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom of speech & punish critics.”
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the revocation was in retaliation for Brennan’s criticism of Trump.
“Not at all,” she said. “The president has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information and who has access to it.”

Top Mexican officials started their fourth week of talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington over a new North American Free Trade Agreement.
Asked if the August goal was still viable, Guajardo said, ""That is why we are here. We are fully engaged. We don't know if there will be a successful conclusion.""
The U.S.-Mexico talks resumed in July, without Canada, after negotiations involving all three members of the $1.2 trillion trade bloc stalled in June.
Guajardo said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on the telephone and was ""hopeful"" Canada could soon hold trilateral NAFTA talks with the United States and Mexico.
Guajardo was joined by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator Kenneth Smith, and Jesus Seade, the designated chief trade negotiator of incoming Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Smith said Mexico and the United States were ""working well"" on the most difficult issues.
Mexico and Washington have been discussing rules for the automotive sector, which has been a major point of contention between the two countries.
The United States has sought tougher rules on what percentage of a vehicle's components need to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs, as well as demanding that a certain number of cars and trucks be made in factories paying at least $16 an hour.
New sticking points emerged last week over President Donald Trump's threat to impose steep automotive tariffs.

Guajardo said the teams had not yet touched the issue of a U.S. proposed sunset clause that would kill NAFTA after five years if it is not renegotiated again. Both Mexico and Canada have said they reject the measure.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Italy bridge collapse: The financial facts behind the fury,"By Valentina Za and Stefano Bernabei
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's anti-establishment government, outraged at the deadly collapse of a 50-year-old bridge, has presented the disaster as a warning to Brussels to give it more leeway to upgrade the country's aging infrastructure.
But the political anger generated by Tuesday's tragedy in Genoa, in which at least 39 people died, could instead end up piling even more financial pressure on the state - from nervous holders of its 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion) in bonds.
Within hours of the viaduct giving way and sending vehicles plummeting, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the EU must allow Rome to include in its next budget all the funds needed to ensure the country's infrastructure was safe.
That investment, to be calculated after an emergency audit of bridges and tunnels nationwide, comes on top of plans outlined by the government which took office in June to spend tens of billions of euros on tax cuts, easing pension rules and a basic income for the poor.
It also wants to avoid triggering a planned rise in value-added tax (VAT), agreed with Brussels by the previous government to meet budget goals.
For Italy's creditors, the fiscal gap is a growing worry.
A sell-off sent Italian bond yields rising sharply on Wednesday morning after Salvini used the bridge disaster to question EU limits on Italy's deficit. The bonds later rallied but their yields continue to offer a sizeable premium over safer German debt.
NOT ALWAYS A PRIORITY
Gustavo Piga, economics professor at Rome's Tor Vergata University, said regardless of EU rules, Rome had not always demonstrated that infrastructure was at top of its agenda.
""Italy sorely needs higher and better public investments but they haven't been a priority for politicians in recent years,"" Piga said, noting that the previous administration had even appeared to divert some funds away from infrastructure after winning some budgetary leeway from Brussels for investments.
Total investment and maintenance spending on Italian transport infrastructure fell by 58 percent between 2008 and 2015, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
But more money could have been invested, according to an Italian central bank analysis last year. As overall public investment in Italy fell 35 percent in real terms between 2007 and 2015, Rome hiked spending on everyday things like public salaries and pensions by 7 percent.
The European Commission also sent reminder on Wednesday that it had for some time been encouraging the ruling coalition in Rome to prioritize infrastructure spending.
The Commission, the EU's executive, said it had approved in April an 8.5 billion euro investment plan for Italian motorways, including in the Genoa region, under EU state aid rules.
Italy is also set to receive around 2.5 billion euros in European funds between 2014 and 2020 to invest in network infrastructures, such as roads or rail, the Commission added.
Italy's economy minister, a former economics professor who appears more attuned to the moods of markets than some of his colleagues, also hinted on Wednesday that infrastructure might not fit neatly into the call for easier EU funding rules.
Giovanni Tria said in a statement that his priority would not be just on higher public investment, which was already factored into his upcoming budget; the government would also aim to ""overcome shortfalls in the ability to spend and intervene"".
A Treasury source said Tria was already discussing a big overall public investment plan with EU officials, worth a total of 150 billion euros over 10 years. Italy does not need to raise its deficit to boost infrastructure spending, the source added.
KEEPING IT PRIVATE?
The bridge disaster may also fail to further the government's cause in Brussels for other reasons: the viaduct revealed problems not long after it was completed in 1967 and it is maintained by a private toll operator, not the government.
Autostrade per l'Italia, part of the Milan-listed  Atlantia  group (MI:ATL), said it complied with all its maintenance requirements and made regular safety checks on the bridge. It said it spent more than 1 billion euros a year over 2012-2017 to maintain and upgrade its road network spanning 3,000 km.
Autostrade has not disclosed its specific maintenance budget for the bridge, which was part of its concession on the A10 motorway linking the port city of Genoa with southern France.
Antonio Brencich, an engineering professor at Genoa University, told state television the bridge had been shown to be defective just two decades after it was built -- a comment supported by anecdotal evidence of those who lived below it.

""In the '80s pieces of cement came down and ruined parked cars, and there was a procedure -- you filled out a form to claim compensation for the repairs,"" said Salvatore Lorefice, 58, a pensioner who worked at a warehouse directly under the bridge.

The plan would provide direct financial aid to some companies affected by the tariffs and would support investments to improve productivity, worker training and boost market diversification, Quebec's Liberal government said in a news release. 
The Trump administration has imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from Canada and other nations, prompting retaliatory tariffs against the United States.
In June, Quebec said it would offer C$100 million in loans and loan guarantees to steel and aluminum companies hit by the U.S. tariffs.
Quebec's Liberal government, which is facing an October provincial election, said the plan announced on Wednesday would support C$3.1 billion ($2.4 billion) worth of company investments in the province.

""The Quebec economy is today threatened by the Trump administration's protectionist policies and their repercussions on the global economy,"" Premier Philippe Couillard said in the release. ""We are living in exceptional circumstances that demand an exceptional response.""

70,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Turkey Follows Russia in Dropping Off Top U.S. Creditor List,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey dropped off the U.S. government’s list of major owners of Treasury debt, following in the footsteps of Russia in reducing its portfolio.
Turkey’s holdings of bonds, bills and notes have fallen 42 percent in the first half of this year, dropping to $28.8 billion in June, according to a Treasury Department report released Wednesday. Treasury has a floor of $30 billion to be classified as a major holder.
Russia, which had previously been a top-10 foreign creditor to the U.S., remained off the list in June after slipping below the threshold a month earlier. Russia’s holdings held at a more than decade low of $14.9 billion, the Treasury data showed.
The sell-offs come as both economies are being squeezed by toughening U.S. sanctions and trade actions. The Trump administration last week imposed new sanctions against Russia in response to the nerve agent poisoning in the U.K. of a former Russian spy and his daughter.
U.S. relations with Turkey soured this week after President Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminum tariffs to pressure the nation to release a jailed American pastor. Turkey increased the tensions by announcing new tariffs on American products such as cars as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a boycott of iPhones and other U.S. electronics.
The holdings of China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, fell by $4.4 billion to $1.18 trillion. Japan’s portfolio of Treasuries, the second-largest, fell to a more than six-year low of $1.03 trillion.
Overall, foreign ownership of Treasuries was almost unchanged at $6.21 trillion in June.

71,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Venezuela Has $1 Billion Due Today. The Bonds Trade at 28 Cents,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s pay day for $1.125 billion of Venezuelan sovereign bonds. But no one is expecting to get any money.
After all, the bond in question is already in default due to a missed interest payment back in February. Why would Nicolas Maduro’s government fork over hundreds of millions of dollars it can’t afford to part with when the nation and its flagship oil company are already about $5 billion in the hole with creditors?
The one new thing today is that this missed payment will mark the first default on government bond principal, rather than just interest payments. The notes are already trading at just 28 cents on the dollar, indicating the low level of hope among investors.
Still, creditors are beginning to get restless. Mining company Crystallex -- which was forced into bankruptcy after Venezuela nationalized the Las Cristinas deposit -- was told by a Delaware judge last week that it can seize shares of the nation’s largest U.S. asset, PDV Holding, the U.S. parent of PDVSA’s refining unit Citgo. Separately, an $8 billion bondholder group advised by Millstein & Co. has said it’s “exploring options” to ensure that Venezuela’s overseas assets are available to satisfy creditor claims.
Even the Petroleos de Venezuela bonds due in 2020 backed by a slice of Citgo which the government has been careful to pay have retreated to about 86 cents from 90 cents after the Delaware court decision, which is being appealed.
According to Siobhan Morden, Nomura’s Latin America fixed income strategist, the cash crunch is worsening with oil production collapsing another 50,000 barrels a day in July and the future looks bleak for Maduro -- who is just beginning his second six-year term.
“We assume no funds allocated to make the sovereign amortization today as the first sovereign default and headline confirmation of cashflow stress,” Morden wrote in a note. “It still looks like a countdown with economic crisis morphing into political crisis for the Maduro administration.”
Where investors used to desperately ring public credit and payment agencies for signs of movement, all channels have gone quiet. Even the public credit office, which used to tweet out confirmation of payment, hasn’t sent a message related to sovereign bonds since November (hat tip to Siobhan). That was way back when Maduro called for an impossible debt restructuring that’s currently prohibited by U.S. sanctions."
72,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",The Trump Economy Is Strong. So Why Exaggerate?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s no denying that, since Donald Trump was sworn in as president in January 2017, the U.S. economy has been doing quite well. Growth in real gross domestic product has been steadily accelerating. (This chart and the next track year-over-year growth instead of the more commonly reported quarterly or monthly changes because that makes it easier to see trends.)
Strong job growth has also continued, with gains in nonfarm payroll employment even accelerating a little this year, which is pretty remarkable this deep into an economic recovery.
I started this chart in 2011 and the previous one in 2010 simply to avoid the big negative numbers of the Great Recession, which make it harder to see trends in the positive numbers since then. GDP started growing after the recession well before employment did, which is why the start years are different.
All those job gains since 2011 have kept the unemployment rate low and, more important, kept the employment-population ratio among prime-age workers rising.
The employment-population ratio is more important than the unemployment rate because, as President Trump pointed out again and again during the 2016 election campaign, the latter doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for jobs. This long expansion (if it lasts one more year, it will be the longest ever) has been pulling people by the millions off the sidelines and back into the labor force — although, as is apparent from the above chart, the prime-age employment rate is still below the previous expansion’s peak.
This rising employment rate is important to keep in mind when contemplating perhaps the least encouraging economic trend of the past couple of years: stagnant wages.
Yes, mainly because of rising inflation, real average earnings have gone nowhere over the past year. Real median earnings, which measures what those in the middle of the income distribution make, even fell slightly from the second quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018.
Remember, though, that there are a lot more Americans working now than there were at the beginning of 2017 — 3.4 million more according to the establishment survey from which payroll statistics are derived, 3.9 million more according to the household survey that’s used to calculate the unemployment rate. A lot of those people are joining the labor force after long layoffs or for the very first time. They’re generally not getting high-wage jobs, and that’s weighing on average and median wages. But they’re getting jobs!
One group that has benefited especially from the long recovery has been black Americans. Blacks are more likely to lose their jobs in downturns than whites, but they’re also more likely (relative to their share of the working-age population) to get hired when the economy is growing. Long economic expansions are good for everybody, but they’re especially good for blacks.
Which brings me to something false that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday about black employment, claiming that it had risen by 700,000 since her boss had taken office and by only 195,000 during Barack Obama’s entire time as a president. The first number is correct (black employment is up by 708,000 since January 2017), the second not even remotely so (actual number: 2.96 million). Sanders later tweeted an apology for getting the “time frame” wrong, although I wasn’t able to find any time frame during the Obama years for which black employment had risen exactly 195,000 from when he took office. The White House Council of Economic Advisers tweeted out some stats of its own, which appear to be factually correct but (1) didn’t match what Sanders had said and (2) took the dubious approach of measuring job gains from when the president was elected, which saddled Obama with two more months of Great Recession job losses that weren’t even remotely his fault.
Anyway, here are the actual stats on black employment gains, measured year-over-year as in the first two charts to make trends clearer:
These numbers jump around more than those in the earlier job growth chart because they’re from the noisier household survey; the establishment survey does not ask employers about workers’ race or ethnicity. But they generally show solid, if not accelerating, job growth for blacks, which has averaged 39,333 a month since Trump took office, compared with 30,781 a month during Obama’s two terms. That comparison seems a little unfair, given that Obama took charge in the middle of the worst recession in three-quarters of a century and Trump did not. But it is factual evidence that the Trump administration could cite to back up the assertion that the strong economy is helping black Americans. Yet more factual evidence: The employment-population ratio for blacks since Trump took office surpassed its highs of the previous expansion. 
Trump and his staffers and supporters, though, seem incapable of sticking to these facts. All administrations try to put the sunniest possible spin on economic statistics, but this administration is committed to impossibly sunny spins — like the president’s claims after last month’s GDP report of “an economic turnaround of historic proportions” and a rate of job growth that would have been “unthinkable” before he took office. All it takes is a quick glance at the charts in the column to see that these assertions are balderdash.
Which leads to an odd situation. The economy is doing well, yet a large share of media coverage of the economy involves correctly pointing out that it’s not doing nearly as well as the president and his minions say it is. Perhaps this is part of a grand plan by the president to rouse his most fervent supporters and make them hate the mainstream media even more than they already do. But Trump has been wildly exaggerating his own personal economic success for decades now, so I’m guessing it’s mainly just that he can’t help himself. I also don’t think it’s working for him. Polls continue to indicate that Trump is remarkably unpopular for a president presiding over such good economic times. If the economy slows markedly, or goes into reverse, his claims that everything is coming up roses will surely go over like a lead balloon."

LONDON (Reuters) - The plunge in Turkey's lira  to a series of record lows over the past week sent tremors through global markets. While the currency has recovered a little lost ground since Tuesday, investors are fretting about contagion via stress on foreign banks and firesales of emerging market assets. 
The following charts illustrate the fall in the lira and its effect across other asset classes.
1) THE FALLOUT IN SUM
This chart shows the change in assets since the start of the month, capturing the moves in Turkey.
Turkey's ripple effect on global assets, so far: https://reut.rs/2KTqwGI
MSCI emerging market stocks (MSCIEF) are now down 9.9 percent year-to-date, and continue to drift away from the direction of global stocks on the MSCI World index (MIWO00000PUS). This has also come about as emerging central banks collectively tighten monetary policy.
EM stocks decouple from global peers as rates rise: https://tmsnrt.rs/2vQ218X
Analysts are divided over how long and how deep a fallout global markets could experience from Turkey's currency crisis. 
""As long as we talk about idiosyncratic risks such as sanctions on Russia and Turkey's relations with the U.S. we can't talk of major contagion,"" said Steve Donze at Pictet Asset Management. ""To have contagion across EM you need broad based dollar strength.""
2) TAKING STOCK
The tumble in Turkey's currency rocked local stock markets. In dollar terms, MSCI's Turkey equity index (MITR00000PTR) has lost around 24 percent of its value since the start of August. The index has tumbled more than 50 percent since the start of the year compared with an around 10 percent decline in the broader emerging market index (MSCIEF).

3) SPILLOVER INTO OTHER EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES
The freefall in the lira has helped to drag down other emerging currencies. Argentina's peso hit its weakest on record with another emergency interest rate rise doing little to stem the drop. India's rupee also plumbed a record low, while Russia's rouble, South Africa's rand and Indonesia's rupiah all traded at their weakest in two or more years.
Stuart Culverhouse at Exotix Capital said sellers weren't just targeting markets which show similarities to Turkey. 
""Contagion and risk off are the main themes although we are seeing a generalized selloff rather than the 'similar characteristics' theory,"" he said.
Wide and widening current account deficits made a number of countries more vulnerable to investors cutting back on risk assets. ""On these metrics, Turkey, Argentina and Pakistan are among the most vulnerable,"" Culverhouse added. 
The falls across the board in emerging market currencies also precipitated a jump in the 1-month implied volatility of these currencies, indicating that investors expect more outsized moves in the coming days.

4) EURO & EURO ZONE BANKS
Shares of European banks (SX7E) - particularly those with sizeable operations in, and exposure to Turkey - sold off after reports that the European Central Bank was increasingly concerned about some lenders.
""Spanish lenders are most vulnerable to the worsening currency crisis, followed by French and Italian banks,"" noted Shweta Singh at TS Lombard. ""With Europe's large exposure to Turkey through banking sector flows, investors are increasingly worried about the fallout as the crisis unfolds.""
The pressure on European banks also spilled over into pressure on the euro currency, which weakened amid renewed concerns over the stability of the euro zone's financial system.

5) SAFE-HAVEN ASSETS
The U.S. dollar benefited from safe haven flows as investors exited risky assets and bought into U.S. Treasuries, thought to be the safest assets in the world. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury fell to its lowest in two weeks, while the greenback hit its highest level in a year.
Currencies viewed as safe havens, such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, also gained from the turmoil.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Turkey doubles tariffs on some U.S. imports; lira rallies,"By Daren Butler and Humeyra Pamuk
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey doubled tariffs on some U.S. imports including alcohol, cars and tobacco on Wednesday in retaliation for U.S. moves, but the lira rallied further after the central bank's liquidity moves had the effect of supporting the currency.
Ankara acted amid increased tension between the two NATO allies over Turkey's detention of a Christian American pastor and other diplomatic issues, which have helped send the lira tumbling to record lows against the dollar. 
The currency  has lost nearly 40 percent against the dollar this year, driven by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's growing influence on the economy and his repeated calls for lower interest rates despite high inflation.
It rebounded some 6 percent on Wednesday, briefly strengthening to less than 6.0 against the dollar, after the central bank squeezed lira liquidity in the market, effectively pushing up rates and supporting the currency.
Optimism about better relations with the European Union after a Turkish court released two Greek soldiers pending trial and a banking watchdog's step to limit foreign exchange swap transactions have also helped the lira.
""They are squeezing lira liquidity out of the system now and pushing interest rates higher,"" said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.
""Rates have gone up by 10 percent ... The central bank has not done this through a change in the benchmark rates, but they are squeezing liquidity, so the result is the same,"" Maggio said.
The lira firmed as far as 5.75 against the dollar on Wednesday and stood at 6.1320 at 1243 GMT in a move initially triggered by the Turkish court decision on the Greek soldiers who faced espionage charges.
A treasury desk trader at one bank said this showed relations with the EU could recover ""while tense relations continue with the USA."" 
The lira was also helped by a step from the banking watchdog BDDK, cutting the limit for Turkish banks' forex swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign banks to 25 percent of a bank's equity. 
""Remarkable turnaround,"" Tim Ash, Bluebay Asset Management senior emerging markets analyst wrote in a client note. ""They are killing offshore lira liquidity to stop foreigners shorting the lira,"" he said.
The lira had rebounded about 8 percent on Tuesday on news of a planned conference call on Thursday in which the finance minister will seek to reassure international investors. A Finance Ministry official said so far 3,000 people have signed up for the call.
Turkey's banking sector remained strong and liquid and the measures taken to support the market have started to show impact, Turkey's Akbank chief executive said and added there were was no withdrawal of deposits.
SPAT WITH U.S.
A decree signed by Erdogan doubled Turkish tariffs on passenger cars to 120 percent, on alcoholic drinks to 140 percent and on leaf tobacco to 60 percent. Tariffs were also doubled on goods such as cosmetics, rice and coal.
The duties were raised in response to the U.S. administration's ""deliberate attacks on our economy,"" Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. Last Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had authorised higher tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from Turkey.
The United States was the fourth largest source of imports to Turkey last year, accounting for $12 billion of imports, according to IMF statistics. Turkey's exports to the United States last year amounted to $8.7 billion, making it Turkey's fifth-largest export market.
NATO allies the United States and Turkey have been at loggerheads over a wide range of topics including diverging interests in Syria, Ankara's ambition to buy Russian defence systems and Andrew Brunson, a pastor on trial in Turkey for terrorism charges.
Trump has repeatedly asked for Brunson's release, while Ankara said the decision was up to the court. On Wednesday, a Turkish court in the Aegean province of Izmir, where Brunson is on trial, rejected the pastor's appeal to be released from house arrest. An upper court had yet to rule on the appeal, his lawyer told Reuters.
Washington warned more economic pressures may be in store for Turkey if it refuses to release Brunson, a White House official said on Tuesday.
Erdogan has said Turkey is the target of an economic war, and has made repeated calls for Turks to sell their dollars and euros to shore up the currency. On Tuesday, he said Turkey would boycott U.S. electronic products. 

In another high-profile case, a Turkish court ruled on Wednesday to release from jail Taner Kilic, the local chair of Amnesty International, a researcher from the rights group said.

77,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Sanctions Risk May Prompt First Russian Rate Hike Since 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s central bank, one of a handful in Europe to cut interest rates this year, could increasingly consider a hike after the ruble slumped following the latest U.S. sanctions and the risk of more to come.
The currency’s worst week since the 2015 oil crash and the price pressures it threatens to unleash are adding to the Bank of Russia’s long worry list after it already delayed plans to shift to a looser stance this year. With Governor Elvira Nabiullina previously indicating that all options will be on the table in case of “a sharp strengthening in pro-inflationary risks,” an increase in borrowing costs may be in play in the months ahead, according to economists including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s Alexey Pogorelov.
Only months after it stepped off the fast track to monetary easing with a pause at three consecutive meetings, the prospect of a hike underscores a change wrought in recent weeks by the fallout from U.S. sanctions and tremors rattling emerging markets from Turkey to Argentina. With inflation already on the rise, a weaker ruble could tip the balance by adding to risks that range from expectations for a weak harvest to an increase in value-added tax in 2019.
“The Bank of Russia can easily return the option of a rate hike, given the combination of factors of a weak ruble, an increase in inflation expectations and the VAT increase,” Pogorelov said.
Russia’s currency has come under heavy selling pressure amid tensions with the U.S., compounded by contagion from the crisis in Turkey. Ruble weakness after the last round of American penalties in April already forced the central bank to halt its monetary easing, with its benchmark remaining at 7.25 percent since then.
Last week, the ruble suffered an even bigger decline, retreating more than 6 percent before recouping some losses on Tuesday. It traded 0.8 percent weaker at 66.9 versus the dollar in Moscow on Wednesday.
Even before the latest bout of depreciation, the central bank was warning that inflation may temporarily overshoot its target of 4 percent. It predicts that price growth will speed up to 3.5 percent to 4 percent by year-end from 2.5 percent in July as a result of the government’s plan to raise the VAT rate to 20 percent from 18 percent.
Only a step separates Russian borrowing costs from a level deemed “neutral” - which the central bank previously described as a nominal key rate of 6 percent to 7 percent -- when monetary policy doesn’t contribute to a slowdown or acceleration of inflation relative to the target. The bank’s latest guidance is that that it’s “highly likely” to reach a neutral stance in 2019, a year later than planned.
Policy makers have three rate decisions remaining this year, starting with a meeting on Sept. 14. A Bloomberg survey conducted in late July found that most economists see the benchmark unchanged through the rest of the year before easing resumes in 2019.
At the present exchange rate, the ruble’s losses will contribute about half a percentage point to inflation, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview broadcast on state television late on Sunday. The central bank has estimated that each 10 percent decline in the currency’s value could add a percentage point to price growth.
What’s harder to assess is the impact on inflation expectations, which policy makers call a “pillar” of their rate decisions. Following the VAT announcement, the outlook for price growth among households for a year ahead has surged to 9.7 percent in July from 7.8 percent in April.
If the tax increase and the ruble’s depreciation lead to a “stable increase in inflation expectations and a decline in the ability to keep inflation near the target of 4 percent,” then the option of raising the key rate may return to the central bank’s “broad menu of possible decisions,” according to Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at the Russian Direct Investment Fund. “It’s also possible if risks for financial stability intensify,” he said.
One argument against moving to raise borrowing costs is that the Bank of Russia’s benchmark adjusted for inflation remains among Europe’s largest. The high level of real rates “leaves the central bank some room,” according to Michail Poddubsky, an analyst at Promsvyazbank PJSC.
But even those who see rates staying unchanged warn that a hike may now be a bigger risk.
“The Russian central bank’s stance will depend crucially on the move in inflation expectations,”  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) analysts including Peter Sidorov said in a report. “The risks are now tilted towards a rate hike for the next three to six months, but we are maintaining our baseline call of rates on hold, followed by a rate cut towards mid-2019.”

78,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 15:
1. Global Stocks Subdued Amid China, Turkey Jitters
In equities, global stocks were mostly lower in subdued trade, as bearish Chinese markets worsened investor sentiment already hurt by Turkey's financial crisis.
Asian stocks retreated to a one-year low, as investors were rattled by another sell-off in China, which tumbled more than 2% despite a liquidity injection by the People’s Bank of China.
Signs of the world's second-largest economy losing momentum and the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade conflict have weighed on Chinese equities.
The cautious sentiment carried over to Europe, where the region's major bourses were lower as concerns over the Turkish currency crisis continued to affect investors' appetite.
Turkey doubled tariffs on some U.S. imports including cars, alcohol and tobacco on Wednesday in retaliation for U.S. moves, in the latest escalation in tensions between the two countries.
Despite the news, the Turkish lira rallied a further 3% against the dollar, while the BIST 100 index was down 1.5%.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures looked set to open lower, as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings and economic data.
The blue-chip Dow futures indicated a loss of 135 points, or around 0.5%, by 6:30AM ET, the S&P 500 futures dipped 15 points, or around 0.5%.
Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to a drop of 50 points, or roughly 0.7%, as disappointing results from Chinese tech giant Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) looked set to drag down the sector.
2. Macy's Reports Earnings
Macy’s (NYSE:M) is one of the last notable names slated to report fiscal second-quarter results before U.S. markets open, as the earnings season continues to wind down.
The retailer is expected to report earnings of 50 cents per share on revenue of $5.56 billion, according to estimates.
Investors will be closely watching the results for a view of general consumer confidence in the economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
Shares of Macy's were trading little changed in premarket. The stock has more than doubled over the last year as the retail sector - beaten down through 2015 and 2016 - has staged a big comeback over that period.
Other headliners expected out today include S&P 500 members NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), both due after the bell.



3. Dollar Hits Another 13-Month Peak
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar hit another 13-month high against a basket of major currencies, as safe-haven demand rooted in fears over fallout from the Turkish lira's recent drop boosted the U.S. currency.
The U.S. dollar index was up 0.15% to 96.70, after climbing to an overnight peak of 96.76, its best level since June 27, 2017.
The greenback's strength has also been bolstered by a drop for the euro, as investors continued to worry over the region's banking sector exposure to the Turkish economy.
The euro was last down about 0.2% at 1.1325 (EUR/USD), after earlier touching a new 13-month low of 1.1317.
The pound also hit a 13-month low, dropping 0.2% to 1.2692, before crawling back to 1.2715 (GBP/USD).
Elsewhere in foreign exchange markets, China's offshore yuan weakened about 0.3%, last trading at 6.9175 yuan per dollar after falling as far as 6.9210, its lowest level since March 2017.
In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield declined 1 basis point to 2.882% after poking above 2.900% on Tuesday.
4. U.S. Retail Sales In Focus
On the data front, the Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for July at 8:30AM ET.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.2% last month, moderating from a gain of 0.5% in June.
Excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.4%, the same as its increase a month earlier.
Also on the economic calendar will be the New York Fed’s Empire State manufacturing reading for the month of August, followed by the Federal Reserve’s July report on industrial production and the NAHB’s homebuilder sentiment reading for August.
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year, with the next move higher coming at its September meeting.
5. Oil Slips Ahead Of EIA Supply Report
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended August 10 at 10:30AM ET.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by nearly 3.7 million barrels last week.
New York-traded WTI crude futures shed 77 cents, or 1.2%, to $66.27 per barrel, while Brent futures declined 76 cents $71.69 per barrel.
Sentiment was also clouded by a darkening economic outlook which could start impacting oil demand, traders said.
Elsewhere in commodity markets, gold prices extended their decline to a 19-month low, as the yellow metal found little in the way of safety flows.
Spot gold fell $6.90, or 0.6%, to $1,187.20, its lowest level since January 2017.

79,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Turkey Limits Banks’ Ability to Short Lira in Latest Crisis Move,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish regulators took another step to help the battered lira, making it harder for banks to short the currency through the swap market.
The Ankara-based Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, known as BDDK, said on Wednesday that the total amount of foreign currency and lira swap and swap-like transactions can’t exceed 25 percent of banks’ legal shareholder equity. A 50 percent limit had been imposed on Monday.
The lira rose for a second day, jumping as much as 7 percent against the dollar and recovering some of the losses this month triggered by tensions with the U.S. Those tensions have been centered on a dispute over the detention of an American pastor, which resulted in tariffs and sanctions. The dispute exacerbated existing concerns about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s unorthodox approach to economic policy.
The plunge in the lira on Monday extended its losses against the dollar this year to more than 40 percent -- more than any other emerging market and major currency. On Monday, the central bank promised “all necessary measures” to maintain financial stability, but didn’t specifically mention higher interest rates and hasn’t raised them yet, even though Turkish corporate and banking executives have asked it to.
Financial Strength
Wednesday’s move came a day after the banking watchdog took an unconventional step to support the nation’s beleaguered banks, temporarily excluding the effect of day-to-day securities losses on how their financial strength is calculated.
The suspension of mark-to-market calculations on capital adequacy ratios will continue until prices of securities “normalize,” the banking regulator said in a document sent to banks on Tuesday. The ""recent speculative volatility in markets"" caused an “unfair erosion"" in banks’ capital strength, it said. Under mark-to-market accounting, portfolios must reflect assets’ current market values rather than their book values.
The average capital adequacy ratio of the banking system stands at 16 percent as of the end of June, according to official data. Every 10 percent decline in the lira reduces capital adequacy ratios by around 50 basis points on average, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report published on Aug. 6.
Loan Restructurings
Separately, the BDDK published a new set of regulations on loan restructurings by banks, financial leasing and factoring firms in the Official Gazette on Wednesday.
The new rules make it possible for lenders to extend the maturities of outstanding loans to clients, refinance them, make new loans to help troubled companies, and seek new collateral. Banks can also demand debtors sell assets to repay debts and improve their finances. Overdue loans can now be restructured within two years from the day a framework agreement is signed.

RIGA (Reuters) - The short-term market impact will be significant if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said during a visit to Latvia on Wednesday.
Britain is due to quit the EU in less than eight months, but the government has yet to agree with Brussels the terms of its departure. It has stepped up planning for the possibility of leaving without a formal agreement.
Sterling fell last week, in part on concern about the state of negotiations and the chance of a no-deal Brexit.
Asked about the possible market reaction to leaving without a deal, Hunt said at news conference: ""Well, of course, there will be significant short-term impact, but I think in these situations the British economy would find a way to get through it and, indeed, we would find a way ultimately to thrive and be successful."" 
Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkevics, who met with Hunt on Wednesday to discuss Brexit, told the same news conference he now estimated the possibility of reaching a deal by the March 29 exit day was 50-50.
Hunt said he did not want to put a percentage on it.
""Of course, there is this risk of a no-deal. But I think there are a growing number of countries that recognize that would be a very, very big mistake not just for the United Kingdom, but for the EU as well,"" he said.
""So rather than speculating on exact percentages, let’s work hard to make sure that doesn’t happen.""
During a visit to Helsinki on Tuesday, Hunt said the risk of a no-deal Brexit has been increasing and everyone needed to prepare for the possibility of a ""chaotic no-deal Brexit"". 
Both London and Brussels say they want to reach agreement at an Oct. 18 EU Council, but diplomats think that target date is too optimistic. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected key elements of British Prime Minister Theresa May's new trade proposals last month.
Economists say failure to agree the terms of leaving would do serious damage to the world's fifth-largest economy as trade with the EU, Britain's largest market, would become subject to tariffs.

Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for the economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU. Meanwhile, some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.

Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's popular 38-year-old prime minister, campaigned before September's election on a promise to clamp down on house price growth and reduce high rates of homelessness, in part by banning foreign buyers.
""This is a significant milestone and demonstrates this government’s commitment to making the dream of home ownership a reality for more New Zealanders,"" Associate Finance Minister David Parker said.
Foreign ownership has attracted criticism in recent years as New Zealand grapples with a housing crunch that has seen average prices in the largest city, Auckland, almost double in the past decade and rise more than 60 percent nationwide.
House price growth has tapered off in the past year in part due to restrictions imposed on lending by the central bank, which was becoming alarmed at the potential financial stability risk of an overheated market.
Figures released by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand on Wednesday showed median house prices had slipped 1.8 percent to NZ$550,000 ($360,140) in July from the previous month, although they were still 6.2 percent higher than the same time the previous year. 
The government slightly relaxed the proposed ban in June so that non-residents could still own up to 60 percent of units in large, newly built apartment buildings but would no longer be able to buy existing homes.
The International Monetary Fund called on the government in July to reconsider the ban, warning the move could discourage foreign direct investment necessary to build new homes.
Official figures suggest that the overall level of foreign home buying was relatively low - about 3 percent of property transfers nationwide. 
However, the data did not capture property bought through trusts and also showed property transfers involving foreigners was highly concentrated in certain areas, such as downtown Auckland and the southern scenic hot spot of Queenstown.
The majority of overseas buyers were from China and neighboring Australia, according to Statistics New Zealand.
""Is the ban wise or useful? We think it’s neither,"" said spokesman Dave Platter of Chinese real estate portal Juwai.com.
""Foreign buying ... tends to be focused on new development, making clear again that foreign investment leads to the creation of new dwellings. That's vital in a market with a housing shortage, like Auckland,"" he said. 
The government has said the ban would not apply to Australians and has been negotiating with Singapore, whose free trade agreement with New Zealand allows foreign ownership, on whether to grant an exemption.

The growth is expected to be driven by Chinese securities firms seeking new investment and funding opportunities as well as rising cross-border deal activities, consultancy Quinlan & Associates said on Wednesday.
It forecast China's total securities revenue pool to rise to 708 billion yuan ($103 billion) by 2023, up from 311 billion yuan in 2017.
China's securities industry, which includes brokerage and underwriting services, has historically been dominated by domestic players. Foreign firms, which can only own minority stakes in joint ventures with Chinese companies, have struggled to gain market share.
Income from the top eight domestic Chinese brokerages was more than eight times that of the top eight joint ventures last year, according to the consultancy's analysis of data from the Securities Association of China.
However, China's vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao announced last November that foreign firms could own 51 percent of securities joint ventures, and their domestic partners did not need to be securities firms.
The rule change would allow foreign banks to benefit from the rapidly-growing fee pool in China, though it is unclear when it would take effect.
""Foreign banks can't compete with the local players on price or balance sheet, but they can when it comes to creating complex products that aren't available on the mainland, and in cross border activities,"" said Quinlan & Associates Chief Executive Officer Ben Quinlan.
Foreign banks such as JPMorgan (N:JPM), UBS (S:UBSG) and Nomura (T:8604) have applied for approval to hold majority stakes in Chinese securities joint ventures.
However, little is known publicly about the status of these applications.
Quinlan said rising trade tensions between China and the United States could slow the easing of rules on foreign holdings in the Chinese securities sector.
""I think the one potential hurdle is a possible trade war,"" Quinlan said, although he added that there were indications that Chinese regulators wished to open up the sector.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's commerce ministry said a U.S. decision to subsidize renewable energy firms and impose tariffs on imported products has seriously distorted the global market and harmed China's interests, firing the latest shot in a broader trade conflict.
China has lodged a complaint to the World Trade Organisation to help determine the legality of the U.S. policies, saying they not only harm China's rights but also undermine the WTO's authority, the ministry said on its website late on Tuesday. (http://www.mofcom.gov.cn). 
Washington announced in January that it was imposing what it called safeguard tariffs over four years - with a 30 percent tariff in the first year reduced gradually to 15 percent in year four.
""As the U.S. violations have severely distorted the global market for products like photovoltaics and seriously damaged China's trade interests, China's use of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is a necessary measure to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and maintain multilateral trade rules,"" the commerce ministry statement said.
The move is not expected to have an immediate impact on China's major solar manufacturers, including GCL (HK:0451), Jinko Solar (N:JKS) and Canadian Solar , as their exposure to U.S. markets was reduced after earlier trade disputes.
One Chinese executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that U.S. solar tariffs were a ""sideshow"" and had little effect on Chinese business.
Peng Peng, a researcher with the China Renewable Energy Industry Association described the dispute as ""a microcosm of the big trade spat"".
""The solar problem has existed for years. I think China chose to bring it up in order to keep up the rhythm of the trade dispute,"" she said. 
The United States has accused China of using subsidies and bulk manufacturing capacity to drive down prices and put U.S. competitors out of business in a range of sectors. 
According to figures from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA), U.S. solar module production capacity fell from 1.5 gigawatts in 2011 to 1 GW last year as a result of bankruptcies.
China claims its manufacturers have benefited not from direct subsidy but from a fierce competitive environment that has driven down costs. 
This year, its firms are facing a new wave of closures after the country's state planning agency announced plans to cap new capacity at just 30 GW this year, down from a record 53 GW in 2017.
Despite the policy shift, manufacturers have continued to ramp up production, with silicon wafer output up 39 percent in the first half. 
From January to May, exports of solar products also surged 21 percent year-on-year. Only a fraction went to the United States, with India the biggest market.
""Solar is only a piece on the big trade chessboard,"" said another Chinese solar executive, who also declined to be named.
""I don’t think the complaint is necessarily a good thing for Chinese solar industry since it adds more uncertainties to the big (trade) war,"" he added.

While the trade frictions with the United States will have a negative impact on the Chinese economy, China will ensure that its annual growth target will be met, said Cong Liang, spokesman at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year. Gross domestic product grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, slowing from the 6.8 percent pace in the first three months.
Data is increasingly pointing to a cooling economy as an ongoing campaign by Beijing to curb risks in the financial system raises borrowing costs and squeezes small businesses.
To help firms affected by tighter financing, China has taken steps to boost liquidity and has urged banks to extend more loans to companies. It has also affirmed pro-growth fiscal policies.
This week, local governments rolled out railway investment plans as Beijing pushed them to speed up issuance of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects.
As the world's second-biggest economy slows, China and the United States are imposing tariffs on each other's goods, with more set to be activated next week. There are few signs that either side is ready to compromise.
So far, official data for January-to-July shows trade frictions have had limited impact on the economy, and any impact from higher tariffs will be ""controllable"", the NDRC's Cong said. 
China's efforts to ease credit conditions in the economy have sparked concerns that funds would find their way back into the once red-hot real estate sector.
Cong said China would ""resolutely curb"" property price rises.

(Reuters) - A staunch ally of President Donald Trump, Kris Kobach, won the closely contested Republican nomination for the Kansas governor’s race on Tuesday when incumbent Governor Jeff Colyer conceded the election. 
Kobach's win marks another successful endorsement for Trump, who has weighed in on Republican primaries in several state and federal races, including Georgia's governor primary, signaling the embattled president remains popular with his base. 
Kobach, who serves as the Kansas secretary of state, in the latest tally for the Aug. 7 primary election, had received 128,543 votes, or 345 more votes than Colyer. 
""I’ve just had a conversation with the secretary of state and I congratulated him on his success and I repeated my determination to keep this seat in Republican hands,"" Colyer said at a news conference. 
""This election is probably the closest in America but the numbers are just not there, unless we were to go to extraordinary measures,"" Colyer said. 
Kansas state law allows for a recount if the vote margin is within half a percentage point, but Colyer decided against making the request.
While Kansas traditionally votes for Republicans at the federal level, the state has traded between Republicans and Democrats in the state capital, and after Brownback passed a series of tax cuts that led to a fiscal crisis, Democrats see an opening to win the race, particularly against the polarizing Kobach. 
Kobach has been a prominent leader of the push to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws. He advised Trump's presidential campaign on immigration and served as vice chairman of the president's short-lived voter fraud commission.
""I look forward to working with Governor Colyer and all Republicans to keep Kansas red in November!"" Kobach said in a statement on Twitter on Tuesday.
Colyer had been appointed governor after Sam Brownback vacated the post to join Trump's administration. 
Kobach will face Laura Kelly, who won the Democratic nomination, in November.

Trump won the state over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by about 20 percentage points.

87,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",New Zealand Poised to Crack Down on Foreign Home Buyers,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s government is poised to ban foreigners from buying residential property, making good on its promise to crack down on offshore speculators who it says are partly to blame for spiraling house prices.
The Overseas Investment Amendment Bill, which will place limitations on foreign purchasers, is due to receive its final reading in parliament later Wednesday in Wellington. Backed by all three parties that make up the government, the bill is expected to pass.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern campaigned on a foreign buyer ban in last year’s election, saying overseas speculators had driven up house prices and made property unattainable for many young Kiwis. Prices have surged more than 60 percent in the past decade amid record immigration and a construction shortfall, driving home ownership to its lowest since 1951.
“We believe the market for New Zealand homes should be set in New Zealand, not on the international market,” Attorney General and Associate Finance Minister David Parker, who is shepherding the bill through parliament, said Aug. 1. “It is our birthright.”
While data suggest foreign buyers play only a small role in New Zealand’s housing market, wealthy Americans such as tech billionaire Peter Thiel and former U.S. broadcaster Matt Lauer have made headlines for snapping up some of the most pristine property in the country. Those cases and others have fueled the perception that New Zealand is being used as a bolthole for the world’s elite.
The bill, which the government says will bring New Zealand into line with neighboring Australia, will classify residential land as “sensitive,” meaning non-residents or non-citizens can’t purchase existing dwellings without the consent of the Overseas Investment Office.
Foreign buyers will need to show they are either increasing the number of residences and then selling them, for example by building an apartment block where a house once stood, or converting the land to another use, the government has said. They will need to convince regulators that whatever they do will have wider benefits to the country.
The government has faced down objections from wealthy investors who have warned that the ban may curb broader investment in the economy and hurt New Zealand’s reputation in offshore markets.
Former Prime Minister John Key, who opposes the ban, said wealthy investors added value to New Zealand through their international connections and the nation needed to be open for business in the global marketplace.
“New Zealand is a little country at the bottom of the world,” Key said in a phone interview from his Auckland home. “Will we get rich selling things to five million New Zealanders or selling things to three billion middle-income consumers? Personally, I think it’s the latter.”
The ban comes as house-price inflation abates and a slump in business confidence threatens to further curb economic growth. House prices rose 5.1 percent in July from a year earlier, the slowest pace since October. The Reserve Bank said last week it can’t rule out cutting the official cash rate to a new record low.
Rate-Cut Risk
“To our mind, the main risk that could bring about an OCR cut is the housing market,” Dominick Stephens, chief New Zealand economist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Auckland, said in a note this week. “The foreign buyer ban is about to come into force, and we simply do not know how it will affect the market.”
Westpac’s expectation is that nationwide annual house-price inflation will slow to around zero by the end of 2018, Stephens said. “But if the foreign buyer ban creates a greater downdraft in prices, then the game could change. The RBNZ would likely react with OCR cuts in such a scenario.”
The government says the foreign buyer ban, tax adjustments and its program to build 100,000 new homes over 10 years will rebalance the property market and make houses more affordable for first-time buyers.
“We are determined to make it easier for Kiwis to buy their first home, so we are stopping foreign speculators buying houses and driving up prices,” Ardern said when she announced the policy last year. “Kiwis should not be outbid like this.”
New Housing
Overseas investors will still be able to buy new housing, particularly apartments, rentals and homes available to purchase under rent-to-own or shared-equity arrangements. They will also be able to invest in retirement villages, student accommodation and aged-care facilities.
Developers of large apartment complexes will be able to sell as much as 60 percent of units to overseas persons off-the-plans without the purchaser needing to obtain consent or on-sell once construction is complete.
Resident visa holders who spend at least 183 days a year in New Zealand will be able to purchase homes under the regime without obtaining consent. Australian and Singapore citizens are exempt from the rules to comply with existing trade agreements.

“We’re going to continue to call on Turkey to do the right thing and release those individuals,” including pastor Andrew Brunson, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing Tuesday.

Erdogan vowed Tuesday to boycott American electronics, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhones, in a defiance of Trump’s demands.
While even a widespread Turkish boycott would do little to dent U.S. economic interests, it shows Erdogan is refusing to give in to market turmoil that’s pushed borrowing costs to record highs and threatens to descend the nation into a financial crisis.
While diplomatic tensions rage, the currency rallied for the first time in a week as Turks cashed in dollar savings to take advantage of the huge slump in the local currency.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Starboard Value said on Tuesday that it sold half of its stake in consumer products company Newell Brands, whose chief executive officer it sought to replace, about four months after ending its proxy contest.
The activist firm, run by Jeffrey Smith, said it owned 8.7 million shares of the maker of Sharpie markers, Mr. Coffee machines and Elmer's Glue on June 30 after selling 9.8 million shares at some point during the second quarter. Starboard bought in during the first quarter of 2018.
The information came in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires large investment managers to say which U.S. stocks they own.
Early in the year, Starboard owned 3.8 percent of Newell and called for Chief Executive Michael Polk to be ousted and the entire board to be replaced. The company struck a deal giving Starboard two board seats in April. 
Smith called the company is ""extremely undervalued"" in April. 
Since January, Newell's stock price has fallen 34 percent. In the last five days, it dropped 10 percent.
Starboard's filing also showed that it sold half of its stake in mall operator Macerich Company (NYSE:MAC). Starboard nominated directors for the firm in April. 
It also sold 60 percent of its position in drugmaker Depomed, where it won board seats last year.

The fund's biggest new position was a 4.3 million share stake in web development services company Web.com Group.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Turkey's financial markets spiral down, threatening the country's economy, investors are gauging whether emerging markets as an asset class are in danger of falling out of grace. The following selection of data points indicate there is relative weakness in Argentina and South Africa, while Asia and Mexico show strength.
A plunge in the Turkish lira has set off a wave of selling across emerging market assets, reviving fears of contagion that has been the sector's Achilles heel for decades.
Stock prices fell significantly while government bond yields rose across emerging markets. The bout of selling has taken prices and spreads near their 15-year average, indicating further declines could turn out to be good buying opportunities.
(Graphic: EM Equity valuations, bond spreads: https://reut.rs/2P2i8Ip)
Most countries listed here import more goods than they export, in value terms. Argentina, with the largest net deficit on this list, is one of the markets usually expected to suffer under continued U.S. dollar strengthening.
(Graphic: Import/Export balance in key EM economies: https://reut.rs/2P8QeKB
Foreign direct investment (FDI) supports economic growth in most cases and can make up for a current account deficit. Combined with data on import/export balances, the FDI data highlights South Africa as a likely weak spot if concerns over Turkey spread globally.
(Graphic: Foreign direct investment, net inflows: https://reut.rs/2P5gYf0)
Emerging market equities measured in U.S. dollars are strongly linked to the performance of local currencies. The lira's troubles so far this year are comparable only to Argentina's peso and both have made for sharp negative stock returns in greenbacks. The Mexican peso is one of the few emerging market currencies to rise this year and its stock market has outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets index by over 900 basis points.

Argentina and Turkey are ahead again in a measure of the government debt yield spread to U.S. Treasuries. As their currencies weaken and their ability to grow their economies comes into question, investors demand more and more yield to hold these countries' debt.

91,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Trump Hurts U.S. Exports in the Marketplace of Ideas,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you are a believer in free markets, you might be tempted to be pleased by some of the more positive policies of the Trump administration: lower corporate tax rates, more market-friendly judges, a greater emphasis on deregulation. Resist (the temptation, if not the administration). When it comes to ideas, the lifeblood of capitalism, the influence of President Donald Trump isn’t nearly so benign.
In fact, even without considering its policy on free trade, advocates of dynamic capitalism should be especially suspicious of the Trump presidency. Consider one of the most prominent pro-market arguments, as it is applied to some other more general contexts.
It is often suggested, by Senator Bernie Sanders among others, that the U.S. should become more like Denmark, with higher taxes, stronger social protections and tougher regulation. Maybe that would increase economic security for many Americans — but it also could make the U.S. economy less dynamic and innovative, by limiting incentives and transferring resources away from the private sector. American innovations — smartphones, medical devices, entertainment and so on — spread around the world. As a general rule, when evaluating a policy for the U.S., the focus first should be on America as a global ideas generator and distributor.
Another example: Americans pay much higher prices for prescription drugs than do most people in the rest of the world. Should the government limit or bargain down those prices? Well, lower prices would reduce the incentive of pharmaceutical companies to buy, discover and market innovations, to the detriment of patients in many countries. Whether or not you are persuaded by this argument, it is central to the case for markets in the 21st century.
OK, so how does all this relate to President Trump?
American innovation is not limited to the products and services it exports. The U.S. is also a rich source of new thinking and ideas. Good ideas are globally interdependent and central to capitalism.
And since Trump took office, America has lost much of its global standing. It is no longer considered a beacon of tolerance and democracy, and is seen as uninterested if not hostile to much of the rest of the world. A Gallup poll in early 2018 found that global confidence in U.S. leadership never has been lower, and China now stands in higher overall favor.
My anecdotal experience is consistent with this data. When I was in Nigeria last year, a cab driver in Lagos cackled to me that “Now America finally has a Nigerian president!”
The days when America was a model democracy that other countries aspired to are largely past, at least for the time being. America is now exporting the notions that corruption and intolerance are a perfectly normal part of the executive branch of government, even in the world’s No. 1 economic and military power. Furthermore, it is not obvious how much the legislative branch — Congress — will check these abuses, especially if the Republican majority remains in power.
Over time, those ideological “exports” may prove a bigger problem than any particular misguided Trump policy. Trump too, is an innovation, and various populist right and alt-right parties around the world have taken comfort and drawn inspiration from his rise. Again, focus on the same general point that has made the American capitalist system so potent: Follow the ideas.
While I am not a Trump supporter, I do find many foreigners’ criticisms of America (and, sometimes, Trump) are overstated. The U.S. economy is doing fine, ordinary Americans remain mostly tolerant, and questions about Trump are being promptly and thoroughly investigated. (Contrast the Mueller investigation with Germany’s failure to officially investigate the strong connections between former Prime Minister Gerhard Schröder and the Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).)
Still, all Americans have to live with these misperceptions, however unfair or incomplete they may be. In other words, part of the job of the president of the global hegemon, namely America, is to put up with criticism and maintain a brave face nonetheless. Trump has been spectacularly bad at that. Furthermore, a lot of these perceptions do ring true, such as the notion that Trump is using the presidency to enrich himself, that he engages in petty bickering, and that he simply is not well-informed about foreign affairs.
It is a truism that ideas have consequences. Nevertheless, we neglect it at our peril."

South Africa has been hit by steel and aluminum tariffs and the detrimental effect could be exacerbated if they are extended to the automotive industry, which the minister said accounts for about 7 percent of South Africa’s economy. In response, the nation could remove U.S. poultry concessions, though that is subject to a court application by South African producers and may not be a decision that is taken directly by government, Davies said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
Farming Goods
Local producers are putting pressure on the government to retaliate and place tariffs on imports of beef, poultry and pork from the U.S. In 2016, South Africa retained preferential access for its farming goods to the world’s biggest market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act after meeting benchmarks set by former U.S. President Barack Obama to allow the import and sale of U.S. meat products.
More than a third of U.S. imports from South Africa in 2017 was covered by AGOA, with transportation equipment including cars and components being the biggest contributor.
Further tariffs on South African produced vehicles and components that are currently part of the AGOA deal would hurt the local manufacturing industry and lead to a job losses, Davies said. That may harden calls for South Africa to retaliate, he said.
“If you take out autos, iron and steel and you take out aluminum, what is theremaining value for us of AGOA,” he said. “This is not just a one-way street and our constituents will respond and who knows where that will take us.”

94,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Prices Are Rising for Walmart and Consumers May Feel the Pain ,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s getting more expensive for retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to stock its shelves with household staples like diapers, paper towels and bottled water. The question now is whether that translates into more pain at the check-out line.
Soaring costs for transportation and raw materials -- some related to tariffs -- have prompted Procter & Gamble Co., Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), Coca-Cola Co. and others to announce price increases this summer on a wide swath of consumer staples. The companies are betting that demand will remain steady even though wage growth is tepid and Americans’ wallets are already getting pinched by higher gas prices during the peak summer driving season.
Now it’s Walmart’s move. The world’s biggest retailer faces some hard choices as it prepares to release second-quarter results Thursday. It may choose to pass along those price hikes to consumers. But that’s a riskier move nowadays as shoppers can easily defect to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). or deep-discounters like  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG). and Aldi. Walmart could also play hardball with suppliers, perhaps by demanding rebates elsewhere or promoting its own portfolio of more affordable store-brand products.
“The consumer-product makers are seeing their costs go up, and they have to pass them through,” said Ken Harris, managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group. “But the retailers are negotiating hard against price increases because they know that whatever they do from a pricing standpoint is totally transparent in this environment.”
Consumer Costs
If Walmart does end up passing along some of the manufacturers’ price increases, it would be a departure from its strategy of reducing price tags across the aisles in recent quarters to blunt the appeal of other grocery chains, particularly the German discounters whose stores increasingly dot the landscape. Walmart executives call the practice “investing in price,” and while it depresses profit margins, it’s widened the price gap between Walmart and rivals in recent quarters, which improves shopper traffic, according to analysts.
But those price cuts happened during a record bout of deflation for groceries, which make up 56 percent of Walmart’s U.S. sales. Now, inflation is creeping back, and retailers would prefer to move their prices up in lockstep. But there’s no guarantee shoppers will go along with those plans -- they could buy generics instead, or find the same product cheaper online, where prices change on the fly. On average, sellers on Amazon’s third-party marketplace change their prices every other day, according to e-commerce researcher Profitero.
“Legacy bricks-and-mortar retailers simply cannot change prices as quickly,” said Chris Walton, an industry consultant.
Rising Costs
The pricing tension isn’t the only thing weighing on Walmart lately. The tightest trucking market in years hits Walmart just as hard as its suppliers. The employee wage hike it announced earlier this year has now fully kicked in, along with other benefits like a college-tuition subsidy that could cost billions. And it’s still spending like mad to expand its e-commerce business, rolling out curbside pickup of online grocery orders and paying $16 billion to acquire most of India’s leading -- yet money-losing -- online retailer.
Those costs have dented Walmart’s profitability and weighed on its shares, which are down about 8 percent in 2018 after two straight years of gains. Still, most analysts and investors consider the spending necessary amid the encroachment by Amazon and the brick-and-mortar discounters.
“If you own Walmart, you have to come to grips with the fact that they have to continue to invest to grab the attention of the consumer,” said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund, which owns Walmart shares.
Walmart declined to comment.
Earnings Outlook
Overall, analysts expect a solid quarterly performance from Walmart, fueled in part by strong sales of summer clothes and other seasonal goods in May, when shoppers flocked to retailers after a wet and cold April. Visits to Walmart stores likely accelerated in the period compared with previous quarters, according to data from Consumer Edge Research. Walmart’s online division should also improve on last quarter’s 33 percent growth, as the company has forecast a 40 percent gain for the full year.
“We think Walmart can deliver second-quarter results that keep the stock grinding higher,” Ben Bienvenu, an analyst at Stephens Inc., said in a note.
Walmart’s rival  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT), which reports quarterly results Aug. 22, will also feel pressure to raise prices. But the Minneapolis-based retailer gets about one-third of its sales from store brands like Cat & Jack or labels that sell exclusively on its shelves, where it has more control over pricing than the typical manufacturer-retailer relationship.
“Target’s approach is a little bit different,” Cadent’s Harris said. “Their emphasis is on their owned brands.”
Tariff Effect
The wild card in all this is the impact of potential Chinese tariffs, which were a hot topic last week as Walmart executives and store managers met in Denver to discuss holiday planning. Walmart and other retailers are making sure holiday orders arrive from China before additional levies are incurred, which led to a record number of cargo containers hitting U.S. ports in June, according to the National Retail Federation’s Global Port Tracker.
Although the first wave of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods doesn’t impact many consumer products, an additional list of proposed tariffs on $200 billion of imports is undergoing a public comment period that ends Aug. 30.
“In the short term, tariffs will be a positive for retailers who can purchase ahead of any price increases,” Harris said. “But it bodes poorly if tariffs stick.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shareholder, Fidelity Investments, cut its stake in the electric automaker by 21 percent during the second quarter, before Chief Executive Elon Musk announced his plan to take the company private earlier this month.
FMR LLC, the Boston-based manager of the Fidelity funds, sold 3 million shares, or a fifth of its stake, and held under 11.2 million shares by June 30, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late on Friday.
The company remains one of Tesla's top ten shareholders, with shares worth about $4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data on Monday.
A Fidelity spokeswoman and a representative of Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It was not clear why Fidelity reduced its holdings or whether it would be interested in supporting a move by the company to go private.
Also during the second quarter, fund managers at the company disclosed a new, near-$30 million stake in a type of bond issued by Tesla that can convert to stock under certain conditions in the future.
Fidelity's move to cut its stake in Tesla occurred before the surprise move by Musk to seek investors' help to take the company private.
Musk now faces investor lawsuits claiming securities fraud and a reported SEC probe after sending a tweet on August 7 that there was ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. Since then, no investors publicly confirmed their involvement. 
Quarterly disclosures of fund managers' stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. SEC, are one of the few public ways of tracking which companies many investors are buying and selling.

But the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.

97,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 09:26AM ET</span>",UBS: Turkey could be heading into a balance-of-payments crisis,"The  Turkish lira ticked up 6% Tuesday morning after  the country's central bank increased the liquidity of Turkish banks by loosening their reserve requirements.
But the crisis is far from over.
The lira is down 43% against the US dollar this year. Unless President Tayyip Erdogan makes a major U-turn by ordering an increase in central bank interest rates, the lira — and Turkey's economy — is going nowhere fast.
That U-turn seems unlikely, analysts say, because of  Erdogan's apparently irrational belief that high interest rates are ""evil.""
""A number of policy errors have led to Turkey's current predicament,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts Alexander Redman and Arun Sai told clients recently.
""The economy stands on the brink of a debt and currency crisis with only political will standing between resolution and a precipice, in our view. Turkish policy makers are left with unpalatable options including a sizeable emergency rate hike, the introduction of capital controls, a heavily conditional IMF bailout, or attempting to muddle through the uncertainty.""
They continued: ""As preventable crises go, Turkey's current episode is tough to eclipse."" 
It's ""Worse than Argentina,"" according to Exotix Capital analysts Stuart Culverhouse and Hasnain Malik, referring to  the hyperinflation that crippled that country earlier this year. Argentina is suffering from high inflation and a big budget deficit, brought on in part by the US dollar's relative strength against the weak peso. The Argentinian central bank has hiked rates to fight its crisis, all the way up to 45%.
But ""Turkey’s currency crisis seems to be more pronounced than Argentina’s was in April 2018 and has produced the sharpest fall in EM currencies since Donald Trump was elected US President in November 2016,"" Culverhouse and Malik say.
It's also worse than the recession in Turkey started by the 2001 deficit payments crisis, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merril Lynch's Ferhan Salman. ""Gross external debt has reached US$466bn (Mar-2018, about 60% of GDP), surpassing the levels of the 2001 financial crisis. External debt rollover needs in the next 12 months are also high (US$180bn - about 22% of GDP),"" he told clients. 
""We have been here before,"" says Russ Mould of AJ Bell, in terms of the 2001 crisis.
The immediate trigger for the collapse of the lira was US economic sanctions, mainly on steel and aluminum, imposed by President Donald Trump. But Turkey's currency — and thus its economy — was especially vulnerable because  Erdogan has strongly held beliefs about the function of his central bank that most economists regard as irrational.
In basic terms, if you have high inflation then the central bank should increase interest rates to drive prices down again.
In Turkey, inflation is currently running at 16%. (By contrast, it's about 2% in the UK and the US.) The Turkish central bank held its interest rates at 17.75% in July.
That spread between the two rates — about 2% — will not be enough to tempt Turks into depositing their cash in Turkish banks, analysts believe. Rather, Turkey needs to hike rates by 5 or 10 percentage points, to something like 25%, in order to create a ""real"" interest rate on cash above the rate of inflation.
Increased cash deposits would shore up the Turkish financial system, reduce the amount of cash in circulation, and bring inflation down. It would also increase the value of the lira, and stabilize Turkey's economy. The downside, of course, is that a reduction of cash in circulation would also trigger an increase in unemployment, something that Erdogan is no doubt keen to avoid.
So analysts are peering back through the archives to gauge the likelihood of Erdogan being persuaded to change his mind. Credit Suisse's Redmun and Sai found two quotes from Erdogan published in mid-May, in which the president expressed unorthodox views about economics.
At a meeting in Chatham House, London, Erdogan told attendees to ""please learn"" that low interest rates deliver low inflation,  according to the Financial Times.
Also in May,  Erdogan spoke to reporters at Bloomberg. He said:
“When the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable? They’ll hold the president accountable. Since they’ll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who’s influential on monetary policies.""
He also confirmed that he was going to have a role setting interest rates himself, confirming his central bank's monetary independence was over.
And he told Bloomberg staff at a lunch that he was resolutely opposed to raising rates.
“How can you invest in a country when the guy doesn’t believe in basic interest rate theory?” The FT reported one attendee as saying. “Turkey almost looks uninvestible.”
Then in June,  Erdogan made an infamous election speech to business leaders in Ankara, in which he said interest rates were ""evil"" (emphasis ours):
""If my people say continue on this path in the elections, I say I will emerge with victory in the fight against this curse of interest rates ... Because my belief is: interest rates are the mother and father of all evil.""
Tilmann Kolb of UBS wrote in a note four days ago that Turkey could be headed into ""a full-fledged balance-of-payments crisis."" In plain English, that would mean Turkey's currency becomes so devalued it becomes unable to pay its debts or buy services from abroad — technical bankruptcy for the entire country.
""At this point, we are not sure if the policymakers have a detailed plan for coordination or disagree on the measures, or if communication and implementation are being blocked at the highest level,"" Kolb wrote. ""Any of these is worrying given the urgent need to act, in our view.""
He added: ""The crisis looks likely to deepen at this point, and so does a further depreciation of the lira. We think the risks are skewed toward a further dollarization of the Turkish economy, and possibly a full-fledged balance-of-payments crisis, the introduction of capital controls, or an involvement of the IMF. While the window for a rebound of the lira has not fully closed, we continue to advise investors to reduce exposure to the currency."""

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The risk of a no-deal Brexit has been increasing and the European Union commission needs to change its attitude if a deal is to be reached, British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Tuesday.
""Everyone needs to prepare for the possibility of a chaotic no-deal Brexit,"" Hunt told reporters in Helsinki.
With less than eight months until Britain quits the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has stepped up planning for the possibility of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement. 
""I think the risk of a no Brexit deal has been increasing recently ... there is absolutely no guarantee that we will get a deal,"" Hunt said after a meeting with his Finnish counterpart Timo Soini.
""But it's not what anyone wants and I hope very much that we'll find a way to avoid that ... the British government has been doing everything it can to avoid that outcome,"" he said.
""We do need to see a change in approach by the European Commission.""
Both London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the Oct. 18 EU Council, but diplomats think that target date is too optimistic. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected key elements of British Prime Minister Theresa May's new trade proposals last month.
Economists say a failure to agree the terms of the divorce would cause serious harm to the world's No.5 economy as trade with the EU, Britain's largest market, would become subject to tariffs.

Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for the economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU. Meanwhile, some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.

99,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 08:59AM ET</span>",Powell to Keep Hiking as U.S. Growth Trumps Turkish Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t count on a Powell Pause.
That’s the message seasoned watchers of the Federal Reserve have for any investors hoping that turmoil in Turkey and the wider emerging-market selloff would stay the hand of Chairman Jerome Powell from raising interest rates.
While international developments did cause the U.S. central bank to hold back in 2015 and 2016, there are big differences between now and then. U.S. unemployment was higher and underlying inflation was lower. But perhaps more importantly, the nexus of the turbulence was China, whose economy is the world’s second largest and more than 10 times the size of Turkey’s.
“The broad conclusion from history is that the U.S. can generally ignore what happens in emerging markets, unless it involves China,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclaysand a former section head at the Fed Board in Washington.
Investors agree with that assessment. Despite fears of Turkish contagion, odds of a Fed hike in September were unchanged from a week ago at 90 percent, according to pricing in federal funds futures, with the probability of another move in December seen at roughly 55 percent.
Fed officials will “be concerned, they’ll be worried and they’ll be monitoring, but they’re not going to take any action on U.S. monetary policy until they expect that crisis to spill over in some substantive way into the U.S.,” said Robert Martin, U.S. economist at UBS Group AG who formerly ran an international capital markets section at the Fed.
So far, the fallout has been limited. While U.S. stock markets have wobbled in recent days in response to the turbulence in Turkey, they’re still near all-time highs. The emerging-market jitters have pushed up the dollar, which on the margin could crimp U.S. economic growth by making it more expensive for companies to export. But that potential drag has been partly offset by a fall in long-term interest rates.
“If you look at how Turkey is affecting U.S. financial conditions, at the moment you barely see it,” said Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro and a former Fed Board economist.
The U.S. economy looks poised to rack up another quarter of solid growth after expanding at its fastest pace since 2014 in the April-June period. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News earlier this month raised their forecast for third quarter growth to 3 percent, from 2.8 percent in July. Gross domestic product climbed at a 4.1 percent pace in the second quarter.
A National Federation of Independent Business survey released Tuesday showed a gauge of optimism among U.S. small-business owners increased to the second highest on record as companies benefited from tax cuts and robust consumer demand.
Fed officials, including Powell, have long maintained that the best way they can help global financial stability is by keeping U.S. growth on track, while communicating clearly about where policy is heading to avoid surprises.
“Maintaining the U.S. economy on a sustainable trajectory, including through transparent monetary policy implementation and effective and efficient regulation, is our best means of contributing to prosperity both at home and in the broader global community,” New York Fed Executive Vice President Simon Potter told an audience in Manila on Aug. 4.
Policy makers stress communication because they want to avoid a repeat of the 2013 taper tantrum, when remarks by then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke about the possibility of beginning to taper the central bank’s asset purchase program caught investors off guard and gave emerging markets a spasm.
Yuan Devaluation
That’s not to say Fed policy is immune to developments abroad. In 2015, the central bank put off a long-expected September rate increase after a surprise currency devaluation by China the month before sent financial markets worldwide into a tizzy. The same thing happened in 2016, as the Fed delayed rate hikes amid severe emerging-market volatility sparked by concerns the Chinese economy was slowing sharply.
Powell argued in May that emerging markets were in a good position to manage the ongoing normalization of U.S. monetary policy. They “have made considerable progress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s,” he said in a May 8 speech in Zurich.
Dollar Liquidity
But that progress hasn’t been uniform, leaving some of them -- like Turkey -- exposed as the U.S. central bank withdraws liquidity from the world financial system by incrementally shrinking its balance sheet and gradually raising interest rates.
“Argentina, Colombia, South Africa and Mexico stand out as fragile” as well because of their large current-account deficits, sizable external debt and high inflation, Tom Orlik, chief economist for Bloomberg Economics, wrote on Monday.
Argentina on Monday acted to stabilize its tumbling currency, jacking up its already highest-in-the-world policy interest rate by 5 percentage points to 45 percent.
Adding to the stresses is President Donald Trump’s belligerent stance on trade.
“The U.S. is not playing its usual role to try to tamp down anxiety and fears,” said David Hensley, director of global economics for JPMorgan Chase & Co in New York. “If anything, the U.S. has been throwing fuel on the fire.”
Turkish markets, already in a tailspin over President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s economic policies, tumbled further after Trump’s Aug. 10 announcement that the U.S. is doubling steel and aluminum tariffs on shipments from the country.
The fire, though, will have to get a lot hotter to get the Fed to change course. “We’re far from that,” said HSBC Securities Inc. chief U.S. economist Kevin Logan. “There would have to be a lot more contagion.”

But Lavrov, speaking on a visit to the Turkish capital on Tuesday, did not make any commitments for Russia to drop the dollar in trade with Turkey, whose lira currency plummeted to a record low against the dollar this week.
""I'm confident that the grave abuse of the role of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency will result over time in the weakening and demise of its role,"" said Lavrov, who was speaking at a news conference with his Turkish counterpart.
""The use of national currencies for mutual trade has for several years been one of the tasks that the presidents of Russia and Turkey had set,"" said Lavrov.
""Identical processes have been happening in our relations with Iran. Not only with Turkey and Iran, we're also arranging and already implementing payments in national currencies with the People's Republic of China,"" Lavrov said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday Turkey will boycott electronic products from the United States, retaliating in a dispute with Washington that has helped drive the lira to record lows.
The lira has lost more than 40 percent this year and crashed to an all-time low of 7.24 to the dollar early on Monday, hit by worries over Erdogan's calls for lower interest rates and worsening ties with the United States.
The weakness of the Turkish currency has rippled through global markets. Its drop of as much as 18 percent on Friday hit U.S. and European stocks as investors fretted about banks' exposure to Turkey.
On Tuesday the lira recovered some ground, trading at 6.53 to the dollar at 0918 GMT, up around five percent on the day. 
It was supported by news of a planned conference call in which the finance minister will seek to reassure investors concerned by Erdogan's control of the economy and his resistance to interest rate hikes to tackle double-digit inflation .
Erdogan says Turkey is the target of an economic war, and has made repeated calls for Turks to sell their dollars and euros to shore up the national currency.
""Together with our people, we will stand decisively against the dollar, forex prices, inflation and interest rates. We will protect our economic independence by being tight-knit together,"" he told members of his AK Party in a speech.
""We will impose a boycott on U.S. electronic products. If they have iPhones, there is Samsung (KS:005930) on the other side, and we have our own Vestel here,"" he said, referring to the Turkish electronics company, whose shares rose five percent.
The United States has imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers over the trial on terrorism charges of a U.S. evangelical pastor in Turkey, and last week Washington raised tariffs on Turkish metal exports. 
Erdogan said his government would offer further incentives to companies planning to invest in Turkey and said firms should not be put off by economic uncertainty.
""If we postpone our investments, if we convert our currency to foreign exchange because there's danger, then we will have given into the enemy,"" he said.
U.S. DISPUTE
Although the lira enjoyed a small respite on Tuesday, investors say measures taken by the Central Bank on Monday to ensure liquidity fail to address the root cause of lira weakness. 
""What you want to see is tight monetary policy, a tight fiscal policy and a recognition that there might be some short-term economic pain -- but without it there's just no credibility of promises to restabilise things,"" said Craig Botham, Emerging Markets Economist at  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
Dollar-denominated bonds issued by selected Turkish banks continued to fall on Tuesday, although sovereign bonds steadied.
Relations between NATO allies Turkey and the United States are at a low point, hurt by a series of issues from diverging interests in Syria, Ankara's plan to buy Russian defense systems and the detention of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson.
The White House on Monday said U.S. national security adviser John Bolton met Turkey's ambassador to the United States to discuss the detention of Brunson. The pastor's Turkish lawyer launched a fresh appeal on Tuesday for his release. 
Traders said news that Finance Minister Berat Albayrak will hold a conference call with up to 1,000 investors to discuss the economy might also have helped support the currency.
""I think the investor call Albayrak has scheduled has helped lira firm,"" said TEB Investment strategist Isik Okte. ""I believe the new and important topics will be discussed in this call, otherwise there would not be such an attempt.""
""The concerns are ongoing in the market but it is possible to mention a limited optimism for the first time in a while,"" a foreign exchange trader said.
Turkey's business lobbies called on Tuesday for a tighter monetary policy to stabilize the lira, and for diplomacy to solve U.S.-Turkish disputes.
Following Monday's meeting between Bolton and Turkish ambassador Serdar Kilic, U.S. officials have given no indication that the United States has been prepared to give ground in the standoff between the two countries' leaders.
Ankara has repeatedly said the Brunson case was up to the courts and a Turkish judge moved Brunson from jail to house arrest in July. Infuriated by the move, which Washington said was insufficient, Trump sanctioned two Turkish ministers and doubled tariffs on metal imports, adding to lira's slide.

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was monitoring the financial situation in Turkey ""very closely"".

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday condemned measures targeting it in a new U.S. defense act, saying it exaggerated antagonism and that Beijing would take a close look at aspects that beef up the role of a U.S. panel that reviews foreign investment proposals.
China's complaints about the act come as the world's two biggest economies engage in an increasingly bitter fight over trade, levying tariffs on each others' products.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a $716-billion defense policy act on Monday that authorizes military spending and waters down controls on U.S. government contracts with China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd .
The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, strengthens the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews proposals to determine if they threaten national security. That measure was seen as targeting China.
China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the inclusion of CFIUS in the act and would ""comprehensively assess the contents"", paying close attention to the impact on Chinese firms.
""The U.S. side should objectively and fairly treat Chinese investors, and avoid CFIUS becoming an obstacle to investment cooperation between Chinese and U.S. firms,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Chinese and U.S. companies seek greater cooperation on investment, it added, urging the two countries' governments to heed the voices of their companies, and provide a good environment and stable expectations.
Monday's legislation also calls ""long-term strategic competition with China"" a top priority for the United States, which should improve the defense capabilities of self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as a wayward province.
In a separate statement, China's foreign ministry said the United States passed the act despite China's strong objections and it was dissatisfied with the ""negative content related to China"".
China urges the United States to abandon Cold War thinking and correctly and objectively view relations, and not implement the act's negative clauses about China, so as to avoid harming cooperation, the ministry added.
China's Defense Ministry also weighed in, saying the act ""exaggerated Sino-U.S. antagonism"", damaged trust between the two militaries and involved the most important and sensitive issue in bilateral ties, namely Taiwan.
""We will never let any person, at any time or in any form split Taiwan off from China,"" it added.
In Taipei, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry thanked the United States for its consistent support.
Taiwan would ""continue to actively coordinate with the U.S. government to stably deepen the security partnership between Taiwan and the United States on a mutually beneficial basis"", Taiwan's foreign ministry said.
The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is the island's strongest ally and sole foreign arms supplier.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is visiting the United States this month, stopping off first in Los Angeles and then in Houston on her way to and from Paraguay and Belize. 

China has complained to Washington about the visits.

1. Turkish Lira Roars Out Of Rout
The Turkish lira rallied, as the currency found its footing following two days of intense selling after the country's central bank pledged to provide liquidity in response to a meltdown which has unsettled global markets.
Investors were also comforted by news that Finance Minister Berat Albayrak would hold a conference call with investors from the U.S., Europe and the Middle East on Thursday, his first since assuming the post almost two months ago.
The lira rose by as much as 8% to 6.4172 against the dollar, before pulling back slightly to 6.5440, still up 5% for the day (USD/TRY).
The struggling currency sank to an all-time low of 7.1289 on Monday amid growing concern over a deepening diplomatic rift with the United States over Ankara's detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in 2016.
Turkish authorities accuse Brunson of supporting a failed coup attempt earlier that year.
2. Global Stocks Rise As Turkish Crises Eases
In equities, global stocks were higher, as investors cautiously returned to risk markets amid a stabilization in Turkey's currency crisis.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures looked set to open higher.
The blue-chip Dow futures indicated a gain of 80 points, or around 0.3%, by 5:39AM ET, the S&P 500 futures tacked on 10 points, or around 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to a rise of 37 points, or roughly 0.5%.
Meanwhile, in Europe, the region's major bourses bounced back after two days of heavy selling as investors' anxieties over contagion from a Turkish currency crisis eased.
Earlier, Asian shares closed mixed, as some regional markets bounced back one day after declining over jitters related to economic uncertainty in Turkey.
Greater China markets declined, lagging their regional peers, as Chinese economic data highlighted concern surrounding a global trade war.
3.  Home Depot  Reports Earnings
As earnings season draws to a close, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is one of the last notable names slated to report fiscal first-quarter results before U.S. markets open.
The home improvement retailer reported earnings of $3.05 per share on revenue of $30.46 billion. That compared with EPS of $2.84 and revenue of $30.0 billion polled by analysts.
Comparable-store sales jumped 8.0% during the quarter, above expectations of 6.5%.
Investors will be closely watching the results for comments on the health of the U.S. housing markets and a view of general consumer confidence in the economy.
Home Depot kicks off a busy week of retail earnings; results from Macy's (NYSE:M) are on the agenda for Wednesday; while Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer, is due to report results on Thursday.



4. Dollar Holds Near 13-Month Peak
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar was a touch firmer, holding near its best level since June 2017.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% to 96.23, after climbing to a 13-month high of 96.39 on Monday.
The yen was lower against the dollar, with USD/JPY rising to 111.00, off a 1-1/2-month low of 110.10 touched on Monday.
The euro dipped to 1.1395 against the dollar, within sight of a 13-month low of 1.1365 touched on Monday.
Elsewhere in foreign exchange markets, most emerging market currencies enjoyed a bounce, with South Africa’s rand (USD/ZAR) and Russia’s ruble (USD/RUB) trading higher in sympathy with the Turkish Lira.
5. Bitcoin Dips Below $6,000 Amid Cryptocurrency Sell-Off
Cryptocurrencies plunged, with Bitcoin tumbling below $6,000 for the first time since June.
The world's most valuable digital currency was last down around 7%, or $450, at $6,025.70 (BTC/USD) on the Bitfinex exchange, after falling to as low as $5,858.60, a level last seen on June 29.
Rival tokens also fell.
Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was down 20% at $265.58, its worst level since September 2017.
Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token was trading at $0.26204, down roughly 16% for the day, while Litecoin was down 17% at $51.57.
The latest rout among digital coins came amid disappointment over the postponement of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by VanEck and Solid X earlier this month.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba on Monday began a rare public discussion to overhaul its Cold War-era constitution, a process the government is calling participatory democracy at its best and opponents are branding a fraud.
Cuba's National Assembly approved a draft of changes to the 1976 constitution last month, including amendments that would pave the way for recognition of private small businesses and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.
The Communist Party-proposed overhaul will be discussed in 35,000 workplaces and community meetings across the Caribbean island scheduled to stretch into November. Once the debate is concluded, the legislature will approve a new draft and submit it to a nationwide vote in February.
While state media have praised the participatory and democratic nature of the consultations, dissidents say the meetings will simply rubberstamp the changes proposed by party leadership. 
With much fanfare in the state-run media, more than a million copies of the proposals have been distributed and they are also available online.
At a state-run health clinic in the capital Havana, a union leader presented the proposed changes point by point to some 50 employees. While a few people asked for clarifications on individual amendments, no one raised any challenges to them.
""We Cubans are going to ratify everything that has already been done, even if there are alternative proposals,"" said Alina Morada, head of nursing for the municipality of Central Havana, where the meeting took place.
The draft omits a clause in the current constitution that enshrines the aim of building a ""communist society"" in Cuba. However, it does not change the ""irrevocability"" of the one-party system and socialist economy. 
Alternative systems of government have been dubbed counter-revolutionary since the late Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution.
But the proposals enshrine a gradual social and economic opening underway since the fall of Cuba's former benefactor, the Soviet Union.
While there are no reliable opinion polls in Cuba, anecdotal evidence indicates many Cubans accept the gist of the changes.
“I think the same-sex marriage issue is the most polemical of the proposals because it never has been discussed here,” said Isabel Palacios, a nurse at the Havana clinic.
“But one does what one wants with their life and that is not a bad thing because we are all human beings.” 
However, Hildebrando Chaviano, a retired lawyer and dissident journalist, said many Cubans were afraid of repression if they spoke out publicly. 
Chaviano garnered 189 votes for a ward delegate position in Havana in 2015 but was blocked by security agents from attending a nomination meeting two years later.

“Who were these nearly 200 people who voted for me? They are not part of my circle of activists. They feared speaking publicly because of repression but when there was a secret ballot they spoke,” he said.

108,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 05:36PM ET</span>","U.S. economy seen strong in 2018, to slow in 2019: CBO","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth will probably accelerate this year before slowing in 2019 to well below the Trump administration's 3 percent target as a fiscal stimulus fades, congressional researchers projected on Monday.
In an updated economic outlook, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that inflation adjusted or real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 3.1 percent this year, exceeding 2.2 percent growth in 2017 due to lower income taxes, increased government spending and private investment.
The government slashed corporate and personal income taxes in January in a $1.5 trillion package and the U.S. Congress passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill in March. 
This has buoyed consumer and business spending as well as government outlays, which combined with accelerated soybean exports to lift the economy to a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter from a 2.2 percent pace in the January-March period. The April-June growth rate was the highest in nearly four years. 
But the CBO said it expected growth to slow in the second half as jolts to consumer spending and agricultural exports either fade or reverse. For instance, some second-quarter soybean exports were aimed at beating Chinese tariffs that took effect in July and cut future shipments. 
""In 2019, the pace of GDP growth slows to 2.4 percent in the agency's forecast, as growth in business investment and government purchases slows,"" CBO director Keith Hall said in a statement.
Republicans have said the tax cuts, which increased the nation's debt, would pay for themselves through strong economic growth. The Trump administration has said the economy can sustain 3.0 percent growth over the long term, an assertion many economists have disputed.
The CBO also cautioned that trade tensions could make a bigger dent on GDP growth than anticipated. An escalating U.S.-China trade war could result in tariffs on all goods traded between the world's two largest economies.
Washington also has traded tariffs with the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
""When CBO completed this economic forecast in early July, the agency estimated that the macroeconomic consequences of the U.S. tariffs and foreign retaliatory tariffs that had been implemented at that time would be small,"" said Hall.
Tariffs then ""affected goods that accounted for less than 1.5 percent of the total value of U.S. trade. However, trade policy has already changed since early July and may continue to evolve, so the effects of new tariffs may become more substantial and have a larger effect on the economy than CBO accounted for in its current projections.""

From 2023 to 2028, the CBO forecast the economy growing by about 1.7 percent each year.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 05:29PM ET</span>",Attention retirement savers: college 529 plans aren't just for kids,"(This version of the August 9 story corrects name in paragraph 19 to Jamie Hopkins from Jeremy Hopkins)
By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - As a financial planner, Ray Loewe watched clients who had retired struggle with too much leisure time. 
“Playing golf six days a week gets boring,” Loewe said.
He vowed that when he retired he and his wife would travel and take college classes. To put his plan into action, Loewe took advantage of a savings tool typically used by parents and grandparents to stash money away for college for children - the 529 college savings plan. He opened one for himself.
When he retired from his planning business in his 60s, Loewe and his wife, Sandy, studied ecology and leather back turtles through a New Jersey community college course taught completely on the ground in Costa Rica. They tapped $25,000 in 529 savings to pay the bill. 
Loewe, whose financial planning business in New Jersey focused on paying for college, was ahead of his time. A decade later, more financial planners are directing retirement-focused clients into 529 plans, experts say.
The number is still small, however. Only 2 percent of 529 plans list people over 21 as beneficiaries, according to Paul Curley, director of college saving research at Strategic Insight.
If you are interested in using a 529 for your retirement consider the following:
START EARLY
A 529 college savings plan offers powerful advantages over savings or brokerage accounts because contributions grow tax-free year after year. Then, when you tap a 529 to pay for a college or technical education, your withdrawals are not taxed. You may also get a state tax deduction each year for your contribution. 
Harness the power of compounding as early as possible by opening a 529 for yourself in your 40s or 50s, not in your 60s.
You may also be able to tap into savings intended for other family members. After putting her career on hold while raising five children and sending them to college with 529 savings, Laurie Alter, 60, plans go to law school next year. She will use leftover 529 money to help pay the bill.
“My father was a lawyer and a judge and I loved listening to him talk about the law,” said Alter, of Flagler Beach, Florida. 
Alter’s financial planner helped her switch the beneficiary from her son's 529 plan to her own name. A 529 must be in a student’s name when he or she goes to college or a technical college.
KNOW THE RULES
It is not necessary to get a degree, but students must enroll in classes for credit or be part of a technical certificate program at eligible educational institutions to use 529 funds without penalty.
You can check colleges at https://fafsa.ed.gov/FAFSA/app/schoolSearch
Money taken from a 529 plan for an unqualified expense will be taxed, as well as hit with a 10 percent penalty. Airfare, for instance, is typically not covered. And a student must be enrolled at least half time to cover housing, said Deborah Goodkin, managing director of NEST 529 College Savings Plans. 
RETIREMENT PLANNING
A 529 is also a smart retirement planning tool that would-be students can use to minimize taxes and make retirement savings last, said Jamie Hopkins, an American College of Financial Services professor. 
If a retiree pulls money from a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) to pay for a college course, that money will be taxed. Possible results: A greater portion of a person’s Social Security could end up being taxed and Medicare premiums could rise for high-income retirees. 
A Roth IRA could be used to pay for retirement college courses without being taxed, but Hopkins suggested reserving a Roth for other expenses. His advice: While working, contribute the maximum possible to a Roth IRA and a healt06:00:00h savings account before starting a 529 for yourself.
Loewe, aware of the Internal Revenue Service's 529 requirements, designed the Costa Rica course himself to include travel and convinced Salem Community College in New Jersey to offer it for four credits.
Still, Loewe's advice is to find existing college courses because it is tough to get a college to start a class for retirees.

110,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",CBO Cuts U.S. Growth Forecast Amid Warnings on Trade Spats,"(Bloomberg) -- The Congressional Budget Office slightly lowered its forecast for U.S. economic growth for this year, and warned of increasing uncertainty from American plans to widen tariffs.
The U.S. economy is projected to expand 3.1 percent this year, down from a previous forecast in April of 3.3 percent, the non-partisan group said in a report on Monday. The expansion will ease to 2.4 percent in 2019, unchanged from April’s projection, on slowing growth in business investment and government purchases, the CBO said.
“Despite the volatility in the rate of GDP growth in the first and second quarters of the year, CBO expects the momentum underlying that growth to largely continue into the second half of the year before slowing gradually in subsequent years,” the group said.
In its last long-term economic outlook in April, the CBO said the U.S. budget deficit is on track to top $1 trillion by 2020 from $804 billion this fiscal year and $981 billion the next.
The Trump administration’s tax cuts and roughly $300 billion in spending increases are deepening the budget deficit. The gap widened by more than 20 percent to $684 billion in the first 10 months of the fiscal year, as revenue from corporate receipts dropped.
The Trump administration says faster economic growth resulting from the tax cuts will increase federal revenue over time. The second-quarter economic expansion of 4.1 percent was the strongest since 2014, up from a 2.2 percent level in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Real GDP growth was 2.6 percent last year.
Excess demand is expected to push up inflation and lead to higher interest rates, slowing economic growth to an average of 1.6 percent between 2020 and 2022, according to the CBO.
Trade tensions are also clouding the economic outlook. The International Monetary Fund has warned that President Donald Trump’s tariff campaign, and the retaliation from America’s trading partners, could undermine the global trading system.
Against China alone, the U.S. will have imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of imports as of Aug. 23, sparking retaliation, with another $200 billion to follow as early as next month. The actions are on top of import tariffs imposed earlier this year on steel and aluminum, washing machines and solar panels.
“Recently implemented changes to trade policies, and proposals calling for further changes, compound the uncertainty surrounding the current economic outlook,” CBO said.
(Updates with longer-term average growth forecast in seventh paragraph.)"
111,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 03:06PM ET</span>",U.S. consumers less upbeat on stocks in July: N.Y. Fed survey,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans were less upbeat about Wall Street even as the U.S. unemployment rate hovered near an 18-year low and the economy recorded its fastest growth pace in four years in the second quarter, a New York Federal Reserve survey released on Monday showed.
The regional Fed's barometer on consumers' perceived chances of U.S. stock prices increasing in 12 months fell to 40.3 percent in July, which is the lowest level since October 2016 when it was 37.64 percent.
Their view on stocks softened despite the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) racking up 3.6 percent in total return last month on strong company earnings and solid economic data.
In general, U.S. consumers were less optimistic about household finances a year from now.
""One-year-ahead expectations of changes in the household's financial situation deteriorated slightly and are now comparable to the values in July 2017,"" the N.Y. Fed wrote on the latest survey results.
While consumers believed household income would grow, their expectations for more family spending fell to 3.2 percent in July. They expected home prices, gasoline and medical costs to soften, while they reckoned food prices would rise.
It is unclear what caused consumers to turn less confident about their finances. 
They maintained a solid view on the jobs market, although they downgraded the prospects for paycheck growth to 2.4 percent from 2.7 percent.
The survey's gauge on expectations for taxes grew for a fifth straight month to 2.2 percent since it hit a series low of 1.5 percent in February.
Last December, Washington enacted the biggest rewrite of the federal tax code in 30 years which included a massive tax cut.
The tax overhaul has resulted in a surging federal debt load to finance the government's budget gap.
Consumer expectations for government debt growth increased to 6.9 percent in July from 6.6 percent in June and compared with 4.9 percent from a year ago. 

The New York Fed survey is done by a third party that taps a rotating panel of about 1,200 household heads.

112,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Argentina Hikes Rate 500 Basis Points as Turkey Contagion Bites,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina took emergency steps to stabilize its currency in the wake of an emerging-market rout caused by Turkey’s crisis, jacking up its key interest rate by 5 percentage points to the highest in the world and outlining a plan to eliminate short-term notes.
Policy makers set the rate for seven-day notes at a record 45 percent and pledged to keep it at that level at least until October. The central bank will phase out 1 billion pesos ($33.2 billion) of short-term notes by December, and said it would sell $500 million at an auction Tuesday to relieve pressure on the peso.
Argentina’s dramatic moves are in contrast to what’s happening in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has lost the confidence of investors by refusing to raise interest rates in the wake of the crisis. While Argentina suffers from some of the same economic problems -- fast inflation and sizable current-account and budget deficits -- the Latin American country’s policy makers are reacting with orthodox policies blessed by advisers by the International Monetary Fund.
“The central bank is showing determination to prevent an overshooting of the the currency and inflation,” said Alberto Ramos, the head of Latin America research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). “An external shock has hit the currency and they’re reacting in the classic way -- what you need to do is hike rates and hope to be able to stabilize the currency with that.”
The peso recovered from its lows of the day after the rate announcement. It was down 2.4 percent to 29.98 per dollar on Monday afternoon after falling as much as 3.6 percent. It was the fourth surprise rate hike by the central bank this year as officials try to combat a currency selloff spurred by concern inflation was out of control and the government wasn’t taking sufficient steps to shore up the economy. Argentina’s peso has tumbled 38 percent this year and the yield on its century bonds has soared past 10 percent.
But the most recent selloff in the peso --the more-than 6 percent drop of the past two days -- was spurred by concerns Turkey’s problems would infect other emerging markets. Argentina was seen as among the most vulnerable economies.
“They had to do something against contagion,” said Siobhan Morden, the head of Latin America fixed income at Nomura Holdings. “You have to do what you can to minimize financial contagion to the real economy.”
Monday’s announcement came the same day the IMF began its mission to Argentina after granting a $50 billion credit line to the South American nation in June. That was the same month former Finance minister Luis Caputo took over at the central bank from Federico Sturzenegger, who admitted he had lost credibility with investors as he resigned.
The Treasury Ministry separately announced Monday that it instructed the central bank to immediately cancel its daily dollar auction. It had been selling between $50 million and $100 million a day since June 21 to defend the peso. In its statement, the central bank reserved the right to sell its reserves as it sees fit.

113,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",China’s Slower Credit Growth Underscores Worries Over Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s broadest measure of new credit slowed, underlining concerns about the economy that have prompted authorities to start doing more to support growth.
Policy makers have pulled back on the pace of tightening and encouraged banks to lend more to counter a slowing economy and what looks like a potentially prolonged trade war with the U.S. Still, the chances of across-the-board stimulus has so far been ruled out, with policy makers continuing to keep a wary eye on the country’s debt pile.
New Measure
The central bank’s new measure of aggregate financing includes banks’ asset-backed securities and loan writeoffs. Using this new calculation, aggregate financing expanded by 1.39 trillion yuan in June, compared to a 1.18 trillion yuan expansion under the old measurement. The bank released historical data back to January 2017 for the new index.
“Policy makers are sticking to the direction of cracking down on shadow banking, and moving loans onto balance sheets,” said economist Xie Yaxuan at China Merchants Securities Co. However, “the steep fall in shadow banking we saw in June isn’t sustainable either. China’s still in a period of transmitting monetary easing to credit expansion.”
The shadow banking sector continued to shrink, falling by about 489 billion yuan in July after a 691.7 billion yuan drop in June.
Earlier easing measures are yet to have an effect on credit extension with July’s aggregate financing slowing on the continued contraction of shadow banking, said Xia Le, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA’s chief Asia economist in Hong Kong. “Aggregate financing may pick up a little toward the end of the year with the pace of shadow banking contraction slowing, but it won’t become a major source for credit supply again.”
Data for monthly bank loans released by the PBOC match figures issued earlier over the weekend by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","NRF lifts 2018 U.S. retail sales forecast on strong job market, tax reform","(Reuters) - The National Retail Federation on Monday raised its U.S. retail sales forecast for 2018, citing higher wages, gains in disposable income and a strong job market that have boosted consumer spending.
The trade body now expects retail sales for 2018, excluding automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants, to rise a minimum of 4.5 percent over 2017, compared with the 3.8 to 4.4 percentage growth it forecasted earlier this year.
""Higher wages, gains in disposable income, a strong job market and record-high household net worth have all set the stage for very robust growth in the nation's consumer-driven economy,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said in a statement https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/national-retail-federation-upgrades-2018-economic-forecast-says-tariffs-remain.
The industry group attributed its forecast raise to better-than-expected consumer spending in the first half of the year.
Unemployment in the United States is at its lowest in 50 years and industrial production is growing at some of the fastest rates for 20 years, helping U.S. consumer sentiment rise to multi-decade highs. 
Several companies, including the world's largest private employer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST), have used reforms in the U.S. tax code to award bonuses, benefits and hike wages for its employees.
""This is the best of times for retailers,"" said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics.
Last year, U.S. retail sales rose 3.9 percent $3.53 trillion, exceeding NRF's forecast for a 3.2 percent to 3.8 percent rise.
NRF, however, cautioned that the tariff war between United States and China could lead to a rise in prices of day-to-day goods and a rise in global oil prices could dampen consumer confidence during the rest of the year.

""Uncertainty surrounding the trade war and higher-than-expected inflation due in part to increased oil prices could make consumers cautious during the fall season,"" NRF's Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said.

115,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Turkey’s Market Collapse Deepens as Rules Are Eased for Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish policy makers made their first move to bolster the financial system and investor confidence amid a plunge in the lira. The currency, stocks and bonds extended their decline.
Promising to ""take all necessary measures,"" the central bank in Ankara lowered the amount commercial lenders must park at the regulator and eased rules that govern how they manage their lira and foreign-currency liquidity. While there was no mention of higher interest rates, it said all options were on the table.
“The central bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary,” according to the statement released early Monday.
It’s all part of an action plan announced by Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak late Sunday to respond to market tumult. He also rejected capital controls as an option to stem outflows of hard currency and vowed to crack down on those he said were spreading damaging rumors that deposits would be seized. Albayrak has visited Kuwait and was expected to visit other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council seeking investment, according to Kuwait’s Al Jarida newspaper.
The lira briefly trimmed losses after the central bank statement but weakened about 6.6 percent to 6.8819 to the dollar at 12:02 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield on two-year government bonds jumped 94 basis points to 25.74 percent, the highest level since the global financial crisis in 2008. The cost of insuring Turkish debt against default over five years surged more than 100 basis points to 537 basis points, while the benchmark stock index dropped as much as 4.6 percent.
U.S. Sanctions
The currency has lost about a quarter of its value against the dollar since the U.S. sanctioned two ministers in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in a spat over the continued detention of an American pastor in Turkey, pushing the economy toward a full-blown financial meltdown.
After Albayrak’s comments on Sunday, the banking regulator put restrictions on dollar-lira swaps in an attempt to make it harder for offshore investors to bet against the currency. The use of fringe tools is unlikely to be a “game changer” for the lira, Global Securities analysts including Research Director Sertan Kargin said in an emailed report.
“The latest liquidity measures could provide some buffer to cushion the lira against speculative moves,” the report said. But the move “remains insufficient to provide full protection for the lira in times of distress in the absence of an outright orthodox rate hike.”
Over the weekend, Erdogan lashed out at the U.S., threatening to find new alliances and new markets for the economy’s vast financing needs. He also took higher interest rates off the table and said Turkey wouldn’t accept an international bailout.

The central bank’s initiative was praised by Adnan Bali, chief executive officer of Isbank which is Turkey’s biggest listed bank by assets. He said the regulator’s move was well executed but needed to be supported by “technical decisions.”
Speaking to BloombergHT television from Istanbul, Bali said interest-rate increases can sometimes be necessary even though they hurt profits of commercial lenders such as his.
“On the subject of interest rates, whatever needs to be done as required by economy science should be done. You may not like it,” Bali said. “When necessary, all instruments should be used. That doesn’t mean you like it or want it.”
Talking about need for further monetary tightening is a touchy subject in Turkey because Erdogan has been outspoken in his opposition to higher interest rates, which he said only profit the ""interest-rate lobby."" He also argues that raising them results in faster inflation -- an argument that goes against the orthodox economic thinking.
Some investors have called for the benchmark rate of 17.75 to be jacked up by 1000 basis points.
“The big question is why they don’t hike properly,” said Guillaume Tresca, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in Paris.

Erdogan, who has described the lira's fall as the consequence of a plot rather than economic fundamentals, also said that spreading false news about the economy was treason and recent U.S. actions were a stab in the back against Ankara.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>","Disorder, deal or dead-end: How will Brexit play out?","By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, yet little is clear: There is, so far, no divorce deal, rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.
How will the Brexit finale play out?
Following are scenarios:
1) DISORDERLY BREXIT
If May is toppled, fails to reach a deal with the EU or finds her deal is rejected by parliament, the United Kingdom would be plunged into crisis.
Many opponents of Brexit predict this outcome, as do some supporters of a deeper break with the EU than that advocated by the prime minister.
- MAY FALLS 
May's botched snap election in 2017 lost her party its majority in parliament. Her minority government is now propped up by nine Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers from Northern Ireland.
Her own Conservative Party, which has grappled with schism over Europe for 30 years, is in open conflict and some lawmakers want a change of leader to be tougher in Brexit negotiations.
If May fell, the Conservative Party would have to select a new leader, a step that would delay already tight negotiations. A national election is possible, though not legally necessary.
Opinion polls, though, show the United Kingdom is divided in its support for Brexit and political parties: no party has a clear enough lead to confidently predict victory in an election.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist who voted 'out' in the 1975 referendum on membership of the European Community, has seen his poll ratings fall.
Possible successors to May include Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, interior minister Sajid Javid, environment minister Michael Gove or Dominic Raab, her new Brexit minister.
Other possible contenders include Tom Tugendhat, a former soldier and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, or lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg.
While the majority of Conservative lawmakers voted against Brexit, many have since switched to supporting Brexit and up to 80 of the 316 Conservative lawmakers now support a sharper split with the EU than May is proposing.
- NO DEAL 
Both London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the October 18 EU Council but diplomats think that target date is too optimistic.
Two documents need to be agreed: the Withdrawal Agreement Treaty (currently 129 pages long) and a political declaration on the framework for a future relationship. The political declaration could set out aims in general terms.
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected key elements of May's new trade proposals last month.
Agreeing a feasible arrangement for the Northern Irish border with the Republic of Ireland is one of several major hurdles and EU crises such as the 2015 Greek bailout shows how protracted negotiations can be.
If May cannot get a deal by October, an agreement could be reached at the December 13/14 EU Council.
- DEAL REJECTED
Any deal with the EU must be approved by the British parliament, which is due to go on Christmas holiday from Dec. 20 to Jan. 7. If British lawmakers reject a deal in late December or early January, Britain would face the prospect of leaving the EU three months later without an agreement.
The country would move from seamless trade with the rest of the European Union to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organisation for external states with no preferential deals.
Some business leaders have warned that adding just two minutes onto every lorry’s customs procedure passing through the southern English port of Dover would produce a 14-mile tailback on either side of the Channel after one day.
Supporters of Brexit say those fears are overblown and that the UK economy would thrive in the long term outside the EU.
If the deal was rejected, May would be likely to resign and neither her party, nor Labour, could be certain of winning an election.
The prime minister is betting that the fear of a so called ""no-deal"" scenario will push many Conservative and Labour lawmakers to support a deal. But the numbers are tight.
Parliament will have two votes: One on the Brexit deal and one on the Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill (WAIB).
Recent votes, such as the July vote knocking down an amendment to the Trade Bill, have shown May can command a majority of around six votes on major Brexit issues.
If the UK faced a no-deal scenario, other options include asking for an extension of the Brexit negotiation (by possibly withdrawing the Article 50 notification - something lawyers say is feasible) or parliament calling for a rerun of the referendum.
2) LAST MINUTE DEAL
British politicians are trying to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure that the EU does a deal that May can sell to her parliament.
In that case, little would be likely to change immediately when the United Kingdom leaves the EU on March 29, 2019, because a transition period lasts until 31 Dec. 2020.
May has said she will fight the next UK election, due in 2022, although she would likely face a challenge from her lawmakers before that.
A transition period would not necessarily guarantee a smooth exit; business leaders say they fear politicians have given little thought to the question of how the UK should operate in practice after it leaves the European Union.
3) BREXIT REVERSED
If the UK is thrust into chaos later this year, there is a chance Brexit could be stopped through a popular vote, according to an influential group of British politicians and journalists.
Opinion polls show that the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over Brexit, though some recent surveys have shown a swing towards support for staying in the EU.
A YouGov poll, conducted July 31-Aug. 7 and commissioned by the pro-referendum ""People's Vote"" campaign, found 45 percent of voters supported holding a new referendum whatever the outcome of talks with the EU, while 34 percent opposed it.
Calling a rerun of a referendum that was a Conservative brainchild would sink the premiership of any Conservative leader while Labour's Corbyn has so far indicated he does not support another referendum.
Supporters of another referendum think parliament could call such a vote if the government was in turmoil.
Brexit supporters have warned that a second referendum on membership of the EU would trigger a major constitutional crisis in Britain with uncertain consequences.
Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, warned opponents of Brexit to be careful what they wish for, saying a second referendum would result in another vote to leave and could wreck both the main parties.
""The Tories will be destroyed and maybe Labour too,"" he wrote.

ROME (Reuters) - Speculators will probably attack Italian financial markets this month but the country has the resources to defend itself, a senior and highly influential government official said in a newspaper interview on Sunday.
Giancarlo Giorgetti, undersecretary in the prime minister's office and a leading light in the far-right League party, said thin summer trading volumes helped fuel market assaults.
""I expect an attack (in August),"" Giorgetti told Libero.
""The markets are populated by hungry speculative funds that choose their prey and pounce ... In the summer the market volumes are small, you can lay the groundwork for aggressive initiatives against countries. Look at Turkey.""
Turkish markets slumped last week on growing concerns over the country's economy and political leadership.
Italian assets have also come under strain in recent weeks, with investors concerned that the governing coalition, made up of the League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, might tear up EU fiscal rules to pay for big-spending budget plans.
""If the (market) storm comes, we will open our umbrella. Italy is a big country and has the resources to react, thanks in part to its large amount of private savings,"" said Giorgetti, who is seen as a moderating force within the League.
Quoting a report by bankers' federation Fabi, Italian newspapers said on Sunday household savings in Italy totaled some 4.4 trillion euros against 2.2 trillion in 1998. 
""PLAN B""
In an interview with Il Foglio newspaper on Saturday, Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi, who is not a member of any political party, said the collapse of Turkey's lira currency showed how important it was for Italy to be a part of the euro.
""What is happening in Turkey should be carefully considered by those who continue to have doubts over whether a currency like the euro is a positive thing or not,"" he said.
Ahead of March national elections, the League called for Italy to exit the euro, but since forging its alliance with 5-Star has repeatedly denied any suggestion that it is planning to orchestrate Italy's exit from the single currency.
Underscoring deep divisions within the coalition on the issue, the League's chief economist Claudio Borghi, who is head of the lower house budget committee, said on Sunday that Moavero did not understand what he was talking about.
""We should worry about the euro, not celebrate its presumed stability,"" he told La Verita daily, warning that plans by the European Central Bank to finish its three-year-old stimulus program could prove highly damaging to Italy.
""Either a new (market) guarantee is put in place, or we need to prepare for a plan B,"" he said, in an apparent reference to Italy exiting the euro. ""We already have a (trade) surplus. The moment we have our own currency, we will have a super surplus.""
Mixed messages from various government ministers and coalition officials have confused investors and exacerbated market concerns over the coalition's economic plans. Giorgetti said there could be no room for communication errors.

""My colleagues must understand that the old ruling class in Italy and Europe want to abort this government ... the EU fears that if we succeed in Italy, other countries will imitate us.""

Russia's Foreign Ministry has said it is working on possible tit-for-tat retaliatory measures.
Asked about those possible Russian counter measures on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was too early to say what they might be. 

""There was an announcement of some new (U.S.) sanctions, there was information that a bundle (of sanctions) was being prepared or was already ready, but it hasn't yet been introduced and of course there's no clear information on what these restrictions will be,"" Peskov told reporters.

122,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 05:45AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Monday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 13:
1. Turkey's Lira Crisis Deepens 
The Turkish lira, which sank some 16% on Friday, plunged yet again to hit another record-low.
The currency fell by as much as 10% in overnight trade to hit a low of 7.1326 against the U.S. dollar, before briefly paring some losses to trade at 6.8657, still down 7.3% for the day (USD/TRY).
The lira found some support after Turkey’s central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for Turkish banks. The moves will free up 10 billion lira, $6 billion, and $3 billion equivalent of gold liquidity in the financial system, the bank said.
The central bank's statement came after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak - who is President Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law - said Turkey would start implementing an economic action plan to ease investor concerns, without giving details on what the steps would be.
The Turkish lira has lost almost 50% of its value this year, largely over worries about Erdogan's growing influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates in the face of high inflation and worsening ties with the United States.
2. Contagion Fears Hit Emerging Markets
Other emerging market currencies were also rattled, as Turkey's economic crisis escalated, and fears spread that it will spill over to the parts of the globe.
South Africa’s rand fell 3% against the dollar to 14.4691. It tumbled more than 10% in earlier trading to a two-year low of 15.4645.
Russia’s USD/RUB declined to its lowest level since mid-April 2016 against the dollar as falling oil prices and concerns over the impact of a fresh round of U.S. sanctions weighed.
India’s rupee hit a record low against the U.S. currency, with USD/INR climbing to 69.813.
The Mexican peso and Indonesian rupiah were also caught in the crossfire.



3. Dollar Climbs To 13-Month High
The U.S. dollar climbed to a 13-month high, as the falling lira fueled demand for safe havens.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was a shade higher at 96.30, after climbing to its highest since early June 27, 2017 at 96.39 earlier.
The yen and Swiss franc were also well-supported.
The euro, on the other hand, fell to its lowest levels in more than a year, with EUR/USD down 0.2% at 1.1388 after touching a low of 1.1365 earlier.
The pound was wallowing near its lowest levels since June 2017, with GBP/USD at 1.2760, pressured lower by the stronger dollar and fears over the growing prospect of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.
4. Global Stocks Rattled As Turkish Rout Spreads
Away from currencies, global stocks slipped to a one-month low, as a renewed rout in the Turkish lira weighed on appetite for riskier assets and drove demand for safe harbors.
Asian markets slid, with all sectors recording steep drops, as the fallout from Friday’s plunge in Turkish asset prices made its way across the Pacific.
Japan's Nikkei ended down around 2% to lead declines in the region, with the yen up as much as 0.5% against other major currencies.
Several emerging markets were also dragged lower amid the jitters, with stocks in Indonesia and the Philippines faring the worst, down some 3.6% and 2.2% respectively.
The gloomy mood carried over to Europe, where banks dragged the region's major bourses to a three-week low, as a growing economic crisis in Turkey shook investor confidence in lenders exposed to the country.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures looked set to kick off the week on the backfoot, with the major indices on track to open with losses.
The blue-chip Dow futures were down 85 points, or around 0.4%, at 5:45AM ET, the S&P 500 futures shed 9 points, or around 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 27 points, or roughly 0.4%.
5. Gold Slides To 17-Month Low
In commodity markets, gold prices traded lower, with spot prices hitting a 17-month low, as the yellow metal found little in the way of safety flows, with investors opting instead to pile in to the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen.
Spot gold fell $8.50, or 0.7%, to $1,203.40, just off an intraday low of $1,202.98, its lowest level since March 2017.
A stronger greenback makes the dollar-denominated metal more expensive for holders of foreign currencies.

123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Turkey Takes Aim at Media Reporting on Country's Currency Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey signaled a clampdown on news and social media, with officials including the public prosecutor warning that criticism may be viewed as “economic attacks” on the country.
Authorities have begun investigating people who “carry out actions threatening security” as well as news reports and social media posts that would “serve as economic attacks,” the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Monday, citing a statement by the Istanbul prosecutor’s office. It tied the news reports to “forces behind the July 15 coup attempt,"" referring to a 2016 failed putsch that Turkey blames on a U.S.-based Islamic cleric.
Turkey’s lira has lost about a quarter of its value against the dollar since the U.S. sanctioned two ministers in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in a spat over the continued detention of an American pastor, pushing the Middle East’s largest economy into a currency crisis. The Central Bank announced measures on Monday morning to bolster the ailing lira, pumping cash into the market to stop its slide.
The Ankara-based capital markets regulator also issued a warning against “misleading news” that impacts investor decisions, saying those who are found to be culprits could face fines and prison sentences of up to five years. The banking watchdog published a similar statement over the weekend, warning about false reporting on banks.
Turkey’s financial crimes investigation board, or Masak, has begun a probe into “those who write manipulative stories on the economy,” Haberturk reported, without saying where it got the information. The Interior Ministry has started investigations into 346 social media accounts that “have postings provoking the dollar exchange rate to rise,” Anadolu tweeted, citing an interior ministry statement. The Ankara prosecutor’s also started a similar investigation.
Turkey has previously cracked down on comments, including those by market analysts and brokers, criticizing the government and the economy.

124,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Trump Wields a Tariffs-and-Sanctions Hammer in Risky Strategy,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump isn’t the first American president to rely on economic sanctions and tariffs to exert U.S. power, but he’s taking that approach to new heights against allies and adversaries from Turkey to North Korea.
With an unexpected tweet on Friday morning, Trump announced that he was employing tariffs -- normally used to address trade disputes -- to pressure Turkey over its continued detention of an American pastor held since 2016. Turkish markets, already in a tailspin over President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s economic policies, tumbled further with Trump’s decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs.
The move against Turkey follows Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign on North Korea, fresh penalties against Russia and his plan to reimpose a raft of sanctions against Iran and anyone who does business with it -- including U.S. allies in Europe.
Economic Might
The result is an administration wielding a tariffs-and-sanctions hammer more liberally and with less regard for the consequences than its predecessors. Analysts say the White House strategy reflects a fundamental belief in using American economic might to force others to change their behavior, an approach that will test past findings that sanctions often fail absent broad global support.
“They are explicitly using tariffs as a sanction,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy and the author of a new book on sanctions. “All these years, we separated the two. Tariffs were for unfair trading practices, and sanctions were for foreign policy problems. The president via tweet said, to heck with it, we’re going to use tariffs for foreign policy problems.”
I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2018
U.S. administrations have increasingly relied on sanctions since the 1990s to prod countries over everything from human rights violations to sponsoring terrorism, and their use swelled under President Barack Obama. But Trump increasingly relies on them in almost every foreign policy challenge he faces, and some analysts say he isn’t backing up the penalties with a deft diplomatic approach.
“This administration has continued to be strong and nuanced in its application of sanctions,” said David Mortlock, a former director of international economic affairs on Obama’s National Security Council. “What’s different is the use of sanctions as the only tool without a broad diplomatic push.”
Yet the administration -- particularly Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- have credited their “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at North Korea’s economy for bringing Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table and believe that in a case such as Iran the same can be done to compel its rivals to make a deal.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, rejected that view in a tweet on Aug. 11, saying “The US has to rehabilitate its addiction to sanctions & bullying or entire world will unite—beyond verbal condemnations—to force it to.” Referring to Trump’s “shameful” new tariffs on Turkey, Zarif said, “We’ve stood with neighbors before, and will again now.”
Trump's jubilation in inflicting economic hardship on its NATO ally Turkey is shameful. The US has to rehabilitate its addiction to sanctions & bullying or entire world will unite—beyond verbal condemnations—to force it to. We’ve stood with neighbors before, and will again now.
— Javad Zarif (@JZarif) August 11, 2018
The faith that sanctions will achieve foreign-policy aims is rooted in the administration’s broader protectionist approach, according to Fred Bergsten, the founding director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He said Trump believes that trade barriers are good policy -- having imposed or threatened tariffs against major trading partners such as Canada, China and the European Union. And Trump’s “America First” approach is tied to his distaste for further committing U.S. military forces abroad, Bergsten said.
“We’re seeing by far the most extensive application of trade controls both for protectionist reasons and in specific cases, be it Iran or Turkey,” Bergsten said. “It’s all part of a common mindset that these trade barriers are effective expressions of U.S. power to pursue.”
Gauging the effectiveness of sanctions has spawned entire fields of study and produced endless policy papers. According to the Peterson Institute, which has studied every global sanctions action going back to at least 1914, the tool is effective 20 to 25 percent of the time. They’re particularly ineffective when aimed at getting a country to give up its “cardinal objective,” such as the nuclear program that North Korea considers essential to its national security.
Russia may be another case in point. In Senate testimony last month, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the Trump administration has deployed sanctions on 213 Russian “entities and individuals,” and yet none of those seem to have swayed Russian behavior. Sanctions imposed over Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in 2014 similarly have brought that crisis no closer to resolution.
“Russia has repeatedly warned that talking to us from a position of strength and in the language of ultimatums is futile and pointless,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Friday of sanctions imposed last week for allegedly using a nerve agent against a former spy living in the U.K. “We will consider counter measures to this most recent unfriendly move by Washington.”
Evangelical Paster
Friday’s decision to impose tariffs on Turkey followed sanctions earlier this month on the country’s justice and interior ministers for refusing to release Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor whose plight has been championed by Vice President Mike Pence. While the two ministers aren’t believed to have any assets in the U.S., the sanctions -- announced by Pence -- were seen as a sudden and specific way to pressure the country even though it’s a NATO ally that hosts a key military base used in the fight against Islamic State.
“This is not how sanctions have generally been used historically,” Daniel Tannenbaum, a former Treasury official and principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, said on Bloomberg Television.
For the time being, the administration seems unlikely to pursue a different course when faced with foreign policy crises. Senators are pursuing legislation that would impose still more sanctions on Russia, and officials are weighing new sanctions on Myanmar over abuses against the Rohingya minority.
“Sanctions are an arm’s-length tool -- it’s a way to project power and take advantage of our unique strengths without sending troops oversea or getting too deeply involved with situations outside our borders,” said Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former senior director for Middle East affairs under President George W. Bush. “It fits the zeitgeist.”"

The present governor, Karnit Flug, has said she will not seek a second term after her five-year tenure ends in November.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed Israeli media reports that Blejer was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon.
Spokespeople for Netanyahu and Kahlon declined to comment on a meeting with Blejer, who had also been tipped as a possibility for heading the Bank of Israel in 2013.
Israeli newspapers have reported on other names being considered for the job as well, including Zvi Eckstein, a former deputy Bank of Israel governor, Nathan Sussman, who until recently headed the central bank's research department, and banking regulator Hedva Ber.

Blejer worked in senior positions at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank before a brief stint as president of Argentina's central bank during the country's economic crisis in 2002. He stepped down after a disagreement with the economy minister.

""I do not see the concrete risk of this government being attacked. It is more a hope of the opposition,"" Di Maio said in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera. 
He added that if ""someone wants to use the markets against the government, it must be known that we cannot be threatened"".
A senior government official said on Sunday that he expected speculators to attack Italian financial markets this month but that the country had the resources to defend itself.
Italian stocks have come under strain in recent weeks, with investors concerned that the governing coalition, made up of the League and Di Maio's 5-Star Movement, might ignore European Union fiscal rules and push up the country's debt, the highest in the euro zone after Greece.
Di Maio said his government would carry out all reforms with maximum respect for the ""equilibrium of the state accounts"" and that there was no need to exceed the EU's 3 percent deficit-to-GDP limit. 
""We will convince the EU to allow us to carry out reforms that will cut debt and boost internal demand,"" said Di Maio, who is also industry and labor minister.
La Repubblica daily reported last week that the government planned to target a budget deficit next year of 1.7 percent of gross domestic product, comfortably inside the EU's 3 percent ceiling but double the current 0.8 percent goal.
The government is due to update its economic targets in September before drawing up the 2019 budget and submitting it to the European Commission for approval the following month.

(This version of the story corrects paragraph 8 to show deficit target was reported by la Repubblica not stated by finance minister.)

OSS, Netherlands (Reuters) - With three lounges, three dining rooms, an open-air jacuzzi, a bar and six luxury cabins, the 50-metre ""Aster"" is one of Dutch shipyard Heesen's more modest superyachts.
The Netherlands, which amassed huge wealth through the technical superiority of European shipbuilders during its 17th century Golden Age, is continuing its maritime tradition by carving out a prominent place in the luxury yacht industry.
""It's a big year for us,"" Johan Kaasjager of Heesen Yachts told Reuters at his shipyard in Oss. ""We'll have delivery of three yachts this year and still a lot to come. The order book is very good at the moment so we're full till 2020.""
A new ship construction dock is so large it's been nicknamed ""the cathedral"". At 90 meters long it will enable Heesen to build its largest ever superyacht, the 80-metre Cosmos.
Heesen has found a sweet spot in that 50-80 meter market segment, with demand so strong it cannot keep up, even after adding new facilities. 
Home to several of the world's top 10 superyacht builders, the Netherlands ranks second behind Italy this year in the builders of yachts longer than 24 meters, with 65 in the pipeline, data from Superyacht Times shows.
Last year, the average price per yacht rose nearly 10 percent to a record 57 million euros ($65 million).
""The reason for strong demand is that people are more trying to escape daily life,"" Kaasjager said. ""A yacht of course, when you're out at sea, is fully private so it's the perfect way to relax and be with your family.""
ONBOARD WATERFALLS 
The trend seen since the recovery from the 2007-2008 recession is for more luxurious, larger ships, with features such as waterfalls that double as projection screens, helipads and swimming pools, blurring the boundary with cruise liners.
While Italy produces a greater numbers of ships and Germany dominates the market for mega yachts over 100 meters long, the Dutch are known for their reliability in delivery, high-tech specifications and speed, Kaasjager said. 
Top customers over the past decade have been the United States and Russia, accounting for nearly 40 percent of business, with Americans making up 22 percent of existing orders.
The value of superyachts built in Dutch yards rose from 662 million euros in 2014 to nearly 1.2 billion euros in 2017, the report said, giving the Netherlands roughly 30 percent of global annual sales of around 4 billion euros.
""It's also the Dutch mentality to build good yachts, good quality, on time, and we do what we promise"", Kaasjager said.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>","China okays $11.45 billion in new urban rail projects, seen quickening infrastructure spending","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's state planner has approved a total 78.7 billion yuan ($11.45 billion) of urban railway projects in the capital of the northern Jilin province, the country's first urban rail project to be approved in a year, local media reported on Sunday.
The approval for the projects in Changchun city signals the restart of infrastructure projects that Beijing had put on hold as it sought to contain local government debt, part of its multi-year risk crackdown.
The Politburo, China's top decision-making body, said in July that China could boost infrastructure spending, confirming a Reuters exclusive that China was planning to ease borrowing curbs on local governments to prop up growth as the economy slows amid a heated trade row with the United States.
The state planner has approved urban railway projects including eight subway lines, with estimated length of 135.4 kilometers for Changchun, the National Business Daily (NBD) said on Sunday, citing an announcement on the Jilin Development and Reform Commission's website.
The original statement could not be found on the commission's website, but a local official with the Jilin commission said the paper's report was accurate but the statement had been removed because official approval documents had not yet been issued.
""We had a meeting with NDRC last month and projects were approved in general but the official paper hasn't been handed down yet,"" said a Jilin commission official who gave his surname as Hu.
Construction on the Jilin projects should start this year and is scheduled to finish in 2023, with 60 percent of the financing to come from bank lending, according to the National Business Daily.
Last year, some local governments including the northern city of Baotou in Inner Mongolia, canceled subway projects because of difficulty financing them.
China's economic growth slowed modestly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter, with the outlook clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the United States, rising corporate borrowing costs, and steep declines in Chinese stocks and the yuan.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>","BOJ should ditch negative rates, yield cap: ex-BOJ executive","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan should abandon negative interest rates and a cap on long-term bond yields immediately as such crisis-mode measures are unnecessary for an economy enjoying steady growth, a former central bank executive said on Monday.
The central bank may fail to exit ultra-loose policy for years unless it drops its insistence of meeting its elusive price target at all cost, said Kazuo Momma, who oversaw monetary policy and international affairs during his stint at the BOJ.
The measures the BOJ took in July to make its policy framework more sustainable are a step forward, but not enough to address the diminishing returns and rising costs of its radical stimulus program, he said.
""Personally, I think the BOJ should abandon negative rates and yield curve control immediately,"" Momma said. ""They are both steps needed only in response to a crises. It's obvious the economy no longer needs such radical steps,"" he told Reuters.
The BOJ has already achieved what the public wanted most by prolonging Japan's economic expansion, bringing the jobless rate to record lows and pushing up wages, Momma said.
There is thus no strong reason for the BOJ to persist in achieving its 2 percent inflation, he said, calling on the bank to focus more on the rising cost of prolonged easing.
Consumption remains weak because households cannot expect returns on their investment to rise much, while ultra-low rates are prompting firms to ramp up excessive investment, he said.
""The BOJ is putting too much emphasis on achieving its price target. It needs to change that and put more weight on how its policy affects the economy and financial developments,"" he said.
Only then could the BOJ make substantial tweaks to its policy framework and seek an exit from ultra-easy policy, said Momma, who retains close contact with incumbent policymakers.
Under its yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ guides short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.
As its huge buying dries up bond market liquidity, the central bank last month made tweaks to its policies to allow long-term yields to move more flexibly around its target.
It also adopted for the first time a forward guidance on future interest rate moves by pledging to keep rates ""very low"" for an ""extended period.""
Momma said the measures did not go beyond addressing malfunctions in the government bond market. He also said the new forward guidance ""didn't mean much"" as it merely confirmed the fact rates will be kept low for years given subdued inflation.
""It's futile to focus on any change in wording for signals on future policy shifts,"" as the forward guidance is kept intentionally vague and would not prevent the BOJ from raising rates when necessary, said Momma, currently executive economist at private think tank Mizuho Research Institute.
""There's not much else left in terms of what the BOJ can do in minor fine-tuning of its policy.""

131,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",U.K. House Prices Are on the Longest Losing Streak Since Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. house prices fell for a fifth month in a row in July, the longest stretch of declines since the financial crisis.
Values fell 0.2 percent from June, bringing the average price for a home to 302,251 pounds ($386,000), Acadata said in a report Monday. London remains a “mixed picture,” with the number of sales in the second quarter falling by 7 percent from a year earlier and prices declining in almost two-thirds of the capital’s boroughs.
The British housing market is weakening after a three-decade boom amid slower economic growth, uncertainty created by Brexit and inflation outpacing wage growth over much of the past year. London, where the average house price is more than double the national average, has been hit harder than the rest of the country.
At the national level, annual price growth has slowed to 1.6 percent, the least in six years, and sales have declined by 6 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, Acadata said. The Bank of England’s interest-rate increase in August is expected “to result in a further reduction in housing market activity,” the report said.
BOE Hike
The central bank hiked rates for only the second time since the financial crisis this month, and said that London’s property market is seeing weakness due to the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union and changes in migration. Policy maker Ian McCafferty said last week that the capital is seeing “significant change as a result of uncertainty around Brexit,” weighing on home prices and rents.
Looking at regions on a three-month growth average, there’s evidence to support that BOE view, the report said. The West Midlands region is seeing the fastest growth, while the Southeast and East of England are seeing the slowest.
A separate report from Visa and IHS Markit showed that consumer spending fell 0.9 percent in July from a year earlier. While hot weather helped boost spending on food, drink and days away, surveys show that retailers are concerned rate hikes will hit already-fragile consumer confidence.
“It seems unlikely that expenditure trends will improve in the near term,” said Annabel Fiddes, principal economist at IHS Markit. “Expenditure trends have been relatively subdued in 2018 so far, which can be linked in part to disappointing growth in real earnings despite a tight labor market, while the recent interest-rate hike by the Bank of England is likely to add further pressure on households’ budgets.”

132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",China-U.S. Trade Spat Is Just a Start to the Economic Cold War,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China is not just another front in President Donald Trump's war on trade. Unlike Mexico, Canada, Europe and other targets of the president, China will be a source of economic conflict for years to come, long after the tariff level on soybeans has been settled. Like the rivalry with the Soviet Union, economic competition with China may form a cold war that shapes American politics and economic policy for a generation or more.
Until now, through flukes of timing, Americans have largely been distracted from China's economic development. China joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001, three months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. For the next several years, America's focus was terrorism and war in the Middle East, not China's ascension and its impact on the U.S. economy. Next came a financial crisis and the great recession, which became the national focus for the next several years. The post-recession political environment in the U.S. has largely been one of government dysfunction and partisan polarization.
But changes in both China and the U.S. make the current period different. In China's period of economic development in the 2000s and much of the 2010s, there were clear benefits for the U.S. even if there were tradeoffs as well. China opening up gave some U.S. industries greater access to the Chinese domestic market. U.S. consumers benefited by getting cheap goods produced in China. There was a hope that integrating China into the global economy would shift its culture to be more like the West.
With China announcing its ""Made in China 2025"" economic vision, it's difficult to see much benefit for the U.S. Seeking to become self-sufficient in industries ranging from aerospace to semiconductors to robots threatens American jobs, corporate profits and global technological leadership. China also becomes more of a national security threat.
We've seen in recent years that as global institutions fray, political and cultural power defaults to the players with the most economic clout. In Hollywood, movies are made increasingly with the Chinese audience in mind, which means ensuring that movies can pass Chinese censors. In oil markets, power is shifting to Saudi Arabia and Russia away from OPEC as the two countries' share of production increases. And in Silicon Valley, while large companies may be debating whether and how much to censor content in the U.S. market, there's no such consternation about censorship if it means access to the Chinese market.
The doomsday scenario for Americans and American values looks something like this: Made in China 2025 is a success. Through a combination of China subsidizing its own companies to innovate and develop their own technologies, and buying or perhaps stealing valuable technology from American companies, China becomes the global leader in technological innovation. Its economic growth continues to outpace American economic growth, and over time it's America forced to adapt to Chinese values in key areas in the global economy rather than the other way around.
This is a scenario that is likely to unite Democrats and Republicans. And indeed, that seems to be happening, as Congress seeks to increase scrutiny around foreign investment in the U.S.
The ramifications of this growing rivalry between the U.S. and China are likely to be far-reaching. Will Chinese students still be allowed to study at American universities? Will high-skilled Chinese workers still be allowed to work in Silicon Valley? That may be up for debate if there's concern about spies intent on returning to China with information useful for Made in China 2025.
A future economic cold war between the U.S. and China may push American leaders to favor a pro-growth policy at any price, even if that risks stoking additional inflation and inflating economic bubbles. If China invests more in space exploration, that could kick off another space race. In whatever realm China decides to emphasize, the U.S. will be afraid to let it get too far ahead.
Fights over currency manipulation and soybean tariffs are likely to be just the beginning. The economic conflict between the U.S. and China could define the next generation of American life."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has drafted a economic action plan and will start implementing it on Monday morning to ease investor concerns, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said on Sunday, after the lira plunged to a new record low in early Asia Pacific trade.
In an interview with Hurriyet newspaper published online, Albayrak described the lira's weakness as ""an attack,"" echoing President Tayyip Erdogan - who is his father-in-law - and said the action plan was ready.
""From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market,"" Albayrak said, without giving details on what the steps would be.
Albayrak also said a plan has been prepared for banks and the real economy sector, including small to mid-sized businesses which are most affected by the foreign exchange fluctuations. ""We will be taking the necessary steps with our banks and banking watchdog in a speedy manner,"" he said.
He has also dismissed any suggestions that Turkey might intervene in dollar-denominated bank accounts, saying any seizure or conversion of those deposits into lira was out of the question.
The lira <TRYTOM=D3> plunged to a fresh record low of 7.24 against the dollar during in Asia Pacific trade, where markets were opening for Monday morning. It pared losses after Albayrak's comments and stood at 6.8603 at 2136 GMT Sunday.
The currency has lost more than 45 percent of its value this year, largely over worries about Erdogan's influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates in the face of high inflation and worsening ties with the United States.
On Friday, the lira tumbled as much as 18 percent at one point, its biggest daily drop since 2001.
Earlier, Erdogan had stood by his opposition to high interest rates, saying they were an instrument of exploitation and that Turkey was not going to fall into this trap.
In the Hurriyet interview, Albayrak said budget policies were important to support and strengthen the central bank's monetary policies. ""We will be entering a strong period in terms of fiscal policies,"" he said.
Turkey's banking watchdog BBDK in a statement said it was limiting banks' foreign exchange swap transactions.
STORM IN A TEA CUP
Erdogan, who has called himself the ""enemy of interest rates,"" wants cheap credit from banks to fuel growth, but investors fear the economy is overheating and could be set for a hard landing.
His comments on interest rates - and his recent appointment of his son-in-law as finance minister - have heightened perceptions that the central bank is not independent.
On Sunday, speaking to supporters in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast, Erdogan dismissed suggestions that Turkey was in a financial crisis like those seen in Asia two decades ago.
The lira's free-fall was the result of a plot and did not reflect Turkey's economic fundamentals, he said. ""What is the reason for all this storm in a tea cup? There is no economic reason... This is called carrying out an operation against Turkey,"" he said.
The central bank raised interest rates to support the lira in an emergency move in May, but it did not tighten monetary policy at its last meeting.
Erdogan repeated his call for Turks to sell dollars and buy lira to shore up the currency, while telling business owners not to stock up on dollars.
""I am specifically addressing our manufacturers: Do not rush to the banks to buy dollars. Do not take a stance saying 'We are bankrupt, we are done, we should guarantee ourselves.' If you do that, that would be wrong. You should know that to keep this nation standing is ... also the manufacturers' duty.""
DEADLINE
Turkey's row with the United States has further weighed on the lira.
The two NATO allies have been at odds over a wide range of issues: diverging interests in Syria, Ankara's ambition to buy Russian defense systems and more recently the case of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor on trial in Turkey.
After Brunson had been in jail for almost 20 months, a court in July ordered him to be moved to house arrest. Since then U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have called for his release, while Ankara says the decision is up to the courts.
Washington in response sanctioned two Turkish ministers, and Trump on Friday announced the United States was doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey, saying relations with Ankara were ""not good at this time.""
Last week, a Turkish delegation went to Washington and met U.S. counterparts but there was no breakthrough.
On Sunday, Erdogan revealed details of talks between the two countries over the pastor, saying the United States had given Turkey until last Wednesday to hand him over. ""They threatened to sanction our ministers if we didn't,"" he said.

A White House official said they did not set a deadline for Brunson, adding that he was expected home a long time ago. The official said diplomacy on the issue continues.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",Beijing struggles to defuse anger over China's P2P lending crisis,"By Shu Zhang and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Peter Wang was asleep at his home in Beijing last Monday when police officers arrived before dawn to detain him, saying he had helped organize a protest planned for later that day.
Across the city, others who had lost money investing in China's online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms - including some who had traveled from as far away as Shandong and Shanxi provinces - got similar visits from police.
By the time they were released, the demonstration they had planned using social media chat groups had fizzled amid a massive security response around the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) headquarters in the heart of Beijing's financial district.
Instead of demanding that the government bail out the hundreds of collapsed P2P companies, those who made it to the protest area were forced onto buses and carted away to Jiujingzhuang, a holding center for petitioners on the outskirts of Beijing, according to two P2P investors.
""Once the police checked your ID cards and saw your petition materials, they knew you are here looking to protect your rights. Then they put you on a bus directly,"" said Wang, who works at an auto repair shop. He joined a separate, smaller protest in a different part of Beijing after his detention. ""There was no channel to solve any problems. All they care about was preventing any disturbance."" 
The size of China's P2P industry is far bigger than in the rest of the world combined, with outstanding loans of 1.49 trillion yuan ($217.96 billion), according to data tracker p2p001.com, run by the Shenzhen Qiancheng Internet Finance Research Institute.
P2P, in which platforms gather funds from retail investors and loan the money to small corporate and individual borrowers, promising high returns, started flourishing nearly unregulated in China in 2011. At its peak in 2015, there were about 3,500 such businesses. 
But after Beijing began a campaign to defuse debt bubbles and reduce risks in the economy, including the country's enormous non-bank lending sector, cracks began to appear as investors pulled their funds.
Since June, 243 online lending platforms have gone bust, according to wdzj.com, another P2P industry data provider. In that period, the industry saw its first monthly net fund outflows since at least 2014, the data provider said.
The latest burst of anger, which led to the planned protests, flared up ahead of a June 30 deadline for companies to comply with new business practice standards, which are still being finalised.
Many of them shut down rather than face tougher regulations, Zane Wang, chief executive of online micro-loan provider China Rapid Finance (N:XRF), told Reuters. That caused panic in the broader market. Investors tried to pull funds from P2P companies, causing liquidity problems for many smaller operators, Wang said, although larger ones are faring better. ""Some platforms might become a winner out of this, and some platforms, probably a large portion of the platforms, might not be able to make it,"" he said.
China's propaganda machine has swung into action as Beijing seeks to reassure people that the Chinese economy and financial markets are healthy despite a trade war with the United States and steep declines in the value of stock prices and the yuan.
No mainland Chinese media - official mainstream papers or more independent-leaning publications - reported the attempts to protest in China's capital.
Many would-be protesters were forced to give fingerprints and blood samples and prevented from traveling to Beijing. Some were even removed from Beijing-bound trains ahead of the protests, said a Shanghai-based P2P investor who lost 1.3 million yuan. She declined to be named out of fear for her safety. 
Even after the demonstrations were effectively snuffed out, hundreds of security personnel patrolled around CBIRC's office, highlighting authorities' sensitivity to any form of social instability.
The CBIRC did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment. The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a fax seeking comment.
On Sunday, state media outlet Xinhua reported that the government has proposed 10 measures to reduce risk in the P2P sector, including a strict ban on new P2P companies and online finance platforms, and a blacklist under China’s social credit rating system for those who don't repay their loans.
MESSY CLEAN-UP
Peer-to-peer lending was pioneered by firms like LendingClub (N:LC) in the United States, but in China it has expanded on a massive scale as firms piggy-backed on the government's drive for financial innovation to serve credit-starved small and mid-sized private companies. 
The industry expanded too fast for regulators to keep up.
Many P2P platforms lend to customers that might be deemed too risky for a commercial bank. That has in cases led to liquidity crises, when too many investors demand their funds at once if loans appear to be going south.
There have also been cases of outright fraud, the most well-known being Ezubao - a $7.6 billion Ponzi scam involving more than 900,000 investors.
More than 100 companies listed in China's domestic stock markets are involved in P2P operations, and 32 of those own more than 30 percent of a P2P company, according to a July research report by CITIC Securities. 
China extended by two years a separate June 30 deadline for an online finance clean-up campaign. But rather than calming matters, it created more uncertainty, market watchers said.
CITIC Securities estimated that under the clean-up campaign, only about 100 platforms out of 1,836 would be able to meet even today's regulatory standards and obtain a license. Less than 50 would thrive.
Experts say larger companies would probably benefit from firmer regulation. But for now, listed companies in the industry have seen their share prices take a beating. 
Shares of some of the Chinese P2P companies listed in the U.S. have plunged. China Rapid Finance shares have lost 73 percent so far this year, while Yirendai (N:YRD) has slumped 71 percent. PPDai (N:PPDF) has dropped 44 percent, and  Hexindai  (O:HX) 27 percent. 
Officials with PPDai declined to comment.
In a news release, Hexindai said it would improve risk management ""and further reduce credit risk.""
Tang Ning, founder and chief executive officer of CreditEase, the majority owner of P2P lending platform Yirendai, told Reuters that he was concerned that the ""industry-wide panic"" would escalate. 
He urged regulators to ""act with a sense of urgency"" to protect good P2P companies while punishing bad players to avoid harming China's financial system and economy.
""Otherwise, it will be 'winter' for the industry. All companies will be hit, both illicit and compliant. Everyone will lose and that's a situation no one wants to see,"" said Tang. ""Small businesses will lose an important, or the most important source of funding. That's not only hurting the financial system but also the real economy."" 
For Wang, the Beijing investor, the pain is acute. He and his family had invested 7 million yuan - their life savings, with which they had planned to use to buy a home at the end of the year - in two P2P platforms that have shut down.
They recovered none of their investment.
""We are financial refugees, not mobsters. The only thing we want is to get back our money, at least a portion of it,"" said Wang.

Pension Insurance Corporation said the buyout left members of the scheme, which was set up in 2017 following BHS's collapse and a cash injection by former owner Philip Green, fully insured and certain to receive benefits under the scheme.
A pension insurance buyout involves a transfer of the promise to pay pension fund members, shifting that responsibility from the fund to the insurer, and giving policyholders a guaranteed income stream.
BHS fell into administration in 2016 with a pension deficit of 571 million pounds ($729 million), with 11,000 jobs lost as result. An outcry over the collapse prompted the government to try to clamp down on bosses who do not do enough to protect workers' pensions.

In February last year Green, who was blamed by British lawmakers for the demise of the BHS, paid 363 million pounds to plug a hole in the pension scheme. Green had sold the chain in 2015 for one pound.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>","Germany says Trump's tariffs, sanctions destroy jobs and growth","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and sanctions policies, saying such measures were destroying jobs and growth and that Europe would not bow to U.S. pressure regarding Iran.
The United States has triggered a bitter tit-for-tat trade dispute with import tariffs meant to protect American jobs against what Trump calls unfair trade practices from China, Europe and other countries.
Trump's determination to push ahead with sanctions on Tehran which also target European companies doing business with Iran has opened another battle front.
""This trade war is slowing down and destroying economic growth - and it creates new uncertainties,"" Altmaier told Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that consumers suffered the most because higher tariffs were driving up prices.
Altmaier lauded the agreement reached by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during negotiations with Trump last month, saying the interim deal had saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe.
The U.S. and the European Union are embroiled in a spat after Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and Brussels responded with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods.
Trump had also threatened to impose tariffs on EU auto imports but reached an agreement to hold off on taking action after meeting with Juncker at the White House last month.
""The agreement between the EU and U.S. can only be a first step. Our goal is a global trade order with lower tariffs, less protectionism and open markets,"" Altmaier said.
Turning to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the minister said Germany and its EU allies would continue to support companies doing business with Iran despite U.S. pressure.
""We won't let Washington dictate us with whom we can do business and we therefore stick to the Vienna Nuclear Agreement so that Iran cannot build atomic weapons,"" Altmaier said.
German companies should be allowed to continue to invest in Iran as much as they want and the German government is looking for ways together with its European allies to ensure that financial transactions could still take place, he added.
Several European companies have suspended plans to invest in Iran in light of the U.S. sanctions, including oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) as well as carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). [nL5N1UY39D] 
German business associations have warned that companies are increasingly suffering from Trump's sanctions policies - including those against Iran - as well as the tariffs he is imposing in the escalating trade conflict with China.
The trade and sanctions disputes are clouding the growth outlook for Germany, Europe's largest economy, but Altmaier said he nonetheless expected strong growth this year due to vibrant domestic demand, record-high employment and rising wages.

The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product figures for the second quarter on Tuesday, with analysts expecting the quarterly growth rate to pick up to 0.4 percent after 0.3 percent in the first quarter.

137,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 06:46AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things To Watch This Week,"Investing.com - Investors will stay focused on Turkey's deepening currency crisis and the fallout across global markets in week ahead to see if any more news materializes after Washington's latest sanctions on Ankara battered the lira and triggered a move out of riskier assets.
In addition, market focus will stay attuned to the next potential steps in the tit-for-tat trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
U.S.-Sino trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies having an impact on economic growth.
On the data front, U.S. retail sales figures for July come out on Wednesday, which should give clearer signs on the strength of the American consumer at the start of the second half of the year.
There are also about 10 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead on Wall Street, as the earnings season starts to wind down, with big-name retailers such as  Home Depot  , Macy's and Walmart among the highlights.
Elsewhere, China also has key data, including industrial production on Tuesday, which will be watched for any signs of damage from the ongoing trade spat with the U.S.
Meantime, in Europe, traders will be able to get their teeth into the latest snapshots of U.K. inflation, employment, and retail sales for further indications on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. Turkey Turmoil Spillover?
The lira briefly plunged more than 20% to a record-low on Friday, while global markets reeled, as investors were spooked that the collapse in the Turkish currency would spread across emerging markets and hit the European banking system.
The lira ended down around 15% against the dollar, its worst day since Turkey's financial crisis of 2001, on the back of a deepening rift with the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum, after imposing U.S. sanctions earlier in the week because of Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in 2016. Turkish authorities accuse Brunson of supporting a failed coup attempt earlier that year.
Turkey's President Recip Tayyip Erdogan failed to offer any economic solace when he spoke Friday, declaring that ""they have their dollar, we have our god.""
Erdogan also asked citizens to ""change the euros, the dollars and the gold that you are keeping beneath your pillows into lira,"" noting this is ""a domestic and national struggle.""
Adding to emerging market currency woes was the Russian rouble, which sank to its lowest since April 2016 against the dollar, on threats of new U.S. sanctions over the Kremlin's alleged involvement in the poising of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal with the chemical agent Novichok earlier this year in the rural English town of Salisbury.
The geopolitical worries come as the U.S. is embroiled in a trade war with China. Both governments announced the possibility of imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on an additional $16 billion worth of goods last week.
2. U.S. Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for July at 8:30AM ET Wednesday.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.2% last month, moderating from a gain of 0.5% in June.
Excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.4%, the same as its increase a month earlier.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
Besides the retail sales report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on building permits, housing starts, industrial production, as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions.
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year, with the next move higher coming at its September meeting.
3. Retailers Headline Last Big Week Of Earnings
While just 10 S&P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week, retailers are just getting started in what will be the last big wave of the second-quarter earnings season.
Home Depot (NYSE:HD) unofficially kicks things off when it reports on Tuesday; results from Macy’s (NYSE:M) are on the agenda for Wednesday; while Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer, is due to report results on Thursday.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) and Children's Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) are among the other major retailers reporting this week.
Other high-profile names set to report this week also include NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Deere (NYSE:DE) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).



This earnings season has been stronger than analysts had expected. Nearly 90% of S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly results thus far. Of those companies, 76% have reported better-than-expected earnings.
4. China Industrial Output 
China is to release July industrial production figures on Wednesday morning.
The consensus among analysts is that the data will show China's factory output grew 6.3%, accelerating from a 6.0%-gain a month earlier.
At the same time, the Asian nation will publish reports on fixed asset investment and retail sales.
Recent data has started to show that the world’s second largest economy may be losing steam, raising concerns about the potential fallout from a full-blown U.S.-China trade war.
5. UK Inflation Figures
The UK Office for National Statistics will release data on consumer price inflation for July at 0830GMT (4:30AM ET) on Wednesday.
Analysts expect annual CPI to inch up to 2.5%, a tad faster than the 2.4% increase seen in June, while core inflation is forecast to hold steady at 1.9%.
In addition to the inflation report, traders will focus on monthly employment and retail sales data, due on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively, for further hints on the health of the economy.
Britain's economy picked up some speed in the second quarter after a sharp winter slowdown earlier in the year, official data at the end of last week showed.
However, traders slammed the pound to its lowest in over a year against the dollar as the probability of a no-deal, or hard Brexit rises.
With less than eight months until Britain leaves the European Union, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has begun talking more publicly about the prospect of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement on what happens next.

138,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",France fumes at proposed post-Brexit EU sea trade links,"PARIS (Reuters) - France deems unacceptable a European Commission proposal to exclude French ports from a re-routing of a strategic trade corridor between Ireland and mainland Europe after Brexit, the government said.
At the moment much of Ireland's trade with the continent goes via Britain in trucks. However, with less than eight months to go until Britain leaves the European Union there is still little clarity on its future trade relations with the bloc, nor the nature of the Irish Republic's border with the British province of Northern Ireland.
The new route put forward by the Commission would connect Ireland by sea with Dutch and Belgian ports including Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. French ports such as Calais and Dunkirk would be bypassed.
""France and Ireland maintain important trade channels, both overland via Britain and via direct maritime routes. The geographical proximity between Ireland and France creates an obvious connection to the single market,"" French Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne wrote to the EU's transport commissioner in a letter dated Aug. 10.
""Surprisingly, the Commission proposal in no way takes this into account. This proposal therefore is not acceptable to France.""
At stake are jobs, millions of dollars' worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding. 

Borne said that French ports had the necessary resources to ensure they could handle the likely increase in trade flows, hinting at concerns of congestion in ports such as Calais, France's busiest passenger port.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's banking and insurance regulator said it will facilitate the transmission of monetary policy by supporting more lending by financial institutions.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a statement posted on its website that it would guide financial institutions to expand financing, including to qualified private companies and small businesses. It would encourage them to balance the promotion of economic growth with controlling risks.
The move comes amid a period of greater uncertainty for the Chinese economy, in part because of an intensifying trade conflict between China and the United States.
The regulator took special note of loans for infrastructure projects. In July, preliminary statistics indicated that new infrastructure loans were 172.4 billion yuan, an increase of 46.9 billion yuan over the month before, it said.
The statement follows comments by China's central bank on Friday that it would maintain a neutral and prudent monetary policy and enhance flexibility in yuan exchange rate levels. It would take measures to fend off systemic financial risks and maintain ample liquidity in the banking system, it said.

“Trade frictions, geopolitics and the normalization of monetary policies in major economies have increased uncertainties in global economic and financial markets,” the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",Chinese media keep up drumbeat of criticism of U.S.,"By Alexandra Harney
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's state media continued a barrage of criticism of the United States on Saturday as their tit-for-tat trade war escalated, while seeking to reassure readers the Chinese economy remains in strong shape. 
Commentaries in the People's Daily, China's top newspaper, likened the United States to a bull in a China shop running roughshod over the rules of global trade and said that China was ""still one of the best-performing, most promising and most tenacious economies in the world.""
The commentaries come as trade tensions between the two countries intensify. China said this week it would put an additional 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports in retaliation against levies on Chinese goods imposed by the United States.
One commentary accused the United States of ""rudely trampling on international trade rules"" and not taking into account China's lowering of tariffs and continued opening of its economy, among other things.
""People of insight are soberly aware that so-called 'America first' is actually naked self-interest, a bullying that takes advantage of its own strength, challenges the multilateral unilaterally, and uses might to challenge the rules,"" it read.
Another commentary argued that the Chinese economy was stable and was expected to remain so.
In the second half of this year, ""comprehensive deepening of reforms will continuously produce benefits."" It said China could take steps to boost domestic demand while continued to cut corporate taxes and fees.
With these and other policies, ""the Chinese market will show an all-new charm,"" the commentary said. 
A separate piece in the People's Daily quoted vice agriculture minister Han Jun saying that if a trade war broke out, many other countries were willing and ""completely able to replace American agricultural products' share of the Chinese market."" 
It also quoted the vice minister as saying that the impact of American tariffs on China would be ""extremely limited"", but warned that were a trade war to escalate, the U.S. agriculture sector would feel its effects.
Earlier this week, Chinese state media accused the United States of a ""mobster mentality"" as it moved to implement additional tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing had all the necessary means to fight back, the reports said.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",Erdogan tells Turks to buy crumbling lira as Trump turns the screws,"By Behiye Selin Taner and Lisa Lambert
ISTANBUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks on Friday to sell their gold and U.S. dollars to support the country's currency which plunged after U.S. President Donald Trump escalated a feud with NATO ally Turkey by doubling tariffs on metals imports.
The Turkish lira  has long been falling on worries about Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and worsening relations with the United States. 
On Friday the currency dropped as much as 18 percent at one point, the biggest one-day fall since a 2001 financial crisis in Turkey.
Reverberations spread through global financial markets, with European stock markets especially hit as investors took fright over banks' exposure to Turkey. U.S. stocks were also rattled. 
The lira has lost more than 40 percent this year. It hit a record low after Trump announced he had authorized higher tariffs on imports from Turkey, imposing duties of 20 percent on aluminum and 50 percent on steel.
The lira, Trump noted on Twitter, ""slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!""
""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"" he wrote.
An important emerging market, Turkey borders Iran, Iraq and Syria and has been mostly pro-Western for decades. Financial upheaval there risks further destabilizing an already volatile region.   
Without naming countries, Erdogan said supporters of a failed military coup two years ago, which Ankara says was organized by a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, were attacking Turkey in new ways since his re-election two months ago.
The new duties on Turkey are double the level that Trump imposed in March on steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. The White House said he had authorized them under a section of U.S. trade law that allows for tariffs on national security grounds.
Turkey's trade ministry said the tariffs were against World Trade Organization rules.
FOCUS ON PASTOR
While Turkey and the United States are at odds over a host of issues, the most pressing disagreement for Trump has been the fate of American Christian pastor Andrew Brunson, who is on trial on terrorism charges for allegedly supporting a group that Ankara blames for a failed coup in 2016. He denies the charges. 
Turkish officials held talks in Washington this week but there was no breakthrough.
(Graphic: Emerging market currencies slide: https://tmsnrt.rs/2vzelu5)
The Turkish financial crisis set off a wave of selling across emerging markets, reviving the specter of contagion that has been the sector's Achilles heel for decades.
The lira sell-off deepened concern over whether over-indebted Turkish companies will be able to pay back loans taken out in euros and dollars after years of overseas borrowing to fund a construction boom under Erdogan.
The president, who says a shadowy ""interest rate lobby"" and Western credit ratings agencies are attempting to bring down Turkey's economy, appealed to his countrymen's patriotism.
""If there is anyone who has dollars or gold under their pillows, they should go exchange it for liras at our banks. This is a national, domestic battle,"" he told a crowd in the northeastern city of Bayburt.
""Some countries have engaged in behavior that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice,"" he said. ""Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging,"" said Erdogan, who warned of ""economic war.""
In an opinion piece in the New York Times on Friday, Erdogan said Turkey's partnership with the United States could be in jeopardy unless Washington ""starts respecting Turkey’s sovereignty.""
""Before it is too late, Washington must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives. Failure to reverse this trend of unilateralism and disrespect will require us to start looking for new friends and allies,"" Erdogan said.
Turkey, home to the Incirlik air base which is used by U.S. forces in the Middle East, has been a NATO member since the 1950s. It is host to an X-band radar, a critical part of the Western alliance's missile defense system again Iran.
The United States has increasingly used economic sanctions against foes such as Iran or North Korea but it is highly unusual for an administration to impose import tariffs over political or judicial issues with other countries.
“I’m not aware of any prior administration using tariffs in this way, and there’s a very simple reason: because they’re an incredibly blunt instrument that often can have blowback on American workers and consumers as we’ve seen in the China context,” said Ned Price, a former CIA officer who also served as a National Security Council spokesman during the Obama administration. 
COUP ALLEGATIONS 
Although Erdogan struck a defiant tone, his foreign ministry called for diplomacy and dialogue to solve problems with Washington and Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan said ""we implore President Trump to return to the negotiating table.""
Ankara wants the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based cleric who Turkish authorities say masterminded the 2016 coup attempt in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies the allegation.
Brunson, an evangelical Presbyterian from North Carolina, was jailed for allegedly supporting the group that Turkey blames for the failed coup and was moved from prison to house arrest in July. 
His cause resonates with Trump's Christian conservative supporters, who could be influential as Republicans seek to retain control of Congress in midterm elections in November. 
Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump who is also representing Brunson’s family, told talk-show host and political commentator Sean Hannity’s radio program on Friday: ""We're close to getting a resolution in that case."" He offered no further details. 
""This could be the most expensive pastor in world history,"" Sekulow said, referring to the harm being done to Turkey's economy.
Erdogan enjoys the support of many Turks even though rents and food and fuel prices have all surged.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",U.S.-Mexico NAFTA talks drag on as autos sticking points emerge,"By David Shepardson and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Talks between the United States and Mexico over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement were set to drag into next week, as auto industry officials said on Friday that new sticking points had emerged over President Donald Trump's threat to impose steep automotive tariffs.
Auto industry officials familiar with the talks said the Trump administration wants the ability to impose national security tariffs on future Mexican production from new auto assembly and parts plants.
These officials said U.S negotiators had essentially agreed that a new NAFTA trade deal would exempt existing Mexican auto plants from any ""Section 232"" tariffs that Trump may impose.
But the U.S. negotiators do not want to apply the same guarantees to new Mexican auto plants, the officials said, as the potential threat of 25 percent tariffs would discourage new automotive investment in Mexico to serve the U.S. market.
At Trump's direction, the Commerce Department in May launched a probe into whether imports of cars, trucks and auto parts pose a national security risk, invoking the same 1962 trade law used to justify broad tariffs on steel and aluminum -- including those imposed on Canada and Mexico.
Administration officials and congressional aides have said the car tariff probe, like the metals tariffs, in part is aimed at winning concessions during ongoing NAFTA renegotiation talks.
Trump late on Friday tweeted that a ""deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal,"" adding that Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ""has been an absolute gentleman.""
Trump added that Canada ""must wait"" to rejoin the NAFTA talks. ""Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if can't make a deal!"" Trump tweeted.
Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is leading NAFTA trade talks for Canada, said the minister was in regular contact with her Mexican and U.S. counterparts.
""We’re glad Mexico and the U.S. continue to work out their bilateral issues. It’s the only way we’ll get to a deal,” Austen said.
ISSUES TO WORK OUT 
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters in Washington on Friday his talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would resume next week, but there were still many bilateral issues to work out before Canada could rejoin the talks.
Asked about progress on autos rules of origin, he said: ""Nothing is close until everything is close, but there are items in every element that is being discussed.""
Guajardo said that once bilateral U.S.-Mexican issues were resolved, Canada could rejoin the talks to work on tri-lateral issues. He said this could take place in ""the next few days or weeks."" 
Industry officials also said the U.S. team had barely moved from its demands last May of a 75 percent overall regional content threshold with 40-45 percent content from high-wage zones -- effectively the United States and Canada -- with the only substantial change a slightly longer phase-in time.
The automotive officials said that Mexico had sought reassurances that new content rules would not cause losses of existing facilities or jobs in the sector and that a NAFTA deal would make Mexico immune to any automotive tariff Trump imposes on national security grounds.
But the U.S. side was sticking to a hard stance in the final stretch of the year-old NAFTA talks, trying to extract concessions as another late August deadline for a deal approaches, one industry representative said. 
The issues the two countries are hammering out include what percentage of auto industry components need to be made in North America to avoid tariffs, and how many cars and trucks need to be made in factories paying higher wages.

The U.S.-Mexico talks for a reworked North American Free Trade Agreement resumed three weeks ago, without Canada, after negotiations involving all three members of the $1.2 trillion trade bloc stalled in May.
 
"
143,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 09:23PM ET</span>",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them:
1/TESTING THE TAPER TANTRUM
Five years ago, the so-called Taper Tantrum sent investors fleeing emerging markets. Since then, the sector seems to have built resilience to the kind of rolling selloffs that racked them in past decades, when a crisis in one country fueled domino-effect selling across the developing world. Now, the rout in Turkey's lira is testing that resilience.
The lira has suffered its biggest weekly loss since Turkey's own 2001 financial and banking crisis; without major action from authorities, it may tank further.
Then, there is Russia's rouble which is at fresh two-year lows after more U.S. sanctions were imposed. And the rest of the emerging market complex appears finally to be cracking. In reality,
Turkey's woes should not directly affect the economy of, say, Mexico. But fund managers hit by losses on Turkish holdings will be looking to recoup the money by selling other emerging assets in their portfolios. The second channel is the dollar which may soar if investors sell assets denominated in the rouble or the peso. So unless the lira bleeding is staunched, torrid times may be ahead for emerging markets.
2/BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO
Some divorces are amicable, others not so much. Britain's long, drawn-out split from the EU, whatever the protagonists say publicly, is getting messier. The risk is it gets ugly. That's how currency traders are playing it now, slamming the pound to its lowest in over a year against the dollar (below $1.28) and almost a year against the euro (now above 90p).
Futures market positioning and options pricing show bets on further weakness as the probability of a no-deal, or hard Brexit rises. But is sterling on a one-way road south, or is the doom and gloom overdone? The Bank of England struck an upbeat tone when it raised rates this month, Q2 GDP growth was a reasonable 0.4 percent, and outgoing BoE hawk Ian McCafferty reckons wage growth may hit 4 percent next year. Plus, hard Brexit is in neither side's interest, so some sort of deal will be struck.
Maybe so, but the FX market's outlook right now is definitely glass half empty. On next week's horizon, traders will be able to get their teeth into the latest snapshots of UK inflation, employment and wages, and retail sales. These may determine whether sterling carries on falling toward $1.25, or recovers to $1.30.
3/LOSING APPETITE
Over the past decade, Japan and China have jockeyed back and forth as the No. 1 and 2 foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries. But their appetite for U.S. debt has slackened notably from their peaks during the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing era, however, and Japan's holdings have been edging ever closer to dropping below the $1 trillion mark for the first time since Sept. 2011.
Whether that milestone was breached in June will be revealed next week, when the United States delivers its Treasury International Capital System (TICS) report on foreigners' holdings of government debt.
Data this week from Japan's Ministry of Finance showed Japanese investors sold U.S. bonds again in June, to the tune of $4.09 billion amid expectations of steady interest rate hikes from the Fed.
4/ZERO HOUR
Close on the heels of this week's foreign exchange reserves data from China, come next week's numbers on whether state banks purchased dollars in July - as they did in June and May.
That data is important because markets are trying to figure out why Chinese reserves rose last month, despite a trade war and a yuan fall to 14-month lows. State banks have carried on buying dollars, suggesting the economy isn't seeing the sort of capital flight that accompanied currency weakness bouts in 2016 and early-2017.
But the yuan is a whisker away from 7-per-dollar, the level China defended in 2015-2016 by selling a trillion dollars. So can markets expect a hard stop as the 7-mark approaches? Will that mean state-run banks will sell the dollars borrowed via swaps? Or is the line in the sand determined by the trade-weighted yuan basket? That is pretty close to the 92-mark, the level economists deem sufficiently weak to support growth and exports.
5/STOCK TRADE
Results-day stock moves have been unusually sharp both in Europe and the United States this season, a telltale sign of investor anxiety in an ageing bull market despite buoyant earnings.
European stocks had their biggest swings in 15 years after results, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts found, while U.S. stocks moved an average of 3.9 percent.
Why the rise in volatility? Earnings, on the face of it, have been very strong.
Year-on-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 this quarter stands at 25 percent, more than double the still-strong 12 percent managed by MSCI Europe companies. Analysts are rapidly revising up global earnings estimates.
But sales figures are beginning to show pressure on companies' margins from tariffs, fuelling fear that rising protectionism could bring a late-cycle market to its knees.
Companies have downplayed the impact of trade war, but vulnerable sectors - such as European luxury, capital goods and carmakers - have been especially volatile.

""Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman,"" Trump said on Twitter.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",China says business ties with Iran no harm to any other country,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's business and energy ties with Iran do not harm the interests of any other country, the country's Foreign Ministry said, after U.S. President Donald Trump said companies doing business with Iran would be barred from the United States.
China has already defended its commercial relations with Iran as open and transparent as U.S. sanctions on Iran took effect despite pleas from Washington's allies.
In a statement released late on Friday, China's foreign ministry reiterated its opposition to unilateral sanctions and ""long-armed jurisdiction"".
""For a long time, China and Iran have had open, transparent and normal commercial cooperation in the fields of business, trade and energy, which is reasonable, fair and lawful,"" it said.
""This does not violate United Nations Security Council resolutions or China's promised international obligations, nor does it harm the interests of any other country, and should be respected and protected,"" the ministry added.
Using sanctions at the slightest pretext or to threaten anyone won't resolve the problem, it said.
""Only dialogue and negotiations are the true path to resolving the issue,"" the ministry added.
China, Iran's top oil customer, buys roughly 650,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Tehran, or 7 percent of China's total crude oil imports. At current market rates, the imports are worth some $15 billion a year.
State energy firms CNPC and Sinopec have invested billions of dollars in key Iranian oil fields such as Yadavaran and North Azadegan and have been sending oil to China.
European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the nuclear deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out.
But that has proven difficult, and European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business.
Few American companies do much business in Iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington's ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japan's Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said on Friday he had had productive trade talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and that they planned to meet again in September.
He said both acknowledged the importance of expanding trade between the two nations.
""We agreed to seek ways to promote Japan-U.S. trade by working out gaps between the two nations and expand areas to cooperate based on shared understanding,"" Motegi told reporters after two days of talks in Washington.
""We will continue talks and proceed further at next meeting we plan to hold in September,"" he said.
He said the atmosphere of the meeting with Lighthizer was ""very good"" and ""energetic"".
Motegi also said he and Lighthizer exchanged views on individual trade areas but nothing had been decided.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office said in a statement that the two sides had ""frank discussions"" on their respective views about trade and investment, and achieved a better understanding of each other's positions. 
""Based on these discussions, both sides agreed to explore ways to fill the gap between their positions and to promote trade between the United States and Japan, and expand areas of cooperation based on common understanding,"" USTR said, adding that the next round of ""consultations"" would be held sometime in September.
The talks launched a round of what the two sides call ""free, fair and reciprocal"" negotiations. They fall within broader bilateral economic discussions led by Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.
U.S. President Donald Trump wants a bilateral free trade agreement but Tokyo is wary because such an agreement would boost pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture.
Japan went into the talks aiming to avert steep tariffs on its car exports threatened by Trump while fending off U.S. demands to engage in bilateral talks toward a bilateral free trade agreement. Trump has complained about Japan's $69 billion trade surplus with the United States, and the inability of American car makers to sell significant volumes in Japan.
But Trump's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into automotive imports could lead to tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars, including those from Japan, and has raised concerns that such a move would harm the Japanese, European and U.S. economies.

Japan also has urged Washington to return to the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership deal after Trump withdrew the United States from the trade pact last year.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Russia not expected to stand up for tanking rouble amid sanctions,"By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A threat of more U.S. sanctions has sent the rouble tumbling to its weakest since mid-2016 but authorities are not expected to leap the currency's defense after weathering a similar storm in April, analysts said.
The rouble crashed to 67.67 versus the dollar on Friday , losing more than 6 percent of its value in just one week, as the United States said it would impose fresh sanctions against Moscow.
The rouble's slide was akin to its drop in April when, also battered by sanctions from Washington, it lost 12 percent in just a few days. 
The lack of action by authorities back then is convincing market players now that they will not intervene this time either.
""When we think about what has happened in April, when sanctions were introduced and we saw a similar reaction in the rouble ... this is not a move in the rouble that would make policy makers extremely worried,"" said Tilmann Kolb, an emerging market analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management in London.
Liza Ermolenko, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in London, said that given the central bank refrained from intervening in the market in April, it is clear that a more sudden and deeper drop in the rouble would be required to make it step in now. 
The authorities have made few public comments on the latest falls, which started on Wednesday, when the U.S. State Department announced a new round of sanctions that pushed the rouble to two-year lows and sparked a wider sell-off over fears Russia was locked in a spiral of never-ending sanctions. 
On Friday the central bank said it had tools to prevent risks to financial stability, without specifying what they were.
The central bank, which last intervened in the market and raised rates to save the rouble from tanking in 2014, described the rouble's drop on news about more U.S. sanctions as natural reaction.
As in April, the central bank has reduced its daily buying of foreign currency for state reserves this week to lift extra pressure from the rouble, which has fallen by around 15 percent versus the dollar so far this year.
""Authorities do not set a goal of avoiding a rouble drop at the moment. That's why they won't do anything,"" said Pyotr Milovanov, currency trader at Metallinvestbank in Moscow.
Analysts say the other possible option to support the rouble would be a hike to the key interest rate, now at 7.25 percent, but this also seems to be off the table for now.
""At this stage we don't expect policymakers to resort to rate hikes,"" Ermolenko from Barclays said.
Kolb from UBS said he would ""expect a bigger reaction when if we got perhaps toward 70 (roubles per dollar) but this also depends on how we get there, if at all"".

""I wouldn't expect Russian policymakers to use their available tools to support the rouble at current levels,"" he said.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Emerging market contagion back with a vengeance as Turkey pops,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - The plunge in the Turkish lira has set off a wave of selling across emerging market assets, reviving the specter of contagion that has been the sector's Achilles heel for decades.
Although the ripple effects may not yet be of the scale of the financial firestorms of 1997-2000 or the global financial crash of 2008-2009, seemingly indiscriminate selling of emerging markets as far afield as South Africa, Russia and Mexico was clear this week as Turkey's crisis deepened.
There were hopes earlier this year that this sort of contagion had dissipated, with little spillover from a crisis in one country, such as Argentina or Brazil, to the wider asset class as whole.
But with the lira  diving 13 percent on Friday in its biggest one-day fall since the financial crisis, other currencies such as the South African rand  and Brazilian real  tumbled in its wake. It was the first real sign of intra-EM contagion since 2013's ""taper tantrum"", when the markets took fright at the prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve reducing its economic stimulus.
""It's the usual classic emerging markets story where people wake up, see bad news in one country and start selling everywhere,"" said Bart Turtelboom, chief executive at APQ Global. 
Emerging market currencies slide : https://tmsnrt.rs/2vzelu5
On the face of it, similar market dynamics to prior emerging market blowups are back at work again.
Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, said capital flows had been very large in the run up to the sell off, on a par with levels before the taper tantrum. In addition, late in the cycle, EM exposure builds up rapidly in a few places where good returns can still be had. 
As a result, asset managers are now trying to reduce risk where they can, especially in the more liquid markets such as Mexico and South Africa, to cover potential redemptions and limit any downside.
""You need the cash to perhaps plug the hole or the losses in other positions in which you are stuck, so that causes the spillover and triggers a chain reaction,"" said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.
Marc Ostwald, global strategist and chief economist at ADM Investor Services International Limited, added that the moves had been accentuated by poor liquidity: ""The door is very big when you want to go in, and it's a mousehole when you want to go out. The really big contagion effect happens when people have to sell good assets to cover losses on bad assets."" 
PERFECT STORM
So why now? Market participants say it's partly due to investors waking up to the high levels of dollar borrowing some emerging countries undertook during the easy money years - debt that needs to be serviced.
With the U.S. Federal Reserve tightening and the dollar strengthening (DXY), borrowing costs for emerging countries are rising. While Turkey may be the weakest link, it is by no means the only country dealing with an asset/liability mismatch.
Turkey, Argentina and Indonesia also sold off hard in May as investors fretted about rising U.S. yields, but both Argentina and Indonesia took decisive action to contain this by raising interest rates to steady their currencies.
Turkey also raised rates then, but its response this time has been to stand pat, with President Tayyip Erdogan seemingly wedded to unorthodox monetary policy and commanding greater influence over the economy since his re-election in June.
At such a vulnerable moment, the United States imposed sanctions on two of Turkey's ministers - a move that Edward Park, investment director at UK-based Brooks Macdonald, said had acted as a catalyst for the market. 
""U.S. sanctions are the straw that broke the camel's back,"" he said. ""This is a good example of a country that did relatively little to calm down the sanctions news and little to defend the currency. It's a perfect storm in terms of market reaction."" 
He pointed out that Turkey had tripled its U.S. dollar liabilities over the last 10 years, taking advantage of cheap money to refinance itself. 
Turkish banks' external assets and liabilities: https://tmsnrt.rs/2McsLts
""There's been a lot of negative sentiment around Turkey but people are thinking that Turkey is not alone ... and what could be the next country under fire because of its external debt liabilities?"" Park said.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that on average, EM near-term dollar funding needs were completely covered by reserves, meaning that the likelihood of U.S. dollar debt crises was extremely limited. 
Conversely, Turkey's funding needs were more like frontier markets, and in the same ballpark as the needs of Latin American economies in the 1980s and Asia in the 1990s, the bank added. 
BANKS SCRUTINIZED 
Higher U.S. sanctions on Turkish steel and aluminum exports announced by U.S. President Donald Trump later on Friday triggered a fresh wave of selling, with EM FX volatility gauges spiking. Russian markets have also felt the heat this week after another surprise sanctions move by Washington. 
The average yield spread of emerging market dollar bonds over safe haven U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) EMBI global diversified index <.JPMEGDR> widened to 353 basis points, a one-month high, while MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index fell 1.5 percent (MSCIEF).
Yet the sell off was not limited to emerging markets: Euro zone bank shares also tumbled on concerns about their exposure to Turkey, after media reports that the European Central Bank was increasingly concerned about some lenders.
Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) have some of the largest operations in Turkey among the euro zone banks.

Gregan Anderson, macroeconomic strategist at brokerage Bulltick, said exposure to Turkey could impact European banks' bottom lines ""and could have a domino effect throughout Europe as people begin to pull out of those banks and into the U.S. In that sense, the Turkey situation can be a contagion (trigger) not only in Europe but across emerging markets.""

149,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","PBOC Vows No ‘Strong’ Stimulus, Says Won't Use Yuan in Trade War","(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank said it won’t use the yuan as a tool to cope with trade tensions and other external issues, and that it won’t conduct any “strong” economic stimulus.
The People’s Bank of China won’t implement stimulus in “flood-irrigation” style, according to the quarterly monetary policy report released Friday night in Beijing. Prudent monetary policy should maintain neutrality and “keep balance between tightening and easing,” indicating a slightly easier bias than it did three months ago.
The central bank has been treading a very difficult path -- it’s responsible for cracking down on growing bad debt across the country, but also must make sure that companies can borrow money to invest and continue to drive growth. That task has been made more difficult by the trade war with the U.S. and an economy that’s already slowing down.
The bank said it will flexibly use a combination of multiple monetary policy tools and further enhance macro-prudential management of the economy. It will also improve financial services through increasing supply and competition, according to the report.
While the PBOC sees risks from rising trade tensions, financial volatility in emerging markets and global financial fragility, it said it would not competitively devalue the yuan, nor use it as a tool to cope with external shifts such as trade tensions.
Those currency comments show that the bank will take a hands-off approach to the foreign exchange market on normal days, but intervene in the event of any massive fluctuations, chief macroeconomy analyst Zhu Qibing at BOC International China Ltd. in Beijing said.
The task of achieving high-quality growth will be “arduous,” the bank said, striking a more concerned tone than in the report last quarter. And while the tightening of local financing and slowing infrastructure investment growth will weigh on the economy in the short-term, it will be beneficial in the longer run.

150,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 11:09AM ET</span>","On Istanbul streets, defiant Turks see U.S. hand behind lira crisis","By Ece Toksabay
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Serap, a 23-year-old clerk at a clothes store in central Istanbul, is sure of who to blame for the precipitous slide in Turkey's lira currency.
""This crisis is created by America,"" she said.
The lira has lost more than 35 percent against the dollar this year and hit a fresh low on Friday, its biggest one day fall since Turkey's 2001 financial crisis. 
Food, rents and fuel prices in Turkey have all surged. The state pipeline operator last week raised the price of natural gas for electricity production by 50 percent.
Serap's sentiments about the causes of the crisis are shared by many Turks and hint at why support for President Tayyip Erdogan, who won re-election in June with super-charged presidential powers, looks untouched, at least for now.
His loyal supporters see the currency sell-off as a U.S. attempt to undermine their country and president. 
""If they have their dollars, we have our people, our God,"" Erdogan said in a speech overnight, casting the lira's slide as a campaign against the nation.
The comments dominated Turkey's overwhelmingly pro-government media on Friday. Newspapers and TV stations have cast the lira crisis as a political assault, spiraling out of U.S. sanctions imposed on two Turkish ministers last week in a row over the detention of a U.S. evangelical pastor, Andrew Brunson.
""They issued a scandalous decision last week about our ministers,"" said Serap, the store clerk. She didn't know exactly what steps Washington had taken against Turkey, but said her country would not be pushed around.
""It's not so easy to make us bow down to their demands.""
Opposition newspaper Sozcu this week showed Brunson, still under house arrest in western Turkey, launching a $100 note folded up as a paper plane.
The lira sell-off, driven by fears about Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and Turkey's worsening relations with the United States, has sent tremors through global emerging markets and dominated international financial headlines. 
But the Turkish media has largely ignored the crisis, aside from covering Erdogan's comments. 
""The newspapers didn't even report the natural gas and electricity price raises,"" said Veysel, an Istanbul taxi driver. He said he learns about the slumping lira and steep fuel price rises when he fills up his tank or quizzes his passengers, rather than from the media.
For a graphic on emerging market currencies slide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2vzelu5
""AMERICAN"" CRISIS
Relations between Ankara and Washington have collapsed over the last year.
Further U.S. measures are expected if the two NATO allies fail to resolve the Brunson dispute, as well as wider differences over issues including U.S. sanctions on Iran and Ankara's plans to buy a Russian missile defense system.
Erdogan has bitterly chastised the United States for failing to extradite a U.S.-based cleric Ankara blames for a failed 2016 coup, supporting a Kurdish militia in northern Syria which Turkey says is a terrorist organization, and for demanding its allies comply with U.S. sanctions on Iran. 
""They are ruling the world on their own,"" said Yilmaz Cakarli, a trader in Istanbul. ""Somebody must find a solution and say 'stop' to the United States.""
That defiance echoes the world view of Turkey's president, who has overseen rapid growth during his 15 years in power. Turkey has become one of the world's top 20 economies and witnessed massive infrastructure development, including new roads, bridges and hospitals under Erdogan.
But with inflation at a 14-year high and still rising, its most powerful leader since Ataturk has resisted the orthodox policy response of raising interest rates, which he once described as the ""mother and father of all evil"".
Last month the central bank left its policy rate unchanged, surprising economists who had predicted a significant hike. In the fortnight since, the lira has lost more ground.
""A STRONG TURKEY""
Some Turks lay blame closer to home. 
""They are taking all of us to the cliff-edge,"" said a 35-year-teacher, buying a phone charger in an Istanbul mall. She declined to be named for fear of being seen to criticize a president who brooks little dissent.
Erdogan's supporters see less cause for alarm. 
""The government knows what it's doing - the crisis rumors are creating false panic,"" said Ahmet, a 30-year-old selling newspapers and cigarettes at a kiosk in Istanbul.
""I think it's good the newspapers aren't making a big deal out of this. What good would it serve other than creating more panic? The government will do something when it's necessary.""
Levent, who owns a shop selling mobile phone accessories, said Turkey's standing in the world was more important than the lira, and fears of a currency collapse were overblown.
""The dollar has gone beyond 5 (lira), yes. But we didn't vote for the dollar, we voted for a strong Turkey,"" he said, referring to Erdogan's June election victory.

""Look - everyone has cars, there's busy 24-hour traffic in this city. Does this look like a city in crisis?""

151,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>","Hong Kong's Economy Slows as Trade War, Rates Squeeze Looms","(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong economic growth slowed in the second quarter, amid a deepening U.S.-China trade conflict and rising interest rates that are weighing on the outlook.
As a key trading hub for the flow of goods, services and capital between the world’s two biggest economies, Hong Kong is vulnerable to second-round effects as China and the U.S. impose tariffs on each other’s products.
While official forecasts show limited impact because the territory isn’t subject to U.S. tariffs on China due to the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, the worry is that volumes will decline as production and shipping get moved elsewhere in Asia to avoid getting hit by the new duties.
“Over 50 percent of trade in Hong Kong is related to Mainland China,” said Iris Pang, greater China economist at ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. “When China is in a trade war, Hong Kong’s trade, logistic and ports would be negatively affected.”
Even before those effects kick in, growth softened from the fastest expansion since 2011 in the first quarter. Gross domestic product grew 3.5 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the government, compared with a revised 4.6 percent in the first. Growth fell 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter. The government maintained its full-year forecast between 3 and 4 percent.
Growth Hit
“It remains to be seen how the escalation of trade conflicts between the U.S. and the mainland would affect the global economy and Hong Kong’s exports in the coming months,” Adolph Leung, deputy government economist, wrote in a press release. “The U.S. trade conflicts with the mainland, in particular, could weigh on global economic sentiment as well as trade and investment activities, possibly putting a damper on Hong Kong’s exports in the period ahead.”
If the tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are implemented, nearly half of Chinese goods re-exported to the U.S. via Hong Kong could be affected, Edward Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, said before the release. Still, all targeted items from both round of tariffs form only 3.5 percent of total 2017 exports.
The trade threat comes as the city’s port traffic is already in decline. Container throughput shrank throughout the first half of 2018 compared to 2017, amid fierce competition from Mainland China ports.
Indeed, Hong Kong’s port has lost its place as the fifth-largest container port to South Korea’s Busan this year. ""We do not see Hong Kong regaining its top five spot and expect Busan to extend the lead over Hong Kong as the year progresses,"" said Rahul Kapoor, a Singapore-based transportation and logistics analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Rates Squeeze
Hong Kong’s economy is feeling the squeeze from rising U.S. interest rates, with the Hong Kong dollar peg meaning the Chinese region imports U.S. monetary policy.  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc will raise mortgage rates starting Monday, following tightening of policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Still, there’s plenty of strength in the economy too, with retail sales still strong, albeit slowing, and unemployment at its lowest in 20 years. So barring a slump in the territory’s sky-high home prices, it looks like a moderation, not a growth slump, lies ahead.
""Growth is likely to be moderate somewhat in the coming quarters due to higher interest rates and trade wars,"" said Eddie Cheung, Asia foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong.

152,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Mortgage Investors Seek Higher Ground Before Fed's $1.7 Trillion Flood,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s wind down of its balance sheet has been handled without too much trouble by the mortgage sector to date -- but now comes the deluge.
As the Fed terminates the mortgage-backed security purchase program started a decade ago, the end to its buying should cause MBS supply from the central bank’s wind down to jump about 50 percent in the second half of this year compared to the first six months.
Private investors will need to take down about $90 billion from July through December, according to Walter Schmidt, the head of FTN Financial’s MBS strategist team.
The Fed has so far reduced its vast MBS holdings to $1.709 trillion, the lowest since 2014. It’s widely forecast that by October the central bank will no longer reinvest any proceeds back into mortgages, and that should widen spreads.
""We have seen year-to-date widening of 15 to 20 basis points on production coupon Treasury spreads and expect another 5 to 10 basis points by year end,"" according to Ankur Mehta, the head of MBS research at Citigroup.
The coming end to the Fed’s MBS purchases, used in the recent past to keep its holdings steady, will release about $150 billion into the market for this year in total. That is a material amount considering forecasts put aggregate net supply this year from normal sources, such as borrowers taking out home mortgages, at around $300 billion.
When the Fed’s balance sheet wind down is combined with that organic supply, the second half of the year may see as much as $270 billion compared with the net total of $170 billion in the first two quarters of 2018, Mehta said.
Helped in part by very low volatility, mortgage spreads haven’t widened too much despite the coming end of the Fed program, but next year may see as much as $195 billion flood the market.
""It’s a pretty large amount of supply for the private sector to have to absorb,"" said Matt Jozoff, head of JPMorgan’s securitized products, rates and municipal research. The spread widening year-to-date puts mortgages at a historically attractive levels, he said.
Still, some investors may wish to position their portfolios defensively for yet more weakness.
""To the extent that there is widening pressure on the basis that argues for being in shorter spread duration product, and we also like going up-in-coupon for the hedged-adjusted carry,"" he said.
The wind down has been well-telegraphed by the central bank, helping to dampen spread widening and hence any negative effect on mortgage rates for borrowers, despite the massive size of its holdings.
""The Fed built its portfolio during a time of crisis, they essentially were making it up as they went along. The unwind of the balance sheet, they hope, will be as exciting as watching paint dry,"" Schmidt said."
153,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",UK gilt curve gives another glimpse of 'no deal' Brexit nerves,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The risk of Britain crashing out of the European Union without a trade agreement has dragged sterling to its lowest in almost a year this week, and the prospect of a 'no deal' Brexit has also infected the UK government bond market in recent months.
One of the clearest financial market signals of future economic activity and growth is the 'yield curve' of government bonds, essentially the difference between short- and long-term market borrowing costs stretching years and even decades into the future. 
In a healthy, growing economy the further along the curve into the future you go, the higher yields will be to account for growth and higher inflation over time. 
When that yield curve flattens, however, it signals concern about future activity. It also tends to crimp lending by reducing banks' interest margins.
When the curve turns negative, or ""inverts"", it frequently presages full-blown recession.
For the UK in recent months, the gilt yield curve has flattened each time market there has been a rise in concern about a ""no-deal"" Brexit or tensions between Brussels and London. 
Bond investors, it would seem, agree with the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of England and some of the world's biggest banks and asset management firms that a ""hard Brexit"" will damage the economy's health. 
This week, for example, the gap between two- and 10-year yields on Gilts, as British government bonds are known, narrowed to 52 basis points from 58 points as UK trade minister Liam Fox spoke of up to a 60 percent chance of a no-deal Brexit. 
""The Gilt curve is reflecting the mess that the UK economy will be in both during the Brexit process and afterwards,"" said Mizuho's head of rates strategy Peter Chatwell.
UK gilt curve close to flattest in two years: https://reut.rs/2vy04xq
The 2-10 year Gilt curve has flattened from 78 basis points in early 2018 and from 95 points one year ago (GB2YT=RR) (GB10YT=RR).
And the way the flattening trend has progressed suggests the UK's prospects are increasingly being viewed through the prism of what kind of Brexit it can negotiate. 
For example, when British foreign minister Boris Johnson and the minister in charge of Brexit, David Davis, resigned in early July, clouding the outlook for London's negotiations with Brussels, the 2-10 curve flattened nine points in one week to 46 bps.
Apart from a brief period after the Brexit vote in June 2016, that was the flattest it had been since the 2008 financial crisis.
The curve then steepened again, until Fox spoke this week.
THE WORLD IS FLAT
To be sure, gilt movements are also part of a global phenomenon of flattening curves, a process led by the United States where the Federal Reserve has been steadily raising official interest rates. The U.S. 2-10 curve has flattened to around 30 bps  and looks increasingly likely to invert.
Curve inversion is a situation where short-dated borrowing costs are higher than longer-dated ones. Over the past 40 years, every instance of inversion of the U.S. Treasury curve has led to recession.
British records go back less far, but two out of the three times the Gilt curve inverted in the past two decades, the UK has fallen into recession. The third time witnessed a sharp slowdown in growth, although not a contraction. 
2 of 3 times, a recession has followed an inverted UK yield curve: https://reut.rs/2vB3Mq6
Chatwell of Mizuho reckons the UK curve is more likely to invert than its U.S. equivalent, even though the United States is much further down the economic and monetary policy cycle, having hiked rates seven times in the last five years to 1.75-2 percent.
The BOE's recent move to 0.75 percent was only its second rate hike in a decade.
Because of this, many believe Brexit, by clouding the UK's economic future, is a crucial influence on the curve. The BOE admitted as much after its meeting, flagging only one potential interest rate rise in each of the coming two years.
Andrey Kuznetsov, a fund manager at the $392 billion Hermes Investment Management, sees the Gilt curve flattening further, noting that while slowly rising interest rates nudge up two-year yields, ""rising uncertainty on the political front, both in the UK and abroad, is supporting demand for the 10-year point."" 
""Putting the two together, flattening will continue,"" he said.

White bread, white flour, cake flour, sanitary products, school uniforms and diapers should all be zero-rated, according to a report by a panel of experts released by the National Treasury Friday. That would provide tax relief of 2.8 billion rand for the poorest households, they said.
In February Former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced a one percentage-point increase in the VAT rate to 15 percent -- the first advance in 25 years -- to try to help plug a revenue shortfall of almost 50 billion rand. The National Treasury asked the panel to review the list to alleviate the effect of higher taxes on the poor.
Currently 19 food items including brown bread and eggs carry no VAT, while paraffin also doesn’t incur the tax. Zero-rating chicken, an important source of animal protein for many South Africans, would have cost 2.1 billion rand in foregone revenue, the panel said.
The recommendations will now be subject to public comment, the National Treasury said.
VAT is the second-biggest source of government income in South Africa. Finance MinisterNhlanhla Nene is scheduled to present the mid-term budget to lawmakers on Oct. 24."

“I have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar!” Trump proclaimed via his Twitter account, noting that the tariff on aluminum would now be 20% while the levy on steel would rise to 50%.
“Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!” he emphasized.
At 9:27 AM ET (13:27 GMT), USD/TRY jumped 17.85%, to 6.5404.
Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Turkey over the continued detention of pastor Andrew Brunson, whom Turkish officials accuse of terrorism for his part of the failed 2016 coup, and no progress was made as delegates from both NATO countries met in Washington this week.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan brushed off concerns on Thursday, saying it was just a campaign against Turkey.
Earlier on Friday, Erdogan urged Turks to exchange gold and hard currency into lira, framing the crisis as a ""national battle"" against economic enemies.
""If there is anyone who has dollars or gold under their pillows, they should go exchange it for liras at our banks. This is a national, domestic battle,"" he told a crowd in the northeastern city of Bayburt. ""This will be my people's response to those who have waged an economic war against us.""
Worries over Erdogan's influence on monetary policy along with its worsening U.S. relations have pummeled the Turkish currency, which has lost more than a third of its value this year and is down nearly 58% from a year ago.
The selloff has become a more widespread market panic on Friday that dragged down global stocks.
Concerns were particularly poignant due to the exposure of European banks to Turkey, but U.S. equities were also being hit by risk-off sentiment."

The ECB will revoke a so-called 'waiver' which allowed Greek banks to post junk-rated government bonds as collateral in regular funding operations, a well anticipated move that comes as Greece exits its third bailout programme within days.
Such an exemption could only be granted while a country is in a bailout programme, and the ECB has long said that the waiver would be revoked, much like in the case of Cyprus in 2016 when it exited its own bailout.
The loss of the waiver could force Greek banks to seek more Emergency Liquidity Assistance, a more expensive source of central bank funding, and would keep Greek papers ineligible for the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase programme.
Still, the end of the bailout is a major milestone and indicates that Greece is healthy enough to stand on its own feet, a confidence booster that could offset the added cost of more funding.
Greek banks borrow just over 8 billion from the ECB in longer-term refinancing operations and now need to post a new type of collateral to maintain their access. 
However, a source familiar with the process said that migration to ELA is expected to be modest and the ELA cap of 8.4 billion is not expected to be raised as a result.

While 10-year Greek bonds (GR10YT=RR) still yield over 4 percent, they are well off from levels above 10 percent before the bailout.

""Clearly that uncertainty is having a depressing effect on economic growth,"" Hammond told broadcasters during a trip to central England to announce 780 million pounds ($996 million)of public investment in high-tech industry.
Brexit proposals set out last month by Prime Minister Theresa May should lead to economic growth broadly the same as if Britain were to stay in the EU, he added.
Hammond said that in the long run he wanted to see growth rates faster than the year-on-year expansion of 1.3 percent recorded in the second quarter of 2018.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","Tariffs and sanctions turmoil may overshadow EU, German growth data","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. tariffs and sanctions policies are likely to keep investors on their toes in the coming week as European politicians and policymakers continue their summer break, while economic data from Germany and the euro zone will also be in focus.
Washington's latest sanctions on Russia have battered the rouble, and Turkey's lira has been hammered by concern that Ankara is sliding into a full-blown economic crisis.
U.S. President Donald Trump's determination to push ahead with sanctions on Tehran that also target foreign companies doing business with Iran has opened another battle front in addition to a much broader dispute over trade tariffs.
German business associations have warned that companies are increasingly suffering from Trump's sanctions policies - including those against Iran - as well as the tariffs he is imposing in an escalating tit-for-tat trade conflict with China.
""In terms of geopolitics, the trade war between the U.S. and China could enter center stage again next week,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""Also, keep an eye on Turkey, where some kind of IMF involvement is getting closer.""
Turkey's lira has plunged to record lows on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and increasingly authoritarian rule, and about a diplomatic rift with Washington over Ankara's detention of several Americans including an evangelical pastor.
On the data front, Germany on Tuesday will be the last of the large euro zone economies to publish an estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the quarterly growth rate to pick up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in the first quarter, suggesting that Europe's largest economy is humming along despite the uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs and sanctions.
RISING RISKS
Also on Tuesday, the euro zone will report its second estimate for GDP in April-June. Preliminary data last month showed economic growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed to 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter.
Eurostat's preliminary figures for euro zone growth have often been revised up in the past, but weaker-than-expected June industrial output data from Germany and Spain have suggested this may not be the case this time.
""An upward revision would change little in economic terms, but could bolster perceptions of stable growth despite rising risks,"" Oliver Rakau from Oxford Economics said.
The European Central Bank has said that risks to global growth are growing as the specter of protectionism and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs sap confidence.
Final inflation data for the euro zone due on Friday is likely to confirm that headline consumer price inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy.
The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below but close to 2 percent over the medium term.
""For the ECB all of this means that it can remain on track with its dovish tapering,"" ING's Brzeski said. ""The timing of a first rate hike, however, remains extremely uncertain.""
The ECB plans to wrap up its unprecedented 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program known as quantitative easing (QE) by the end of the year and keep interest rates at record lows through the summer of 2019.
Surveys suggest concerns over trade have already begun to dampen investment activity which could translate into meager growth and moderate inflation rates in the second half of the year.

""All of that should not alter the ECB's QE exit plans, but it will keep all of us busy speculating about the first rate hike,"" Rakau from Oxford Economics said.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 06:02AM ET</span>","Turkey's Erdogan dismisses lira fears, says 'we have our God'","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed concerns over the tumbling lira, calling on Turks to ""have no worries"", after the currency hit record lows in recent weeks on the back of a widening rift with the United States.
Ankara and Washington, NATO allies, have been at loggerheads over the detention in Turkey of U.S. evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges, prompting U.S. sanctions on two of Erdogan's ministers and threats of trade restrictions.
Early on Friday, the lira  hit a new record low, plunging to as far as 6 against the U.S. dollar after a Turkish delegation returned from talks in Washington on Thursday with no apparent solutions to an ongoing crisis.
Speaking to supporters in the Black Sea province of Rize late on Thursday, Erdogan brushed off concerns over the currency as campaigns against Turkey.
""There are various campaigns being carried out. Don't heed them,"" Erdogan said.
""Don't forget, if they have their dollars, we have our people, our God. We are working hard. Look at what we were 16 years ago and look at us now,"" he said.
The recent sell-off in the lira has been fueled by investor concerns over Erdogan's grip on monetary policy under a new powerful executive presidency and the ongoing row with the United States.
Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"", wants banks to lend cheap credit to fuel growth, but investors fear the economy is overheating and could be due for a hard landing.
They are also concerned over the central bank's ability to rein in persistent double-digit inflation with the president repeatedly calling for lower rates.
Last week, Erdogan called on citizens to convert their hard currency and gold into lira in order to prop up the plunging currency with a ""domestic and national stance"".

The unorthodox approach of the president, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than 15 years, has unnerved investors who have voiced concerns over Turkey's authoritarian trajectory under Erdogan.

1. Turkish lira hits fresh record low on political turmoil
Political turmoil continued to pull the Turkish lira down on Friday, hitting new record lows against the dollar as souring relations with the U.S. saw no signs of reaching a resolution. At 5:53 AM (9:53 GMT), USD/TRY jumped 6.72%, to 5.9216.
U.S. President Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Turkey over the continued detention of pastor Andrew Brunson, whom Turkish officials accuse of terrorism for his part of the failed 2016 coup, and no progress was made as delegates from both NATO countries met in Washington this week.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan brushed off concerns on Thursday, saying it was just a campaign against Turkey.
Erdogan and his newly appointed finance minister and son-in-law Berat Albayrak are due to speak at 7:00 AM ET (11:00 AM ET). It was announced on Thursday that Albayrak would present a ""new economic model"".
In other emerging markets currency, the Russian ruble continued its decline, hitting fresh two year lows, after the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions against the Kremlin for its alleged part in poisoning a former British spy and his daughter in the UK. At 5:54 AM (9:54 GMT), USD/RUB gained 0.25% to 66.8558.
2. Stocks head lower as Turkey’s woes dampen risk appetite
U.S. futures pointed to a lower open amid risk off sentiment in global markets, while market participants await the latest inflation data to be released on Friday. At 5:55 AM ET (9:55 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures fell 103 points, or 0.40%, S&P 500 futures lost 13 points, or 0.45%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 37 points, or 0.49%.
European shares also fell on Friday as worries over a dramatic fall in the Turkish lira jolted financial markets amid concerns of the region’s banks’ exposure to upheaval in Turkey.
Asian stocks closed mostly lower on Friday as global investors opted to fell risk assets while they also continued to assess the impact of the latest tit-for-tat in the trade war between the U.S. and China.
China’s Shanghai Composite index managed to eke out meager gains after recording amid rampant volatility. The index had recorded seven straight swings of 1% or more, the longest stretch since Chinese markets crashed in 2015.
3. Inflation expected to keep Fed on track for 2 rate hikes
Investors will get a look at some more inflation numbers before many hit the road to get a jump on the weekend, with the data expected to support the case for the Federal Reserve to hike rates twice more this year.
The consumer price index (CPI) comes out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) Friday.
Economists expect that the CPI rose 0.2% in July, compared with June, and the year-over-year gain will be 3%. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% month on month. The year-on-year core CPI gain is expected to be  2.3%.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged last week, as expected, characterizing the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December.
4. Dollar hits 13-month high
Global trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty sent traders fleeing to safe haven currencies, with the dollar hitting a 13-month peak and the yen also gaining across the board.
Investors have been paying close attention to increasing trade tensions with the latest news focusing on U.S. sanctions on Moscow, while Washington is also fueling the political feud with Turkey.
At 5:56 AM ET (9:56 GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, gained 0.43% at 95.87, just off an intraday high of 96.03, its strongest level since July 2017.
The yen benefitted from its own safe haven status, allowing it to make headway against generalized strength in the greenback. USD/JPY was last down 0.14% to 110.92.
5. Oil cautious after IEA warning on sanctions against Iran
Oil prices held around the unchanged mark in early morning trade on Friday as the International Energy Agency warned that the recent cooling in the market may not last.
""The recent cooling down of the market, with short-term supply tensions easing, currently lower prices, and lower demand growth might not last,"" the Paris-based agency said in its monthly report.
IEA warned that upcoming oil sanctions against Iran could bring turmoil to the market later in the year. U.S. sanctions targeting Iranian oil is expected in early November and could increase the potential of a global energy supply shortage.
Many countries, including Europe, China and Russia, oppose the sanction, but the White House wants other countries to stop buying oil from Iran.
""As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,"" the IEA said.
U.S. production will also be on markets’ radar as Baker Hughes releases its weekly data later on Friday.
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by 2 to 859 last week, providing some relief over escalating output stateside.
U.S. crude oil futures slipped 0.04% to $66.78 by 6:01 AM ET (10:01 GMT), while Brent oil edged forward 0.10% to $72.14."

The ECB, which declined to comment on the FT report, is said to be chiefly concerned about BBVA (MC:BBVA), UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). They have among the largest operations in Turkey, although their local subsidiaries' contribution to the overall balance sheet is relatively modest. 
The Turkish lira has resumed its prolonged slide as a rift between Turkey and the United States widens and concerns grow about President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy under a powerful new executive presidency.

A supervisory review by the ECB does not yet see the issue as critical but it is concerned that borrowers may not be hedged against the lira's weakness, a worry since foreign currency loans make up about 40 percent of the Turkish banking sector’s assets, the FT said.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 05:18AM ET</span>",Italy should scrap balanced budget clause in constitution: Di Maio,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Italy should scrap a clause in its constitution obliging it to run a balanced budget, deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said, adding that the government was not yet working on the matter.
""I think that in future it should be canceled,"" Di Maio said in a television interview on Thursday evening.
Di Maio said scrapping the clause was in the ""contract"" drawn up by the ruling coalition made up of his 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League before it took office in June.
He said the government was now concentrating on keeping its pledges to provide a minimum income for the poor, cut taxes and reform the pension system to make it possible to retire earlier.
Financial markets are worried the government's spending plans will push up Italy's debt, the highest in the euro zone after that of bailed-out Greece, and yields on Italian bonds have been rising in recent weeks in volatile trading.
Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose sharply early on Friday before recovering partially, as uncertainty surrounding the 2019 budget talks and turbulent world markets prompted investors to dump the euro zone's riskier assets.
The balanced budget constitutional amendment was approved by parliament in April 2012 during the euro zone debt crisis, under the government led by Mario Monti. 
It had been presented the previous year by Monti's predecessor Silvio Berlusconi in an effort to calm financial markets as Italy's borrowing costs increased.
The clause came into effect from 2014 but since then Italy has never achieved a balanced budget and parliament has voted to make a temporary exception each year to approve the governments' spending plans.
The new 5-Star/League administration says the best way to bring down public debt is by investing more to boost economic growth, rather than trying to balance the budget each year.
The government contract said the balanced budget rule needed changing because it ""makes it impossible to adopt effective anti-cyclical policies.""
However, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday the government had no plan to scrap the balanced budget clause. 
""It's there and it's staying there,"" he said when asked about the issue at a news conference.
La Repubblica daily reported on Friday the government planned to target a budget deficit in 2019 of 1.7 percent of gross domestic product, comfortably inside the EU's 3 percent ceiling but double the current 0.8 percent goal.
The prime minister's office said the target for 2019 had not yet been set and that it was too early to speculate on what it might be.

The government is due to update its economic targets in September before drawing up the 2019 budget and submitting it to the European Commission for approval the following month.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top newspaper rebutted growing criticism in government circles that Beijing should have taken a lower profile to head off its trade war with the United States, saying on Friday that, like an elephant, China cannot hide its size and strength.
The growing trade conflict is causing rifts within China's Communist Party, with some critics saying that an overly nationalistic Chinese stance may have hardened the U.S. position, sources close to the government have said.
The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily took direct aim at those it said were naysayers in an unusually public rebuttal to a debate that has been happening largely behind closed doors in policy-making circles in China.
While condemnation of the White House has come at home and abroad, there are those who have spread ""specious"" views on the internet, it said in a lengthy commentary.
""One of these puts the blame on China, saying that 'China's strategy is too confident and high profile, incurring a one-two punch from the United States',"" it said.
""Another of these criticizes China saying that it shouldn't strike back,"" the paper said. ""The meaning is - as long as China caves in, the United States will raise its hand high in mercy, and the Sino-U.S. trade war won't happen.""
However, it was absolutely not the case that China brought this upon itself, the commentary said.
History showed that the United States had always gone after countries, such as the former Soviet Union, Britain or Japan, that were perceived as threatening its global dominance. That had brought China into the firing line with its enormous and growing economy, the People's Daily said.
""After more than a century of hard work, China has returned to the center of the world stage, and this is the basic fact we must observe in the China-U.S. trade friction,"" the paper wrote.
""Such a large size, such a heavy thing, can't be hidden by 'being low key', just like an elephant can't hide behind a sapling,"" it said.
China said this week it would slap additional 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports in retaliation against levies on Chinese goods imposed by the United States.
The move was the latest round in escalating tit-for-tat trade tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump aiming to pressure Beijing into making concessions. 
The People's Daily said Beijing was emerging as an ""unprecedented opponent"" for the United States.
""No matter what China does, in the eyes of the United States, China's development has already 'damaged the supremacy of the United States',"" it wrote. 
""Against this kind of 'opponent', the United States must adopt two methods - first, use the opponent to encourage itself and exhort mass political support for 'making America great again', and second, curb the opponent's supremacy at every level,"" it said.
Rising trade tension with the United States has however become the biggest threat to the stability of the Chinese economy, Wang Yiming, deputy director of the State Council Development Research Center, wrote in a separate column in the People's Daily on Friday.
With trade headwinds underway, Wang called for a slew of measures to stabilize exports, including improving a state tax subsidy policy that provides tax incentives for Chinese companies to increase their exports, as well as stepping up funding support for Chinese exporters.
China on Wednesday revamped a national leadership group charged with planning and studying its key technological development strategies, sending domestic technology shares higher as investors took it as a sign of policy boost for the sector.

More assistance for China's tech sector would mark the latest in a series of growth-boosting measures being rolled out by Beijing as an escalating trade war with the United States puts more pressure on China's already slowing economy.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",S&P settles landmark derivatives-rating lawsuit in Australia,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on Friday it has settled a lawsuit in Australia over claims by pension funds and local governments that the credit rating firm had overlooked risks when awarding high ratings to opaque investments that imploded in the global financial crisis.
Australia's Federal Court approved the settlement on Thursday, S&P said in an emailed statement which did not disclose the settlement sum or terms.
""S&P Global is pleased to reach a settlement on the class action lawsuit, the last of the significant litigation pertaining to our previous ratings actions on collateralised debt obligations,"" it said.
The U.S.-based ratings agency was sued for at least A$190 million ($140 million) by two local governments and two pension funds in Australia, which lost money on synthetic collateralized debt obligations (SCDOs) rated by S&P when the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis hit a decade ago.
Settling the class action suit, funded by Singapore-based Litigation Capital Partners, likely protects S&P from suits from other investors because legal avenues have now lapsed.
A spokesman for the plaintiffs said the settlement was confidential.
Litigation Capital Partners' Australian representative had no comment on Thursday, nor did the councils and pension funds when contacted by Reuters.
During the case, lawyers for the local councils accused S&P of weakening its risk assessment criteria to win business and turn out high ratings on opaque debt products. S&P said it designed and assigned ratings in accordance with well-recognized international practice and Australian regulations.
In the decade since the global financial crisis, S&P has settled lawsuits in the U.S. over its ratings of CDOs, the products blamed for spreading market turmoil around the world.
A finding of wrongdoing against the agency in Australia could have re-opened legal avenues, since lapsed due to the statute of limitations, to pursue S&P over its role in investment losses incurred during the financial crisis.
S&P and other rating agencies have long faced criticism from investors, politicians and regulators for assigning high ratings to securities that quickly turned sour. Criticism specifically focuses on the fact they are paid by issuers for ratings, raising concern about potential conflicts of interest.
The investments that found their way into Australia were designed by U.S. investment banks, transferring risk in those products from Wall Street to local councils that would typically invest their spare cash in bank and government bonds.

In an interview with Guardian, published Thursday, McCafferty said pay could accelerate at a pace not seen since the financial crisis due to labor shortages. On rates, he said there was a need for another two hikes in the next 18 months to two years. The official, who has long been considered one the Monetary Policy Committee’s most hawkish members, is due to leave the central bank this month.
McCafferty said that wage growth might “might creep up towards 4 percent-ish” in 2019, from below 3 percent currently and more than the 3.25 percent forecast by the BOE. He added that the worker shortfall was now moving from skilled occupations into unskilled sectors.
“The labor market has shown significant signs of tightening in recent months,” he said. “Surveys and other measures are pointing to labor shortages as a constraint on output growth.”
Policy makers raised rates to 0.75 percent last week, the second increase in the space of the year. In both cases, McCafferty voted for a rate hike before his colleagues.
“I don’t think we have left it too late,” he said. “But once you think a rate increase is appropriate you shouldn’t dally with the first one.”

168,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",Make-or-Break Moment Arrives for Australia Energy Crisis Fix,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is facing a crucial test for his bid to fix Australia’s muddled energy policies, which have saddled the nation with sketchy power supplies and spiraling prices.
Energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, will attempt Friday in Sydney to win over his counterparts from the nation’s eight states and territories for his so-called National Energy Guarantee. Their agreement is necessary to move forward with the plan -- still thin on details -- that promises cheaper and more reliable power while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Turnbull’s Liberal-National government has to win over states run by the main opposition Labor party, which are seeking greater commitments to reduce carbon emissions. And even if he succeeds, passage of the legislation through parliament may still fail as some lawmakers in his coalition lobby for more coal-fired power. The price of failure for Turnbull could be high -- his government trails in opinion polls ahead of a national election due by May.
Though one of the world’s biggest sources of coal and natural gas, Australia has struggled to keep its own energy house in order amid a decade of political dysfunction and policy misfires. Consumers and manufacturers have been hit with higher energy prices as aging coal-fired power plants shut without a clear, and lower-carbon, way forward to replace that lost capacity.
To read about the political squabbling that left Australia’s energy system adrift, click here.
Turnbull is striving to engineer a plan that will deliver affordable and reliable energy, as well as reducing emissions, without subsidies, taxes, emissions-trading schemes or carbon prices. He also aims to encourage development of all types of power sources and provide the clarity investors want before committing to new projects.
“Business needs certainty, the confidence and the clear policy direction to make the necessary investments,” Richard Lancaster, the chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based CLP Holdings Ltd., the parent of EnergyAustralia, said in an interview Tuesday. “If we can get a strong consensus and a clear agreed plan, that gives business the confidence to invest.”
Road Ahead
The NEG may lead to a reduction in residential bills of about A$120 ($89) a year between 2020 and 2030, Australia’s department of the environment and energy has said.
There are two key parts to the plan: a reliability guarantee and an emissions guarantee, according to an Energy Security Board formed to provide advice to the states and territories on the NEG.
The market operator will provide a 10-year forecast on whether electricity supplies will be reliable, while retailers who don’t meet their obligations will face penalties. Retailers must also meet emissions targets based on Australia’s international obligations.
Turnbull claims he’s “agnostic” on the sources of new energy generation so long as they allow Australia to reach its Paris Agreement commitment of cutting emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The former banker says he needs approval from all states and territories for the NEG for it to work efficiently.
“Australian eyes are on this room today,” Frydenberg said at the start of the meeting in Sydney. “What happens here matters to the outcomes around every Australian kitchen table and every Australian factory floor.”
Should the government win support for the plan on Friday, Turnbull will seek approval from his federal lawmakers on Tuesday for legislation to enact the NEG. For it to become law, his government needs the support of rival lawmakers in the upper house, where it lacks a majority.
Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she won’t make a decision on the NEG until she sees the legislation, which is unlikely to happen until Tuesday at the earliest. Meanwhile, Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews had said his government won’t support the NEG in its current form because it doesn’t do enough to tackle pollution.
Lawmakers in Turnbull’s own coalition may also prove obstacles. They include former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has said Australia should abandon its Paris commitments and has threatened to vote against the NEG legislation.
“Turnbull has a bit of a minefield to walk to get this plan through,” said Paul Williams, a political analyst at Brisbane’s Griffith University. “Rising energy costs go right to the heart of voters’ concerns about cost-of-living pressures, so they won’t be in a forgiving mood should his signature policy to ensure cuts to electricity prices falls short.”

169,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Control immigration, but keep workers coming: UK employers","By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's leading employers' group said on Friday it accepted that Prime Minister Theresa May would need to impose controls on EU citizens working in the UK after Brexit, but new immigration rules must not stop companies from hiring the staff they need.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) -- which has angered Brexit supporters with its pro-EU views -- acknowledged the concerns many voters have about immigration.
""We accept freedom of movement is over. We accept there needs to be an element of control,"" said Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general. ""But we are absolutely clear that immigration delivers huge economic value to the UK, so it needs to be open.""
With the government working on its post-Brexit immigration policies, the CBI said in a report that a careful balance had to be struck.
It said compulsory registration of EU citizens who enter the UK - which has not been required until now - would be an important step toward establishing firmer control of immigration and raising public trust that the issue was in hand.
""Registering EU nationals allows the UK to ensure that they are contributing to the economy and society if they want to stay for a longer period of time. The UK will need a way to ensure that only EU nationals that are contributing stay in the longer-term,"" the report said.
It acknowledged the difficulty and sensitivity of achieving that goal, but said ""ensuring that everyone who comes to the UK is contributing is an important part of ending free movement as it has operated to date"".
At the same time, local workers should be prioritized for jobs when unemployment in specific professions rose above a certain level.
In response to the report, the government said it was considering a range of options to control its borders while continuing to attract and retain workers who benefit Britain.
The CBI said the world's fifth-biggest economy would still need migrants from the EU and beyond after it leaves the bloc in March.
Half of London's construction workers are not from Britain and more than one in four employees in banking and finance in the capital are non-UK citizens -- 17 percent from the EU and 11 percent from the rest of the world, it said.
A quarter of staff, or 113,000 people, who work in warehouses in Britain are EU nationals.
There are already signs that Brexit has put workers off coming to the country -- in the 12 months to March this year, only 805 EU nurses and midwives registered to work in the health service, down sharply from 6,382 a year earlier, the report said.
The government had to change the often hostile debate about migration which most economists say has been positive, so far, for the economy and public finances, the CBI said. 
""In these febrile times, it's vital that a policy of such importance for the UK's future living standards can be discussed without ideology or an oversimplification of public attitudes,"" Hardie said.
The CBI said migration had to be part of future trade talks with countries around the world to help open up new markets.
That would mean an overhaul of Britain's complex visa system for non-EU workers.
The government should drop its target of cutting net migration below 100,000 people a year -- which it has repeatedly missed -- and replace it with a system that ensures migrant workers contribute to the economy, the CBI said.

The government said in its response to the CBI report that it was committed to bringing net migration down to ""tens of thousands"".

170,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Australia's Central Bank Chief Says the Unspeakable,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Talk about a failure of forward guidance.
Australia's population hit 25 million this week, three decades sooner than the government had forecast. Sure, it's not much compared with the size of some Asian cities and the American states of California and Texas, but this population boom has had a huge effect on the economy and life in cities, where most Australians reside. Contrary to popular imagery, the country is one of the most urbanized on the planet.
The bulk of the transformation can be attributed to immigration. Few politicians or business leaders will say so. When they visit London or New York, they tirelessly – sometimes tiresomely – trumpet 27 years of economic expansion. Most of the credit is showered on China, minerals and the stimulus deployed in 2008-2009. No mention of the 25,000,000th Australian.
Except at the Reserve Bank of Australia. Don't let two years of unchanged interest rates deceive you into thinking RBA officials have nodded off. Governor Philip Lowe was unequivocal this week in praise of population growth, including immigration. Here's one huge forecasting error that's being embraced.
Perhaps it's something that only Lowe can do: He's still in the early stages of his seven-year term, and the central bank is revered in Australia. Lawmakers responsible for immigration are reluctant to go there in advance of next year's national elections. They are too vulnerable to dog whistles from the right (yes, Australia has that, too).
Hours after the national headcount hit 25 million, Lowe devoted most of a speech in Sydney to demographics. Monetary policy had to wait for the final two pages of a 17-page address. He was careful to acknowledge concerns that infrastructure, transportation and housing hadn't always kept up, but the message was clear: Population growth, largely attributed to immigration, has been a big plus for the economy.
Immigration has allowed the workforce to be replenished, helped address skills shortages and lifted the overall standards of education. People living in Australia born overseas are more likely to have attended college, and the country benefits from stronger overseas connections when foreign students return home, especially to places like China and India. People under the age of 35 account for more than three-quarters of net overseas migration, Lowe said, a tonic for the nation's graying population. Australia will stay younger and more productive than many other countries.
Oh, for more people like Lowe.
Few political leaders in any country seem willing to extoll the economic case for immigration. Lowe's powerful speech suggests that our national debates need more unelected bureaucrats who can proclaim what the political class is afraid to say.
It's hard to see Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell being as forthright. Perhaps Powell will yet choose his moment. He's still new to the job. But his congressional testimonies have a ""stay in our lane"" quality to them. He doesn't want to make the Fed any more of a target than it is now. Fair enough.
The Reserve Bank of Australia, however, is almost untouchable, largely because Australia's economic success has given the central bank god-like status. If there is a deep recession, more scrutiny will come and the RBA will have to adapt to that. Until then, Lowe is doing a real public service."
171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Make-or-Break Moment Arrives for Australia's Energy Crisis Fix,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is facing a crucial test for his bid to fix Australia’s muddled energy policies, which have saddled the nation with sketchy power supplies and spiraling prices.
Energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, will attempt Friday in Sydney to win over his counterparts from the nation’s eight states and territories for his so-called National Energy Guarantee. Their agreement is necessary to move forward with the plan -- still thin on details -- that promises cheaper and more reliable power while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Turnbull’s Liberal-National government has to win over states run by his main Labor opposition, which are seeking greater commitments to reduce carbon emissions. And even if he succeeds, passage of the legislation through parliament may still fail as some lawmakers in his coalition lobby for more coal-fired power. The price of failure for Turnbull could be high -- his government trails in opinion polls ahead of a national election due by May.
Though one of the world’s biggest sources of coal and natural gas, Australia has struggled to keep its own energy house in order amid a decade of political dysfunction and policy misfires. Consumers and manufacturers have been hit with higher energy prices as aging coal-fired power plants shut without a clear, and lower-carbon, way forward to replace that lost capacity.
To read about the political squabbling that left Australia’s energy system adrift, click here.
Turnbull is striving to engineer a plan that will deliver affordable and reliable energy, as well as reducing emissions, without subsidies, taxes, emissions-trading schemes or carbon prices. He also aims to encourage development of all types of power sources and provide the clarity investors want before committing to new projects.
“Business needs certainty, the confidence and the clear policy direction to make the necessary investments,” Richard Lancaster, the chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based CLP Holdings Ltd., the parent of EnergyAustralia, said in an interview Tuesday. “If we can get a strong consensus and a clear agreed plan, that gives business the confidence to invest.”
Road Ahead
The NEG may lead to a reduction in residential bills of about A$120 ($89) a year over the 2020 to 2030 period, Australia’s department of the environment and energy has said, citing the Energy Security Board.
The board, formed in August to provide advice to the states and territories on the NEG, listed in April eight key steps to maintain reliable electricity supply. The measures include the provision of a 10-year forecast from the Australian Energy Market Operator on whether the reliability standard will be met, along will recommendations on compliance and penalties.
Should it be implemented, the reliability section of the NEG will start in 2019 and the emissions component will commence in 2020, succeeding the Renewable Energy Target, according to the Clean Energy Council.
Turnbull claims he’s “agnostic” on the sources of new energy generation so long as they allows Australia to reach its Paris Agreement commitment of cutting emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The former banker says he needs approval from all states and territories for the NEG for it to work efficiently.
Should that happen on Friday, Turnbull will use a meeting of his federal lawmakers on Tuesday to urge their approval for legislation to enact the NEG. For it to become law, his government would then need to win support of rival lawmakers to pass the legislation in the upper house, where it lacks a majority.
Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she won’t make a decision on the NEG until she sees the legislation, which is unlikely to happen until Tuesday at the earliest. Meanwhile, Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews had said his government won’t support the NEG in its current form because it doesn’t do enough to tackle pollution.
Lawmakers in Turnbull’s own coalition may also prove obstacles. They include former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has said Australia should abandon its Paris commitments and has threatened to vote against the NEG legislation.
“Turnbull has a bit of a minefield to walk to get this plan through,” said Paul Williams, a political analyst at Brisbane’s Griffith University. “Rising energy costs go right to the heart of voters’ concerns about cost-of-living pressures, so they won’t be in a forgiving mood should his signature policy to ensure cuts to electricity prices falls short.”

172,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",AMLO Changes Course on Mexican Security After Record Bloodshed,"(Bloomberg) -- Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico last month by a landslide, plans to use that mandate to chart a new course to addressing the nationwide surge in violent crime over the past decade.
Known as AMLO, the 64-year-old president elect is proposing a simple yet radical departure from his predecessors’ crime-fighting policies. Rather than wage a war on crime, his administration will seek to reduce violent crime by attacking its roots, which he’s identified as poverty, corruption and impunity.
Skeptics may see it as naïve, but Mexicans are tired of record levels of bloodshed and the response to his crime and security agenda from an audience of crime victims’ families this week suggests they’re open to a new approach.
Speaking in Ciudad Juarez -- where 26 people were killed in one 24-hour period last week -- he told his listeners that he’ll focus on job growth and economic opportunities for young Mexicans to keep them from turning to crime. He also pledged to make the criminal justice system more flexible -- including the possibility of an amnesty program -- with the aim of rebuilding civil society. By the time he had finished his remarks, six more people were killed in the city of roughly 1.3 million on the U.S.-Mexico border.
""You cannot confront violence with violence. We won’t forget, but we will forgive,"" said Lopez Obrador Tuesday afternoon as he launched what he’s called a public peace-building forum, an idea he advocated for during his presidential campaign.
Lopez Obrador is taking office during the most violent era in Mexico’s modern history -- total murders in 2017 were the highest on record reaching more than 31,000, and 2018 will likely be worse given a 16 percent increase in the homicide rate in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
The spike in violence isn’t recent though. Then-President Felipe Calderon launched a military offensive against organized crime in 2006 with the objective of capturing drug lords such as Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. For more than a decade, the military confronted cartel armies and captured kingpins, splintering criminal organizations as violence surged. From 2006 to 2017, there were an estimated 235,000 homicides in Mexico, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography.
""AMLO recognizes that the past security strategy has completely failed,"" said Eduardo Arcos, a Mexico-focused associate analyst at Control Risks. ""The country is increasingly violent after two six-year terms,"" he said, referring to Calderon and outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto, who continued Calderon’s anti-crime policies and strengthened the military’s role in law enforcement.

""This is good indication of change in the security approach, but we’re missing details on concrete mechanisms,"" Arcos said.
Lopez Obrador faces high expectations from his electorate to make Mexico safer. In a survey from July 23, 65 percent of participants said they expected security to improve under AMLO, according to Mexico City-based political analysis firm, Consulta Mitofsky.
Lopez Obrador says he will pivot from heavy-handed military confrontation to socioeconomic policies to provide economic opportunities for youth while rooting out corruption. Alejandro Hope, a Mexico City-based security consultant, sees Lopez Obrador’s ideas as being on the right track for long-term improvement, though they would do little to reduce violence in the short term.
""The country is tired of the violence,"" Hope said. ""But a transitional justice approach is judicially complicated and politically explosive -- I don’t know if they’ve calibrated that cost,"" Hope said.
‘Mandate of Security’
The evolution of the violence epidemic in Mexico has ensnared Mexican cities that were once buzzing with tourism like Acapulco, and industrial centers like Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Tabasco, which are linchpins of the energy industry. Up-and-coming states like Puebla and Guanajuato have been victimized by oil-pipeline robberies, and thieves, known as ‘huachicoleros,’ have boldly taken to blockading highways leading to the capital. Other types of crime such as extortion, human trafficking and human smuggling have proliferated.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, has almost four months to flesh out his security agenda, but the peace forum directly responds to the outcry from his base. As civilian casualties rise, civil society organizations like Mexico United Against Delinquency have emerged to assist victims of organized crime by building a bridge to the state institutions that have some power to redress victims and their families.
Bloomberg Economics Primer: Mexico’s Downside Risks Intensify
According to Lisa Sanchez, the Director of Mexico United Against Delinquency, the forum on national pacification could work, but it should be accompanied with clear reforms on judicial governance, which would put more emphasis on investigation rather than confrontation.
“Politicians often generalize the violence, calling it ‘isolated cases’,"" Sanchez said. ""Victims want to be recognized, and they want the state to comply with their mandate of security, which is central to Lopez Obrador’s promise of combating corruption.""
On Wednesday afternoon, Lopez Obrador was back in Mexico City, to officially accept the title president-elect. In a televised speech, he highlighted the importance of reducing corruption and impunity once in office.
""Our objective is to reformulate the security policy that is almost exclusively based on the use of force,"" Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech.

The companies had faced investor concerns about the Puerto Rican government’s record bankruptcy, and about a difficult recovery after hurricanes struck the island last year.
By mid-day, MBIA jumped as much as 11% to the highest intraday since January 2017, and Ambac gained as much as 12% to its highest since March 2017, while Assured Guaranty rose as much as 5.5% to the since last September.
""We would expect a very positive reaction"" from MBIA’s shares ""given its concentrated exposure, though Assured Guaranty should see a positive reaction as well given the agreement can serve as a blueprint for future settlements on other Puerto Rico exposures,"" KBW analyst Bose George writes in a note.
MBIA has about $700 million of par exposure to senior Cofina bonds, MKM analyst Harry Fong wrote in a note. While the proposed Cofina settlement may result in a small loss for the insurer, ""we think certainty is better than uncertainty,"" Fong said.
Resolving Puerto Rico’s debt situation ""is a significant positive development"" for Ambac, Fong wrote in a separate note. That insurer, with Cofinas accounting for about $805 million of its total Puerto Rico exposure of about $2.0 billion, has also likely reserved enough for an expected loss. “The small loss was acceptable over a long court battle where the outcome included significant uncertainty,” Fong said. Ambac may start to explore options beyond bond insurance once its Puerto Rico issues are settled, he added.
Separately, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer called the Cofina deal, with 93% recovery for senior bondholders, a ""huge win"" for Ambac.
But the gain in equities pales before gains in fixed income. Puerto Rico bonds soared as much as 30 percent after the settlement was announced. Five-year credit default swaps tied to MBIA debt tightened 58.1 basis points to 324.2 basis points at 2:15 in New York, according to data provider CMA. That’s the biggest decline since July 2017.
On MBIA’s earlier conference call, CEO William Fallon said the company insures approximately $1.2 billion of accreted value of Cofina senior bonds. “While there are many steps required to confirm the Cofina settlement, a December confirmation date has been targeted,” Fallon said, adding that MBIA doesn’t anticipate any material change up or down to the reserves as of its filing on Wednesday.
On Ambac’s earlier second-quarter conference call, CEO Claude LeBlanc declined to comment about the Cofina deal ""because of the confidential nature of mediation,"" and because ""the in-house transaction is subject to final terms as support in separate definitive written agreements.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister on Thursday said his team was working hard to strike a deal with the United States on new rules for the auto industry, which could pave the way for Canada to rejoin talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The U.S.-Mexico NAFTA talks resumed three weeks ago, without Canada at the table, after negotiations involving all three members of one of the world's largest trade blocs stalled in June. 
After a second day of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said talks were ""advancing"" but that it was not clear how long it would take to settle U.S.-Mexico issues before Canada would come back to talks. 
""We keep working, we are advancing and progressing with various issues, this morning we covered a good number of them,"" Guajardo said.
Mexico and Washington have been discussing rules for the automotive sector, which has been a major point of contention between the two countries.
The United States has sought tougher rules on what percentage of a vehicle's components need to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs, as well as demanding that a certain number of cars and trucks be made in factories paying at least $16 an hour.
Asked about the discussion on autos on his way out of Lighthizer's office, Guajardo said ""we are doing our best to do it as fast as possible,"" adding that he would remain in Washington on Friday.
Before entering the meeting with Lighthizer, Guajardo was asked by reporters whether Canada would take part next week in the talks, and he said ""possibly.""
""But we have to make sure that the U.S.-Mexico bilaterals (are) done,"" he said.
Guajardo was accompanied on Thursday by Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's pick for chief NAFTA negotiator, Jesus Seade.
Asked if talks would conclude this week, Seade said: ""We are advancing well, but there are a lot of things to review ... It is not clear if we will finish this week or the next.""
A U.S.-proposed so-called sunset clause that would kill a NAFTA deal unless it is renegotiated every five years has been another major stumbling block in the talks. 

Guajardo said negotiators were leaving some issues for last and that the sunset clause, which was ""highly complex,"" had not yet been touched.

The U.S. and Mexico, which have been in bilateral negotiations for about three weeks, appear to be “getting close” to agreement over auto manufacturing, David MacNaughton, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., said in an interview.
“If they can resolve their differences on that, then I think we can move ahead and have the three of us talk about some of the other issues that affect all of us,” MacNaughton said on BNN Bloomberg television Thursday.
While a quick, three-way Nafta deal is still possible if all nations show flexibility, Canada still opposes U.S. proposals for a sunset clause on the agreement and still wants an independent dispute-resolution process, he said.
Negotiators for the U.S. and Mexico are pushing for a deal on regional content requirements for car production and a list of other contentious issues. Canada hasn’t been at the negotiating table in the past weeks, as the U.S. and Mexico have focused talks largely on their proposals for toughening auto content rules.
When asked Thursday whether negotiations next week would include Canada, Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said, “hopefully” once the U.S. and Mexico advance their talks."
176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Evans Says Fed May Need Higher Rates to Restrict Economic Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates to “somewhat restrictive” levels over the next couple of years to combat the effects of recent fiscal stimulus on the U.S. economy, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said.
“If inflation continues to be on the order of 2, 2.2 (percent) -- I’m not expecting it to get as high as 2.5 -- that suggests only a modest amount of restrictiveness above our neutral rate might be called for in 2020,” Evans told reporters Thursday in Chicago.
“It would not surprise me at all if we make a judgment to move to a somewhat restrictive setting,” he said, citing roughly half a percentage point above his 2.75 percent estimate of the neutral level of the federal funds rate.
For Evans, who has long been considered one of the most dovish officials at the U.S. central bank, the view that restrictive policy may be appropriate in the coming years marks a shift in his thinking. As recently as December, he dissented against rate increases on the grounds that inflation expectations were too low and may prevent inflation from rising to the Fed’s 2 percent target.
Now, given the boost to economic growth that tax cuts and government spending increases passed by U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are expected to bring, Evans is more confident in the inflation outlook. A U.S. inflation gauge watched closely by central bankers, based on the prices of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, was 1.9 percent in June, up from 1.6 percent a year earlier.
Underlying Inflation
“I do think that the underlying inflation expectations that sort of underpin the current inflationary environment are a little bit lower than I would like to see,” Evans said. “Given the data -- economy being strong -- I think inflation expectations are going to catch up.”
Evans sees a need for restrictive interest-rate policy in the coming years because he expects unemployment to fall to around 3.5 percent by the end of 2020. It was 3.9 percent in July. The Chicago Fed’s estimate of the so-called natural rate of unemployment -- the rate that policy makers believe would be sustainable in the long run without causing inflation to rise -- is 4.3 percent.
But he cautioned that uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment is very large, as much as “two percentage points on either side.”
The tariffs recently imposed on Chinese imports by the Trump administration seem to be “adding some uncertainty, but it’s uncertainty at a time where the economy is doing very strongly, and the labor market continues to improve,” so it makes sense to continue raising interest rates, he said.
Trump recently criticized the Fed’s rate increases, saying he doesn’t “like all of this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up.”
When asked about Trump’s comments, Evans said he wasn’t concerned.
“I take a lot of confidence from the way that the Federal Reserve system has been designed by Congress and the president, that we have a certain amount of independence, that we’re allowed to undertake our best decision-making,"" he said.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Fed's Evans sees one or two more rate hikes in 2018 as reasonable,"By Howard Schneider
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is performing ""very well"" with continued growth clearing the way for one or two more interest rate hikes in 2018, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Thursday in an interview in which he dismissed earlier worries about weak inflation.
""It could be one or two more,"" following rate increases in April and June, said Evans, who as recently as December dissented against a Fed policy-setting committee decision to raise rates.
He said the economy's ""extremely strong"" performance has made him confident now that inflation will stay near or even move slightly above the Fed's 2 percent target, while unemployment remains low and GDP growth continues in a range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent at least through next year.
""It is really a very good period of time for the economy and the setting of monetary policy,"" Evans said in the interview at the Chicago Fed's downtown headquarters, adding that the U.S. central bank was in a position to move rates slowly higher without evidence yet that it is either restraining growth and employment or risking a takeoff in price increases.
In a policy statement last week, the Fed characterized the economy as ""strong,"" enforcing market expectations for rate hikes in September and December - despite recent criticism from President Donald Trump that higher rates could undermine his policies.
Evans is not a voter this year on the rate-setting committee but he has been a steady voice against raising rates too high, too quickly, until it was clear inflation would meet the Fed's goal. Doing so, he said, would risk curbing some business hiring and spending decisions at a time when the employment scars of the 2007-2009 recession were still healing. 
Now, ""inflation has moved up to 2 percent essentially. There is good reason to expect we will stay in that area,"" neither slipping back as some policymakers have feared, or accelerating in a way that would force the Fed to raise rates more quickly, Evans said.
TRADE UNCERTAINTY 
Evans said debate will intensify next year about a stopping point as the Fed feels its way toward a ""neutral"" interest rate that is neither encouraging or discouraging spending and investment decisions, and weighs whether inflation risks have become so great that it needs to move even higher and actually restrain businesses and households. 
But for now, he said the Fed's current plans seem well-aligned with where the economy is heading. Its employment and inflation goals are essentially met, and there are no imminent risks that appear likely to throw things off course. 
""Labor markets are good. Household balance sheets seem like they are fine. Businesses are optimistic ... The global economic environment seems to be really quite good,"" Evans said.
Even the global trade dispute, which raises the specter of rising tariffs and disrupted world supply chains, has yet to become a big enough problem to change that rosy outlook.
Evans said the trade issue had added an element of uncertainty that may delay some business investment, but added that it was being offset by corporate enthusiasm over tax cuts and deregulation, and the Trump administration's new spending.
""You size up the tariffs, the increases in input costs ... and you find that while it sounds like a big number ... the actual effect on industry output and GDP is still measured in a few tenths"" of a percentage point, Evans said.
""The magnitude still seems to be relatively small, uncertain, against a context where the economy is very strong and we have just added quite a lot of fiscal stimulus."" 

""Are there a few headwinds? Yeah. But it feels more like tailwinds.""

That was slightly slower than the 4.4 percent pace calculated by the regional Fed's forecast program on Aug. 3. 
The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model pared its estimate on inventory investment growth to gross domestic product in the third quarter to 1.91 percentage points from 1.95 points.
The U.S. Commerce Department said earlier on Thursday domestic wholesale inventories had notched up 0.1 percent in June instead of holding unchanged as it originally reported.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said U.S. producer prices were unchanged in July for the first time in seven months. Analysts polled by Reuters had projected a 0.2 percent increase from June.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German companies are increasingly suffering from U.S. President Donald Trump's policy of sanctions - including those against Iran - and the tariffs he is pursuing in an escalating trade war with China, business associations said on Thursday.
Washington said on Wednesday it would also impose fresh sanctions on Russia by the end of August after it determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, something the Kremlin denies.
""Of course the U.S. policies are impacting German foreign trade,"" Holger Bingmann, head of the BGA trade association, told Reuters. ""Individual companies are grinding their teeth and are severely affected.""
Volker Treier, foreign trade chief at the DIHK Chambers of Commerce, said the international environment was becoming increasingly complex for German businesses.
Treier said many of Germany's trading partners were affected by the U.S. measures and their effects, which was in turn hurting business with German companies. Exports were not faring as well as last year, he added.
He said DIHK's forecast that German exports would increase by 5 percent this year ""seems increasingly ambitious"".
Bingmann and Treier were reacting to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia but also to punitive measures against Iran and reciprocal tariffs and trade threats by the U.S. and China.
The United States will impose tariffs on another $16 billion of imports from Aug. 23 and China plans to slap additional tariffs of 25 percent on the same amount of U.S. imports ranging from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment.
On Wednesday China and Germany defended their business ties with Iran in the face of Trump's warning that any companies trading with the Islamic Republic would be barred from the United States.
""It's simply unacceptable that U.S. laws are being enforced outside U.S. territory,"" Bingmann said. 
He urged the German government to provide details on how it would protect German firms after the latest U.S. sanctions against Iran, adding that if Berlin did not do that, German firms would gradually cease doing business there.
On Monday German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany, France and Britain were determined to protect European companies engaged in business with Iran using an updated version of the EU's so-called Blocking Statute, which bans any EU company from complying with U.S. sanctions.

Bingmann said German trade with customers in other countries was doing well overall but that was largely due to good business in the EU.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 10:36AM ET</span>","Russia denounces new U.S. sanctions as illegal, mulls retaliation","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia condemned a new round of U.S. sanctions as illegal on Thursday and said it had begun working on retaliatory measures after news of the curbs pushed the rouble to two-year lows over fears Moscow was locked in a spiral of never-ending sanctions.
Moscow has been trying with mixed success to improve battered U.S.-Russia ties since Donald Trump won the White House in 2016, and Russia's political elite was quick to chalk up a summit last month between Trump and Vladimir Putin as a victory. 
But initial triumphalism swiftly turned sour as anger over what some U.S. lawmakers saw as an over deferential performance by Trump and his failure to confront Putin over Moscow's alleged meddling in U.S. politics galvanized a new sanctions push.
Having bet heavily on improving ties with Washington via Trump, Moscow now finds that Trump is under mounting pressure from U.S. lawmakers to show he is tough on Russia ahead of mid-term elections. 
In the latest broadside, the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday it would impose fresh sanctions by the month's end after determining that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain, something Moscow denies.
The Kremlin said the sanctions were illegal and unfriendly and that the U.S. move was at odds with the ""constructive atmosphere"" of Trump and Putin's encounter in Helsinki.
Moscow would start to work on retaliatory measures ""in the same spirit"" as any U.S. restrictions, the Foreign Ministry said. 
The new sanctions come in two tranches. The first, which targets U.S. exports of sensitive national-security related goods, comes with deep exemptions and many of the items it covers have already been banned by previous restrictions.
The second tranche, which can be selectively activated after 90 days if Moscow fails to provide ""reliable assurances"" it will no longer use chemical weapons and blocks on-site inspections, is potentially more serious.
According to the law, it could include downgrading diplomatic relations, suspending national flag carrier Aeroflot's ability to fly to the United States and cutting off nearly all exports and imports.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow had not yet received any official U.S. request to open up sites once linked to chemical weapons for inspection.
The State Department's announcement fueled already worsening investor sentiment about the possible impact of more sanctions on Russian assets and the rouble at one point slid by over 1 percent against the dollar, hitting a two-year low, before recouping some of its losses. 
The U.S. move also triggered a sell-off in Russian government bonds and the dollar-denominated RTS index fell to its lowest since April 11. 
""There is local panic on the currency market,"" BCS Brokerage said in a note. ""At times, the number of those who want to ditch the rouble is becoming so high so there is not enough liquidity.""
Despite the steep drop in the rouble, the central bank was not expected to intervene. It let the rouble float freely in 2014 after unsuccessfully burning through substantial foreign currency reserves in a doomed effort to defend it. 
The Finance Ministry said on Thursday there was no threat to financial stability, a statement markets interpreted as a signal Moscow had no immediate plans to channel any of its $458 billion worth of reserves into propping up the rouble.
ILLEGAL
The Kremlin said the new sanctions were ""illegal and do not correspond to international law.""
""...Such decisions taken by the American side are absolutely unfriendly and can hardly be somehow associated with the constructive - not simple but constructive - atmosphere that there was at the last meeting of the two presidents,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Washington had become an unpredictable player on the international stage, Peskov added, saying ""anything could be expected"" from it and that it was important that Russia's financial system, which he described as stable, was prepared.
Peskov criticized the U.S. decision to link the sanctions to the British nerve agent case, an incident the Kremlin has long cast as a Western plot to damage its reputation and provide a pretext for more sanctions. 
Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March after a liquid form of the Novichok type of nerve agent was applied to his home's front door.
European countries and the United States expelled 100 Russian diplomats after the attack, in the strongest action by Trump against Russia since he came to office.
Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and a former colonel in the Russian army, said the State Department's move looked like the latest salvo in what he called a hybrid war. 
""Sanctions are the U.S. weapon of choice,"" Trenin wrote on Twitter. 
""They are not an instrument, but the policy itself. Russia will have to brace for more to come over the next several years, prepare for the worst and push back where it can.""
At variance with Moscow over Ukraine and Syria, Western sanctions have already drastically reduced Western involvement in Russian energy and commodities projects, including large scale financing and exploration of hard-to-recover and deep water resources.

Legislation introduced last week in draft form by Republican and Democratic senators, dubbed ""the sanctions bill from hell"" by one of its sponsors, calls for sanctions to be widened to include virtually all Russian energy projects and to effectively bar Western companies from any involvement in the country.

As the World Trade Organization's head warned that global trade was threatened, its quarterly outlook indicator - a composite of seven forward-looking indices - dipped to 100.3 from the 101.8 predicted in May for the second quarter.
That signaled ""an easing of trade growth in the coming months in line with medium-term trends,"" it said on Thursday.
The latest figures for export orders and cars were 97.2 and 98.1 respectively. Trump has already imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from major U.S. trade partners and signaled that vehicles are likely to be next. 
To try to persuade China to change its economic model and reduce the U.S. trade deficit, Washington last week proposed a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, Beijing proposed retaliating with tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods. 
""Global trade is under threat. Whether or not you call the current situation a trade war, certainly the first shots have been fired,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo wrote in an opinion piece published by several newspapers on Thursday.
""The situation is extremely serious. Reciprocal trade restrictions cannot be the new normal. A continued escalation would risk a major economic impact... hitting the poorest hardest.""

182,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Turkey Reduces Government Borrowing Target Amid Market Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey said it would borrow less than originally planned to narrow the budget gap in the medium term, leading the embattled lira to trim losses.
The domestic debt rollover ratio will be 104 percent at the end of the year, down from an earlier forecast of 110 percent, the Treasury and Finance Ministry said in a written statement. Lower spending and increased revenues will bag the government around 35 billion liras ($6.5 billion) during the rest of the year, helping the budget to run a surplus of around 5 billion liras when payments on interest are excluded.
The statement is the first from top policy makers on measures to fix the economy’s vulnerabilities since the most recent market rout was triggered by last week’s U.S. sanctions. The penalties on two ministers in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government were imposed over Turkey’s continued detention of an American pastor.
Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak will elaborate on details of his new economic program in a briefing on Friday.

The lira erased some of its losses within minutes of the statement. It had weakened 1.9 percent to 5.3811 per dollar at 1:21 p.m. in Istanbul. The currency lost about 9 percent since the U.S. sanctions were announced.

183,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 05:35AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Thursday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, August 9:
1. U.S., Japan Hold First Bilateral Trade Talks
While markets are still on edge over the brewing trade war between the United States and China, traders expect today's main event to take place in Washington, where Japan will enter talks seeking to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a bilateral free trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed in April to set up a new framework to discuss ""free, fair and reciprocal"" trade that will be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.
Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. may be a potential target for Trump's trade policies.
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the U.S. and its major trading partners having an impact on global economic growth.
China on Wednesday imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods, in retaliation to planned extra duties from the U.S. on Chinese products set to be enforced from August 23.
2. Sanctions Rock Currency Markets
Sharp movements in currency markets were in focus, as investors reacted to fresh U.S. sanctions on Russia for its role in the poisoning of a former security agent in the U.K. as well as an ongoing U.S.-Turkey human rights dispute.
The Russian rouble retreated to its lowest since November 2016, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65 per dollar threshold, after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions on Moscow over the Kremlin's alleged involvement in the poising of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal with the chemical agent Novichok earlier this year in the rural English town of Salisbury.
According to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, the sanctions will go into effect on or around August 22.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira touched a fresh record low against the dollar, weakening more than 3% after a Turkish delegation met U.S. officials to try to resolve disputes between the two NATO allies as part of an ongoing spat over the arrest of evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson.
President Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Turkey over the continued detention of Brunson, whom Turkish officials accuse of terrorism for his part of the failed 2016 coup.
3. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Flat Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a muted open, as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings, while continuing to monitor global trade and geopolitical tensions.
At 5:35AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up just 4 points, or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 futures and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures also indicated a flat start to their respective trading sessions.
Stocks closed mixed on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq managed to notch its longest winning streak since March, as shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose to a record-high.
Elsewhere, in Europe, the region's major bourses were mostly lower in mid-morning trade, with almost every sector in the red. Germany's DAX was the worst performer, slipping 0.6%.
Earlier, in Asia, stocks in the region closed mostly higher, as a rally in Chinese stocks helped offset the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war.
Shanghai blue chips climbed 2.7% amid talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, just the latest in a series of growth boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens.
4. Media Earnings In Focus 
Dozens of companies are expected to release earnings today in one of the last big waves of the earnings season.
Most of the focus will fall on Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) - the parent company of MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount - which reports ahead of the opening bell.
Analysts on Wall Street expect earnings per share of $1.07 on revenue of $3.27 billion.
The company has been touting its turnaround effort for months, and will likely focus on that during the post-earnings conference call. But investors will also keep a close ear on anything CEO Bob Bakish might say about its corporate cousin, CBS (NYSE:CBS).
CBS chief Les Moonves faces accusations of sexual harassment, casting his future in doubt.
And after hours,  News Corp.  (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Tronc (NASDAQ:TRNC) will report earnings.
Other high-profile names reporting Thursday include, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS), Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD),  Universal Display  (NASDAQ:OLED), Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT), and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH).



Wall Street has reached the tail end of the latest corporate earnings season. Nearly 90% of S&P 500 companies have released their calendar second-quarter results. Of those companies, around 77% have reported better-than-forecast quarterly profits, according to FactSet.
5. PPI Data Ahead
Today's calendar will bring investors the July data on producer prices at 8:30AM ET. The data is expected to show prices rose 3.4% over the prior year, as signs of inflation pressures building in the economy continue to add up.
Also on the calendar are initial jobless claims at 8:30AM ET. Economists expect just a slight rise in weekly first-time claims from the week before.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was a shade higher at 95.10.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices were little changed, with the benchmark 10-year yield standing at 2.96%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note holding at around 2.67%.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Turkey's lira sell-off: What's a central bank to do?,"By Nevzat Devranoglu and Tuvan Gumrukcu
ANKARA (Reuters) - Concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and worsening relations with the United States have sent Turkey's lira  into free-fall.
It has lost more than a quarter of its value against the dollar this year, with the sell-off deepening even after the central bank hiked rates at an emergency meeting in May. The crisis has raised concerns about the impact on banks, corporate debt and the broader economy.
Here are some scenarios on how the central bank could react.
1/TALK IT UP
One of the easiest, and ultimately least effective, options. Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya or Finance Minister Berat Albayrak could attempt to calm the markets via public commentary.
While the tactic is often used by policymakers in times of turmoil, economists said any attempt to talk up the lira would give it a short-term boost at best.
""This is going to require more than verbal intervention,"" said William Jackson of Capital Economics.
2/KEEP QUIET AND CARRY ON
Policymakers could try and hang on until the central bank's next monetary policy meeting on Sept. 13. But if the last few days are anything to go by, that would mean a lot more pain for the lira, and further erosion of the bank's credibility in the eyes of investors. 
Tellingly, both Erdogan and Albayrak, his son-in-law, have remained quiet in recent days. That is in sharp contrast to Erdogan's usual defiant stance in the face of lira sell-offs. 
The president, who has described interest rates as the ""mother and father of all evil"", has previously cast lira selling as an attempt by the West to bring Turkey to its knees -- rhetoric that has not helped mollify investors. 
3/LOOSEN UP 
All banks are required to hold a portion of their lira and foreign currency deposits as reserves. The central bank can loosen those requirements, thereby freeing up foreign exchange liquidity. This could reduce lira volatility by ensuring there is enough, or excess, liquidity in the market.
The bank tried this during May's sell-off, providing some $10 billion worth of liquidity, although it was ultimately forced to hike interest rates by a dramatic 300 basis points anyway.
It tried the same tactic on Monday, freeing up some $2.2 billion. The move seems to have backfired, with economists saying it strengthened the perception that the central bank lacks independence.
""The lira plunged as markets got the impression that the central bank has problems hiking rates,"" well-known Turkish economist Mahfi Egilmez said on Twitter. ""It would have been better if they did not change the reserve requirements at all.""
Like verbal intervention, this tactic would generally be deployed in the run-up to a rate hike.
4/HEFTY HIKE, STRONG MESSAGE
This is the best-case scenario for investors, and would go a long way to putting a floor under the battered lira. The central bank would deliver a substantial rate hike, along with a message that it was independent and able to keep rates high for an extended period to tackle inflation.
Investors are probably looking for a real interest rate of 5-10 percent, Capital Economics' Jackson said, meaning that with inflation now at nearly 16 percent they would need to see interest rates of more than 20 percent. The benchmark repo rate  is now at 17.75 percent.
But the size of the hike would be ""less important than what accompanies it,"" he said, adding ""you want to see that interest rates are going to remain high for a very long time"".
The central bank has stated it will maintain a tight monetary policy stance ""for a long time"", and not hesitate to deliver additional tightening if required.
In its latest inflation report it signaled that the impact of the lira's depreciation on inflation could necessitate a tighter monetary policy stance ""for longer"".
5/IT'S COMPLICATED (AGAIN)
The bank could return to its complex system of using multiple rates to set policy, keeping the benchmark steady while funding again through its late liquidity window, at a higher rate. This is seen as an unlikely option, as it would roll back the recently completed return to a single rate. It might provide a brief reprieve but would undermine market confidence in the longer term.
6/SELLING DOLLARS
This is the least likely option given the central bank's low forex reserves -- it has around $21 billion it could use to buy lira. Including all reserve requirements and government accounts, it has $100 billion.
The central bank has said that direct intervention is no longer a valid policy option in global central banking. Like other central banks in emerging markets, it prefers to use swaps or non-deliverable forward-like forex liquidity measures that don't directly decrease its net reserves.
7/CAPITAL CONTROLS

Both politicians and the central bank have clearly said such an option is not on the table. Capital controls would undermine investor confidence in Turkey, once seen as a star emerging market.

""Downside risks to the global economy have intensified amid actions and threats regarding trade tariff increases by the United States and possible retaliation by the affected countries,"" the ECB said in an assessment, which is largely consistent with its view in its July 26 policy statement.
The ECB added that if all the threatened measures were to be implemented, the average U.S. tariff rate would rise to levels not seen in the last 50 years.
At its meeting two weeks ago, the ECB kept policy unchanged, staying on course to end a 2.6 trillion-euro ($3.01 trillion)bond purchase scheme by the close of the year and to raise rates for the first time since the euro zone debt crisis in the autumn of 2019.
It added that even as external risks are mounting, domestic growth appears to be robust and near-term indicators point to a solid and broad-based expansion.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>",Handling of U.S. trade dispute causes rift in Chinese leadership: sources,"By Ben Blanchard and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - A growing trade war with the United States is causing rifts within China's Communist Party, with some critics saying that an overly nationalistic Chinese stance may have hardened the U.S. position, according to four sources close to the government.
President Xi Jinping still has a firm grip on power, but an unusual surge of criticism about economic policy and how the government has handled the trade war has revealed rare cracks in the ruling Communist Party.
A backlash is being felt at the highest levels of the government, possibly hitting a close aide to Xi, his ideology chief and strategist Wang Huning, according to two sources familiar with discussions in leadership circles. 
A prominent and influential academic whose views have found favor in some party quarters has also come under attack for his strident views on Chinese power.
Wang, who was the architect of the ""China Dream"", Xi's vision for China to become a strong and prosperous nation, has been taken to task by the Chinese leader for crafting an excessively nationalistic image for the country, which has only provoked the United States, the sources said.
""He's in trouble for mishandling the propaganda and hyping up China too much,"" said one of the sources, who has ties to China's leadership and propaganda system.
The office of the party's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Wang and his relationship with Xi, or on whether China had erred in its messaging in the trade war.
There is a growing feeling within the Chinese government that the outlook for China has ""become grim"", according to a government policy advisor, following the deterioration in relations between China and the United States over trade. The advisor requested anonymity.
Those feelings are also shared by other influential voices.
""Many economists and intellectuals are upset about China's trade war policies,"" an academic at a Chinese policy think tank told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""The overarching view is that China's current stance has been too hard-line and the leadership has clearly misjudged the situation.""
That view contrasts with the thinking at the beginning of the year of many Chinese academics who had touted China's ability to withstand the trade row in the face of Trump's perceived political weakness at home. 
China thought it had reached a deal with Washington in May to avoid a trade war, but was shocked when the Trump administration, in Beijing's eyes, went back on that agreement.
""The evolution from a trade conflict to trade war has made people rethink things,"" the policy advisor said. ""This is seen as being related to the exaggeration of China's strength by some Chinese institutions and scholars that have influenced the U.S. perceptions and even domestic views.""
One official who is familiar with China's propaganda efforts said the messaging had gone astray.
""In the trade war, the line of thinking in the propaganda has been that Trump is crazy,"" said the official. ""In fact, what he is scared of is us getting strong.""
CONFIDENT CHINA?
Under Xi, officials have become increasingly confident in proclaiming what they see as China's rightful place as a world leader, casting off a long-held maxim of Deng Xiaoping, the former paramount leader who said the country needed to ""bide its time and hide its strength"".
That confidence has been apparent as the government pushes its Belt and Road initiative to develop trade routes between East and West and takes a hard line on territorial issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan. 
Hu Angang, an economics professor at Tsinghua University and an expert in the field of ""Chinese exceptionalism"", is one prominent advocate for the view that China has achieved ""comprehensive national power"".
In recent weeks, Hu has faced a public backlash, with critics blaming him for making the United States wary of China by trumpeting and exaggerating its relative economic, technical and military might.
That view of Hu is also shared by some people in official circles, according to the policy advisor.
Hu declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
The cracks within the party come as China's stock markets and currency have slumped, and the government has struggled to shore up the economy to cushion the impact of the trade war. 
China in recent weeks has encouraged more lending and pledged to use fiscal policy - including tax cuts and more funding for local governments - to combat slowing economic growth and rising uncertainty driven in part by the escalating trade war.
Xi has had other fires to hose too, including public anger over a vaccine fraud case and protests in Beijing this week by investors in failed online lending platforms. 
Meanwhile, top leaders are believed to be meeting for secretive annual talks, most likely at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, leaving a policy vacuum as Xi and other officials all but vanish from state media. Based on what has happened in previous years, that could be for up to two weeks. 
It is unclear if Wang, the propaganda boss, will face any consequences, and there may be other reasons for the tensions within the party related to him. 
A third source with ties to the leadership told Reuters the tension had to do with Wang opposing a cult of personality that has been forming around Xi.
Wang still features in state media and diplomats and leadership sources say he is unlikely to be removed from the Standing Committee, the party body that runs China, in what would be an unprecedented move.
Though official media has in recent days been filled with defiant commentary regarding the United States and the trade war, there have been signs of a shift in China's messaging.
Beijing has begun downplaying Made in China 2025, the state-backed industrial policy that is core to Washington's complaints about the country's technological ambitions.
State television's English-language news channel CGTN, which is aimed at foreigners, has also been focusing on how ordinary Americans will be affected by more expensive prices for cheap made-in-China consumer goods and the damage tariffs will do to the U.S. economy.
But the thinking in Chinese government circles is that the damage has already been done - and that China has learned the hard way that its domestic propaganda is now being scrutinized abroad in a way it never was before.
""It's impossible for China to 'bide its time and hide its strength', but at least we can control the volume of our own propaganda and tell China's story the proper way,"" the policy insider said. 

""When the size of China's economy was small, it got little outside attention but China is now closely watched.""

189,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",BOJ lays some groundwork but still far from stimulus exit: Reuters poll,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - A third of economists polled by Reuters said the Bank of Japan's steps to make its policy more flexible suggest it is laying the groundwork for an eventual exit from its massive stimulus but most said it won't actually pull the trigger anytime soon.
The BOJ last week pledged to keep interest rates ""extremely low"" for an extended period while making policy tweaks to buy stocks and bonds more flexibly, including allowing the 10-year government bond yield to move in a slightly wider band around zero percent.
Those steps were aimed at making the BOJ's stimulus more sustainable as it remains far from achieving its 2 percent inflation target even after five years of massive asset buying and ultra-low rates under BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
""I don't think the BOJ's flexibility brought the bank a full step forward towards policy normalization, but perhaps we could say by a third of a step,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
Mutou was among 12 out of 35 economists who said the central bank's steps brought it closer to crafting an exit strategy -- although implementing one remained far off.
In fact, 73 percent of economists who see stimulus unwinding as the BOJ's next step don't expect that to happen until 2020 or later, up from 37 percent last month.
""Since the BOJ's decision did not raise inflation expectations, the timing of its exit strategy will not change,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities Japan, who doesn't see an exit before 2020.
He called the overall impact from the BOJ's policy tweaks on the economy and inflation ""almost neutral"". 
But economists were positive towards the BOJ's decision to let 10-year yields move between minus 0.2 percent and 0.2 percent -- double the previous range -- as keeping yields in too narrow of a band had been shrinking bond trading. 
Twenty-seven of 35 economists said the move on yields would help bond market functioning, while eight disagreed, the poll taken between Aug. 3 and 8 found.
""Functioning in the JGB market will partially improve,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""But as long as the BOJ maintains its yield curve control policy, a negative impact from worsening functions in the market will continue."" 
Elsewhere, economists project the core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food, will rise 0.9 percent in the fiscal year to March 2019, and the same rate the following year -- excluding the effects of a planned sales tax increase.
By contrast, the BOJ has forecast CPI to rise 1.1 percent this fiscal year and 1.5 percent next year.
The economy, the world's third largest, is seen growing 1.1 percent this fiscal year and 0.8 percent the following year, the poll showed.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:28PM ET</span>","Chinese state media accuse U.S. of 'mobster mentality', vow to fight tariffs","By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Thursday accused the United States of a ""mobster mentality"" in its move to implement additional tariffs on Chinese goods, and warned Beijing had all the necessary means to fight back.
The comments mark a ratcheting up in tensions between the world's two largest economies over a trade dispute, which is already impacting industries ranging from steel to cars and causing unease over which products could be targeted next.
Beijing late on Wednesday said it would slap additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports, in retaliation to news the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods from Aug. 23.
""The two countries' trade conflict, which is merely push and shove at the moment, is likely to escalate into more than just a scuffle if the U.S. administration cannot marshal its mobster mentality,"" state newspaper China Daily said in an editorial.
""China continues to do its utmost to avoid a trade war, but in the face of the U.S.'s ever greater demand for protection money, China has no choice but to fight back,"" it said.
So far, China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products. Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft.
""China has confidence in protecting its own interests, has many means,"" state broadcaster CCTV said on its early morning news show.
Another commentary, written by China Institute of International Studies research fellow Jia Xiudong and published in the overseas edition of the People's Daily newspaper, said the United States was trying to ""suppress China's development"".

China should consider ""unconventional methods"" such as the stimulus plan used by Beijing during the global financial crisis if needed to sustain economic growth, the Global Times newspaper, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said in a commentary.

191,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",Trump Won’t Kill Off Germany’s Trade Surplus,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s trade surplus is likely to stay large no matter how hard Donald Trump tries to make it disappear.
The U.S. president has accused his ancestral homeland -- his grandfather was a German immigrant -- of unfair trade practices and threatened the country with import levies on cars. Time is running out if he’s to make any inroads during his four-year term.
Yet the economic fundamentals that give German manufacturers an export edge are set to persist, and in no small part due to the U.S. tax cuts and economic boom that Trump regularly takes credit for.
“If the economy is running well, people will buy cars and other foreign products, which of course helps German exports,” said Carsten Hesse, European economist at Berenberg in London.
How big is MASSIVE?
Trump tweeted in May that the U.S. has a “MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany.” That imbalance was 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in 2017, a substantial chunk of the European nation’s 244 billion-euro global surplus.
In fact, Germany hasn’t posted an annual deficit with the world since 1951 (for most of that period it was West Germany), or even a monthly one since early 1991. Figures this week showed the surplus so far this year is in line with 2017 and just shy of the record set in 2016.
Buying German
The U.S. economy grew an annualized 4.1 percent in the second quarter, far outstripping Germany, in an expansion fueled by low unemployment and Trump’s tax cuts.
That drives up consumer spending, and for buyers seeking to spend their cash on luxury cars, Germany is a popular provider. Vehicles from companies such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche were its biggest export by value last year, with BMW posting a 2.8 percent increase in unit sales in the U.S. in the first half of 2018. The country is also a major seller overseas of machinery, chemicals, electronics and electrical equipment.
As the International Monetary Fund noted in an assessment in July, “in the short term, the rebound in global demand, partly driven by U.S. fiscal stimulus, will support German exports and the high trade surplus.”
Weaker Currency
The U.S. Treasury has kept Germany -- along with China, South Korea, Japan, and Switzerland -- on its currency monitoring list for nations it considers to have a significant trade surplus, high current-account surplus, or to be intervening in the currency markets. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro has previously accused Germany of benefiting from a “grossly undervalued” euro.
The single currency’s level reflects the economic outlook for all 19 members of the euro zone, giving Germany alone little influence over it. Still, the IMF estimates that the real effective exchange rate is some 10–20 percent weaker than a sovereign German currency would be.
That advantage is unlikely to be eroded any time soon, because the stronger U.S. economy means a divergence in monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank that favors the dollar.
The Fed is expected to raise rates for a third time this year at its September meeting, with a fourth move in December also on the cards. The ECB won’t even halt its bond-buying program until the end of the year, and has pledged to keep rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019.
Just Talk
Trump’s tariff threats against Europe are more rhetoric than reality at the moment. He and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed last month to hold off from levies as long as negotiations are ongoing.
BMW said last week it didn’t account for any potential tariff impact in its outlook as it doesn’t know how things will develop. Siemens, Europe’s biggest engineering group, saw some moderation in order growth in the U.S. last quarter but no “earthquake” so far.
Juncker did agree that Europe would aim to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas, but that fuel is far more expensive for Germany than supplies from Russia.
The Other Surplus
Germany has long argued that it can’t order companies to reduce exports and consumers to boost imports to reduce the trade surplus. That doesn’t mean it’s helpless though. The IMF has recommended the government use its “entire fiscal space” to lift productivity, boost labor supply and encourage investment, saying that would help rebalance the economy.
The government appears to be more focused on reducing its debt burden though. It’s concerned about funding the pensions and services that its aging population will require, and has run a budget surplus for four years.
“A lot of policy choices on the German side are somewhat understandable from the domestic perspective,” said Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics in Frankfurt. “I would say certain steps should be taken to reduce the current-account surplus, but also because it would simply make sense to spend this extra money from the budget or give it to the people.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico is ""encouraged"" to keep working with the United States to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said after a two-hour meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday.
In the Washington meeting, the officials took stock of developments from negotiators working over the weekend, Guajardo told reporters.
""We are definitely encouraged to keep on working, basically covering all the items that we have to cover and we added a list of things that we'll be talking about tomorrow,"" said Guajardo.
Guajardo, who was accompanied by Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's pick for chief NAFTA negotiator, Jesus Seade, is scheduled to meet again Lighthizer at 10 a.m. on Thursday.
Asked if a deal would be reached on the contentious rules of origin for autos, Guajardo repeated that ""nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.""
The United States has demanded tougher rules of origin, particularly on what percentage of a car needs to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs.

Guajardo said on Monday that Mexico had put forward a proposal to update NAFTA's rules of origin, and was studying the U.S. position.

Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr held the official cash rate at 1.75 percent and left the door open to a cut if needed. “We expect to keep the OCR at this level through 2019 and into 2020, longer than we projected in our May statement,” he said Thursday in Wellington. “The direction of our next OCR move could be up or down.”
The central bank lowered its forecast for economic growth over the coming year amid a slump in business confidence, a cooler housing market and risks to New Zealand exports from global trade tensions. It pushed out its forecast for the first rate increase to the third quarter of 2020, a full year later than it predicted in May. The rate has been at 1.75 percent since the end of 2016.
The kiwi dollar fell almost half a U.S. cent after the decision and traded at 67.08 cents at 9:53 a.m. in Wellington from 67.47 cents beforehand. The governor made no comment about the level of the exchange rate in his statement.
“We continue to expect that the OCR will stay on hold until November 2019, though the RBNZ’s new view is it will be on hold for longer,” said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank Ltd. in Auckland. “The important thing is that there is absolutely no urgency for the OCR to increase for a considerable period.”
Confidence, Housing
The RBNZ forecast economic growth of 2.9 percent in the year ending March 31. That’s less than the 3.3 percent it projected in May. Business confidence fell to a 10-year low in July, according to ANZ Bank New Zealand’s monthly survey. House price inflation last month was the slowest since October.
“The decline in GDP growth over the past year suggests momentum in the economy may have eased,” the RBNZ said in today’s monetary policy statement. “While growth is expected to pick up, there are a number of downside risks to this outlook. Reflecting a weaker outlook for capacity pressure, the projected path for the OCR is flat for longer than in the May statement.”
The RBNZ now expects that inflation will reach the midpoint of the 1-3 percent band it targets in the first quarter of 2021, later than the late 2020 timing projected in May.
Prices rose 1.5 percent in the year through June 30 and inflation is being stoked by higher fuel prices and more expensive imports as the currency declines. The central bank’s core inflation gauge accelerated to 1.7 percent in the second quarter, the fastest in seven years.
“There are welcome early signs of core inflation rising,” Orr said. Still, the path to 2 percent for headline inflation “may be bumpy” and the bank would look through any volatility caused by changes in global oil prices, a lower exchange rate and announced petrol excise tax rises, he said.
New Zealand’s labor market has tightened, the RBNZ said. The jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 4.5 percent in the second quarter even as jobs growth accelerated. Wage growth quickened as a higher minimum wage was introduced, and pressure on pay rates is expected to build amid skill shortages and some aggressive public-sector wage demands.
“Employment is roughly around its maximum sustainable level,” Orr said. “We expect the unemployment rate to decline modestly from its current level.”
All economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted today’s decision, and most expected the central bank to start tightening policy in the second half of next year.
“With GDP growth declining, we expect only a gradual increase in inflation,” the RBNZ said. “Stimulatory monetary policy remains necessary to ensure inflation continues to rise towards the target mid-point.”

194,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 05:55PM ET</span>",Khamenei says Iran does not have anything to be concerned about,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran's utmost authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Islamic Republic had nothing to be concerned about, a report on his official website said on Wednesday, as the country's clerical leadership faces biting U.S. sanctions.
The sanctions imposed on Tehran this week have already led banks and many companies around the world to scale back dealings with Iran. Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday.
""With regard to our situation do not be worried at all. Nobody can do anything,"" his website Khamenei.ir quoted him as saying in one of his speeches in the past weeks, but was published only a day after the new U.S. sanctions took effect.
Trump tweeted on Tuesday that the new sanctions, which were lifted under a 2015 international nuclear deal, were the most biting sanctions ever imposed. 
Iran has denounced as ""U.S. unilateralism"" the reimposition of sanctions in line with Trump’s decision to pull out of the agreement over Iran’s nuclear program.
Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou, in a commentary published by Britain's Guardian newspaper on Wednesday, said that Trump was making history by violating a U.N. Security Council resolution it voted for three years ago.
The resolution, which underpinned the pact between Iran and six powers, calls on U.N. member states to refrain ""from actions that undermine implementation of commitments"" under the nuclear accord.
U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that they aim to pressure countries to stop buying oil from Iran in a bid to force Tehran to halt its nuclear and missile programs and involvement in regional conflicts in Syria and Iraq.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday that a U.S. plan to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero will not succeed, according to the Iran state newspaper.
""If the Americans want to keep this simplistic and impossible idea in their minds they should also know its consequences,"" Zarif told the Iran newspaper.
""They can’t think that Iran won’t export oil and others will export.""
President Hassan Rouhani hinted last month that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, if the United States attempted to stop the Islamic Republic’s oil exports.
Trump responded by noting that Iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the United States.
""The Americans have assembled a war room against Iran,"" Zarif said. ""We can’t get drawn into a confrontation with America by falling into this war room trap and playing on a battlefield.""
Last month, Trump offered to meet Iran's leaders ""without preconditions"". But Rouhani on Monday said there could be no talks as long as Washington was reneging on the deal.
Zarif said that Oman and Switzerland have acted as mediators in talks with America in the past but that there are currently no direct or indirect talks being held with the United States.
Rouhani, speaking in a meeting with North Korea's foreign minister on Wednesday, said that America cannot be trusted, according to the State news agency IRNA. 

""Today, America is identified as an unreliable and untrustworthy country in the world which does not adhere to any of its obligations,"" Rouhani said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Divorce crushed Dennis Nolte's retirement plans not once but twice.
The first time, which was more than 20 years ago, ""everything burned to the ground,"" Nolte said. He had to start over financially from scratch. The second divorce was rough, too, but he was better prepared.
What happened in between is that Nolte rebuilt, little by little, using what he knows as a certified financial planner and former therapist.
Giving up retirement assets can be one of the biggest psychological blows in a divorce. The other assets that couples typically divvy up, like a house and cash, are usually in joint accounts.
When splitting pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s, which all require legal documents, couples can choose a straight 50-50 split or a more creative swap. When incomes and savings are equal, sometimes both parties just walk away with their own pots. No matter what, each spouse ends up with less money than they had been expecting to carry them through the rest of their lives together.
Overall in the United States, divorced households have about 30 percent less net worth than non-divorced households, and have a 7 percentage point higher risk of not having enough money to last through retirement, according to a new study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
At first, ""there's a lot of crying,"" says Michelle Buonincontri, a certified financial planner and certified divorce financial analyst based in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Rebuilding your retirement nest egg after a divorce is complicated because qualified retirement plans have contribution restrictions.
You might lose $250,000 from your 401(k) in a divorce agreement, but you can only invest $18,500 per year, or $24,500 if you are over 50. And IRAs and Roths are limited to contributions of $5,500 per year, with restrictions related to age and income. Pensions are walled off completely.
TIME ON YOUR SIDE
A financial strategy as well as a bit of saving psychology will help you get back on your feet.
What kept Nolte going is that he knew time was on his side after his first divorce, even though he had to cash in his whole retirement IRA for small business owners to maintain two households, pay lawyers and fund the divorce settlement.
""At 40, you still have the benefit of compounding,"" said Nolte, who is now 61 and based near Orlando, Florida.
Financial planner Rose Swanger had a high-income client who found himself in a similar situation - he had to give up half of a seven-figure 401(k) balance in a divorce and was very down about it. Swanger suggested he continue to max out his current contributions in his retirement plan but also auto-deduct another couple of thousand of dollars and stash that money in a taxable investment account.
""That helps build up an emergency fund and set aside money for savings,"" Swanger said.
More than five years later, her client now has more than $250,000 in his 401(k), and more than $100,000 in his taxable account.
The situation for the spouse on the receiving end of the retirement accounts, who might have been a stay-at-home parent during the marriage or just earned less, also has challenges. Things get even more complicated when the receiving spouse is past retirement age because you cannot contribute to accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs unless you have earned income, and Social Security does not count.
One of Deirdre Prescott's clients got a $500,000 chunk of her ex-husband's IRA but she is now 62 and no longer working as a teacher. Prescott is working with her to bridge the gap between when her client's alimony runs out in two years and when she taps Social Security. (Delaying retirement benefits until age 70 greatly increases the amount you get each month.)
Prescott's client plans to live off other assets and some modest free-lance income. The key part of the strategy is to take advantage of her low tax bracket.
She will convert as much of that traditional pre-tax IRA into a Roth IRA, which allows contributions to grow tax-free. She will have to pay income taxes on the amount she transfers, but the account will then grow tax free, and she will not be subject to required minimum distributions at 70 1/2 like she would be with an IRA.
""She came in completely panicked but if she continues to live modestly and puts off taking Social Security, she should be OK,"" Prescott said.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 03:56PM ET</span>",Trump administration cuts staff at financial markets watchdog: source,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration moved on Wednesday to shrink a government agency tasked with identifying looming financial risks, notifying around 40 staff members they would be laid off, according to a person familiar with the changes.
The employees at the Office of Financial Research (OFR) were formally told on Wednesday they will lose their jobs as part of a broader reorganization of the agency that was created in the wake of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the source said. 
The overhaul forms part of a broader push by the Trump administration to reduce government bureaucracy by slashing government jobs and cutting regulations. 
Staff at the OFR, an independent bureau within the U.S. Treasury that analyzes market trends to spot financial risks, were told in January that jobs would be eliminated as the administration sought to cut the OFR's budget by 25 percent to around $76 million, the person said.
Some staff have left voluntarily up until this point, this person said. They added that the OFR is also working with the Treasury to find new roles for other OFR employees. 
“We are working to make OFR a more efficient organization with a stronger workforce and culture to better execute on the mission,"" a spokesman for the Treasury said in an email statement.
""The plan to reshape the workforce was announced to OFR employees in January, and the headcount reduction is an important step toward streamlining operations and reducing costs,"" he added.
In its 2018 budget request, the OFR said its financial year 2016 full-time headcount was 208 but that it aimed to reduce that to around 139. The headcount target remains at approximately 140, roughly 65 percent of the agency's peak 217 staff, the source said. 
The OFR has for years been under attack from congressional Republicans and other critics who claim the agency is unproductive, unnecessary and another form of intrusive government bureaucracy.
Consumer advocates say the bureau provides a critical function by gathering data on areas such as banking, lending and trading from the country's complex web of federal and state regulators to provide a bird's-eye view of system-wide risks. 
The OFR is one of several financial regulators being overhauled under President Donald Trump, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, also housed within the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
These watchdogs have frozen or are rolling back rules introduced following the financial crisis, such as curbs on predatory lenders and the designation of some firms as systemically risky.
The OFR's original head, Richard Berner, left at the end of 2017. Ken Phelan, a Treasury official, has served as its acting director since then. The administration has nominated Dino Falaschetti, an economist for congressional Republicans, to fill the role on a full-time basis. 

His nomination is pending before the U.S. Senate.

Canada’s energy producers could supply a greater portion of their domestic market and satisfy more of world demand if they could move supply from producing regions to both coasts, said Ben Brunnen, vice president of oil sands operations and fiscal policy for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Canada imported about C$1.17 billion ($902.4 million) worth of oil and fuels from Saudi Arabia in the second quarter, according to Statistics Canada.

198,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury proposes tax rules on pass-through businesses,"By David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday proposed tax regulations for a new 20 percent income tax deduction for owners of businesses organized as pass-through entities, including rules to prevent the measure from becoming a tax loophole for wealthy Americans.
The regulations are intended to provide everything pass-through owners need to comply with the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code that President Donald Trump signed into law in December.
About 30 million U.S. businesses, including many small ""Mom and Pop"" firms, are organized as pass-through entities, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation think tank. Rather than operating like corporations with shareholders, as many large companies do, these businesses pass profits through to their owners as personal income. 
""The pass-through deduction is an important tax cut for small- and mid-size businesses, reducing their effective tax rates to their lowest levels since the 1930s,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. 
""This 20-percent deduction will lead to more investment in U.S. companies and higher wages for hardworking Americans.""
Trump's tax overhaul provided permanent tax relief to corporations, which saw their tax rate slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent and an end to U.S. taxes on much of their foreign profits.
Pass-through owners got only temporary relief under the law's individual tax provisions, which are due to expire after 2025. The deduction is currently set to cost the Treasury $415 billion in tax revenues over the next decade. 
Republicans in the House of Representatives are expected to consider legislation to make individual tax cuts permanent, with a vote possible ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional midterm elections. But such a measure is not expected to become law anytime soon.
The regulations provide the deduction to a wide range of businesses by limiting a tax code provision that could otherwise deny the benefit to any businesses based principally on the skill or reputation of owners or employees, analysts said. The rules say the limitation applies narrowly to income from product endorsements, royalties and licensing fees. 
""They left a lot of winners, which may be expensive,"" said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank. 
Howard Wagner, a partner with the accounting and consulting firm Crowe LLP, said the new rules should also provide welcome flexibility for owners of multiple businesses and settle lingering uncertainties about the kinds of firms that qualify for the deduction.
The proposed regulations are intended to ensure that business owners receive the full deduction on business income up to a $315,000 threshold for married couples and $157,500 for single filers. The deduction is limited for higher income.
Specific industries including healthcare, law, accounting and consulting do not qualify. But others, such as the real estate industry where Trump and his family have business holdings, receive the benefit, as do architects and engineers.
Analysts have warned that wealthy taxpayers could try to seize the full deduction improperly by declaring themselves as contractors or splitting off a restricted firm's non-restricted income into a separate entity. 

Treasury officials said the new regulations include anti-abuse safeguards to prevent such schemes.

(Reuters) - Proposed tariffs on U.S. imports from China of electronic cigarettes, known as vaping products, could not come at a worse time for the industry. 
New levies would increase prices just as the industry is facing slowing growth and as it begins to add new health warnings to packaging.
The Trump administration has threatened 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including vape devices and parts, in addition to tariffs on $50 billion already imposed. 
As a result U.S. vape manufacturers, who depended on China for 91 percent of imported vaping products in 2016, find themselves caught in the middle of a growing trade war. Vaping which is often cheaper than smoking, has surged in popularity in recent years. Viewed as a healthier alternative to smoking, users inhale steam from the nicotine-filled devices, rather than burning cigarettes with byproducts of paper, tobacco and a range of other chemicals. 
The potential negative impact of tariffs represent just one example of how the rapidly expanding trade war between the U.S. and China can affect whole industry sectors, causing job losses and other financial pain.
The tariffs could drive up the price of a vape by about 15 percent, according to industry estimates. This would be particularly painful for an industry where consumers are highly sensitive to rising prices. Nielsen Tobacco report estimates retail sales of the U.S. vapor market will be about $5.5 billion in 2018.
A study in the journal Tobacco Control estimated a 10 percent price increase in e-cigarettes would reduce sales by between 12 percent to 19 percent. The study noted that because many vapers are experimenting, rising prices could curtail future use.
""Margins on products are already low, to maintain margins we'd have two choices, raise prices or cutting employees' hours,"" said Matthew Milby, who owns two Maryland vape shops under the name Smoke Free Nation. He predicted some shops would be put out of business. 
Two of the biggest companies, Juul Labs and VMR Products, are among companies with products that will be hurt by the tariffs. Juul led the market growth last quarter, and held 68 percent of the market share according to a June Nielsen Tobacco report.
Industry experts predict the tariffs could affect virtually all vape and e-cigarette products, and hit the industry's smaller firms hardest.
Jan Verleur, chief executive of vape maker VMR, is worried tariffs, which he will likely have to pass on to consumers with a 10 percent to 15 percent price increase, will reduce consumers access to the products since an estimated 70 percent of the company's products would face the extra levy.
Euromonitor International's Head of Tobacco Research, Shane MacGuill, said the tariff would have a ""significant detrimental impact on the vapor product industry.""
Euromonitor's year-to-year data shows the market's growth has been slowing, for smokeless tobacco and vapor products. From 2016 to 2017, the market grew just 9.3 percent, compared to 22.5 percent in 2015 to 2016.
Juul's industry-dominating devices and pods will fall under the tariffs. The company declined to disclose what portion of products could be effected, or if it would increase prices.Ramping up U.S. manufacturing of e-cigarettes, which were invented in China, would be difficult until there is a clearer picture of the developing regulatory environment, including new labeling requirements and increased Food and Drug Administration regulation in 2022. 
The United States also has too few workers with the specific technical expertise to make vaping products.
In comments to the U.S. Commerce Department about the proposed tariffs, Juul's chief legal officer Gerald Masoudi said no manufacturers located outside of China would be willing or able to supply the volume of devices Juul needs.
Geoff Habicht, president of SV3, an American-based company that manufactures its products in China, predicted a $40 product could increase to $45 or $50, and a $10 refill could increase to $12.50.
SV3's tentative plans are to take on some of the increased cost for a quarter rather than pass them on to the consumer as the company weighs options. 

But, Habicht said consumers could end up seeing a 14 to 25 percent price increase across products. He also is pushing his suppliers to absorb some costs.

Yoshio Nozawa, who researched corporate bond spreads for the Fed over the past five years, said Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund and its peers should buy more high-yield bonds and alternative assets such as real estate. The pension fund’s long-term performance of its 158.6 trillion yen ($1.43 trillion) in assets is more important than quarterly results, he said.
“Investors that can own assets for a long period have a high risk tolerance,” Nozawa, 39, said in an interview in Tokyo after receiving a GPIF award for corporate bond research in July. “Pension funds have the advantage of being able to hold low-liquidity products that other investors usually shy away from, so there’s room for them to consider investing in more of those assets.”
The GPIF revised investment guidelines earlier this year to include the buying of Japanese debt rated below BBB, or junk bonds, under certain conditions. As of March-end, it allocated about 415 billion yen to actively managed foreign high-yield bond funds run by firms such as Nomura Asset Management, MacKay Shields and UBS Asset Management.
Alternative investments made up 0.17 percent of the GPIF’s total assets, below its self-imposed limit of 5 percent, as of the end of June.
The key to analyzing corporate bonds is understanding the composition of their spread, which is affected by the expected default loss and risk premium, according to Nozawa, who currently teaches finance at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. If the risk premium is driving the spread, then it may indicate that it’s time to buy the debt rather than sell, he said. This also applies to stocks and other assets, he added.
Japanese investors such as pension funds and life insurers tend to invest in investment-grade bonds. Corporate debt issuance was about 11 trillion yen in 2017, with more than 95 percent of the securities rated A or higher, according to a report by Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research.
Ayako Sera, a strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, said the GPIF has little choice but to diversify into alternative assets and high-yield bonds if it wants higher returns. Japan’s bonds, which make up about 27 percent of the GPIF’s assets, have low yields as the Bank of Japan maintains its unprecedented monetary easing.
“The GPIF’s biggest problem is it can’t keep taking in domestic bonds -- especially government bonds -- as a staple with Japanese interest rates so low,” Sera said. “The fund needs to sample a wider variety of dishes.”"

The nation’s outflow has fallen, and Iran is having to rely more on its own fleet of tankers to carry oil to its customers, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.
Iran’s exports of crude and condensate, a form of light oil extracted from gas fields, were down by 430,000 barrels a day, or 15 percent, in July compared with April, the last month before President Trump announced that he was pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposing sanctions.
Iran’s fleet of very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, and Suezmax tankers -- the largest that can fit fully-laden through the Suez Canal -- has always played an important role in delivering Iranian crude to customers, but it is increasing as insurers and international shipping companies react to the sanctions snap-back. In April, vessels belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Co. were hauling a little under half of country’s crude and condensate exports. By last month that share had risen to around two thirds.
“This clearly shows there is hesitation among buyers around continuing to purchase Iranian crude with the implementation of these sanctions,” said Warren Patterson, commodity strategist for ING Bank NV, adding that the dip in flows will probably result in tighter supply of oil.
Nowhere is the growing reliance on Iran’s own tanker fleet more apparent than in its shipments to Turkey. Under the previous sanctions on Iran, all crude deliveries from Iran to Turkey were made on ships belonging to NITC. That began to change in mid-2016, after those sanctions were lifted, and from September of that year it became rare to see Iranian-owned tankers passing through the Red Sea and Suez Canal to Turkey.
Now that picture is switching back again. Last month more crude was loaded onto Iranian-owned tankers bound for Turkey than at any time since August 2016.
Iran’s oil ministry said last month it doesn’t use the Bab el-Mandeb strait at southern end of Red Sea for its crude exports after Saudi Arabia temporarily halted its own shipments through the waterway, due to an attack on two of its tankers. The ministry didn’t say when Iran stopped using the strait.
Yet, there there has been a steady stream of Iranian crude passing through the strait, though until recently very little of it has been carried on Iranian-owned vessels. That is fast changing as Iran seeks to maintain deliveries to Turkey amid U.S. sanctions.

Italy’s populist coalition wants enough flexibility to introduce a flat tax and a citizen’s income in next year’s budget without running foul of EU budget restrictions, Di Maio said in an interview. He suggested that if the EU changed the way the deficit was calculated then his government’s plans could be implemented without breaching the limit.
Italian 10-year yields spiked to an intraday high and the spread between BTPs and bunds widened after Di Maio’s comments. The yield on 10-year bonds rose 4 basis points to 2.91 percent.
“We want to discuss these reforms with the European Union to obtain the margin for maneuver that will allow us to implement those measures” Di Maio said. “That means doing the same as we did on immigration. There shouldn’t be a clash with the EU, but a frank discussion.”
In June, Italy’s populist government hijacked an EU summit to demand help tackling an influx of undocumented migrants. In the runup to the talks, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini provoked a diplomatic incident by turning away a rescue ship with more than 600 people aboard, then swapped insults with French President Emmanuel Macron. At the summit in Brussels, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte threatened to block all the other business leaders were aiming to complete.
Ultimately, member states agreed to increase border security, set up holding centers to handle asylum seekers, and to impose tighter controls on the charity organizations rescuing people from the Mediterranean Sea. An Italian official said Conte got about 70 percent of what he’d wanted.
Budget Battle
Now the administration is turning its attention to how to deliver on its election promises within the constraints imposed by the EU. With 2.3 trillion euros ($2.7 trillion) of public debt, the most in Europe, Finance Minister Giovanni Tria has said the government program won’t jeopardize Italy’s commitment to reduce its debt burden.
At the same time, the government has promised to ramp up benefit spending and cut taxes. Those plans may cost as much as 120 billion euros in the first full year, according to calculations by Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund executive. The ruling parties have questioned that estimate, without providing further details of how they are going to fund the measures.
One potential approach could involve excluding some spending from the deficit calculations.
“It is possible to introduce both this measure and a flat tax and to respect European Union deficit limits, because this is a structural reform for Italy,” Di Maio said. “The European Union must listen to us in this phase when we want to protect citizens facing a social emergency.”

204,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",China to slap additional tariffs on $16 billion of U.S. goods,"By Ryan Woo and David Lawder
BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the Chinese commerce ministry said, as the world's largest economies escalated their trade dispute.
The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23, the ministry said, the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods.
The United States published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on Tuesday.
China's final list announced on Wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in June, which included crude oil. The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft, although the total value is unchanged.
The U.S. action that prompted the Chinese retaliation was the latest by President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions, after Washington imposed tariffs on $34 billion in goods last month. China has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any U.S. action.
""This is a very unreasonable practice,"" the Chinese commerce ministry said of the U.S. action on Wednesday as it rolled out China's counter-tariffs.
To compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil, China added fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, and various types of bicycles and cars, among other products.
Last week, China proposed additional tariffs on another $60 billion of U.S. goods after Trump raised planned tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent.
So far, China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products. Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft. 
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office could not immediately be reached for comment on China's retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger Trump's next round of threatened tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
USTR is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs, which could reach 25 percent, due to end Sept. 5. It would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the duties.
Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the U.S.-China tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions.
""My expectation is that U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of imports from China will be in effect about a month prior to the November U.S. elections. That's soon enough to be used by Trump as a rallying argument, but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before January 2019. Of course, China will retaliate, probably dollar for dollar,"" Hufbauer said.

China, however, would run out of U.S. imports to levy, as it bought only $130 billion worth of American goods last year. It would likely have to impose penalties on U.S. companies doing business in China to make up the difference.

ROANOKE, Virginia (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is strong enough to warrant further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Wednesday.
In a speech on the U.S. economy, Barkin argued that the Fed's benchmark interest rate was below normal levels, a suggestion that Fed policy was still stimulating economic growth, which he said was solid.
""It is difficult to argue that lower than normal rates are appropriate when unemployment is low and inflation is effectively at the Fed’s target,"" Barkin said in Roanoke, Virginia. 
The U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged last week, but its statement pointed to strength in the economy and bolstered expectations it would raise borrowing costs in September. 
The Fed has been slowly raising interest rates since 2015. Barkin told reporters afterward that gradually raising rates was a ""sensible"" approach.
Barkin, who has a vote this year on monetary policy, said in his speech that the U.S. labor market appeared to be ""very tight,"" although he noted wages were not rising very quickly for reasons still unclear. This could perhaps be due to slower growth in productivity at companies, he said.
He said there were rising concerns in the United States over tariffs, which U.S. President Donald Trump has raised for imports from many countries, prompting higher retaliatory tariffs abroad for U.S. exports.
""Certainly tariff concerns are making people more nervous than they did a few months ago,"" Barkin said. 
He said his staff was researching how tariffs were likely to affect the economy, noting that the tit-for-tat nature of tariffs would put ""comparable"" upward and downward pressures on inflation. 

The effects of tariffs on employment could play out more slowly, he said, with a key factor being whether businesses curtail investments.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Emerging markets see third month of net interest rate hikes,"By Ritvik Carvalho and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Interest rate rises by major emerging market central banks outstripped rate cuts for the third straight month in July as policymakers tightened credit to offset inflation risks and currency weakness amid trade fears and a resurgent U.S. dollar. 
Emerging central banks have now recorded the longest monthly run of net interest rate hikes since 2010, calculations by Reuters show. June numbers showed the biggest tilt toward monetary tightening in seven years, with Turkey, Mexico, India, Indonesia and the Philippines among central banks tightening policy.
The graphic below, based on a group of 38 emerging economies, shows the monthly balance between the number of emerging market central banks hiking versus those cutting their policy rates since the financial crisis of 2008.
A positive reading indicates that more central banks in the group raised their policy rate over that particular month compared with those that lowered it. For an interactive version of this graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MmsXmH
Emerging market central banks are hiking again: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MupTVW
Struggling with plunging currencies, Turkey and Argentina have been the starkest examples, jacking up their benchmark interest rates in emergency moves. 
But a build-up of inflationary pressures more widely will result in monetary tightening across large parts of the emerging markets, analysts at Capital Economics predict.
Citi's Inflation Surprise Index Emerging Markets <.CSIIEM> touched its highest level in over a year in July at 2.7. A positive reading suggests that inflation has on average been higher than expected.
Emerging market inflation surprises to the upside: https://reut.rs/2vnUs8S
Emerging market currencies have come under increasing pressure from the dollar's (DXY) relentless rise since the start of 2018. 
The dollar has strengthened 1.4 percent against a basket of currencies of its major trading partners such as the European Union, Canada and Japan since the start of the year. But looking at the dollar against other important trading partners -- a group of 19 of emerging markets including China, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Russia -- the greenback strengthened more than 5.2 percent over the same period. 
There are some likely exceptions among central banks. 
Faced with rising inflation Russia has paused its rate cutting cycle for now, but a Reuters poll predicts the central bank will reduce rates again in early 2019. 
Quickening inflation and slowing growth have prevented South African policymakers from extending their rate-cutting cycle, but Capital Economics predicts they could deliver more cuts in the coming 12-18 months.

207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Theresa May Planning Cabinet Summit on No-Deal Brexit,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is stepping up the government’s preparations in case Brexit negotiations break down and the country crashes out of the European Union without a deal.
May is planning a top-level meeting of her cabinet ministers early in September specifically to discuss how to ready the U.K. for a no-deal Brexit, according to people familiar with the matter.
Separately, a working group of senior government officials is being convened to devise ways to keep the Irish border free of customs checks and police even if there’s no withdrawal agreement, one of the people said.
Read More: Pound drops on fears of no-deal Brexit
The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29 but talks between the two sides are making painfully slow progress. Politicians on both sides have warned there’s a risk that negotiations could break down, and the pound has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since October on fears of a no deal exit.
The negotiations are stuck over two key issues: May’s proposals for a new free-trade area spanning the U.K. and the EU; and how to avoid a hard land border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Ensuring there’s no return to a hard border infrastructure and customs checks at the frontier is seen as politically vital to maintain the peace on the island of Ireland.
In July, May’s cabinet agreed at a meeting at her Chequers country retreat to step up preparations for departing from the bloc without an agreement and she’s reorganized the Brexit Department to focus on the task.
The government is aiming to publish 70 documents over the coming weeks detailing what will happen to different sectors of the economy if negotiations fall apart. On Sunday, Trade Secretary Liam Fox became the first member of May’s cabinet openly to warn that no deal is now more likely than reaching an agreement with the EU.
Some officials and ministers inside the government are growing increasingly pessimistic about the chances of getting a deal.
Read more: U.K. Ministers Fear Bloody Last Chapter in May’s Brexit Thriller
One of the people familiar with the planned cabinet meeting said it could be held at Chequers, but another said this is unlikely.
The difficulty May is facing is that she needs to keep competing audiences happy. Her own party is split between passionate Brexit campaigners, such as Fox and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, and committed pro-Europeans, such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and former attorney general Dominic Grieve.
To make matters worse for May, she has no automatic majority in Parliament and must strike a deal with the EU that will satisfy both wings of her party, or appeal to members of the opposition Labour party. If she fails, the chances of a chaotic no-deal exit increase.
The U.K. is aiming to finalize the terms of the divorce later this year, and May’s team now believes November is a likely month for concluding the negotiations with the EU. If talks drag on much longer, there might not be enough time left to get the deal ratified in the EU and U.K. parliaments before the country leaves the bloc in March.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",China emerges as second-largest aid donor in South Pacific: think tank,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - China has emerged as the second-largest aid donor in the South Pacific, figures published on Thursday by a think tank show, illustrating its growing influence in a region traditionally dominated by Australia and New Zealand.
China's $1.3 billon-worth of donations and concessionary loans since 2011 trails Australia's $6.6 billion, figures compiled by the Australia-funded Lowy Institute show, but it is more than New Zealand's $1.2 billion.
Spending by China, criticized by many of its neighbors for island building in the South China Sea, is almost 9 percent of total aid donations in the South Pacific. If pledged aid is included, China's promises total $5.9 billion, or nearly a third of all aid pledged to the region's 14 countries by 62 donors.
""There is definitely an element of briefcase diplomacy in the Pacific,"" the Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands program director, Jonathan Pryke, one of two lead researchers, told Reuters by phone from Samoa.
""They are engaged in buying support,"" he said, adding that China's sway was not ""as overwhelming as you might get the sense from the narrative that's been played out this year and last"".
The Lowy analysis lands as Australia-China relations sour. Australia has moved to both check Chinese influence domestically and step up Pacific engagement, along with New Zealand and the United States.
Australia recently outbid China to lay an internet cable to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, which the research ranks as the two largest aid recipients in the region, while also expressing concern at the scale of China's lending.
A Reuters' analysis of the financial books of 11 South Pacific island nations shows China is now the region's biggest bilateral lender, with loans jumping from almost zero to over $1.3 billion currently outstanding in a decade.
The Lowy numbers, which do not include New Zealand contributions since March 2017, also show China jostling with Taiwan to use aid money as a means of cultivating diplomatic ties in region home to a third of Taiwan's allies.
On a per capita basis, Beijing, which views self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province of ""one China"", invested $108 in seven countries supportive of that view. Taiwan spent $120 per capita in the six countries where it has formal diplomatic ties.
Representatives of China and Taiwan in Australia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, nor did a spokeswoman for New Zealand's foreign minister or the foreign ministries in Beijing and Taipei.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in a speech on Tuesday attended by China's ambassador, struck a conciliatory tone, saying China will ""of course"" seek and gain a greater role in world affairs. China's foreign ministry said it noted and commended ""these positive remarks"".

The Saudi central bank and state pension funds have instructed their overseas asset managers to dispose of their Canadian equities, bonds and cash holdings ""no matter the cost"", according to the report.
The sell-off began on Tuesday and underlines how the Saudi government is flexing its financial and political muscle to warn foreign powers against what it regards as interference in its sovereign affairs, the FT said.
Saudi Arabia froze new trade and investment with Canada and expelled the Canadian ambassador this week, in an escalating row after Ottawa urged the country to free rights activists.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 09:12AM ET</span>",Britain walks Brexit high wire over financial services,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must avoid tying Brussels up in red tape or antagonizing its soon to be former European Union partners and the United States if it is to maintain access to the bloc's financial services market after Brexit.
At risk is Britain's biggest financial services export market, which was worth a record 26 billion pounds ($33.45 billion) last year out of total sector exports of 60 billion pounds.
Brexit will mean banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain losing the unfettered access to the bloc's customers they currently have under EU ""passporting"" rules.
However a transition deal, if it can be agreed between Britain and the rest of the EU, would allow passporting to continue after Brexit next March until the end of 2020. After that, a new trade agreement covering all economic sectors would be needed, although its outline has yet to be agreed.
Britain is seeking future financial trade based on a more generous version of the existing equivalence system for firms from non-EU states, such as the United States and Japan, where domestic regulation is aligned closely enough with the bloc's.
Karel Lannoo, chief executive of Brussels think tank CEPS, said accommodating Britain would put political pressure on the EU to improve access for other non-EU states and annoy Norway, which pays for EU market access.
""Brussels does not want to open a Pandora's Box as they would have to give the same treatment to other third countries like the United States. Norway will also say what is the purpose of the EEA,"" Lannoo said, referring to the European Economic Area.
Seventy percent of financial services currently passported between EU states are not covered by equivalence, including commercial lending, deposit taking, payments, asset management and core insurance, meaning firms must pay up to open new EU hubs or face a severe loss of market. 
Brussels knows it is treading a delicate line when it comes to amending equivalence - it has already had clashes with the United States over clearing houses, and with Switzerland over stock exchanges - and U.S. regulators warn that their equivalence agreements must not be disrupted by Brexit deals.
Around 100 EU rules would need amending to broaden equivalence, potentially tying up EU legislators for years.
FRENCH VILLAIN
Britain's finance ministry has asked the City and experts like Rachel Kent, a partner at Hogan Lovells law firm for advice on how to enhance equivalence, Reuters reported last month.
""We have to know what to ask for. We are already fully aligned with the EU. It's about taking items out rather than putting things in, and that should make it a much quicker process,"" Kent said, adding that the sector is now stress testing the government's proposals for financial services.
European Commission officials told Reuters in June there were no plans to go beyond the limited changes already proposed, a hardset position viewed by the City as standard negotiating tactics.
Changes made to equivalence so far are viewed in London as a Paris-backed drive to restrict access so that more UK firms open new EU hubs benefiting Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin or Luxembourg.
""France is conveniently portrayed as the on-duty villain, but Germany and in fact most of the core EU and part of the rest think it would be unjustifiable and unacceptable that the UK keeps the advantages of the single market after having left it,"" said Jacques Lafitte, a former EU official who helped create the euro.
Time for approving changes is also running out as the European Parliament goes to the polls next year and a new European Commission is appointed, meaning a legislative hiatus.
But consultants say the EU is unlikely to turn off the tap to UK financial services after 2020 as it needs to build up its own capital market after decades of City dominance.
""Does the EU want to see enhanced access continuing between the EU and UK? Almost certainly in the short term,"" said Andrew Pilgrim, government financial services leader at consultants EY.
BLUNTER GUILLOTINE
Still, few believe the EU will offer Britain a binding commitment to expand equivalence.
""The City kids itself by hoping for anything better than 'normal' equivalence,"" said Lafitte, who now advises financial firms on EU policy in Brussels.
Others say the bloc may at least change how it administers the process. Britain says the 30-day guillotine or notice period for withdrawing access - which has never been triggered - makes equivalence unreliable.
""I suspect that a withdrawal period of a year or two instead of 30 days will make its way into the EU equivalence regime,"" Kent said.
Brussels-based consultants say that Britain would have to make commitments in return for broader equivalence, such as promising not to compete unfairly.

Some EU officials worry that Britain will dilute financial rules to bolster the City of London's role as a global financial center. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has suggested that the cap on bankers' bonuses imposed by the EU and long opposed by Britain, could be changed after Brexit.

""We will negotiate with the European Commission with a serious, reasonable and courageous programme that will protect our interests,"" Conte told a news conference.
""We will be very serious, rigorous, but we will not be unreasonable and foolish in our demands,"" he added.
His remarks helped calm markets which fear the government's ambitious plans for tax cuts and higher spending could push up Italy's debt, which is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's as a proportion of national output.
The government was due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the 2019 budget, which will be drawn up next month and must be presented to the Commission for approval in October.
Conte said the cabinet was working as a unit and dismissed reports EU Affairs Minister Paolo Savona was working on a plan of public investments worth 50 billion euros which Italy would insist should not be included in its deficit calculations.
""There is no plan A, B or C, there is a single budget that the government is working on ...the contribution of minister Savona is fundamental but it is part of shared framework,"" he said.
The 81-year-old Savona was orginally chosen by the anti-establishment coalition for the key role of economy minister, but was vetoed by the head of state due to his critical views on Italy's membership of the euro zone.

Conte spoke shortly after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria warned in a newspaper interview that the economy was slowing and next year's budget deficit would be higher than previously targeted.

The government plans come as concerns over Chinese takeovers of strategically important technology firms in Germany and other European countries mount.

213,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Nafta Talks Enter Third Week With Focus on Cars, Sunset Clause","(Bloomberg) -- As Nafta negotiators from the U.S. and Mexico meet for a third straight week in a push to complete a deal on cars, they’re also preparing for a showdown over a clause sought by the Trump administration that could end the agreement altogether.
The nations are nearing an accord on content and salaries for auto manufacturing, and the issue remains their top focus, according to two people familiar with the talks. But as teams become more optimistic that a cars deal can come together, attention is starting to pivot to the so-called sunset clause pushed by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer -- another make-or-break issue.
Unlike autos, where the U.S. and Mexico have been haggling for months and largely are down to tweaking details, neither side has been willing to make concessions on the sunset clause, which would end Nafta automatically after five years unless the nations agree to continue it, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing private conversations. Mexico has maintained the mantra that nothing on Nafta is resolved until everything is resolved.
‘Most Complex Issues’
The clause is considered radioactive by Mexico, Canada and business groups because it goes against a key objective of most free-trade deals. Part of Nafta’s original purpose was to provide certainty to companies making investments in manufacturing, including car production. An accord that casts doubt on future tariff levels and corporate protections raises immediate questions about the benefits of building a factory outside the U.S.
“There are many pending issues, and we’re advancing in the grade of complexity,” Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters in Mexico City on Monday. “The sunset clause forms part of the most complex issues.”
Guajardo will be back in Washington on Thursday to meet with Lighthizer -- his third visit in as many weeks. The nations are pushing for an agreement by Aug. 25 in order to allow sufficient time for U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to sign the pact before Mexico’s next president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office Dec. 1. That would take the pressure off Lopez Obrador and allow him to focus on domestic priorities.
While Canada hasn’t attended meetings in the past three weeks, and Trump administration officials have been more publicly optimistic about talks with Mexico than Canada, Canada and Mexico have reiterated that they expect Nafta to remain a three-nation agreement.
Bloomberg reported last week that the U.S. and Mexico are nearing a deal on autos. Mexican newspaper El Economista reported Monday that Mexico has accepted raising the North American content requirement for cars to the 75 percent level sought by the U.S. within five years. That’s up from 62.5 percent now, though below the 85 percent originally sought by the U.S. in October.
Guajardo said in an interview with Mexican station Radio Formula last week that the nation is ready to accept wage requirements near the 40 percent of salaries of at least $16 per hour that had been proposed by the U.S. When asked to comment, Guajardo’s press office referred to comments he made Monday, when he told reporters that Mexico has an autos proposal on the table, but declined to talk about its content.
Lighthizer’s press office declined to comment.
‘Certainty and Predictability’
On the sunset clause, Guajardo has suggested that instead of setting up Nafta to automatically expire, the three nations should agree to evaluate the results every five years. Mexico views the clause as redundant because any of the partners already can withdraw from Nafta after giving six months’ notice.
“A free-trade agreement is supposed to provide certainty, and this would hurt investment in Mexico and the competitiveness of North America,” Moises Kalach, the trade head for the Mexican business chamber known as CCE, said in an interview last week. “It’s not something we can work with.”
One possible deal would be for Mexico to accept the U.S. autos proposal in exchange for the U.S. dropping some of its most controversial other ideas, such as the sunset clause and restrictions on Mexican agricultural exports depending on the season, said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer at Dickinson Wright. Lighthizer rejected a similar Mexican offer in May, but the incentives now could be different given the U.S. mid-term congressional elections in November and the upcoming Mexican presidential transition, Ujczo said.
Getting a deal on autos could open the door to agreement in other areas like the sunset clause, said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the U.S.
“Once you get one of the 800 pound gorillas off the table, then you create a narrative and a story of traction and success,” he said. “It’s not only in terms of the content per se, but the dynamics and tone of the negotiation.”"
214,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 8:
1. Chinese Exports Accelerate Even As Trump Escalates Trade War
China's exports surged more than expected in July despite U.S. tariffs, while its closely watched surplus with the United States remained near record highs, as the world's two major economic powers ramped up a bitter dispute that some fear could derail global growth.
The data provided the first readings of the overall trade picture for the world's second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6.
China's July exports rose 12.2% from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a 10% increase, and up from a 11.2% gain in June.
Imports also rose much faster in July, jumping 27.3%, thanks to still solid domestic demand.
Of more direct consequence in the Sino-U.S. trade war, China's surplus with the U.S. shrank only marginally to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June.
In the latest move by President Donald Trump to put pressure on Beijing to negotiate trade concessions, Washington is set to begin collecting 25% tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on August 23.
China has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree.
2. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Flat Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a muted open, as trade concerns continued to linger and investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings.
At 5:30AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up just 4 points, or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 futures and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures also indicated a flat start to their respective trading sessions.
Stocks rose on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 moved closer to a record high set earlier this year, boosted by strong corporate earnings.
Elsewhere, in Europe, the region's major bourses were mostly lower in mid-morning trade, with most sectors in the red, as corporate earnings failed to lift sentiment.
Britain's FTSE was the standout gainer, getting a boost from a broadly weaker pound, which sank to 11-month lows against the dollar and euro.
Earlier, in Asia, stocks in the region closed mixed, with China losing steam after rebounding in the last session, as investors reacted to the latest salvo in the U.S.-China trade dispute.
3. Last Major Wave Of U.S. Earnings
Dozens of companies are expected to release earnings today in one of the last big waves of the earnings season.
Ahead of the opening bell, results are due from CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Michael Kors (NYSE:KORS), Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA), Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL),  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT),  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE), Autohome (NYSE:ATHM), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), and SINA (NASDAQ:SINA).
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX),  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP),  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST), TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO),  Sarepta  Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT), and  Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR) report after the market close.



Other stocks that will likely be in focus today include, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which soared 11% on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was considering taking the electric car maker private.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) will also capture some attention, with all three set for a volatile session in the wake of earnings updates released after Tuesday's closing bell.
4. Oil Markets Await Fresh Weekly U.S. Inventory Data
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended August 3 at 10:30AM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 3.3 million barrels.
The data will also offer fresh indications on domestic output levels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories declined by 6 million barrels last week.
Oil prices held steady ahead of the data, with U.S. WTI crude futures at $69.17 per barrel, while London-traded Brent crude futures were at $74.61 per barrel.
5. Cryptos Collapse On Delayed ETF Decision
Cryptocurrencies plunged, with Bitcoin tumbling below $6,500 for the first time since July, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission postponed a decision on whether to allow the listing of an exchange-traded fund backed by the largest digital currency.
The SEC now has until September 30 to “approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove” a proposed rule change from Cboe Global Markets Inc. that would allow the listing of a fund from VanEck Associates Corp. and SolidX Partners Inc. to list, the regulator said in a statement.
An initial deadline was due to expire next week.
Bitcoin was last down around 8%, or $560, at $6,478.70 on the Bitfinex exchange, a level last seen on July 16.
Rival tokens also fell.
Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was down almost 11% at $367.70, its worst level since April 6.
Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token was trading at $0.34699, down 15% for the day, while Litecoin was down 12.5% at $65.21.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 05:27AM ET</span>","Italy's economy minister sees lower growth, higher deficit next year","MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - Italy's economy minister said on Wednesday lower economic growth was expected to increase the deficit next year and slow the reduction of the public debt, but he reiterated his commitment to a prudent fiscal policy.
Giovanni Tria, in a newspaper interview, also said that Italy planned to sell its holding in the state-controlled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) - remarks that appeared to show a split within the ruling coalition composed of the 5-Star Movement and far-right League. 
Tria said the government estimated the country would grow by 1.2 percent this year, lower than the 1.5 percent previously forecast. He also expected a downward revision of economic output to 1 or 1.1 percent next year from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent.
""This slowdown would bring the deficit to 1.2 percent in 2019,"" he told the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. That would be higher than a deficit target of 0.8 percent of gross domestic product drawn up by the previous administration. 
Tria added that a clearer estimate of the deficit would be available in September and would depend on the cost of servicing the debt and on the amount of revenues or expenditure cuts that the government uses to avoid a scheduled hike in sales taxes. 
The worsening economic forecasts could put the new anti-establishment government on a collision course with the European Commission, which monitors the budgets of EU countries.
""We are discussing with the Commission so as to avoid a pro-cyclical fiscal correction which would intensify the slowdown in the economy,"" he said.
But Tria, an academic who is seen as more moderate than many of his government partners, said all the reform measures included in the executive's plans were ""compatible"" with commitments Italy had with the EU over its public finances.
He said lower growth could slow the reduction of Italy's debt, the second highest in the EU after bailed-out Greece, but the government maintained the target of bringing it down. 
This could be achieved partly by a plan to privatize public companies, he said.
Tria and other top ministers were due to discuss the budget on Wednesday, following a preliminary meeting last week. He said this had been largely devoted to finding ways of boosting growth by increasing public investments.
Tria said planned higher welfare spending and income tax cuts would be introduced gradually, and financed by cutting other areas of public spending and eliminating billions of euros of tax breaks currently available to companies and individuals.
""The whole tax system needs to be re-arranged, with the guarantee that no-one will lose out in the change from the old to the new systems,"" he said.
The so-called ""citizens wage"", ensuring income of up to 780 euros per month for the poor, will eventually take the place of various other forms of income support now available, he said.
At the same time, he indicated an 80 euro-per-month income tax cut for low earners introduced by the previous government will also be scrapped, saying its application had created ""infinite complications"" for the tax system.
Italy owns 68 percent of Monte Paschi after it bailed the bank out in 2016 under a 5-year rescue plan agreed with the European Commission which included a commitment to sell the government's ""entire stake"" in the bank by a date that is confidential.
Tria's comments on the bank appeared to be at odds with statements made previously by senior coalition members.
League's economic spokesman Claudio Borghi had said the bank would remain in public hands and would be used to provide funding to local communities.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",ECB sees scope for further consumption boom,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Private consumption in the euro zone has further room to grow, likely driving economic expansion even as external headwinds multiply, the European Central Bank said in an economic bulletin on Wednesday.
Euro zone growth has slowed sharply over the past two quarters, raising fears that the bloc's remarkable expansion, now into its sixth year, may be coming to a premature end. 
But the ECB has long argued that the slowdown is due almost entirely to external factors and that domestic demand remains strong and jobs creation appears to be holding up.
""Private consumption has been the main driver of the recent economic expansion, but there is still scope for further growth,"" the ECB said. ""As labor markets continue to improve, consumer confidence should remain elevated and private consumption should rise further.""
The slowdown comes at a particularly sensitive time for the ECB as it dials back stimulus. It plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme by the close of the year, in the hope the economic recovery is strong enough to continue with more modest central bank support. 
Employment in the euro zone at over 107 million is record high but unemployment at 8.3 percent is still one full percentage point above the euro zone's pre-crisis mark. 
In its bulletin, the ECB argued that recovery in private consumption has so far been weak, particularly for lower income families, whose consumption levels have yet to recover to their pre-crisis level. 
Households in the poorest and least educated segments of society, which are now among the main beneficiaries of employment growth, are also more likely to consume non essential items, the ECB said.
""Losses from the financial crisis have not been recouped everywhere,"" the ECB said. ""Private consumption in Germany and France stands about 10 percent higher than before (the recession) but by contrast, consumption in Italy and Spain has not yet recovered completely.""
Defending its monetary policy against criticism that low rates inflate bubbles, the ECB added that the muted rise in credit growth does not indicate that the consumption boom is fueled by cheap credit.

""There is little evidence that low interest rates have led to generalized increases in household indebtedness, supporting the view that the overall economic expansion is sustainable,"" it added.

218,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Turkey's foreign currency reserves - not much of a cushion,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey's currency troubles are fuelling worries about a full-blown balance of payments crisis, and as these graphics show, whichever way you look at it, the country's foreign currency reserves don't provide much protection.
1/SHORT-TERM VIEW
One of the most common methods used to gauge the adequacy of a country's reserves is to compare them with its upcoming debt payments, and by this yardstick Turkey stands out due to its large stack of foreign currency borrowings.
That ratio dropped to just below 74 percent at the mid-year point, having started 2018 at about 90 percent. Even that was low, as 100 percent is generally considered the minimum.
In the simplest terms it means that without access to borrowing markets or without generating extra reserves, Turkey could in theory default. It needs to refinance around $200 billion a year on average.
2/RAM BAM
The International Monetary Fund is seen as the oracle on currency crises due to its vast experience in trying to put countries' finances back together. It has developed a broader gauge it calls the Reserve Adequacy Measure (RAM) which tries to capture the total resources a country has available to meet shocks.
On top of the traditional FX and gold reserves, it also takes into account central bank swap lines, sovereign wealth fund ammunition and access to IMF and other protective financing to calculate an overall ratio.
The IMF's rule of thumb is that a country's RAM ratio should be between 100 and 150 percent. Turkey's is now below 75 percent having dropped every year since 2013.
3/UNDERCOVERED
Another measure that some experts say is now overly simplistic is the amount of time that a country's reserves would cover the costs of it imports.
Turkey is a big energy importer, so in that sense it does have a particular relevance, especially when oil and gas prices are 50 percent higher than they were a year ago and still rising.
Three months' import cover is typically seen as the lowest safe level. Turkey's figure is currently around five months according to the most recent data, though it will drop rapidly if the lira doesn't stabilize.

219,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",Pressure Builds on U.K. Labour to Back Second Brexit Referendum,"(Bloomberg) -- Pressure is building on U.K. opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to switch course and back a referendum on whatever Brexit deal the government reaches with the European Union.
Labour Party activists are trying to force a debate on the issue at its annual conference in Liverpool next month. If they succeed -- and there are still some hurdles -- a second plebiscite that could potentially reverse Brexit becomes much more likely.
Efforts to secure a shift in Labour policy are intensifying due to warnings from senior government ministers that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal, according to Mike Buckley, a party member from Sheffield, northern England, and director of the Labour for a People’s Vote campaign group.
“More and more people can see Brexit is going to end up very, very badly for the people we got into politics for,” he said.
Labour has been trying to straddle both sides of the Brexit divide to balance the fact that while most districts the party represents backed leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum, the majority of its supporters nationwide voted to remain. The party has said it respects the result and that if voted into power, would “prioritize jobs and living standards” in talks with Brussels.
Deadline
With an October deadline for Theresa May’s government and the EU to reach a deal fast approaching, Labour may be forced to change tactics.
Supporting a second vote would create a clear division between Labour and May’s Conservative Party, which has consistently said politicians have a duty to deliver on the result of the referendum. But it would also be a considerable risk, as lawmakers across party lines fear that another vote would be seen as subverting democracy.
National polls are also inconclusive as to which way a second referendum would go.
Buckley’s group is urging local party branches to put forward a motion to the conference, which says that Labour should try to force an early general election and then campaign on a pledge for a referendum on any divorce deal with the EU -- including an option to stay in the bloc. If there’s no election, the party should push for a referendum from opposition, it says.
If the motion is debated and passed at conference, it would put pressure on Corbyn but wouldn’t necessarily force a policy change. When the Unite trade union, Labour’s biggest financial backer, debated a similar motion this year, a compromise was brokered so as not to “tie the hands of the leadership.”
Support
That may happen again this time, even though a survey of 1,024 Labour members last year found 78 percent supported a second referendum.
Buckley’s group has tried to make its motion as appealing as possible. To counter any claims that it amounts to an attack on Corbyn, it clearly states support for the party leader and his redistributive agenda. Its position is bolstered by the fact that thousands of members of Momentum -- the grassroots group set up to support Corbyn’s leadership -- have also signed a petition calling for a second referendum to be put on the conference agenda.
More than 4,100 people have signed so far, but only an estimated 70-80 percent are Momentum members, petition organizer Alena Ivanova said, meaning it still falls short of the threshold of about 4,000 needed to force a Momentum-wide poll on whether to press for a conference debate on the issue.
Ivanova is keen to avoid any association with pro-EU Labour lawmakers who sought to oust the leader in 2016 amid criticism of his lackluster role in the Brexit referendum. While some of them are also pressing for a second vote, they’re a hindrance to the campaign, she said.
‘Tainted’
“The less some of the figures who are tainted with previously trying to sabotage Jeremy Corbyn are seen to push for this, the better the chances are of it getting to the conference floor,” Ivanova said by phone. “One of the reasons the petition is important is because it shows there is an appetite from the left to discuss this.”
Though not Labour policy, senior Labour officials have left open the possibility of a second referendum. Treasury spokesman John McDonnell told Bloomberg in April that the party hasn’t “ruled anything out,” though his preference was for a general election.
Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, told the BBC last month that if there’s no divorce deal, or if Parliament rejects the agreement May brings back from Brussels, “the sensible thing is to keep all our options on the table.”
Buckley said he expects about 200 of the 647 Labour constituency parties to consider his group’s motion by the deadline of Sept. 13, and as many as 50 of them to send it to conference as the one item they are permitted to propose for debate. Nine have so far chosen to do so.
Delegates would then vote on the first day of conference on whether it should be added to the official agenda -- alongside other motions on the health service, education or the economy.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 11:57PM ET</span>",BOJ board disagreed on new tolerance for yield moves at last meeting,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan board members disagreed on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target when they crafted steps to make monetary stimulus more sustainable, a summary of opinions from the last rate review showed.
There were also divisions between those in the nine-member board who were worried about the rising demerits of prolonged easing, and those who wanted to continue focusing on reflating growth with aggressive monetary stimulus, the summary showed.
The rift underscores the policy challenges the BOJ faces as subdued inflation forces the central bank to maintain its radical stimulus program despite the mounting costs such as the hit of near-zero rates on bank profits.
At the July 30-31 policy meeting, the BOJ kept its pledge to guide long-term interest rates around zero percent, but said it would allow yields to move more flexibly.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a post-meeting briefing that the bank would allow long-term yields to move at double the previous range of around minus 0.1 percent to 0.1 percent.
However, one board member said the BOJ should allow yields to move upward and downward by around 0.25 percent, referring to recent yield moves in other major economies, according to the summary, which was released on Wednesday.
The summary does not identify which members made the comments.
""Controlling long-term yields in a flexible manner is likely to contribute to maintaining and improving market functions. Even if interest rates rise somewhat from the current level, its effects on economic activity and prices are likely to be limited,"" the board member was quoted as saying.
Another board member warned against allowing long-term rates to rise much, saying that doing so when inflation expectations remained weak could push up real borrowing costs and weigh on price growth, the summary showed.
Japanese bond yields hit a 1-1/2 year high last week, as investors tested the limits of the BOJ's new commitment to allow debt markets to move more freely.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent.
While the central bank has successfully controlled yields around the target, its dominance shrank liquidity in the bond market to the extent there had been days in recent months when the benchmark 10-year bond was not traded at all.
Concerns over the dwindling trade volume was partly behind the BOJ's decision last week to allow yields to rise more.
There were also discussions last week on whether the BOJ should ramp up stimulus, instead of taking steps to make the current framework more sustainable, reflecting views within the board that it would take longer than expected to achieve the bank's 2 percent inflation target.
""It is necessary to strengthen monetary easing itself"" instead of taking steps to prepare for a long-term battle to achieve the BOJ's price target, one member was quoted as saying.
Several members, on the other hand, called for more focus on addressing the side effects of prolonged easing. One member said the BOJ must continue to examine whether there was room to review its policy to mitigate the demerits, the summary showed.
A finance ministry representative present at the meeting said the government ""welcomes"" the BOJ's measures, in a sign the moves had endorsement from premier Shinzo Abe's administration, the summary showed.

But the government also saw the BOJ's move as a sign it will maintain its massive stimulus, another government representative said, suggesting Abe remains opposed to any attempts to dial back the bank's massive monetary stimulus.

221,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>","RBA's Lowe Sees Inflation Reaching Target in 2020, Rates on Hold","(Bloomberg) -- Australian central bank chief Philip Lowe said inflation is expected to reach the 2.5 percent target midpoint in 2020 and the interest-rate outlook is unchanged.
“We see reasonable prospects that the economy will record good growth, the unemployment rate will come down gradually and that inflation will increase over time,” Lowe said in the text of a speech Wednesday. “If this is how things evolve, you could expect the next move in interest rates to be up, not down,” he said, reiterating there was no strong case for a near-term change to policy.
In his speech, Lowe mounted a strong defense of the nation’s immigration program and its role in supporting economic growth. Citing the population hitting 25 million on Tuesday, the governor noted that Australia’s median age of 37 is one of the youngest among advanced economies. More than 80 percent of net overseas migration has been accounted for by people under the age of 35, he said.
Lowe said the labor market is “gradually tightening” and would likely lift both wages and inflation at some point, reiterating that unemployment would fall to around 5 percent in the next couple of years from the current 5.4 percent. The Reserve Bank has kept rates at a record-low 1.5 percent for two years as it seeks to play an anchor role in the economy to encourage businesses to boost investment and hiring.
Lowe said employment strength was evident in increased job vacancies, with the number as a share of the labor force at the highest level “in many years.” While he acknowledged that the desired full employment level -- currently estimated at a 5 percent jobless rate -- could eventually end up being lower, he was still confident pay would rise and inflation accelerate.
‘Best Course’
“If we were to make faster progress than we currently expect, any future increase in interest rates is likely to be earlier,” he told an audience in Sydney. “Conversely, slower progress would likely see a longer period without” a change.
“For the time being, the Reserve Bank Board’s judgement remains that the best course is to maintain the cash rate at its current level,” Lowe said.
Australia’s rapidly growing population, which hit 25 million some three decades earlier than the government forecast near the turn of the century, provides a basis for optimism about the future of the economy. The immigration program is fueling an increasingly strident debate, with opponents arguing it’s changing the complexion of the country, pushing up house prices and driving down wages.
The governor noted that the step up in migration also reflects the increase in overseas students and policies around their visas. There are currently half a million students, and in recent times about one-sixth have stayed to live and work after completing their studies.
“This has boosted our population,” Lowe said. “It has also boosted the nation’s human capital. People living in Australia who were born overseas are more likely than the average Australian to have a post-secondary school qualification.”
The governor also provided a quick picture of households, arguing their debt position was improving and risks in the financial system had been reduced through tighter lending standards. Australia’s household debt to income ratio is 190 percent, among the world’s highest.
Despite that, he said consumption growth would still be around 3 percent over the next couple of years.
“We do, though, need to keep a close eye on the housing market and housing finance,” Lowe said.
The RBA will release its updated quarterly economic forecasts on Friday.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 11:14PM ET</span>",Superyacht linked to 1MDB probe arrives at Malaysian port,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A $250 million superyacht, impounded as part of a hunt for assets linked to the multi-billion dollar investigation into 1Malaysia Development Bhd, arrived at a port in Malaysia on Tuesday about six months after it was seized.
The Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity was first seized in the Indonesian holiday venue of Bali in February at the request of U.S. authorities investigating 1MDB.
The Malaysian state fund is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
The yacht is among assets that included real estate, jewelry and a Picasso painting that the DOJ says were bought with funds stolen from 1MDB.
The yacht cruised into Port Klang, near Kuala Lumpur, amid tight security, flanked by marine police boats, as media and onlookers gathered to catch a glimpse of the ship.
Once docked, dozens of Malaysian enforcement officers boarded to serve an arrest warrant on the vessel, inspect it and question the crew. Indonesia, which had impounded the yacht, handed it over to Malaysia on Monday.
Malaysian Attorney General Tommy Thomas said in a statement that the yacht was brought to Malaysia after legal treaties between Indonesia, the United States and Malaysia were activated.
""1MDB claims ownership to this vessel... as they believe that their money was misappropriated and used to purchase the vessel,"" said Sitpah Selvaratnam, a lawyer representing 1MDB.
Sitpah, part of the group inspecting the yacht, said the vessel carried 17 crew members and appeared to be in good condition.
GOLD LEAF INTERIOR, SWIMMING POOL, MOVIE THEATER
The DOJ has alleged in lawsuits filed in the United States that the 300-ft (91-m) yacht was bought by Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, with funds diverted from 1MDB.
Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Low, whose whereabouts are unknown. Low, whose Malaysia passport has been revoked, has previously denied any wrongdoing.
According to yachtcharterfleet.com, a website for luxury charters, the Equanimity has an interior clad in marble and gold leaf, a spa and sauna, a 20-metre (66-ft) swimming pool, a movie theater, a lift and a helipad.
Owners of the yacht, Equanimity (Cayman) Ltd., said in a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday that the Malaysian government took the vessel in direct violation of an existing Indonesian court decision and an order of the U.S. court.
""Although the Indonesian and U.S. court proceedings had led to conflicting decisions regarding the status of the yacht, both proceedings at least had been open and transparent, with Equanimity (Cayman) Ltd. being given a fair opportunity to present its positions and arguments,"" the statement said.
""Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for whatever actions were undertaken by the Government of Malaysia to seize the yacht,"" it added.
The owners filed a petition in a U.S. court earlier contesting the handover of the vessel to Malaysia calling it an ""unlawful and extrajudicial"" seizure.
The petition also questioned the lawfulness of a warrant issued by the Indonesian police to turnover the vessel to Malaysia.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ousted his predecessor Najib Razak in an election in May. He immediately launched an investigation into 1MDB, which had been founded by Najib. Najib has denied any wrongdoing.

223,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 09:50PM ET</span>",U.S. to Raise Tariffs on $16 Billion of China Goods on Aug. 23,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. said it will begin imposing 25 percent duties on an additional $16 billion in Chinese imports in two weeks, escalating a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Customs will begin collecting the duties on 279 product lines, down from 284 items on the initial list, as of Aug. 23, the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The new list covers products ranging from motorcycles to steam turbines and railway cars.
It will be the second time the U.S. slaps duties on Chinese goods in about the past month, despite complaints by American companies that such moves will raise business costs and eventually consumer prices. The U.S. levied 25 percent duties on $34 billion in Chinese goods on July 6, prompting swift in-kind retaliation from Beijing. China has vowed to strike back again, dollar-for-dollar, on the $16 billion tranche.
The total could increase soon. The USTR is reviewing 10 percent tariffs on a further $200 billion in Chinese imports, and is even considering raising the rate to 25 percent. Those duties could be in place after a comment period ends on Sept. 6.
President Donald Trump has suggested he may tax effectively all imports of Chinese goods, which reached more than $500 billion last year.
A U.S.-China trade war will reduce global output by 0.7 percent by 2020, with China’s economy taking a 1.3 percent hit and U.S. GDP dropping 1 percent, Oxford Economics said in a research note Tuesday, before the new list was released. While there’s no major risk of the world lapsing into “damaging stagflation,” the possibility remains of a “bigger blow-up” that sharply reduces trade, as in the 1930s, it said.
Log Splitters
Among the products removed from the earlier list on $16 billion of imports were shipping containers, including those used by freight companies. Schneider National Carriers Inc. and other firms testified during a hearing July 24-25 in Washington that there are no U.S. manufacturers and that the containers are almost exclusively made in China.
Also removed were splitting, slicing or paring machines. Joseph Cohen, chief executive officer of New Jersey-based Snow Joe LLC, which makes log splitters, had asked that they be taken off the list.
The final list did not remove tariffs on fertilizer distributors, which Jane Hardy, chief executive officer of Brinly-Hardy Co. In Indiana, testified on July 24 could be the “nail in our coffin” for her firm after 179 years in business.
Over the weekend, Trump said he had the upper hand in the trade war, while Beijing responded through state media by saying it was ready to endure the economic fallout.
Upper Hand
The U.S. and China have been trying to restart high-level talks that broke off after Trump followed through on his tariff threats. Representatives of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations, according to two people familiar with the efforts.
The two sides held three rounds of formal talks, beginning with a delegation to Beijing led by Mnuchin in May. After Liu visited Washington later that month, the nations released a joint statement pledging to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, among other things. But within days, Trump himself backed away from the deal, saying talks would “probably have to use a different structure.”
Negotiations broke off after the Trump administration imposed the tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports, a move the Chinese said would void any promises they’d made in negotiations.
Trump’s mission to reduce the U.S. trade deficit via the threat of tariffs has brought him into conflict with China as well as U.S. allies, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a global trade war the International Monetary Fund has warned may undermine the strongest economic upswing in years.
(Updates with items removed from previous list from 7th paragraph. A previous version of this story was corrected to fix the end date for the comment period on $200 billion in tariffs.)"
224,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:56PM ET</span>",Banca Carige says ECB made no reference to possible 'resolution',"MILAN (Reuters) - Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) said on Tuesday the European Central Bank (ECB) had made no reference to a possible ""resolution"" of the Italian bank in rejecting its latest capital plan, dismissing a risk flagged by Moody's ratings agency following a downgrade. 
Resolution is a procedure that ensures the orderly liquidation of banks and involves a series of measures used by the authorities as an alternative to bankruptcy proceedings.
Boardroom conflicts have thrust Carige, Italy's last remaining large problem bank, into the spotlight, putting at risk a turnaround which was just starting to bear fruit.
The lender is facing a management crisis after its chairman, deputy chairman and several board members resigned in disagreement over the leadership of Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino.
In July, the ECB had given the Genoa-based lender until the end of the year to close a capital shortfall, or to start seeking a merger with a stronger peer.
Earlier on Tuesday, Moody's downgraded Carige and placed it under review for further downgrade, citing governance tensions which it said were ""an impediment to the bank's effective restructuring"". 
It also said there was ""the heightened risk that Carige could be placed in resolution"" after the European Central Bank rejected the lender's capital conservation plan last month.
However, Carige said the ECB's decision ""does not contain any reference to a possible resolution"".
Fiorentino is overseeing a balance-sheet clean-up demanded by the ECB and last year managed to pull off a capital increase needed to keep Carige in business.
But its failure this year to issue a hybrid bond that would have boosted its lower-quality capital means Carige's total capital ratio lags a 13.1 percent threshold set by the ECB.
Carige said the ECB had rejected the bank's latest capital plan and had asked for new measures by Nov. 30 that would allow the lender to comply with mandatory capital levels by Dec. 30.
Italy's 10th largest bank is betting on asset sales to boost its total capital ratio to 13 percent, up from the current 11.9 percent and close to a 13.125 percent threshold set by the ECB.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, the lender said it would enter exclusive talks with Bain Capital until Oct. 15 regarding the sale of an unlikely-to-pay loan portfolio with a gross book value of up to 400 million euros ($464 million). 

Carige added its board had approved the text of its reply to the ECB, which it would send to the European authorities within the prescribed timeframe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday as it published a final tariff list targeting 279 imported product lines.
The action is the latest by U.S. President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions after imposing tariffs on $34 billion in goods last month. China has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree. 
The latest $16 billion list will hit semiconductors from China, even though many of the basic chips in these products originate from the United States, Taiwan or South Korea. 
The 25 percent tariffs also will apply to a broad range of Chinese electronics, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has said benefit from the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial plan, aimed at making China competitive in high-technology industries.
The Semiconductor Industry Association expressed disappointment at USTR's decision to keep the sector on the tariff list.
""We have made the case to the administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt America’s chipmakers, not China’s, and will do nothing to stop China’s problematic and discriminatory trade practices,"" SIA President John Neuffer said in a statement.
USTR removed a handful of items from its original list after a 46-day public comment and review period found they would cause ""severe economic harm.""
These were intermodal shipping containers, floating docks, splitting and slicing machines used with wood, bone and hard plastics, extremely thin slicing tools known as microtomes, and alginic acid, derived from seaweed and used in pharmaceuticals, textile printing and dental impressions.
The latest list brings the total Chinese imports that face a 25 percent tariff to about $50 billion in a rapidly escalating trade war that could eventually slap duties on all goods traded between the world's two largest economies.

Trump has also threatened 25 percent tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, and possibly another $300 billion worth, in his administration's quest for changes to China's intellectual property, market access and industrial subsidy policies.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>",How to rebuild when divorce derails your retirement,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Divorce crushed Dennis Nolte's retirement plans not once but twice.
The first time, which was more than 20 years ago, ""everything burned to the ground,"" Nolte said. He had to start over financially from scratch. The second divorce was rough, too, but he was better prepared.
What happened in between is that Nolte rebuilt, little by little, using what he knows as a certified financial planner and former therapist.
Giving up retirement assets can be one of the biggest psychological blows in a divorce. The other assets that couples typically divvy up, like a house and cash, are usually in joint accounts.
When splitting pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s, which all require legal documents, couples can choose a straight 50-50 split or a more creative swap. When incomes and savings are equal, sometimes both parties just walk away with their own pots. No matter what, each spouse ends up with less money than they had been expecting to carry them through the rest of their lives together.
Overall in the United States, divorced households have about 30 percent less net worth than non-divorced households, and have a 7 percentage point higher risk of not having enough money to last through retirement, according to a new study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
At first, ""there's a lot of crying,"" says Michelle Buonincontri, a certified financial planner and certified divorce financial analyst based in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
Rebuilding your retirement nest egg after a divorce is complicated because qualified retirement plans have contribution restrictions. 
You might lose $250,000 from your 401(k) in a divorce agreement, but you can only invest $18,500 per year, or $24,500 if you are over 50. And IRAs and Roths are limited to contributions of $5,500 per year, with restrictions related to age and income. Pensions are walled off completely. 
TIME ON YOUR SIDE
A financial strategy as well as a bit of saving psychology will help you get back on your feet. 
What kept Nolte going is that he knew time was on his side after his first divorce, even though he had to cash in his whole retirement IRA for small business owners to maintain two households, pay lawyers and fund the divorce settlement. 
""At 40, you still have the benefit of compounding,"" said Nolte, who is now 61 and based near Orlando, Florida. 
Financial planner Rose Sanger had a high-income client who found himself in a similar situation - he had to give up half of a seven-figure 401(k) balance in a divorce and was very down about it. Sanger suggested he continue to max out his current contributions in his retirement plan but also auto-deduct another couple of thousand of dollars and stash that money in a taxable investment account.
""That helps build up an emergency fund and set aside money for savings,"" Sanger said.
More than five years later, her client now has more than $250,000 in his 401(k), and more than $100,000 in his taxable account.
The situation for the spouse on the receiving end of the retirement accounts, who might have been a stay-at-home parent during the marriage or just earned less, also has challenges. Things get even more complicated when the receiving spouse is past retirement age because you cannot contribute to accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs unless you have earned income, and Social Security does not count. 
One of Deirdre Prescott's clients got a $500,000 chunk of her ex-husband's IRA but she is now 62 and no longer working as a teacher. Prescott is working with her to bridge the gap between when her client's alimony runs out in two years and when she taps Social Security. (Delaying retirement benefits until age 70 greatly increases the amount you get each month.)
Prescott's client plans to live off other assets and some modest free-lance income. The key part of the strategy is to take advantage of her low tax bracket. 
She will convert as much of that traditional pre-tax IRA into a Roth IRA, which allows contributions to grow tax-free. She will have to pay income taxes on the amount she transfers, but the account will then grow tax free, and she will not be subject to required minimum distributions at 70 1/2 like she would be with an IRA.

""She came in completely panicked but if she continues to live modestly and puts off taking Social Security, she should be OK,"" Prescott said.

227,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",It's the Politics Stupid! Jobs Risk for Australia's Central Bank,"(Bloomberg) -- Politics is shaping up as the wild card for Australia’s central bank, which is set to stick to the script when it releases economic forecasts later this week by forecasting stronger growth, a gradual pickup in inflation and a slow drop in unemployment.
A tight election race that needs to be be held by May risks spurring a hiring slump, says Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac Banking Corp., just as it did around the previous two polls.
Opinion polls and the government’s slim majority “point to considerable political uncertainty,” Evans said. “If businesses acted cautiously during the lead up and the aftermath of the last two federal elections then we cannot rule out a repeat in 2019. Certainly the bank’s assumption of a healthy 1.6 percent – 1.8 percent jobs market over that period would be challenged.”
Surveys have consistently shown the government lagging the opposition Labor party, which wants to scrap a planned corporate tax cut and wind back personal income tax reductions for wealthier Australians. In an environment of stagnant real wages and interest rates, fiscal stimulus is the only option for helping boost incomes and supporting consumption.
The central bank in May forecast economic growth will accelerate to an annual 3.25 percent by December and then to 3.5 percent by June 2019, which is well above Treasury’s estimate of the economy’s speed limit at 2.75 percent. In the RBA’s policy statement Tuesday, when it left rates at a record-low 1.5 percent, the central bank said that unemployment is expected to fall “over the next couple of years” to around 5 percent.
“Recent history around election periods raises significant uncertainty about the sustainability of the bank’s employment forecasts and hence their expectation of above- trend economic growth,” said Evans.
Governor Philip Lowe speaks in Sydney Wednesday and the Reserve Bank’s updated estimates will be released Friday."
228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","EU Banker Exodus Hits London Home Prices, Says BOE's McCafferty","(Bloomberg) -- An outflow of European bankers from London is damping prices and rents in the capital’s housing market, Bank of England policy maker Ian McCafferty said on Tuesday.
“We have seen an exodus of people -- such that certain properties in London are now finding it harder and the prices in London are now reacting,” McCafferty, who is due to leave the BOE this month, said in response to listener questions on LBC Radio. “We’re getting stories that the number of French and German and other European bankers that are coming to London has fallen quite sharply over the course of the last couple of years.”
London’s housing market has seen prices decline this year, as Brexit and slower growth dent demand after a three-decade boom that left valuations stretched. McCafferty said that the capital is seeing “significant change as a result of uncertainty around Brexit.”
The BOE, which hiked interest rates for the second time since the financial crisis last week, noted the weakness in the capital in its August Inflation Report. Policy makers said it may “reflect a fall in net EU migration, alongside wider Brexit uncertainty.”
“The number of EU nationals in London appears to have fallen slightly since the EU referendum,” they said. “As EU nationals make up around 12 percent of households in London and 20 percent of the private rental sector, that fall will affect demand for housing services and therefore house prices and rents.”
The BOE’s decision to raise interest rates garnered criticism from some economists, who said doing so ahead of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union could prove to be a mistake. Carney was also criticized by pro-Brexit lawmakers for wading into the political debate after he said that the chance of a no-deal Brexit is “uncomfortably high.”
In comments that could further stoke that criticism, McCafferty said Tuesday that a no-deal Brexit would be a negative for the economy. Known as possibly the most hawkish member of the BOE’s rate-setting committee, He is due to leave the central bank at the end of the month, and will be replaced by Jonathan Haskel, an expert on productivity.
Sam Woods, the BOE’s top financial services supervisor, said last month that the number of U.K. finance jobs lost to the continent by Brexit day may be “slightly below” the BOE’s estimated range of 5,000 to 10,000. It’s impossible to predict with accuracy how many jobs may ultimately be lost, because so much depends on Britain’s future relationship with the EU, he said."
229,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Dollar Debt Will Be Elusive to Turkey as U.S. Sanctions Bite,"(Bloomberg) -- The summer holiday in the bond market may be a long one for Turkey.
New dollar issuance, including government and corporate-sector bonds, has dried up, with no sales recorded since April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And with corporate-bond losses among the worst in emerging markets amid a plunge in the lira, the dollar-debt market may be shut for some time to come.
The U.S. announced sanctions on two Turkish ministers last week over its continued detention of an American pastor on espionage and terrorism-related charges. Yields on Turkish debt soared and the lira sank to new lows as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to retaliate, and said the country’s economy is under attack. The lira has weakened 7.4 percent against the dollar this month, extending this year’s slide to 28 percent.
“I would say right now the primary market is closed to Turkey,” said Meno Stroemer, the Zurich-based head of corporate bonds at Fisch Asset Management AG, which oversees about $10 billion. “You have the U.S. sending a loud message that an escalation of sanctions is very much on the table. We have seen what the sanctions can do in Russia and things can get very complicated and problematic; that is clearly a risk investors are dealing with.”
Bondholders investing in hard-currency corporate debt from Turkey lost 8.9 percent this year, even more than they did in Argentina, which had to go to the International Monetary Fund for emergency funding. Turkish banks accounted for four of the 10 worst-performing corporate bonds this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The average yield on Turkish dollar debt of 7.8 percent compares with 7.34 percent for Nigeria and 7.25 percent for Pakistan, countries that have much lower credit ratings. Even that may not be enough to compensate investors for the risks of further U.S. sanctions.
‘Non-Negligible Risk’
“Foreign investor demand can still be managed with yields on offer up to a certain degree,” said Okan Akin, a credit analyst at AllianceBernstein Ltd. in London. “If the U.S. sanctions worsen, Turkey can be completely locked out of markets, which is a non-negligible risk as things stand at the moment.”
Dollar-denominated June 2028 bonds of Turkiye Is Bankasi AS lost 25 percent, while Akbank TAS’s March 2027 securities declined 22 percent. High yields in the secondary market may mean that issuers will wait for asset prices to stabilize before testing the waters, even though they have $17 billion foreign-exchange debt coming due by the end of next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“In current market conditions any new issue in dollars will have to come at significant discount to secondary levels,” said Andrey Kuznetsov, a money manager at Hermes Investment Management in London, which oversees $43 billion. This “is likely to prove unattractive to issuers who can wait for more favorable market conditions,” he said.
The cost of insuring Turkish debt against default climbed to the highest since 2009 on Tuesday.
“We had a massive selloff and at this point it looks like there is no end in sight,” said Claudia Calich, a money manager at M&G Ltd. in London, which manages $454 billion. “In theory they should have access to the market but in practice the story is looking quite complicated, to say the least.”

At the request or Brazil’s attorney general, Judge Kassio Marques on Tuesday ruled that the shutdown of the Brazilian border to Venezuelans constituted a “violation of the exercise of rights assured by modern law,” according to a statement from the attorney general’s office.
Brazil’s federal police said it reopened the border in the northern state of Roraima on Tuesday morning, following the judge’s orders.
An estimated 16,000 Venezuelans poured into Roraima in the first six months of this year, according to the news portal G1, overwhelming public services in the sparsely populated state. With just 10 homeless shelters catering for around 4,000 people in the state, many of them are now sleeping in the streets. The government has so far relocated just 820 refugees to other parts of Brazil. Reports of criminality and prostitution in Boa Vista, the state capital, are on the rise, leading to increased tension between migrants and locals.
The injunction barring the entry of Venezuelans in Roraima was issued on Sunday by Judge Helder Girao Barreto. It was supposed to remain in effect until the government stepped up efforts to relocate migrants and improved the facilities available to receive them.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 11:18AM ET</span>",YOUR MONEY: Retirement planning the Dr. Strange way,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the recent film smash “Avengers: Infinity War,” superhero Doctor Strange analyzes more than 14 million possible futures to figure out how to defeat the evil Thanos and save humanity.
Well, he has nothing on Stephen Wendel.
Wendel, head of behavioral science for Chicago-based investment research firm Morningstar, looked at more like 400 million possible futures for his white paper “Easing the Retirement Crisis.""
The planning simulations - using almost 4,000 real families - took six months to run through a gigantic computing platform. The goal: Figure out what specific financial behaviors will get you where you need to be, and which do not work. 
Step one in this time-traveling exercise was to admit where we are in terms of retirement savings, in order to figure out where we need to go. The picture is not pretty.
“We even used very optimistic assumptions, such as that Social Security would be fully funded and that people’s pensions would still be there,” said Wendel. “Even then, only about a quarter of working households are on track to have what they need in retirement.”
That dire news assumes a decent stock market. If you figure that the stock market has below-average years ahead, then the 25 percent number of retirement-ready households drops to 18.5 percent. Even worse: If Social Security falters, the number tanks to 9 percent.
NEXT STEPS
There are eight different “levers” you can work to alter your retirement outlook, Wendel's research found. These are actions like saving more, spending less, delaying retirement, boosting your equity exposure, chasing higher returns and so on.
If you choose just one, you have to get pretty extreme, like slashing your standard of living to 40 percent of your pre-retirement salary, for instance, rather than the standard 80 percent. Or you could delay your retirement age by a full decade.
If you combine multiple strategies, you can have more modest-but-achievable progress, Wendel said. Unlike ""Infinity War,"" which comes down to only one possible solution, with these 400 million retirement scenarios there are many ways out. 
For instance, if households saved a minimum of 6 percent a year, and delayed retirement by just a couple of years until age 67, the effect is dramatic. The current 25 percent of households that would be okay in retirement shoots up to 71 percent, according to Wendel's Morningstar data.
While retirement readiness is ultimately a personal mission, employers could help out, too: “The most common default for retirement savings in workplace plans is still 3 percent,” said Wendel. “Everybody in the industry knows this is woefully low.” 
A better starting point for 401(k) plans that would automatically place most Americans on a much better retirement path is 6 percent, Wendel noted.
Some other levers, by the way, are not as effective, the study found. So do not obsess about things like getting your allocation perfect or trying to chase better returns, which are not going to move the needle all that much. Instead focus on the big guns in your arsenal like saving more, spending less and working longer.
That holds true across all age categories, by the way. Even for older, mass-affluent households, who are coming to the end of their contribution years, asset allocation is still the least impactful lever.

""You don’t have to do anything really extreme to get back on the right track. You just have to make multiple small changes,” said Wendel.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 10:24AM ET</span>",No-deal Brexit? What it might mean for Britain,"By William Schomberg and Tom Miles
LONDON/GENEVA (Reuters) - The prospect of a ""no-deal Brexit"" appears to have grown after the European Union's negotiator rejected last month central elements of Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals for a new trade agreement.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Friday the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without striking any deal with Brussels was ""uncomfortably high"". Trade minister Liam Fox has put the chances at 60-40.
May's office repeated on Monday she believed Britain would negotiate a good agreement but that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"".
The pound hit an 11-month low against the dollar on Monday with traders linking this partly to the possibility of no deal. It rose modestly on Tuesday.
Following are some questions and answers about what a no-deal Brexit might mean.
What will happen if Britain and the EU fail to get a deal?
Britain is a member of the World Trade Organization so tariffs and other terms governing its trade with the EU would be set under WTO rules.
EU tariffs are quite low, averaging about 5 percent, but they are higher for some important British exports including cars which would face a 10 percent tariff.
Exporters could face other barriers including complying with EU standards for goods such as food and electrical products. British exports might get stuck at the EU border.
    Many British services firms, especially in the giant financial industry, would probably face more restrictions on doing business in the bloc than under May's preferred deal.
Under WTO rules Britain and the EU could not offer each other low tariffs, quick border checks, or close cooperation on services, unless they offered these to all WTO member states.
What's the downside of a no-deal Brexit?
Most economists say the higher the barriers are to trade with the EU, the bigger the hit for Britain.
The National Institute for Economic and Social Research says a no-deal Brexit would cost each person in Britain 800 pounds ($1,030) a year more than the effect of a ""soft Brexit"" under which Britain had ties to the EU similar to Norway's. May's plan would cost 500 pounds per person a year more than a soft Brexit.
The impact on Britain's economy could be bigger still if business investment falls, aggravating slow productivity growth, or a fall in migration causes labor shortages. 
What's the upside to a no-deal Brexit?
Brexit supporters argue that WTO rules would help Britain's economy by making it easier for London to strike its own trade deals with faster-growing countries and regions beyond Europe.
However, this would take years and Britain on its own might struggle to secure favorable terms from the likes of the United States and China.
Ruth Lea, a pro-Brexit economist, said the concerns about border delays were overblown, because countries outside the EU typically declare their exports online to speed their passage.
Brexit backers also say Britain could save its estimated EU divorce bill of around 39 billion pounds and spend this on public services instead.
Will a no-deal Brexit mean chaos?
With less than eight months until Britain leaves the EU, time is short to negotiate an agreement or prepare both sides for the possibility of no deal.
Any disorderly Brexit risks delays at borders as officials struggle with a sudden introduction of new customs rules. 
Britain's government is drawing up plans to stockpile medicines and blood products before a possible no-deal Brexit.
In the worst-case scenario, Britain would fall out of EU arrangements such as the U.S.-EU aviation Open Skies agreement, possibly causing transport chaos. Financial derivatives trading would face legal uncertainty.
EU citizens in Britain and British citizens in the EU would risk losing residency and other rights.
Given the potential for disruption, the EU might offer to extend the Brexit negotiation period if there were some prospect of a deal, Malcolm Barr, a JP Morgan economist, said. 

""The EU knows that a no-deal Brexit would hurt all involved and would be an enormously complex problem to manage,"" he said.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>",New Trump sanctions on Iran take effect despite pleas from allies,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh and Peter Graff
BEIRUT/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday that firms doing business with Tehran would be barred from the United States, as new U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect in spite of pleas from Washington's allies.
Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.
Trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington's main European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.
The European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of U.S. sanctions and persuade their firms not to pull out. But that has proven difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business.
""These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Monday Iran's only chance of escaping sanctions would be to take up an offer to negotiate with Trump for a tougher deal.
""They could take up the president's offer to negotiate with them, to give up their ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs fully and really verifiably,"" Bolton told Fox News.
""If the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze, they should come and sit down. The pressure will not relent while the negotiations go on,"" said Bolton, one of the administration's main hawks on Iran.
REMOVE THE KNIFE
Washington accepts that Iran has complied with the terms of the 2015 deal reached under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, but says the agreement is flawed because it is not strenuous enough. Iran says it will continue to abide by the deal for now, if other countries can help protect it from the economic impact of Washington's decision to pull out.
Tuesday's sanctions target Iran's purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and auto sector. Global oil prices rose on Tuesday on concern sanctions could cut world supply, although the toughest measures targeting Iran's oil exports do not take effect for four more months.
Brent crude oil futures were up 75 cents to $74.50 per barrel at 1337 GMT and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 32 cents at $69.33 a barrel.
""It is a reality check that this is happening and that Iran's oil exports will be hurt when the oil sanctions hit it in November,"" chief commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) Bjarne Schieldrop said.
In a speech hours before the sanctions were due to take effect, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani rejected negotiations as long as Washington was no longer complying with the deal.
""If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,"" Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.
""We are always in favor of diplomacy and talks...But talks need honesty,"" Rouhani said.
The nuclear deal is closely associated in Iran with Rouhani, a relative moderate who won two landslide elections on promises to open up the economy to the outside world.
European countries fear that by abandoning the deal, Washington risks undermining Rouhani and strengthening the hand of his more hardline opponents, who have long argued that the West would never allow Iran to prosper.
Britain, France, Germany and the EU as a bloc said in a joint statement on Monday: ""We deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S.""
Since the sanctions were initially lifted two years ago, Iranian oil exports have risen. But many Iranians have yet to see major economic improvement, and the prospect that Washington would re-impose sanctions helped drive a collapse in the value of Iran's currency this year, raising the cost of imports.
There have been protests in Iran this year against rising prices, and the security forces have responded firmly. Perhaps seeking to head off more unrest, Iran announced steps this week to make it easier to access foreign currency, and said it was prosecuting an ex-central bank official for economic crimes.
""[Sanctions] will definitely make daily life harder for Iranians,"" said Saeed Leylaz, a Tehran-based economist and political analyst. ""But if the government has a serious plan they can control the situation.""
Few American companies do much business in Iran, an enemy of the United States since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington's ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there.
Among large European companies that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France's oil major Total and its big carmakers PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA).

""We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions"", said German car and truck manufacturer Daimler.

The executives are traveling to Trump’s golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he’s in the middle of what the White House calls a working vacation. The president will be joined by aides including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner; Larry Kudlow, his top economic adviser; and deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Chris Liddell.

Richard LeFrak, a real estate tycoon who is an informal adviser to Trump, will also participate.
Trump enjoys business leaders’ support for the tax law he signed last year and a deregulation agenda -- policies his administration contends are fueling economic growth and low unemployment. But some CEOs have criticized his immigration policies and, especially, his trade war with China and U.S. allies.
His administration recently asked corporations to sign pledges to help train or retrain American workers for 21st century jobs.
“This is an opportunity for the president to hear from a number of business leaders from a variety of sizes and types of companies on how the economy is doing from their perspective and what their priorities and thoughts are for the year ahead,” said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. “These people are managing the American workforce.”
While in New Jersey, Trump has traveled to a political rally and dined with supporters to raise money and support for Republic candidates who are running in November. He signed off on the reinstatement of sanctions on Iran, and has spoken by phone and in person with lawmakers and advisers.
He has been active on Twitter, continuing to attack Democrats on immigration and criticizing California’s leaders for water policies he says are contributing to wildfires in the state. "

1. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Higher Open
U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open, with the S&P 500 set to edge closer to the all-time high it reached in January, as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings.
There was also some relief coming from the lack of escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
At 5:35AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 80 points, or roughly 0.3%, the S&P 500 futures tacked on 6 points, or about 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 25 points, or around 0.3%.
The three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Monday, with the Nasdaq recording a five-day winning streak, which was its longest since May.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses were higher in mid-morning trade, with nearly every sector in positive territory.
Among national indexes, Germany's export-heavy DAX outperformed, rising by as much as 1.1%.
Europe's gains came on the heels of a stronger trading session in Asia, where a rebound in battered Chinese stock markets helped boost sentiment.
The Shanghai Composite Index surged 2.7%, its best one-day gain in two years, as investors snapped up shares that were hit hard during a four-day losing run.
2.  Disney  , Snap, Papa John's Report Earnings
Dozens of companies are expected to release earnings today in one of the last big waves of the earnings season.
Most of the focus will fall on Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which both report after the close.
Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) results, also due after the bell, will be closely watched as the company has been engulfed in controversy over the use of a racial slur by its founder and now former CEO back in the spring.
Other high-profile names reporting today include,  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP),  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX), Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), and Dean Foods (NYSE:DF), which are all set to report during pre-market hours.
Joining Disney, Snap and Papa John's after the bell will be results from Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN),  Applied Opt  (NASDAQ:AAOI), and Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH).



This earnings season has been stronger than analysts had expected so far. Of the S&P 500 companies that had reported through Monday, almost 80% have posted better-than-expected profits, according to FactSet.
3. Dollar Falls Back
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar slipped lower, giving back some of the previous session's gains.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down roughly 0.2% to the 95.00-level, after edging up close to a one-year high of 95.35 Monday.
Elsewhere in foreign exchange markets, the euro climbed 0.3% to 1.1590 against the dollar, after falling to 1.1530 on Monday, its lowest since June 28.
The British pound was also higher, regaining ground after falling to 11-month lows amid worries over the growing prospect of a no-deal Brexit.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices ticked lower, pushing yields slightly higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield inching up to 2.95%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note rose to 2.66%.
4. Oil Prices Continue Higher Ahead Of API Data
In commodity markets, oil prices were higher, extending gains from the prior session, as the United States reintroduced sanctions against major crude exporter Iran, tightening global markets.



Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, tacked on 50 cents to $74.25 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 30 cents to $69.31.
Oil traders turned their attention to fresh data on U.S. commercial crude inventories to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
The American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report for the week ended August 3 at 4:30PM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 3.4 million barrels.
5. JOLTs Data Ahead
On the data front, the calendar is thin today, with no top-tier reports on deck.
The highlight of the day will come at 10:00 AM ET, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its job openings and labor turnover survey (JOLTS) data on job openings from June.
On average, economists expect that job openings rose to 6.74 million, although it’s unlikely a miss or beat will move stocks much given the reaction to the employment report on Friday.

238,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",U.K. Sees Brexit Deal Deadline Slipping to End-November,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is resisting the European Union’s timetable for Brexit talks and is calculating that U.S. President Donald Trump might help her.
While EU officials are signaling they want September to be a showdown moment in negotiations, the U.K. is aiming for a later deadline, according to a person familiar with the situation. May’s team thinks that by the end of November the EU will be so preoccupied with the prospect of Trump disrupting a Group of 20 summit that they will want to get the Brexit deal wrapped up, the person said.
The calculation, based on conversations with EU officials, is that leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron of France will want to present a united European front in support of the rules-based system -- with May onside -- when they meet Trump at the summit on Nov. 30, the person said.
The British approach is at odds with the plan emerging from Europe. The U.K. is due to leave the EU on March 29 and both sides have said they are aiming for a deal in October. Negotiators need to leave enough time for the U.K. and European parliaments to debate and ratify the final terms of the divorce.
Showdown
In recent weeks, European officials have said they want progress even sooner as an informal summit of leaders on Sept. 20 is now set to become a showdown Brexit meeting. EU officials have turned a summit scheduled for Oct. 18-19, which was expected to be about Brexit, into an opportunity to plot an international response to Trump’s tariff offensive.
With progress in the negotiations painfully slow, politicians in both the U.K. and the EU have begun warning that the chances of failure -- with Britain crashing out of the bloc with no deal -- have started to increase. Talks are stuck on the sensitive issue of how to keep the Irish border free of checkpoints and police after Brexit, when it will become the EU’s frontier with the U.K.

May’s team now thinks the EU’s focus on preparing to meet the U.S. president’s challenge to the global order will provide the bloc with an incentive to get a deal done ahead of the G-20 leaders’ meeting in Buenos Aires at the end of November. There is no EU summit scheduled for November, but an extra meeting could be called for the purpose of signing off the Brexit deal.
The EU has joined China and Japan in clashes with Trump over his decisions to impose tariffs on imports from his country’s biggest trading partners, and to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
Supportive
The person pointed out that May had been supportive of Merkel’s stance against Trump at the G-7 meeting in Canada in June, which ended in disarray after the president withdrew his backing from the official concluding communique.
Another person familiar with the matter confirmed that German officials want a deal before the G-20 meeting so European leaders can be united when they meet Trump. But that doesn’t mean Germany is shifting its position on Brexit.
Merkel’s team will be willing to wait to get an agreement with May if necessary, the person said, adding that Germany won’t compromise on the need to protect the integrity of the EU’s single market.
A French presidency official said the aim was still clearly to get the divorce deal settled by October. “There’s never been any deadline in September, nor November,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

An escalating trade dispute with the United States, rising corporate borrowing costs and steep declines in Chinese stocks and the yuan have raised concerns that the world's second-largest economy could face a steeper slowdown than had been expected just a few months ago.
""The main focus will be on strengthening the overall coordination of policies,"" Ma Jun, a policy adviser to the People's Bank of China (PBOC), told a financial news outlet affiliated with Xinhua News Agency.
The cabinet's Financial Stability and Development Commission (FSDC), which is headed by Vice Premier Liu He, should coordinate fiscal, monetary policies, Macro  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Assessment(MPA) and micro-level regulations, Ma said.
China's leaders have pledged to make fiscal policy ""more active"", following a debate among researchers from the central bank and finance ministry on whether fiscal policy should be used more actively to spur growth.
China's small and private firms face increased financing difficulties as banks grow more concerned about credit quality, Ma said. Tighter official scrutiny of local government investment projects has also reduced their demand for loans. 
The PBOC has been pumping out more cash by cutting banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) this year, but it has long struggled to channel credit to small firms, which are vital for economic growth and job creation, analysts said. Larger state firms, meanwhile, have traditionally had much easier and cheaper access to credit.
A central bank adviser said last week China should limit the credit impact of its multi-year campaign to reduce risks in the financial system, voicing concern that the tightening may have gone too far.
Ma also said the central bank should further improve its targeted RRR cuts and the MPA mechanism to better serve smaller firms.
The MPAs are quarterly health checks of financial institutions to determine their risk exposure, and reporting requirements have been getting progressively tougher.
In the long term, the PBOC bank should adopt a new benchmark policy rate as the intermediate policy target to replace the existing bank lending and deposit rates to help improve its policy mechanism, Ma added.
China's new bank loans hit a five-month high in June, but annual growth in outstanding total social financing slowed to 9.8 percent, the slowest on record, while broad M2 money supply growth also hit a record low of 8 percent, indicating the regulatory tightening is having an impact.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Italian ministers to hold budget meeting on Wednesday,"ROME (Reuters) - Senior officials in Italy's eurosceptic government will meet on Wednesday to discuss next year's budget, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Tuesday.
The executive that took office in Rome in June has flagged ambitious spending plans that have raised concerns on financial markets. 
In an interview with Radio24, Di Maio said the government would hold several meetings on the budget, including one on Wednesday. On Monday, he had said the government would only apply European Union fiscal rules if they did not impede its reform agenda.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week the government's ruling coalition had reached a compromise on the budget's outline.
Investor unease at the mixed messages has driven a selloff of Italian debt that on Friday briefly pushed yields on 10-year bonds (IT10YT=RR) above 3 percent for the first time since June.
While yields (IT2YT=RR) (IT10YT=RR) have since pulled back, analysts said on Tuesday the market remained vulnerable.
Di Maio told Radio24 the government planned to cut company tax contributions for employees and reform pensions. He confirmed the executive would respect electoral pledges to cut corporate and individual income taxes while increasing financial support for the unemployed.
It is unclear at this stage how these measures will be financed. Italy has the highest debt in the European Union after bailed-out Greece.
The government needs to agree its fiscal plan for next year by September and must present a draft budget to the European Commission by mid-October.
After the budget meeting last week, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, an economics professor seen as more fiscally moderate than most of his cabinet colleagues, said the outline was compatible with EU targets, which require Italy to reduce its debt.
But Di Maio cast doubt on that view on Monday, echoing remarks a day earlier from Matteo Salvini, who leads the other partner in the governing , the far-right League.

The United States and New Zealand both won WTO rulings last year against Indonesian import restrictions on food, plants and animal products, including apples, grapes, potatoes, onions, flowers, juice, dried fruit, cattle, chicken and beef.
Indonesia also lost an appeal.
The latest U.S. filing said Indonesia had not complied with the ruling, so Washington was seeking annual sanctions to compensate for the damage done to U.S. interests.
""Based on a preliminary analysis of available data for certain products, this level is provisionally estimated at up to approximately $350 million for 2017,"" it said.
""The United States will update this figure annually, as Indonesia's economy continues to expand.
Indonesia is still studying the U.S. move to seek sanctions, said Oke Nurwan, trade ministry's director general of foreign trade, adding that authorities believe Jakarta had complied with the WTO panel decision. He said rules on Indonesian food imports had already been revised.
The process of seeking compensation often take years, and Indonesia is likely to contest the size of any potential sanctions.
There was no immediate sign of a similar sanctions request from New Zealand, which said last year Indonesia's restrictions were estimated to have cost New Zealand beef sector up to NZ$1 billion. ($673 million)
Indonesia has been lobbying senior U.S. officials to keep the Southeast Asian nation on a list of countries that receive special trade terms under the Generalized System of Preferences, a facility that gives reduced tariffs to about $2 billion of Indonesian exports.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office in April said it was reviewing Indonesia's eligibility for GSP in light of Jakarta's imposition of a wide array of trade and investment barriers that create serious negative effects on U.S. commerce.
Indonesia's trade minister Enggartiasto Lukita in July said he will advise Washington that Indonesia will remove trade barriers for U.S. apples following a WTO ruling as part of lobbying for GSP.
Indonesia scrapped a quota system for beef imports in 2016.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 01:08AM ET</span>",Chinese newspaper mocks Trump's claim of winning trade war as 'wishful thinking',"By Engen Tham
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media kept up their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, with a newspaper on Tuesday describing as ""wishful thinking"" Trump's belief that a fall in Chinese stocks was a sign of his winning the trade war.
As the world's two biggest economies remained locked in a heated tariff dispute, Beijing and Washington have kept up a blistering rhetoric with threats and counter-threats of more punitive trade measures.
The editorial in the official China Daily underscored an increasingly aggressive stance adopted by Chinese state media against Trump, a shift from their previous approach of tempering any direct criticism against the U.S. president.
On Monday, the overseas edition of the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper singled out Trump, saying he was starring in his own ""street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation"".
China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, following the Trump administration's plan for a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The China Daily referred to a Saturday Tweet by Trump which said ""Tariffs are working far better than anyone anticipated. China market has dropped 27 percent in last four months.""
China's stock market was performing poorly before the U.S. administration imposed tariffs, said the English-language newspaper, asserting that the downturn was partly due to Beijing's attempts to cut corporate debt.
The paper said Trump's claim that ""tariffs are working big time"" was undermined by data showing the U.S. trade deficit climbed $3 billion to $46.3 billion in June, the first increase in four months.
The China Daily is often used by the government to communicate its message to an international audience. 
Trump has repeatedly criticized China for its trade deficit with the United States, saying it showed Beijing was engaging in unfair trade practices.
Chinese state media has also been promoting the message that the country's economy is strong enough to ride out the trade war.
In a separate commentary, in the People's Daily overseas edition, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry reiterated this stance, saying China was strong and resilient enough to weather the trade dispute.
""We absolutely have reason to believe that during this complex trade friction, and relying on the domestic market, China can continue to enhance its leading position in the global economic and industrial system,"" researcher Mei Xinyu wrote. 
Despite the U.S. tariffs, a Reuters poll of economists forecast China's exports to have grown in July, though many see a deteriorating outlook for shipments especially if Trump goes ahead with his threats to slap more punitive duties on Chinese imports

Recent data showed growth in the world's second largest economy has already started to cool. The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more ""active"" fiscal policy.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 12:19AM ET</span>","Philippine inflation accelerates in July, cements rate hike expectations","By Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine annual inflation accelerated in July and moved further away from the central bank's comfort range, strengthening expectations for further policy tightening this week. 
Inflation quickened to 5.7 percent in July, the fastest rise in over five years, due to higher food and transport costs, the National Economic Development Authority said.
It was higher than the 5.5 percent median forecast in a Reuters poll, and near the top end of the central bank's 5.1-5.8 percent estimate for the month.
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Nestor Espenilla signaled the uptick in inflation required a policy response, and the only question that needs to be answered is how strong should it be.
""We will consider all the latest data updates in determining the strength of our follow-through response in the upcoming policy meeting,"" Espenilla told reporters via mobile phone message shortly after the data was released.
July's inflation print marked the fifth straight month the rate has breached the central bank's 2-4 percent target for this year and next, leading some analysts to believe policymakers would deliver as much as a 50-basis-points rate hike on Thursday.
Espenilla said the central bank was sticking with its view that inflation will return to its target by 2019.
The central bank, which is due to meet on Aug. 9, raised its benchmark interest rate  by 25 basis points each in May and June, to tame inflation and shore up the peso, which has been battered by concerns over a widening current account deficit and capital outflows.
""The BSP (central bank) still has to continue raising rates to assure consumers and the market that inflation is well anchored,"" Bank of the Philippine Islands economist Emilio Neri told news channel ANC.
The peso  weakened slightly to 52.91 to the dollar on Tuesday morning after it closed at 52.85 on Monday. The main stock index (PSI) was down 0.58 percent.

The peso has lost 5.7 percent against the dollar this year, making it one of Asia's worst performing currencies.

Berlin tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of high-profile takeovers by Chinese companies, making it possible for the government to intervene if a buyer amassed a shareholding of 25 percent.
The Economy Ministry should be able to intervene if a non-EU investor ""acquires a direct or indirect shareholding of at least 15 percent of voting rights in a German company,"" Die Welt newspaper cited a draft law as saying.
In Germany and other countries including the United States, France, Australia and Britain, there are concerns that China and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies via takeovers.
The proposal to change the German Foreign Trade Ordinance is being coordinated with other ministries and a law that provides for more control could come into effect this year, Die Welt reported.
""When it comes to defense-related companies, critical infrastructure or certain areas of other civil security-related technologies such as IT security, we want to take a closer look in future,"" it quoted German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier as saying.
""Until now we've only been able to make checks when at least 25 percent of a company's shares have been acquired. Now we want to lower this threshold so we can review more acquisitions in sensitive economic sectors,"" he added.
Altmaier said Germany still wanted companies to invest in Germany but added attentiveness where such investment affects national security interests was part of the social market economy.
Last week the German government signaled it was prepared to use a new power to veto foreign takeovers of German companies in the case of a Chinese bid for toolmaker Leifeld. That came after Leifeld's majority owner Georg Koffler said China's Yantai Taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the German government.
Last month, a German state bank bought a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz to prevent China's state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition.
The head of Germany's domestic intelligence service has also said that Chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms, highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from China with an increase in bids.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:36PM ET</span>","Renewed U.S. sanctions target Iran's economy, Tehran cool on talks","By Lesley Wroughton and Parisa Hafezi
WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's top security adviser on Monday urged Iran to take up an offer of talks with the United States or suffer more pain from economic sanctions, but Iran's president said Washington needed first to prove it can be trusted.
Hours before revived U.S. sanctions were due to kick in, White House national security adviser John Bolton said Iran should pay heed to Trump's willingness to negotiate.
""They could take up the president's offer to negotiate with them, to give up their ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs fully and really verifiably,"" Bolton told Fox News.
""If the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze, they should come and sit down. The pressure will not relent while the negotiations go on,"" said Bolton, one of the administration's main hawks on Iran.
So-called snapback sanctions, due to come into force early on Tuesday, target Iranian purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector.
Foes for decades, the United States and Iran have been increasingly at odds over Iran's growing political and military influence in the Middle East since Trump took office in January 2017.
The renewed sanctions were among those lifted under a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran on curbing Iran's nuclear program. Trump abandoned the deal in May. Heavier U.S. sanctions, aimed at Iran's oil sector, are due in November.
Iran's rial currency has lost half its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions. The currency's collapse and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations in Iran against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. 
President Hassan Rouhani on Monday said Iran could hold talks with the United States only if Washington proved its trustworthiness.
Rouhani implied that if the United States signed up again to the nuclear deal and lifted sanctions, then that could pave the ground for negotiations.
""If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,"" Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.
""We are always in favor of diplomacy and talks. ... But talks need honesty,"" Rouhani said. He called on Iranians to unite in the face of hardship. ""There will be pressure because of sanctions, but we will overcome this with unity,"" he said.
Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal, saying it fails to address Iran’s ballistic missile program, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites, and “sunset” clauses under which some of its terms expire.
The two countries are also in dispute over Iran's involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts from Yemen to Syria and tensions between Tehran and Israel.
SANCTIONS WEAK SPOTS 
Trump plans to reintroduce more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November and wants as many countries as possible to cut their imports of Iranian oil to zero.
But the U.S. sanctions strategy has several weak spots, especially a reluctance by Europe and China to curtail business with Iran.
The European Union voiced regret on Monday at the looming U.S. sanctions.
A senior official at Iran’s economy ministry said Tehran did not think the economic impact of the sanctions would be ""massive.""
""Many countries, including Europeans, disagree with the U.S. sanctions and are willing to work with Iran,” said the official, who asked not to be named.
Iran said on Sunday it will ease foreign exchange rules, to try to halt the fall of its currency.
Iran’s net official reserves are projected to decline this year to $97.8 billion, enough to finance about 13 months of imports, the International Monetary Fund estimated in March. 
The sanctions aim to modify Iran's behavior and not bring about a ""regime change"" targeting Rouhani, U.S. officials said on a conference call on Monday. They said the government's handling of social and labor protests was a concern. 
Fear of sanctions and economic hardship have led to sporadic protests in several cities in recent days, with ordinary Iranians chanting slogans against Iranian leaders.
Trump warned on Monday of ""severe consequences"" for people or entities that fail to wind down economic activities with Iran.
""The United States is fully committed to enforcing all of our sanctions, and we will work closely with nations conducting business with Iran to ensure complete compliance,"" he said in a statement.
The European Union vowed on Monday to counter the renewal of sanctions on Iran.
The EU and other parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, China and Russia, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal.
""We deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S.,"" the bloc said in a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain.

They pledged to work on preserving financial flows and Iran's oil and gas exports - a lifeline of its economy.

247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Saudi Diplomatic Row Over Activist Gives Trudeau a Rare Boost,"(Bloomberg) -- Justin Trudeau’s attempts to export his “sunny” progressive ways have hit another roadblock, this time with Saudi Arabia. Yet unlike in recent spats with China and India, Canada’s prime minister may get a slight boost at home for his support of women’s rights.
Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties and halted new trade dealings late Sunday following comments by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland criticizing the kingdom for arrests of women’s rights activists. The standoff pits Trudeau, an outspoken champion of women’s advancement, against a Saudi government that’s taking a harder line more recently after making reforms to help women.
Trudeau’s sunny persona and “progressive” agenda, which propelled him to global rockstar status in an era of populist backlash, have found few takers abroad. In his India trip this year, he was dogged by questions of whether his government was too sympathetic toward Sikh separatists. And Trudeau rankled China with a push to adopt provisions on trade like labor, gender and environmental guarantees.
While these global clashes have at times eroded Trudeau’s popularity at home, the standoff with Saudi Arabia is unlikely to have much lasting impact. It may even shore up support for his Liberal Party, which is neck and neck in most polls with the opposition Conservatives ahead of 2019 elections. Trudeau’s backing this year has stumbled to its lowest level since the Liberals took power in 2015, with gaffes overseas contributing to the decline.
Political Calculus
“There’s a bigger issue at play, there’s the political calculus,"" pollster Nik Nanos said Monday in an interview, adding that Trudeau may have been compelled to act to assert his human rights views and boost a flagging political image. “Now you have Liberals and Tories in a dead heat and so the Liberals have to look at ways to jump start their support.""
Saudi Arabia on Sunday recalled its ambassador to Ottawa and ordered the Canadian envoy to Riyadh to leave within 24 hours, according to a Saudi Foreign Ministry statement. Canada is “seeking greater clarity” about the matter, a spokeswoman for Freeland said.
Calling out Saudi Arabia on women’s rights fits with Trudeau’s push for gender equality. He appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet when he was elected, and set up a women’s council with U.S. President Donald Trump to increase access to capital for female business owners during a visit to the White House last year.
""It could be perceived as a win domestically,"" said Bessma Momani, a professor in the department of political science at the University of Waterloo. “Will the Conservative Party want to die on the sword defending Saudi Arabia? Probably not.""
Economic Risk
The stance comes with limited economic risk for Trudeau, given that Saudi Arabia is such a small trading partner. So far this year, Canada has exported C$1.4 billion ($1.08 billion) in merchandise goods to Saudi Arabia and imported C$2 billion, according to Statistics Canada data.
“I would expect the Canadian public would be supportive of the position that Canada has taken, calling for greater respects of human rights in Saudi Arabia,"" said Roland Paris, a University of Ottawa professor and former Trudeau foreign policy adviser. ""I don’t think that this poses any serious domestic political challenge for the Trudeau government, but it may pose a challenge for specific Canadian exporters.”
Saudi investments in Canada include G3 Global Holdings Ltd., a joint venture between Bunge Ltd. and Saudi Agricultural & Livestock Investment Co., which purchased the former Canadian Wheat Board in 2015. Saudi Arabia has invested about $6 billion in Canadian businesses since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Tanks, armored vehicles and parts and motor vehicles accounted for about 45 percent of Canada’s 2016 exports to the kingdom, while crude oil and copper ores made up about 98 percent of imports, according to a Canadian government report. Saudi Arabia supplies oil to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick. Messages seeking comment sent to Irving, Bunge and G3 weren’t immediately returned. Markets were closed Monday for a holiday across most of Canada.
The loonie was little changed against the U.S. dollar, at 76.90 cents.
SNC Impact
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., Canada’s biggest engineering and construction company, is seeing ""no immediate impact"" to its operations in Saudi Arabia, according to Daniela Pizzuto, a spokeswoman. The Montreal-based firm has been operating in Saudi Arabia for five decades and last month signed a five-year agreement to provide engineering services to a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Gulf Oil Co. SNC is already building various facilities at a gas processing plant operated by Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest exporter of crude.
""We trust that this situation will be resolved at the earliest opportunity,"" Pizzuto said in an email Monday. “We greatly value the relationships that have been built and our contributions to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""
Rex Brynen, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said the spat may hurt Trudeau ""slightly"" but won’t become a major domestic issue other than giving the opposition Conservative Party some political ammunition.
""The Conservatives will say Trudeau talks big and goofs up; this situation will be a drop in the bucket,"" Brynen said Monday in an interview. “Part of the Conservative strategy is to paint Trudeau as a lightweight who doesn’t think of the consequences of his actions.""
Voicing Frustration
The Saudi Foreign Ministry cited remarks last week by Freeland and the Canadian embassy in Riyadh criticizing the arrests of women’s rights activists including Samar Badawi. Her brother Raif Badawi, a blogger who was critical of the government, was already in a Saudi jail. Raif Badawi’s wife is a Canadian citizen.
“The Canadian government was only voicing a frustration that other Saudi allies privately feel with the Kingdom’s reform process, but was unwise to do it in comparatively strident language,” said Neil Partrick, a Saudi expert and editor of “Saudi Arabian Foreign Policy: Conflict & Cooperation.” Because the Trudeau government isn’t a significant ally, the Saudis “probably decided that Canada was, for the time being at least, expendable,” he said."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Monday the country has put forward a proposal to update the North American Free Trade Agreement's contentious rules of origin, and in turn was studying the U.S. position. 
The United States has demanded tougher rules of origin, particularly on what percentage of a car needs to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs than outlined in the current trade deal.
""We have a proposal on the table, we're analyzing some characteristics of the U.S. position, and we're doing it clearly in line with our dialogue with Mexico's auto industry,"" Guajardo told reporters after an event in Mexico City. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who launched the renegotiation of the 1994 pact a year ago, has said he wants the reworked deal to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. 
Guajardo on Monday also said that Canada, which is not participating in U.S.-Mexico talks that began in Washington two weeks ago after months of negotiations between the three trade partners, could join next week, depending on progress in the next few days between Mexico and the United States. 
The bilateral meetings have yielded important developments, Guajardo said, adding that he will return to Washington midweek. He did not give details. 
Mexican sources briefed on the negotiations have said Mexico has offered to raise the threshold for regional content beyond a May proposal of 70 percent, up from the current level of 62.5 percent. The United States is seeking 75 percent as well as demanding a proportion of vehicles be made in factories paying $16 an hour or more. 
Mexico's El Economista financial newspaper on Monday reported that Mexico had agreed to those demands, in return for a five-year transition period. Asked about the reports, Mexico's chief trade negotiator Kenneth Smith said that no deal on autos had yet been reached.
""We haven't closed or resolved this chapter yet,"" Smith told reporters after the same event in Mexico City, saying that Canada also needed to take part before negotiators could reach final decisions. 
Smith said Mexico and the United States were discussing technical details and each other's proposals involving the auto sector, and that Mexico was explaining the areas it considered particularly sensitive. 

He also said Mexico would not budge on its rejection of U.S. bids for seasonal restrictions on fresh products or a sunset clause that could strike down NAFTA agreements after five years.

249,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>","Right-Winger Picks Brazil General as VP, Others Choose Women","(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s right-wing presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro picked an Army general as his running mate, while his direct competitors targeted female and rural voters by choosing women with strong ties to farming business.
Bolsonaro on Sunday selected General Antonio Hamilton Mourao, who drew attention last year with comments seen as supportive of military intervention amid widespread corruption scandals. On the last weekend for parties to nominate their candidates, business-friendly candidate Geraldo Alckmin and leftist former Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes both nominated women with strong ties to the countryside. Jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva chose a male running mate who may take his place if he’s barred from running, making room for a female former lawmaker to join the ticket as vice president.

The backdrop to some of the weekend’s choices is the huge number of undecided female voters and Bolsonaro’s strong support among farmers in what is one of the most uncertain elections since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985. Roughly eight out of 10 female voters are undecided or intend to cast a void ballot, according to a Datafolha opinion survey. The choices are also significant in light of recent history. Michel Temer in 2016 became the third vice-president to take the reins of the country since the end of military rule.
Doubling Down
For Bolsonaro, the choice of Mourao as running mate effectively doubles down on his efforts to cultivate an image as a law-and-order crusader amid a surge of violent crime and ongoing corruption scandals. He has promised firearms for all law-abiding citizens, supported use of deadly force against criminals, and attempted to stir nostalgia for the relative security during the military rule.
“I’m not going to chose a woman just to win votes,” Bolsonaro told an audience of business leaders in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. Later, when asked by reporters if he didn’t see redundancies in a ticket made up of two former army officials, he answered: “And we’re going to have many ministers from the military as well, make no mistake.”
Bolsonaro’s strongest support is among Brazilians aged 16 to 44, most of whom weren’t born during the military dictatorship, according to a Poder360 survey in July. Gomes and Alckmin trail Bolsonaro in that poll.
“This is very much associated with the idea that we’re coming from a crisis of values, and reestablishment of order is the main task of the next president,” Rafael Cortez, political analyst at Tendencias Consultores, said by phone. “That appeal doesn’t broaden the support Bolsonaro has today; what it can guarantee is preservation of his level of voter intention.""

TV Time
As Mourao’s PRTB party is small, the ticket will afford Bolsonaro precious few seconds of free television time to persuade Brazilian voters. Candidates get airtime based on the size of the parties backing them. He’ll instead need to bank on his social media following that about doubles that of others, including Lula, who polls ahead of Bolsonaro but is unlikely to be allowed to run.
Alckmin, who picked Senator Ana Amelia as his running mate, is backed by a large alliance of parties that will ensure he has the largest share of TV airtime among all the candidates. Gomes picked Katia Abreu, a former Agriculture minister and senator.

Lula chose former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad as his running mate. If electoral authorities decide he cannot run in the election, former lawmaker Manuela D’Avila will assume Haddad’s place on the bottom of the ticket, according to a statement.

250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",How No-Deal Brexit Chatter Could Be Helping U.K.'s Theresa May,"(Bloomberg) -- Is a no-deal Brexit becoming more likely? U.K. Trade Secretary Liam Fox puts the chances at 60 percent. And while Theresa May sees that as an overestimate, her office has been careful not to dispute Fox’s argument that talks could collapse if the European Union doesn’t give ground.
“The prime minister has stressed on a number of occasions the importance of being pragmatic and practical in the negotiations,” May’s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters on Monday. He also referred to a February speech in Munich, in which May warned EU leaders not to allow “rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology to inhibit our co-operation.”
The government is at least partly motivated by trying to avoid public divisions over Brexit, especially on subjects as unknowable as whether talks will fail. But there’s another reason why May’s office is relaxed at the prospects of a no-deal Brexit being talked up: The more people think about the implications of crashing out of the EU, the easier it is to get them to support a compromise.
“The government forcing people to think about it now ultimately strengthens their hands,” said Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in London. “It means thought is put into why pursuing such an outcome is foolhardy.”
Compromise
Discussing the pitfalls of not doing a deal could help May paint internal critics as extremists and herself as a champion of pragmatic compromise, especially as some opposition Labour Party lawmakers are now also thinking about supporting the agreement May brings back from Brussels if it would help the economy.
It may also help persuade the EU to give some of the ground Fox called for.
Slack described May’s Brexit proposal last month as “a significant move” to which EU countries “need to respond.” The message to Brussels is that May has spent significant political capital, and can’t go further without a reciprocal shift from the bloc. The resignations of two key ministers help to make that case -- but so does an increase in British chatter about talks collapsing.
That’s not to say Fox was doing May’s bidding. One government official pointed out that others have offered views on the odds of no deal, and Fox had simply been doing the same. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said last week the U.K. was “heading for no deal by accident,” while Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the chances were “uncomfortably high.”
Comfortable
Unlike those two, Fox campaigned for Brexit and is instinctively more comfortable with the prospect of leaving the bloc without an agreement -- something that could also be coloring his assessment.
If it is May’s strategy to use such voices to her advantage, it’s a difficult one to get right without alienating the Brexiteers in her Conservative Party. Though they’ve spent months calling for her to walk away from negotiations, they’re now alarmed that May’s plan to publish advice on how to prepare for that scenario could make “no deal” look like a bad idea.
Part of the problem is that “no deal” means different things to different people, though most assume there would be agreements to ensure planes continue to fly between the EU and the U.K., for example, and that citizens’ rights would be taken care of.
But as May herself observed in June, even achieving that would require extensive discussions conducted in the wake of an acrimonious collapse of the main Brexit talks. All the signs point to her trying to create the conditions for a deal -- both at home and abroad."
251,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Russia's Shield Against Sanctions Draws Praise From Moody's,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia is ready to absorb the blow from any new sanctions the U.S. throws its way, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
Measures to cut down holdings of Treasuries and reduce exposure to the dollar have made the economy less vulnerable to the threat of deeper penalties, Moody’s analyst Kristin Lindow said in an interview. The country could even weather the unlikely scenario of sanctions on sovereign debt recently proposed by U.S. lawmakers, she said.
The central bank has accelerated efforts to safeguard its financial system since Washington blocked the country’s biggest aluminum producer from accessing capital markets in April, sending investors fleeing from the country’s assets. Since then Russia appears to have sold four fifths of its cache of U.S. government debt, an amount totaling $81 billion.
“When sanctions were imposed in April, it became clear that transactions in dollars could be problematic to entities and individuals in Russia, so they are planning accordingly,” Lindow said by phone from New York. “I think that is something any responsible policy maker would do.”
Moody’s put Russia on a positive outlook in January, setting it on course for a possible escape from junk in the next 12-18 months. S&P Global Ratings lifted the nation to investment grade earlier this year.
Yields on 10-year ruble bonds have climbed to a 12-month high since a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation on Thursday to impose sanctions for Russia’s interference in U.S. elections. Measures listed in the bill include sanctions on new Russian sovereign debt and energy projects. Lindow said lawmakers are unlikely to target government bonds after the Treasury warned earlier this year of the potential for destabilizing global markets.
“I think Rusal was quite a lesson for them, that they should look very carefully at how far-reaching the consequences can be,” Lindow said. “I think the impact was bigger than they anticipated.”
Buying Yuan
In addition to selling Treasuries, Russia has boosted the share of the yuan in its international reserves and pushed for payments in local currencies with many of its trade partners. The government has also started testing a local alternative to the SWIFT payment system used for international banking transactions.
President Vladimir Putin said late last month that Russia won’t make “any sharp movements” or abandon the dollar, but will take steps to minimize risks. Russia will continue to use dollar as long as the U.S. authorities don’t ban transactions, he said.
Analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). estimated that Russia’s borrowing costs could rise by 2 percentage points if the latest bill passes into law. Lindow says the country has enough liquidity locally to keep selling new ruble debt, but other borrowers in the market may find themselves crowded out. After an initial shock, markets will adjust to the measures as they did after the U.S. first began implementing sanctions on Russian companies and individuals in 2014 over the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea, she added.
“The Bank of Russia has been through that crisis already, they know things worked out well then,” Lindow said. “I’m sure the same kind of preparation is being done this time.”

252,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Indonesia hands yacht linked to 1MDB over to Malaysia,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Indonesia handed over to Malaysia on Monday a $250 million luxury yacht, impounded earlier this year as part of an international hunt for assets purchased with billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off from state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad thanked Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in a video posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, for facilitating the yacht's handover.
Malaysian authorities are seeking to arrest Low Taek Jho, the financier who allegedly bought the Equanimity, a 91 meter (300-foot) yacht registered in the Cayman Islands. Lawsuits have identified him as a central figure in the 1MDB scandal, but his whereabouts are unknown.
Low, through a spokesman from his legal team, has described the handing over of the yacht to Malaysia as illegal and politically motivated.
""The Mahathir regime’s illegal act today, ignoring court rulings in legal proceedings in the U.S. and Indonesia, prove he has no interest in a fair and just process,"" he said in a statement Monday.
Low has previously denied any wrongdoing. His Malaysian passport has been revoked and an arrest warrant issued.
Mahathir said any claimants to the yacht should provide proof that it belonged to them, and where they got the money to pay for it. 
""We believe the ship is owned by the Malaysian government because it was bought by Malaysian money that was stolen by certain parties,"" Mahathir said.
The yacht was handed over to Malaysian authorities at the Indonesian island of Batam, and was expected to reach Malaysia's Port Klang ""within 48 hours"", a spokesman for Mahathir said in a text message.
Mahathir ousted his predecessor and former protege Najib Razak in an election in May, and immediately launched an investigation into 1MDB.
The fund, founded by Najib, is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. Najib, who has been questioned by Malaysian anti-graft officers and is barred from leaving the country, has denied any wrongdoing related to 1MDB. 
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told reporters the government planned to take inventory of items one the yacht and open the vessel for public viewing, before eventually selling it ""at the highest price"".
Lim said Malaysia's attorney-general was expected to issue a statement on Tuesday regarding the status of the yacht and address concerns that it could affect investigations by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). 
The DoJ has sought to take custody of the Equanimity, after it was seized by Indonesia in February at the request of U.S. authorities as part of a multi-billion dollar anti-kleptocracy investigation into 1MDB.
A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to civil lawsuits filed by the DOJ. 

Malaysia is trying to recover up to $1.7 billion in assets, including the yacht, that the DoJ has alleged were bought with stolen 1MDB funds.

254,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Monday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 6:
1. U.S.-China Rhetoric Flares Up Again
China's state media lashed out at the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump in an unusually direct attack, adding to worries that the world's two largest economies are spiraling towards a full-blown trade war.
The ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper singled out Trump in an editorial today, saying he was starring in his own ""street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation"" and his expectation that others play along is simply ""wishful thinking.""
China's strictly controlled news outlets have frequently rebuked the United States and the Trump administration as the trade conflict has escalated, but they have largely refrained from specifically targeting Trump until now.
The comments came after China on Friday announced retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. products.
That move was in response to the Trump administration's proposal of a 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
2. Global Markets Start The Week Lower
Global stocks started the week on a downbeat note, as a backdrop of renewed trade tensions weighed on sentiment.
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies having an impact on economic growth.
Asian shares closed mixed, paring gains seen earlier.
Mainland Chinese stocks led losses in the region once again, with indices steepening losses in the afternoon. The Shanghai Composite declined 1.3%, while smaller-cap stocks in Shenzhen fell 2.1%.
The cautious sentiment carried over to Europe, where most of the region's major bourses slid lower in mid-morning trade, with nearly every sector in negative territory.
Among national indexes, Germany's export-heavy DAX took the brunt of investors' anxieties over trade, dropping by as much as 0.7%.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures looked set to kick off the week on the backfoot, with the major indices on track to open with modest losses.
The blue-chip Dow futures were down 30 points, or around 0.1%, at 5:25AM ET, the S&P 500 futures shed 5 points, or around 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 8 points, or roughly 0.1%.
3. Earnings Season Starts To Wind Down
About 40 S&P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week, in what will be the last big wave of the second-quarter earnings season.
Monday sees  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Newell Brands (NYSE:NWL),  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH), and SeaWorld (NYSE:SEAS) report ahead of the opening bell.
After the bell, Weight Watchers (NYSE:WTW), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), and Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) are due.
Some other high-profile names reporting this week are  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)., Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX),  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS),  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA), and Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH).



4. Dollar Stands Tall After Jobs Data
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar edged higher after the latest U.S. jobs report underlined expectations for the Federal Reserve to stick to a gradual pace of rate hikes this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, inched up 0.1% to 95.15, re-approaching the more than one-year peak of 95.44 hit on July 19.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices ticked higher, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to 2.95%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note dipped to 2.65%.
On the data front, the calendar is thin today, with no top-tier reports on deck.
Inflation reports are the top economic releases in the week ahead, with producer price inflation data Thursday and the more important consumer price index Friday.
5. New U.S. Sanctions Against Iran Kick In
Despite opposition from European allies, the White House is set to make an announcement this morning detailing the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran that were overturned by an historic nuclear deal in 2015.
A U.S. Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said so-called ""snapback"" sanctions will be reimposed at 12:01AM ET on Tuesday after businesses were given 90 days to wind down their activities.
The first wave of sanctions are set to affect Iran's purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil are due in November.
The sanctions are being reinstated after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
Brent crude futures rose 31 cents to $73.52, while U.S. crude oil futures added 28 cents to $68.77 a barrel.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:41AM ET</span>",BOJ's architect of 'shock and awe' plots retreat from stimulus,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - More than five years into a radical plan to boost the world's third-biggest economy, the Bank of Japan sent a message of quiet surrender last week, admitting it couldn't stoke inflation and walking back steps intended to do so.
The man leading the BOJ away from its program of unprecedented asset-buying and low or negative interest rates is the man who largely crafted the measures in the first place, bank deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya.
A fan of classical music who has recently begun to favor Russian composers, Amamiya ""plays the piano, guitar and flute well,"" says a person who has known him for decades.
Unlike many previous central bank leaders, who took an academic approach to policy, Amamiya simply ""tries to create something new,"" the person said.
The career central banker's latest creation, a mechanism for unwinding much of his previous work, has been quietly under development for almost a year.
Interviews by Reuters with a dozen people familiar with the bank's thinking reveal for the first time that there were plans to raise rates twice this year.
In January, market turbulence pulled the rug from under an announcement of an increase. The bank then hoped to signal higher rates in July and raise them in September, but weak inflation data scuttled that idea too.
Neither plan was made public. 
Last week, the central bank took more subtle action, rolling back parts of its policies that have hurt banks, paralyzed Japan's bond market and distorted stock prices even as they failed to ignite healthy inflation.
The move represented a compromise Amamiya forged with his boss, bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, to appease doves on the policy board with a promise to keep rates very low for an extended period.
He swung a key vote, deputy governor Masazumi Wakatabe, allowing the new policy to move forward without any clouds of doubt from a senior official.
""The latest steps marked a major turning point for Kuroda's stimulus program,"" a source said. ""The reflationists have become a minority, which means the BOJ is turning more hawkish.""
Amamiya, who largely crafted Kuroda's initially successful ""shock-and-awe"" campaign, may now be more mindful of his own legacy, insiders say. The Bank of Japan declined to comment for this article.
A roadmap to a sustainable stimulus program could serve as his own path to succeeding Kuroda as governor in five years.
But there are no easy answers. A few more years of ultra-low rates could drag down weak regional banks. Explicitly raising rates may trigger an unwelcome increase in the yen that could cool the export-reliant economy and anger politicians.
""Unwinding monetary support is far more difficult than expanding it,"" said a former BOJ policymaker who retains close contact with incumbent central bankers.
And looming in the background is the stubborn fact that low rates have done nothing to nudge inflation toward the central bank's target of 2 percent.
""Everyone at the BOJ knows what they're doing now is quite radical and needs amending at some point,"" another source said.
MR. BOJ
Dubbed ""Mr. BOJ"" by central bank watchers for innovating most of the bank's recent bold monetary easing tools, the 62-year-old Amamiya has spent most of his career at the monetary affairs department, which drafts policy and speeches.
His candid, down-to-earth style won him close ties with powerful politicians and business executives, helping lift him to the second-highest position in the central bank.
But even the politically savvy Amamiya was blindsided by public backlash after the bank, desperate to protect a fragile economy from a strengthening yen, pushed short-term rates below zero in January 2016.
The move proved to be a disaster.
Amamiya, who had three years earlier won praise for spearheading Kuroda's radical stimulus, received daily visits from bank executives furious about low bond yields, which were crushing margins.
At his direction, bureaucrats soon were huddled in the seventh-floor meeting room at the BOJ's headquarters in Tokyo, searching for ways to support yields that had sunk far below the level they were shooting for.
Their brainstorming led to a policy called yield curve control, which kept short-term rates negative and guided long-term rates to around zero.
The policy represented the first tool carefully designed to unwind Kuroda's massive asset-buying program.
It freed the bank from its obligation to buy a fixed amount of bonds, allowing it to steadily slow bond purchases to roughly half of what it had loosely pledged - just enough to keep yields pinned near zero. 
""In a way, it was back to orthodox monetary policy that used interest rate targets as a policy tool,"" a third source said. ""It was the first step toward policy normalization.""
DEADLOCK
By the middle of 2017, BOJ bureaucrats, emboldened by a strengthening economy, were quietly mulling how to prepare for a future rate hike.
The first hint came in November, when Kuroda referred to the academic concept of a ""reversal rate"" - the point at which rate cuts by a central bank hurt an economy.
Signals also began trickling out from board members like Hitoshi Suzuki, who called in February for an increase to address the rising cost of stimulus. Former academic Makoto Sakurai warned in May against overstimulating demand with easy policy.
When the bank board met in July, after one abortive attempt to raise rates, members remained deeply divided between those worried about the rising cost of prolonged easing, and those opposed to a quick exit from years of radically expansive policy.
But as inflation data made it clear a second try at a rate increase wasn't possible, Kuroda and Amamiya came up with a proposal that would appeal to both sides. 
To appease the reflationists, the bank for the first time deployed ""forward guidance,"" which gives markets an idea of where interest rates will be over an extended period.
The guidance pledged to keep interest rates low. But that message could be tweaked once conditions allow for an increase, the sources say, making it a tool for policy normalization.
The BOJ also created room to reduce asset purchases by saying it would buy ""flexibly."" Negative rates will be applied to a smaller pool of reserves, diluting their effect and pleasing commercial banks.
""The BOJ was successful in tweaking its policy scheme, which did not greatly impact markets but introduced a tool, forward guidance for policy rates, for future tightening,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
The yen weakened after the announcement and Japanese bond yields hit a 1-1/2 year high last week as investors tested the limits of the BOJ's new commitment to allow markets to move more freely.
Amamiya said the bank had no fixed timeframe for keeping rates low and could take more steps to address the rising cost of easing on parts of the economy.
Some critics, however, say the latest moves already show signs of desperation.

""It's unclear what the BOJ really wants to do,"" said one of the sources. ""It's doubtful how much the latest moves would help banks. The only thing clear is that with a dearth of policy tools, the BOJ is in a deadlock.""

256,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:04AM ET</span>","Trump's trade 'extortion' won't work, China state media says","By Andrew Galbraith and Michael Martina
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Monday lambasted U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies in an unusually personal attack, and sought to reassure investors anxious about China's economy as growth concerns battered its financial markets.
China's strictly controlled news outlets have frequently rebuked the United States and the Trump administration as the trade conflict has escalated, but they have largely refrained from specifically targeting Trump.
The latest criticism from the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper singled out Trump, saying he was starring in his own ""street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation"".
Trump's desire for others to play along with his drama is ""wishful thinking"", a commentary on the paper's front page said, arguing that the United States had escalated trade friction with China and turned international trade into a ""zero-sum game"".
""Governing a country is not like doing business,"" the paper said, adding that Trump's actions imperiled the national credibility of the United States.
The heated dispute between the world's two biggest economies has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal in recent months. Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned that escalating trade conflicts following U.S. tariff actions on its trading partners threaten to derail the global economic recovery.
The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods in July. Washington is expected to soon implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already said it will match immediately.
On Friday, China's finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States worth $60 billion.
That move was in response to the Trump administration's proposal of a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar have raised concerns that China's economy could face a steeper slowdown. 
Recent data showed growth has already started to cool. The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more ""active"" fiscal policy.
U.S. companies are putting in place measures to cushion the impact of the trade row, including price hikes, and a number of companies - from industrial firms to home furnishers and toymakers - have said they will move some sourcing and manufacturing outside of China.
China's exports are expected to have maintained solid growth in July despite the new tariffs on billions of dollars of shipments to the United States, though the outlook has darkened as both sides raised the stakes in the trade brawl.
CHINA MARKETS TAKE HIT
The vitriol from the People's Daily follows Trump's comments on Twitter from Saturday in which he boasted that his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports was ""working far better than anyone ever anticipated"", and that Beijing was now talking to the United States about trade.
Trump cited losses in China's stock market as he predicted the U.S. market could ""go up dramatically"" once trade deals were renegotiated.
China's stocks were lower on Monday as Beijing's latest tariff threats escalated the tit-for-tat Sino-U.S. trade war, while the yuan weakened after briefly edging up despite the central bank's latest efforts to shore up the tumbling currency.
Michael McCarthy, Sydney-based chief market strategist at CMC Markets and Stockbroking, wrote in a note to clients that while China's proposed new tariffs appeared proportionate, ""White House tweets claiming an upper hand for the U.S. over the weekend risk another round of confidence sapping exchanges."" 
A flurry of articles in Chinese state media emphasized the resilience of China's economy and downplayed concerns about the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war.
""Market participants foresee a relatively stable Chinese currency in the near term, without fear of impacts from the U.S.-China trade dispute. They expect solid economic growth momentum amid policy fine-tuning,"" an article in the official English-language China Daily newspaper said, citing Chinese economists. 
On Friday, the People's Bank of China said it would require banks to keep reserves equivalent to 20 percent of their clients' foreign exchange forwards positions from Monday, in a move to stabilize the yuan.
""Leading China's economy on a stable and far-reaching path, we have confidence and determination,"" another commentary in the main edition of the People's Daily said. 
Trump has threatened tariffs on over $500 billion in Chinese goods, covering virtually all U.S. imports from the Asian giant, demanding that Beijing make fundamental changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers and subsidies for high technology industries. 
The nationalist Global Times, responding in an editorial late on Sunday to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow's remarks that China should not underestimate Trump's resolve, said China did not fear ""sacrificing short-term interests"".

""China has time to fight to the end. Time will prove that the U.S. eventually makes a fool of itself,"" the Global Times said.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",U.S. bond market takes looming Treasuries deluge in stride,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. government debt supply will likely continue to boom, but bond market investors seem to be taking it in stride.
The Treasury Department is having to sell more debt to finance the government's ballooning deficit, stemming from the massive federal tax overhaul in December and the spending deal passed in February. Still, bond yields have remained in a narrow range, suggesting investors may not be fretting about the swelling debt supply.
""There will be no relief from supply especially from bills going into October,"" said Tom Simons, money market strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York. Supply is expected to run high at least until the Treasury provides updated forecasts on its borrowing needs, next due in November - and might even accelerate further.
This week, the Treasury will sell $34 billion in three-year notes, with $26 billion in 10-year debt on Wednesday and $18 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. It will also auction $51 billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills, together with an expected $65 billion in one-month bills. 
The supply will fall short of a record week of $294 billion set in March but continues a trend higher since February.
Analysts, who said the market would have no trouble digesting this week's offerings, see the government as becoming increasingly dependent on private investors for cash as the Fed further reduces its bond holdings. The goal is to shrink a balance sheet that had grown to more than $4 trillion from three massive rounds of asset purchases to combat the previous recession.
""I think they will go fine,"" Matt Freund, head of fixed income strategies at Calamos Investments in Chicago, said of this week's debt auctions.
Analysts projected that supply will continue to climb, and that March's record-setting weekly amount would be eclipsed in the coming weeks. 
The Treasury said on July 30 it expected to borrow $56 billion more during the third quarter than its earlier estimate, resulting in issuing $329 billion in debt securities during this period.

FOCUS ON OTHER RISKS
The government's rising debt load is a long-term concern for investors, but it is not atop their list of pressing worries.
The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing and the pace of Federal Reserve's interest rate increases pose far graver threats to markets and the economy than more government IOUs, analysts said.
""It is a really, long-term powerful narrative, but when is it going to bite?"" Calamos' Freund said.
As long as the U.S. economy hums along and its bond yields are higher than most of its peers, appetite for U.S. Treasuries should remain solid in the foreseeable future, according to most analysts. Mild inflation and the Fed staying on a gradual rate-hike path also support U.S. bond demand, the analysts have said.
""From an absolute yield perspective, where else are you going to go?"" said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management in San Francisco.
On Friday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slipped over 3 basis points at 2.952 percent following a mixed July payrolls report. Yields move inversely to prices. 
The U.S. 10-year yield is running 2.50 percentage points above its German counterpart and 2.85 points higher than Japanese 10-year yield. 
The U.S. budget gap is forecast to hit $1 trillion in fiscal year 2020, compared with $804 billion in the fiscal 2018, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
Given the growing deficit, the government has ramped up its issuance of bills and shorter-dated coupon debt to meet its funding needs after the suspension of the federal debt ceiling earlier this year.

""Our priority is the citizens and their needs,"" Di Maio told broadcaster RAI in an interview.
He said the government would try to apply its planned reforms, which include tax cuts and higher spending on pensions and welfare, without breaching rules designed to keep EU states public deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product.

But respecting fiscal rules ""cannot be a way to say that we cannot implement"" the reform agenda, Di Maio said.

""In (current account) surplus countries such as Germany we see hesitant measures, at best, to counteract the surplus,"" Obstfeld wrote in a guest commentary published in German daily Die Welt on Monday.
The IMF and the European Commission have long urged Germany to boost domestic demand by lifting wages and investment to reduce what they call global economic imbalances. Since his election, U.S. President Donald Trump has also repeatedly criticized Germany's export strength.
Obstfeld said that countries like the United States, in which the external current account balance is too low, should reduce budget deficits, encourage households to save more, and gradually normalize their monetary policy.
Countries in which the balance is too high, like Germany, should increase government spending, for instance by investing in infrastructure or digitalization, so that companies invest more domestically rather than looking abroad.
""The net external positions will diverge more. That increases the risk of disruption by currency or asset price adjustments in indebted countries, to the disadvantage of all,"" he said.

""If there is a sudden adjustment, then both the debtor and creditor countries will suffer,"" he added.

260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Brexit Noise Drowns Out London’s Cry for Help,"(Bloomberg) -- In the heart of London’s theater district opposite the Savoy Hotel, with rooms for up to $800 a night, scores of people are lingering patiently on a balmy summer evening.
The snaking line near a branch of Coutts & Co., the bankers to the Queen, displays a portrait of contemporary London: men and women of all ages and ethnic backgrounds, some speaking English and some Polish amid a cacophony of other languages. Some are dressed smartly in shirts and trousers, others in jeans and baseball caps. One man is wearing a food delivery company uniform. 
But they’re not there for a deal on tickets to a West End show or a table at Gordon Ramsay’s joint. They’re there for food handouts from a local charity.
Images of rich aside poor, homelessness and soup kitchens are hardly new in a city that inspired Charles Dickens and George Orwell, or even unique among major urban centers across the world. But in Britain today, they reflect a society under increasing strain as Brexit – the relentless quest to leave the European Union – drains the country’s political energy and focus from confronting other pressing matters.
Government policy making has been paralyzed, unable to address the causes of the disillusionment that led to 2016's vote for Brexit while eight years and almost 140 billion pounds ($184 billion) of spending cuts hit public services and social aid. In London, the wealth and glamor of Europe's most global city mask a struggling underclass in jobs that don't pay enough to afford the basics.
“I don’t have much food so I need to get it somewhere,” said Sean Gibson, 41, standing at the back of the line patiently waiting for his dinner from the pink marquee run by Friends of Essex and London Homeless.
He said he can’t earn enough to pay rent and eat as a courier for a food delivery company. At most, he says he was earning 960 pounds every six weeks in a city where average monthly rents are about twice that. “Half the rents here are 600 pounds and up. How can people afford that? It’s ridiculous,” he said.

Britain is increasingly a country of parallel universes.
Employment is at a record thanks to flexible work contracts like Gibson’s, the economy is healthy enough for the Bank of England to be raising the cost of borrowing, and absolute poverty rates are at record lows.
Yet a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank published on July 24 found living standards rose last year at their slowest pace since 2012. The recovery in incomes following the global financial crisis has even gone into reverse for the poorest 30 percent of families, it said. While London is the wealthiest region in northern Europe, the U.K. is also home to nine of its 10 poorest regions.
Public spending in Britain has fallen to about 38 percent of gross domestic product from 45 percent in 2010, according to figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility.
Research by charity Shelter found that 55 percent of homeless families in temporary accommodation are working. The 33,000 families represent an increase of 73 percent since 2013, according to the research based on freedom of information requests.
“Everybody’s fighting for themselves now,” Mohammed Nazir, the cabinet member for housing in Slough Borough Council on the fringes of London, said after a meeting in the U.K. Parliament about homelessness. “Social consciousness is rapidly disappearing.”
Prime Minister Theresa May, meanwhile, is battling daily to hold on to her leadership. Eight members of the government quit since she announced her Brexit road map earlier this month. Policy making has become fire-fighting as the clock ticks down to Britain’s formal departure from the EU in March next year.
There have been four different housing ministers in as many years. Policies to reduce homelessness and help provide security to a new generation of vulnerable workers are routinely overshadowed, according to Neil Coyle, an opposition Labour lawmaker who co-chairs parliament’s cross-party group on homelessness.
“We call it ‘neglexit,’” he said. “It’s when every other major policy issue is being neglected because of Brexit.”
Read More: The City That Defined Brexit Has Given Up
The government had planned to unveil proposals in July to meet its 2017 pledge to halve the number of people sleeping on the street by 2022 and eradicate it completely by 2027. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said it still aims to publish something over the summer.
Yet it’s unlikely any plan would account for the growing numbers like food courier Gibson who are sleeping on the sofas of friends and families or in bed-and-breakfast accommodation.
“It’s very difficult for us to judge if someone is or isn’t homeless because we’ve had people dressed quite nicely, and they make an effort,” said Steven Stuart who set up the Friends of Essex and London Homeless charity 18 months ago with his wife. “We think of homelessness as a man sleeping in a doorway under a blanket, but it’s on many levels now.”
Harriet, 21, an east London real-estate agent, fell into the ranks of the homeless when the lease on her apartment expired earlier this year. She then took to renting rooms through Airbnb for two months.
“I was living in horrible flats with four rooms and the others were rented out to people who were smoking joints in the kitchen or travelers,” said Harriet, who declined to be identified by her full name as she struggles to make ends meet. “I was constantly stressing about not finding a room.”
In London alone, the number of “hidden homeless” could be 13 times greater than the number of people on the street. As many as 12,500 people don’t have a fixed abode in the capital, though they aren't included in statistics.Others use public transportation. The number of sleepers on night buses more than doubled to 213 by the winter of 2015 and 2016 from the same season in 2012 to 2013, according to the mayor’s office.
Single homeless people often have to rent from private landlords who are more likely to evict tenants that can’t keep up payments. Phil, who didn’t want to give his full name, now sleeps in the Westminster underground station, meters away from the Houses of Parliament. “You’re only one paycheck away from being on the streets,” he said. “A lot of people don’t realize it.”

261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",India Keeps Door Open for Trade-War Truce With the U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- India deferred the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. imports to next month, opening the door to an agreement that would avert a trade war between the two nations.
The higher import duty on goods like chickpeas and Bengal gram, or chana, has been delayed to Sept. 18 from Aug. 4, the finance ministry said in a notification. The two sides have held meetings to relieve the tension in trade relations after Washington slapped higher levies on products shipped from the South Asian nation.
The move comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensifies. The Trump administration is considering increasing its proposed tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, while Beijing has threatened to retaliate.
India’s list also included tariffs on walnuts, almonds, boric acid, apples, diagnostic reagents and some hot-rolled coil products. The nation’s position is that Trump’s 25 percent and 10 percent duties on steel and aluminum, respectively, violate the global trading rules and have hurt its exports.
India had a trade surplus of $25 billion with the U.S. in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. cited this as one of the reasons for naming India a potential currency manipulator.

262,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>","China Prepared for Long Trade War With U.S., State Media Says","(Bloomberg) -- After a weekend of claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that he has the upper hand in the trade war with China, Beijing responded through state media by saying the nation is ready to endure the economic fallout.
China is prepared for a “protracted war” and doesn’t fear sacrificing short-term economic interests, according to an editorial in the nationalist Global Times on Sunday evening. “Considering the unreasonable U.S. demands, a trade war is an act that aims to crush China’s economic sovereignty, trying to force China to be a U.S. economic vassal.”
The exchange of barbs between the two sides follows the release late Friday in Beijing of a new tariff list designed to retaliate against the U.S. threat to impose new duties on $200 billion of Chinese imports. The worsening of the tension comes amid a slowing of China’s economy, declines in the currency and a bear market in stocks.
Trump told an audience of diehard supporters on Saturday that playing hardball on trade is “my thing.”
“We have really rebuilt China, and it’s time that we rebuild our own country now,” Trump said Saturday during about an hour of free-wheeling remarks at a rally outside Columbus, Ohio. China’s market declines weaken that nation’s bargaining power in the escalating trade war, he added.
Trump continued his focus on tariffs Sunday morning, tweeting that the duties are working “big time” and that imported goods should be taxed or made in the U.S. He also suggested duties will allow paying down “large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated” while reducing taxes for Americans.
“Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment,” Trump tweeted, “I say, as they come, Tax them.”
The yuan extended gains following a rally triggered by a surprise China central bank move to make it more expensive to bet against the currency. Asian stocks advanced Monday.
China stepped in Friday to try to cushion the yuan after a record string of weekly losses saw the currency closing in on the key milestone of 7 per dollar.
Duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on 5,207 kinds of imports from America if the U.S. delivers its proposed taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website late Friday.
President Trump last week ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate. The move was intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands for structural changes to the Chinese economy and a cut in the bilateral trade deficit, but China’s response suggests that tactic hasn’t worked.
“In the face of the bullying of the Donald Trump administration, Beijing must remain sober-minded and never let emotion override reason when deciding how to respond,” according to an editorial by the China Daily, the flagship state-run English newspaper. “Given China’s huge market, its systemic advantage of being able to concentrate resources on big projects, its people’s tenacity in enduring hardships and its steadiness in implementing reform and opening-up policies, the country can survive a trade war.”

263,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2018 11:38PM ET</span>",Australia's pension funds feel heat of powerful inquiry,"By Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian pension funds are ""surrounded by temptation"" to put profits ahead of people, a barrister assisting an inquiry into financial misconduct said on Monday at the start of hearings into the A$2.6 trillion ($1.9 trillion) sector.
The powerful Royal Commission inquiry has already roiled the banking and funds-management industry and now it is the turn of Australia's pension fund sector to answer questions about alleged misconduct and poor performance.
""What happens when we leave these trustees alone in the dark with our money?"" asked Michael Hodge, the barrister assisting the inquiry at the start of a scheduled two-week examination of the retirement savings sector. 
""Can they be trusted to do the right thing?"" 
Account-holders and industry groups said in their submissions that fees were not properly disclosed or were charged for services that were not rendered, such as financial advice, the inquiry heard. 
Concerns over fees and performance have generated a groundswell of consumer disquiet in Britain and the United States about the vague language retirement funds use to justify lackluster performance. 
Pension funds in Australia operate as trusts, which means they must adhere to various laws such as ensuring investments are made prudently and members cared for.
""Australians are not, as a general rule, reviewing the performance of their superannuation funds, comparing that performance to other funds and making rational choices as to whether they should remain with their fund or switch,"" Hodge said.
The latest round of hearings may pile more pressure on the shares of the country's four biggest banks and top financial planner AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) - all of which the Royal Commission has called to appear.
Revelations of misconduct stemming from earlier hearings have already wiped about A$26 billion off the market capitalization of Australia's top financial firms, as investors factor in higher compliance costs and greater regulation.
REGULATOR SCRUTINY
Australia has the third-largest pension pool in the world, according to OECD data, due to laws requiring employers to pay nearly a tenth of every worker's wage into a fund the person cannot usually access until retirement.
The majority of Australia's 12 million workers often leave their employer to choose between a union-backed industry fund or a corporate product run by a major bank or fund manager. 
Some workers also rely on financial advisers to manage their pension investment, although the inquiry has repeatedly revealed that advice can be compromised by conflicts in the advice industry, such as poorly-structured bonus payments.
Hodge said that while most funds were overseen by the prudential regulator, there was no dedicated authority looking at their trustee responsibilities and ""searching for bad behavior"".

Trump's wish for others to play along with his drama is ""wishful thinking,"" the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper said in an editorial.
The editorial said the United States had escalated trade friction with China, and turned international trade into ""zero-sum game"".
""Governing a country is not like doing business,"" the editorial said, arguing that Trump's actions imperiled the national credibility of the United States.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2018 09:12AM ET</span>",Indonesia lobbies U.S. to maintain special tariff treatment,"By Agustinus Beo Da Costa
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia lobbied visiting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to keep the Southeast Asian nation on a list of countries that receive preferential trade terms, its foreign and trade ministers said on Sunday.
""President Joko Widodo has delivered Indonesia's hope that the U.S. will maintain the country's GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) facility,"" Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told reporters after meeting Pompeo.
In April, the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office said it was reviewing the eligibility of Indonesia, along with India and Kazakhstan, for the GSP, based on concerns over compliance with services and investment criteria.
""Around 53 percent of the goods covered by the GSP are commodities with links to products the U.S. exports, while 35 percent are related to the production process of U.S. products,"" Marsudi said.
Under the GSP, Indonesia gets reduced tariffs on about $2 billion worth of exports to the United States, including some agricultural, textile and timber products, the Indonesia’s employers association told Reuters in July.
Total exports to the United States were $17.8 billion data in 2017 from Indonesia’s trade ministry showed. Indonesia ran a $9.7 billion trade surplus with the United States last year.
Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said Indonesia has asked the United States to exempt its aluminum and steel products.
The minister said he and Marsudi had met U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in Washington in July and agreed to raise the value of annual U.S.-Indonesia trade to $50 billion. Lukita said Pompeo had agreed on the need to increase economic ties and increase the countries' strategic partnership.
""President Trump wants to trade with Asia, with Indonesia,"" Pompeo told Indonesia's Metro TV, calling the trade between the two ""incredibly important."" 
The U.S diplomat, who refrained from commenting on the GSP negotiations, said he wanted to ensure Indonesia-U.S. trade was ""fair and equivocal"" and criticized China's growing role in Southeast Asia.

""The country that attempts to use its economic power to dominate this region is China, not the United States. We want to be a great partner for Indonesia,"" Pompeo said.

Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies having an impact on economic growth.
There are also about 40 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead on Wall Street, as the earnings season starts to wind down.
On the data front, global financial markets will focus on this week's U.S. consumer price data, which should give clearer signs on the pace of inflation and fresh hints on the frequency of Federal Reserve rate hikes through the end of the year.
Elsewhere, market participants will also be looking ahead to monthly trade figures out of China to see if the recent trade dispute with the U.S. had any impact on exports and imports in July.
In Europe, market players will look ahead to a preliminary reading on British growth data for further indications on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. U.S.-China 'Trade War' Developments In Focus 
Market focus is largely attuned to the next potential steps in the tit-for-tat trade dispute between the U.S. and China after the Asian nation said Friday it was preparing retaliatory measures against U.S. tariffs, targeting $60 billion worth of U.S. goods with import duties of between 5% and 25%.
The response follows the Trump administration's proposal Thursday of a 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
Neither side is showing any signs of backing down, fueling worries that world's two largest economies are spiraling towards a trade war that could shake the global economy.
The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councilor Wang Yi, said on Saturday the response by Beijing to U.S. trade measures were necessary and legitimate.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, in a series of tweets on Saturday, said that his strategy of placing steep tariffs on imports of goods from China is ""working far better than anyone ever anticipated,"" citing steep losses in China's stock market.
Trump also claimed that China was talking to the U.S. about trade, but he provided no details.



The U.S. and China have already implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods in July. Washington is expected to soon impose tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already said it will match immediately.
Investors fear an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
2. Earnings Season Starts To Wind Down
About 40 S&P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week, in what will be the last big wave of the second-quarter earnings season.
Weight Watchers (NYSE:WTW), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY),  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Newell Brands (NYSE:NWL) and Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) are on the agenda for Monday.
Results from  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Snap (NYSE:SNAP),  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP),  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX), Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN), Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA), Dean Foods (NYSE:DF), and Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) will capture the market's attention on Tuesday.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Michael Kors (NYSE:KORS), 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX), NY Times (NYSE:NYT),  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Sina (NASDAQ:SINA), NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES),  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST), Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL),  Sarepta  Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT),  Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR), and Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA) report results on Wednesday.
Thursday sees Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)., Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS), Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD),  Universal Display  (NASDAQ:OLED), Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT), and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) post earnings.
Finally,  Applied Industrial Technologies  (NYSE:AIT) is among the few reporting on Friday.



3. U.S. Inflation Data
The Commerce Department will publish July inflation figures at 8:30AM ET Friday, which should lend further support to the notion that inflation has returned to the Fed’s target.
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.2% last month and 3.0% over the prior year, according to estimates.
Excluding the cost of food and fuel, core inflation is projected to climb 2.3% on a year-over-year basis.
Besides the inflation data, this week's rather light economic calendar also features reports on producer prices on Thursday.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged last week, as expected, characterizing the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December.
4. China Trade Figures
China is to release July trade figures on Wednesday morning.
The report is expected to show that the country’s trade surplus narrowed to $39.1 billion last month from $41.6 billion.
Exports are forecast to have climbed 10.0% from a year earlier, while imports are expected to rise 17.0%.
In addition to the trade data, the Asian nation will publish a report on foreign exchange reserves on Tuesday, followed by data on consumer and factory inflation figures on Thursday.
Recent data has started to show that the world’s second largest economy may be losing steam, raising concerns about the potential fallout from a full-blown U.S.-China trade war.
Market players will also watch the yuan after it slumped to 14-month lows against the dollar late last week (USD/CNY).
The ongoing weakness in the yuan has prompted speculation that policymakers in Beijing are allowing their currency to weaken in order to offset the impact of U.S. trade tariffs.
5. UK Preliminary GDP
Market players will focus on the first estimate of British second-quarter GDP for further hints on the health of the economy.
The report, released by the Office for National Statistics at 0830GMT (4:30AM ET) on Friday, is forecast to reveal the economy grew 0.4% in the April-June quarter, after expanding at a 0.2% clip in the previous three-month period.
On an annualized rate, the British economy is expected to grow 1.3% in the three months ended June 30, a tad faster than the 1.2% clip in the preceding quarter.
The Bank of England raised interest rates last week, but signaled it was in no hurry to lift them further as Britain heads for Brexit next year with no clear plan for leaving the European Union.
With less than eight months until Britain leaves the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has begun talking more publicly about the prospect of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement on what happens next.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",India says storing copies of foreign payment firms' data a likely solution,"By Neha Dasgupta and Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Foreign payment firms could keep copies of customer data in India while retaining offshore storage operations, the government said, as a way to resolve a row with MasterCard, Visa and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) over the localization of such information. 
A decision by India's central bank in April that all payments data should, within six months, be stored only in the country for ""unfettered supervisory access"" has led to furious lobbying by global firms that worry it would cost them millions of dollars.
India's Economic Affairs Secretary S.C. Garg said that keeping data copies in the country had emerged as a possible solution during a meeting with officials from the Reserve Bank of India and executives from the payment firms.
""One of the options which emerged in that meeting was maybe mirror copies might be a potential solution,"" Garg told Reuters in an interview on Saturday.
He said the Reserve Bank of India had to take a final decision on the matter but keeping mirror images of the data in India would mean all the customer information would be available to local authorities.
The RBI's directive comes as more people in India are switching to plastic, partly driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's decision to replace high-value currency notes in November 2016, since when the government has aggressively discouraged cash transactions.
In March, Indians clocked up transactions worth $52 billion using their 900 million credit and debit cards, nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016, data from the RBI showed.
But rising fraud is a concern too. The RBI in April said the payment ecosystem in India had expanded considerably, making it necessary to ensure the safety and security of data.
Garg said the government was trying to find a consensus over data localization at a time of heightened scrutiny of how companies globally handle their customers' data.
""What we do is we listen to different stakeholders, what they say, what their stance is and where can we can find a landing zone ... That is the reason why it was suggested to have mirror copies,"" he said. 
Reuters previously reported that India's finance ministry has proposed relaxing the RBI's directive following weeks of intense lobbying by U.S. companies and trade bodies.
During the June meeting, representatives from U.S. lobby group U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) said that storing the data exclusively in India would be a security risk, as in the event of a natural disaster no-one would have access to it if it was all stored in one place.
A STRONGER ECONOMY
Garg said India's strong economic and fiscal performance warranted a sovereign rating upgrade by leading rating agencies, including Standard & Poor's, and reiterated that the economy was on course to achieve its 3.3 percent fiscal deficit target for 2018/19.
""Of course we would want an upgrade. There is no question. Everything (economically) is strong,"" he said adding that S&P might assess India's sovereign rating next month.

In November last year, S&P affirmed India's sovereign rating at ""BBB minus"" along with a stable outlook. S&P has kept India at the lowest investment grade since 2007 while Moody's Investors Services has upgraded India's credit rating to ""Baa2"", a notch higher than S&P's rating.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",ECB's Lautenschlaeger says worried about banking deregulation: Welt am Sonntag,"BERLIN (Reuters) - An easing of European banking regulation risks taking power from regulators to ensure that banks have sufficient capital to withstand crises, ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger has told a German newspaper.
""I'm concerned about looming deregulation. Not just in the United States but also in Europe,"" the weekly Welt am Sonntag quoted Lautenschlaeger as saying in an interview. 
""After the financial crisis supervisors were strengthened and given instruments to proactively react to looming risks. Before that they could only react when the damage had already been done. We need to ensure that the pendulum doesn’t swing back to that,"" said Lautenschlaeger, who is also deputy head of the ECB banking supervisor.
The European Central Bank last month unveiled a compromise solution on how banks must set aside cash against a large pile of bad loans after plans by its Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) to force them to set aside money within a given timeframe met resistance from bankers, lawmakers and even within the central bank.
""There are some proposals on capital rules that worry me. It could become more difficult for supervisors to demand more capital for certain risks. Supervisors’ instruments would be weakened,"" Lautenschlaeger said, without being more specific.
Commenting on ECB monetary policy, she said that it would be wrong for the central bank to abruptly change direction.

""That would help neither the economy nor price stability ... I am very much in favor of normalizing monetary policy. That also means that we should gradually raise interest rates. The pre-condition is that the path to price stability is sustainably strengthened,"" she said.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2018 05:33PM ET</span>",UK trade minister Fox says EU is pushing Britain to no-deal Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - British trade minister Liam Fox said ""intransigence"" from the European Union was pushing Britain toward a no-deal Brexit, in an interview published on Saturday by the Sunday Times.
With less than eight months until Britain quits the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has stepped up planning for the possibility of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement.
Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, put the odds of Britain leaving the European Union without agreeing a deal over their future relationship at 60-40.
""I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us toward no deal,"" Fox told the Sunday Times after a trade mission in Japan.
""We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it's a bureaucrats' Brexit -- not a people's Brexit -- (and) then there is only going to be one outcome.""
It was up to the EU whether it wanted to put ""ideological purity"" ahead of the real economy, Fox said.
If Britain fails to agree the terms of its divorce with the EU and leaves without even a transition agreement to smooth its exit, it would revert to trading under World Trade Organization rules in March 2019. 
Most economists think this would cause serious harm to the world's No.5 economy as trade with the EU, Britain's largest market, would become subject to tariffs.
Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for Britain's $2.9 trillion economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU, which some of them cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.

On Friday Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the chances of a no-deal Brexit had become ""uncomfortably high"".

270,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2018 04:33PM ET</span>",China won't accept U.S. trade 'blackmail': state media,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's state media said on Saturday the government's retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods showed rational restraint and they accused the United States of blackmail. 
Late on Friday, China's finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States, with the extra levies ranging from five to 25 percent on a total value of goods less than half of that proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. 
The response follows the Trump administration's proposal of a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
""China's countermeasures are rational,"" the Global Times, a tabloid run by the official People's Daily, said in a commentary. 
""China will not rush to compete with U.S. numbers,"" it said, echoing comments made by state television. 
The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods in July. Washington is expected to soon implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already said it will match immediately.
""The White House's extreme pressure and blackmail are already clear to the international community,"" said a state television commentary. ""Such methods of extreme blackmail will not bear fruit against China.""
TRUMP TOUTS TARIFFS, SAYS THEY ARE WORKING
In a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump disagreed.
""Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated,"" he claimed, citing a big drop in China's stock market. ""They are really hurting their economy.""
Trump also claimed that China was talking to the United States about trade, but he provided no details. He said his administration would continue to employ tariffs if other nations were unwilling to come to the table on trade. ""We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals,"" Trump said.
China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of China's annual imports of American products. Last year, China imported about $130 billion in goods from the United States. Trump has ultimately threatened tariffs on over $500 billion in Chinese goods, covering virtually all U.S. imports from China.
""The U.S. has repeatedly resorted to threatening and deceitful routines, trying to force China to compromise, both overestimating its own bargaining power and underestimating China's determination and ability to defend its national dignity and the interests of its people,"" said a commentary in the official Xinhua news agency.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, remained staunch on Washington's push for fairer trading conditions with China. 
""President Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally or fairly by the Chinese, and the efforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct that,"" Pompeo told reporters on the sidelines of a regional forum in Singapore. 
Pompeo added that he had discussed trade issues with Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi on Friday. Wang said on Friday they did not get into details.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said he met Pompeo in Singapore and that his message was clear.
""My objective was quite straightforward: I think I need to inform him that we are very concerned,"" said Saifuddin.

    Countries like Malaysia form an integral part of Chinese exporters' supply chains, and analysts have warned a trade war could knock billions of dollars off their economic growth in coming years.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is ""very keen"" on concluding negotiations to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement as soon as possible, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Saturday, amid signs of progress after months of delays.
Talks to modernize the 1994 trade pact started in August 2017 but have dragged on much longer than expected as Canada and Mexico pushed back against far-reaching U.S. demands for reform. President Donald Trump has said he will walk away from NAFTA unless major changes are made.
In a renewed push, Mexican and U.S. cabinet ministers held a series of meetings in Washington over the past week in a bid to work out their differences. One Mexican official expressed optimism that some kind of agreement could be reached by the end of the month.
""I and Canada are very, very keen to get it done as quickly as possible,"" Freeland told reporters on a conference call. She did not answer directly when asked whether the end of August was a realistic deadline.
Mexican and U.S. officials are due to meet again next week to work on contentious issues such as wages and rules governing how much North American produced content an automobile must contain to qualify for duty-free status.
Freeland said she was ready to join the talks at any time but did not give details. Canadian officials dismiss speculation that she is being sidelined.
""While this is a trilateral agreement ... there are also significant bilateral trading issues between each of the countries,"" said Freeland, adding that she welcomed bilateral talks between Canada's two NAFTA partners.

The Trump administration, which complains NAFTA caused hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs to move to plants in low-wage Mexico, wants Mexican workers to be paid more and is demanding more North American content in cars and light trucks produced in the NAFTA nations.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>",Indonesia to hand over yacht linked to 1MDB to Malaysia,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Indonesia has agreed to hand over to Malaysia a $250 million luxury yacht it impounded in Bali earlier this year in connection with a corruption scandal at a Malaysian state fund, Indonesian authorities said on Saturday.
The Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity was seized in February at the request of U.S. authorities as part of a multi-billion dollar corruption investigation launched by the Department of Justice (DOJ) related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
An Indonesian court ruling in April declared that the yacht was wrongfully impounded and should be released to its owners, but Indonesian police seized the boat again in July following a formal request for legal assistance from the United States.
Indonesian police said they would hand the yacht over to Malaysia but did not specify when.
""The yacht will be handed over at the border between Indonesia and Malaysia's waters,"" Daniel Silitonga, deputy director for economic and special crimes at the Indonesian national police force's Criminal Investigation Agency, told Reuters by text message. 
""We have to maintain the good relations between the two countries,"" he said, adding that the yacht is currently in waters close to the border of Singapore and the Indonesian island of Batam.
A spokesman for Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's office said ""some arrangements"" were being made with Indonesian authorities regarding the yacht and that an announcement would be made when the details were finalised.
A source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters on Friday that Indonesia had agreed to hand the yacht to Malaysia following a personal request by Mahathir.
Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981-2003 and is now 93, visited Indonesia in June on his first official visit in the region since returning to power in May in a surprise election win over Najib Razak.
1MDB, founded by Najib, is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to U.S. civil lawsuits filed by the DOJ. Najib has denied wrongdoing.
Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho is described in the lawsuits as a central figure in the scandal. The DOJ says Low used proceeds diverted from 1MDB to procure Equanimity, a 300-ft (91-m) yacht registered in the Cayman Islands. 
The $250 million vessel is said to have an interior clad in marble and gold leaf, a spa and sauna, a 20-meter swimming pool on deck, a movie theater, a lift and a helipad.
In an emailed statement, a spokesman for Low's legal team said the handing over of Equanimity to Malaysia was illegal and that it was politically motivated.

Malaysian authorities are seeking to arrest Low, whose whereabouts are unknown. His Malaysian passport was revoked and an arrest warrant has been issued against him. Low has previously denied any wrongdoing.

Since becoming prime minister in April, 41-year-old Abiy Ahmed has turned Africa's most populous after Nigeria on its head with his plans to reshape politics and the economy.
""PM Abiy Ahmed has set up an Advisory Council on the privatization of large state-owned enterprises,"" Fitsum Arega, Abiy's chief of staff said on Twitter late on Friday. 
""The Council will ensure the process is managed with utmost transparency and accountability."" 
Abiy's government has said that it is open to selling off a host of state-owned firms, either partially or entirely, as part of economic reforms designed to “unleash the potential of the private sector”.
The government was tendering for advice from global business consultancies including McKinsey and PwC, the country's information minister told Reuters in July.
Ethiopia has achieved one of Africa’s fastest growth rates over the past decade, averaging up to 10 percent a year.
But investors complain about its stifling and antiquated socialist bureaucracy, where the default answer from fearful civil servants is “no” and importing something as mundane as cotton can take six or 12 months.

Besides his stated desire to attract foreign capital into one of Africa’s most closed states, Abiy has brokered peace with Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia fought a border war two decades ago.

New Delhi, incensed by Washington's refusal to exempt it from new tariffs, decided in June to raise import tax from August 4 on some U.S. products, including almonds, walnuts and apples, and later delayed the move. 
Officials from New Delhi and Washington, including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, are scheduled to hold a series of meetings including strategic talks with their Indian counterparts in September.
Trade differences between India and the United States have been rising since President Donald Trump took office. Bilateral trade rose to $115 billion in 2016, but the Trump administration wants to reduce its $31 billion deficit with India, and is pressing New Delhi to ease trade barriers. 
India, the world's biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, in June decided to raise import duties on the commodity by 20 percent, joining the European Union and China in retaliating against Trump's tariff hikes on steel and aluminum. 
It had also planned to impose a 120 percent duty on the import of walnuts in the strongest action yet against the United States.

India has proposed to buy petroleum products from the U.S. to help narrow the trade deficit. The United States has also emerged as a top arms supplier to India and U.S. companies are bidding for military aircraft deals worth billions of dollars.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 09:58PM ET</span>",N.Y. Fed markets chief sees policy normalization going smoothly,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's campaign in raising interest and shrinking its balance sheet is running smoothly despite recent volatility in U.S. money markets, the New York Federal Reserve Bank's top markets official said in prepared remarks delivered on Saturday in Manila.
Recent swings in long-term U.S. money market rates are part of their adjustments to structural changes post-financial crisis in addition to the Fed's current normalization of monetary policy, the New York Federal Reserve's Markets Chief Simon Potter said at the executives’ meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks Governors’ meeting.
""The monetary policy implementation framework continues to provide the FOMC with excellent control over overnight money market rates, and has proven its ability, including recently through the technical adjustment, to flexibly respond to new developments,"" Potter said.
In April, the average or effective federal funds rate, or what banks charge each other to borrow reserves overnight, was only 5 basis points below the top end of the U.S. central bank's target range, which was 1.50-1.75 percent at the time.
This sparked worries among some traders whether the fed funds rate would rise above the top of the target range and possibly rattle market confidence in the Fed's ability to control short-term rates.
To address this fed fund rate rise, the Fed made a technical adjustment to the interest it pays on bank reserves at its June policy, raising it by 20 basis points while increasing the target range by 25 basis points, Potter noted.
The effective fed funds rate <USONFFE=> has been running at 1.91 percent, 9 basis points below the top end of the Fed's current target rate range.
Potter said higher issuance in Treasury bills earlier this year; repatriation of corporate cash overseas due to last year's massive tax cut; stricter bank capital regulation and reform of the money market fund industry are among the factors behind the recent swings in interest rates in money markets.
""Although term money market rates have fluctuated recently in response to a variety of drivers, these markets continue to act as a deep and liquid source of wholesale funding to firms around the world while appropriately incorporating the FOMC’s monetary policy stance,"" Potter said.
Potter acknowledged the Fed's paring of its balance sheet, currently at $4.2 trillion, might play a role in reducing the amount of excess bank reserves, causing wholesale borrowing costs to tick up.
""I see this as a reasonable possibility, and therefore I think it might be possible that the decline in reserve balances has pushed up overnight rates a bit over time,"" Potter said.

278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",‘Fantastically Good’ Canadian Economy Shifts Focus to Rate Hike,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s economy is gaining strength instead of buckling amid a trade fight with the U.S.
Exports rose to a record high in June even as President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum, and gross domestic product expanded in May at its fastest clip in a year, according to data released this week by Statistics Canada.
That has economists predicting second-quarter growth of more than 3 percent and talking about the possibility of a second-straight rate increase from the Bank of Canada. Another move from the central bank next month was considered a long shot until now, as trade threats continue to cloud Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s economic agenda.
“It’s a fantastically good week for Canada on the economic side,” Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by phone. Scotiabank became the first major Canadian commercial lender to predict a September rate increase this week, with the other four big banks still calling for Governor Stephen Poloz to hold fire until October.
Poloz raised rates at the central bank’s July meeting, the fourth move in a year, and said further increases could be needed with the economy operating near capacity. The governor told reporters trade risks are just that, reiterating that policy makers will be guided by incoming data instead of political rhetoric.
“The Bank of Canada is on course to raise rates in the coming months, and while our callremains for a hike in October, a September move isn’t out of the cards,” Royce Mendes, a senior economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, wrote in a research note.
Investors were putting the odds of a rate hike in September at about one in four Friday afternoon, up from one in five a week earlier. The odds for October were two in three.
Another key variable in the Bank of Canada’s rate calculus will be pinned down next week, with jobs figures due Friday. Citibank’s economic surprise index, which measures how data compares to market expectations, turned positive this week for the first time since February.
“The economy is still humming along,” Dawn Desjardins, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said Friday in a phone interview. Policy makers “will continue to gradually remove the stimulus because the economy is really running up against capacity constraints.”
To be sure, U.S. protectionism could still sideswipe Canada -- especially if Trump follows through on threats to put tariffs on automobiles, one of the northern nation’s top exports. Cross-border relations frayed somewhat this week, when Trudeau’s minister in charge of talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement was left out of discussions between U.S. and Mexican officials, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Perrault said Scotiabank was nonetheless confident in advancing its prediction for a rate hike, because even bilateral talks showed progress on Nafta. Canada’s growth rate still reflects a drag from trade uncertainty, which could be lifted should a deal be reached between the three nations ahead of U.S. midterm elections this fall.
“Capacity pressures are forcing firms to invest,” Perrault said. “Maybe they are investing reluctantly, but they are investing.”"
279,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>",China plans tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods in latest trade salvo,"By Se Young Lee and Christian Shepherd
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, as a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to solve their bitter trade conflict.
The Trump administration tightened pressure for trade concessions from Beijing this week by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China vowed to retaliate while also urging Washington to act rationally and return to talks to resolve the dispute.
The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods in July. Washington is expected to soon implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already announced it will match immediately.
China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of China's annual imports of American products. Last year, China imported about $130 billion of U.S. goods.
China's finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States, with the extra levies ranging from 5 to 25 percent.
Timing will depend on the actions of the United States, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.
""The U.S. side has repeatedly escalated the situation against the interests of both enterprises and consumers,"" it said. ""China has to take necessary countermeasures to defend its dignity and the interests of its people, free trade and the multilateral system.""
A top adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump said the newly proposed tariffs were not as severe as the White House had been bracing for, and he warned China not to test Trump's resolve.
 ""They better not underestimate the president,"" White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business Network. ""He is going to stand tough.""
TENSIONS WEIGH ON CHINESE MARKETS
The United States alleges that China steals U.S. corporate secrets and wants it to stop doing so, and is also seeking to get Beijing to abandon plans to boost its high-tech industries at America's expense. Washington also wants China to stop subsidizing Chinese companies with cheap loans, claiming that this allows them to compete unfairly.
Trump has said he is determined to reduce the large U.S. trade deficit with China.
The U.S. president has accused China and others of exploiting the United States in global trade, and has demanded Beijing make a host of concessions to avoid the new duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which could be imposed in the weeks after a comment period closes on Sept. 5.
Beijing says the United States is deliberately creating the trade conflict, using bullying tactics, and ignoring international negotiating norms so that it can stop the rise of China as a competitor on the world stage.
The rising tensions have weighed on Chinese stock and currency markets, with the Chinese yuan falling against the dollar.
""Instead of retaliating, China should address the long-standing concerns about its unfair trading practices,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in an emailed statement.
TOP DIPLOMATS MEET
The two countries have not had formal trade talks since early June.
Still, two senior diplomats met earlier on Friday on the sidelines of a regional summit in Singapore.
China is willing to resolve differences with the United States ""on the basis of an equal footing and mutual respect,"" China's top diplomat said after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
""He (Pompeo) was accommodating on this as a direction, and said that he does not want current frictions to continue,"" said State Councillor Wang Yi, who is also China's foreign minister.
Answering a reporter's question about what was specifically said on trade, Wang said: ""We did not speak in such details.""
""How can talks take place under this pressure?,"" he added.
However, speaking to reporters at the White House, Kudlow said there had been some communication on trade ""at the highest level"" in recent days.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters also said there had been ""high-level discussions on multiple occasions in the past few months"" and Washington remained open to further talks with China.
CONDOMS AND COFFEE
Among U.S. products targeted in the latest Chinese salvo were a wide range of agricultural and energy products, including liquefied natural gas. LNG's inclusion marks a deployment by Beijing of one of its last major weapons from its energy and commodities arsenal in its fight with Washington.
The market is not large by value compared with approximately $12 billion of U.S. crude that came to China last year, but LNG imports could shoot up as Beijing forges ahead with its plan to switch millions of households to the fuel away from coal.
  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has estimated annual Chinese imports of U.S. LNG could rise to as much as $9 billion within two or three years, from $1 billion in 2017. The amount could be even larger if the United States resolves a logistics bottleneck.
""As the total value of goods under tariffs shoots up, China has little choice but to use LNG and others to top up the value,"" said Lin Boqiang, professor on energy studies at China's Xiamen University.
The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association whose members include  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP), said the new Chinese tariffs would hurt American workers.
“China is the third-largest importer of U.S. LNG, but U.S. LNG makes up only a modest but growing portion of China’s supply portfolio, which suggests that this particular trade dispute will hurt America more than it hurts China,” Kyle Isakower, API's vice president for regulatory and economic policy, said.
Other U.S. goods targeted by China in the latest list include semiconductors, some helicopters, small-to-mid-sized aircraft, condoms, iron ore, steel products, roasted coffee, sugar, foods containing chocolate, candies, and even car windscreens.

China's biggest U.S. imports by value in 2017 were aircraft and related equipment, soybeans and autos.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A few U.S. companies that moved offshore in a wave of inversion deals are considering returning to the United States now that domestic tax rates are lower and tax policing is tougher abroad, attorneys and consultants said.
A handful of clients have asked about redomestication, which could involve buying a U.S.-headquartered company, the tax advisers said. No specific companies or deals were identified. 
Uncertainties about U.S. Republican President Donald Trump's trade policies have also prompted the conversations, the advisers said. 
""Inverted companies have reason to look at whether or not it still makes sense for them to be offshore, particularly those that manufacture product outside the U.S. and sell it back into the U.S.,"" said Pam Olson, a Washington-based tax expert at accounting and consulting group PwC.
A surge of homecomings would reverse an on-again, off-again trend since the 1980s of U.S. companies reincorporating overseas to cut tax costs.
In an inversion, a U.S. company typically buys a smaller foreign firm in a lower-tax country and adopts the acquired firm's headquarters.
That maneuver means the company does not have to pay U.S. taxes on foreign income, even if its management and operations remain in the United States. 
Trump's public shaming of companies that move plants and jobs overseas has also made some consumer-focused firms rethink inversions, advisers said.
Executives at inverted companies see less tax ""friction"" under the new tax regime that would discourage redomiciling, advisers said, and have also mentioned the appeal of corporate-friendly, low-tax states and improved access to U.S. government contracts in the discussions. 
More than 60 U.S. companies have inverted, including medical device maker  Medtronic  Plc (N:MDT). There was a wave of deals in 2011-2014, but inversions largely ended in 2015 after a regulatory crackdown by Democratic President Barack Obama.
 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) walked away from a $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan Plc (N:AGN) in 2016 because of new U.S. Treasury rules. 
The Trump administration last month finalized and left in place the Obama-era rules.
The Republican tax overhaul signed into law in December eliminated a key inversion incentive by slashing the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and altering how foreign profits are taxed.
A push to prevent profit-shifting strategies and corporate tax base erosion across the 36-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is also making foreign tax domiciles marginally less attractive, especially in Europe.
Tax advisers said it is still possible to structure lower tax rates in countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands.
How the U.S. Treasury implements parts of the new tax law will help determine whether companies return to the United States.
A new tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, or GILTI, on its face imposes a 10.5 percent tax rate. But because the bill is poorly worded, it can result in rates of 15 percent or more due to unfavorable effects on foreign tax credits.
GILTI's implementation could influence tax-base decisions among companies redomiciled in Britain, which may consider whether to relocate to the United States or other countries to avoid the effects of Brexit.
Redomiciling to the United States is a case-by-case decision, said Joe Calianno, tax partner at financial advisory firm BDO. 

""It really is a modeling exercise to determine whether it's more beneficial being a U.S.-based company versus a foreign-based company,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister said on Friday that Mexico and the United States could overcome key stumbling blocks standing in the way of a new NAFTA deal next week, adding that Canada would likely soon rejoin the negotiations.
Mexican and U.S. teams will work through the weekend to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the ministers will return to the table late next week, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters after meetings with U.S. officials in Washington.
Mexico and the United States resumed talks last week, after a U.S. move to slap tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metal exports and Mexico's July elections stalled negotiations that began last year when President Donald Trump demanded a better deal for U.S. workers. 
""Technically, we are ready to move into finishing the issues, Mexico-U.S. issues, the most next week. There are very good probabilities that we'll be landing solutions,"" Guajardo said in English. 
""We are optimistic that we can try to land a deal before the end of August,"" adding there were ""three critical, specific points"" to resolve that he declined to specify.
Another senior Mexican negotiator was a little less bullish about the chances of a deal this month.
""I am cautiously optimistic. I think it can be done, but there can also be problems. We have to see,"" Jesus Seade, who joined the Mexican negotiating team last week representing President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Canada has not been at the table in rounds of talks over the past weeks. Some experts say this is a sign of tensions between Canada and the United States, while officials insist trilateral talks will soon resume. 
Guajardo said top U.S. and Mexican officials could meet again on Wednesday or Thursday.
Rules for the auto sector, including a U.S. demand for higher wages in Mexico, as well as a U.S.-proposed sunset clause that would kill the deal if it is not renegotiated every five years, have been major stumbling block to talks.
Seade said the issue of the sunset clause could be broached next week. ""It is something we have to discuss and the time has come,"" he said. ""We have said that is not something we can work with."" 

Guajardo said neither the sunset clause nor wages were being discussed between Mexico and the United States on Friday.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.
1/INFLATION DOG TO BARK?
Stubbornly low inflation has been described as the dog that didn't bark. Indeed, inflation has stayed weak even as global stocks have rallied hard in the past decade. But is the dog about to start barking?
It's a question markets are sensitive to, and Friday's consumer inflation data will be next week's most closely-watched U.S. data point.
Year-on-year core CPI, which measures prices that consumers pay for frequently purchased items, has been inching up. June's core CPI was 2.3 percent and is seen holding steady in July. But on a monthly basis, prices are expected to rise 0.2 percent versus a 0.1 percent increase in June, Reuters forecasts show.
June's near-flat reading was driven by moderate gasoline price gains and falls in apparel and hotel costs. The U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the PCE price index, has also this year hit the 2 percent target for the first time in six years.
2/BACK TO JAPAN
The Bank of Japan's plan to give banks some relief from years of near-zero rates proved to be a minor policy tweak that lifted the upper bound of its 10-year yield target to 0.2 percent. Yet for a market resigned to seeing ultra-long bond yields trending steadily down to zero, even this small step was significant.
Thirty-year bonds, popular with Japanese pension funds and insurers, saw yields spike 17 basis points to 0.85 percent in less than two weeks. That took yields close to the one percent level at which insurers' returns match the payout promises they made to policyholders.
If yields keep rising, government bond returns will compensate local investors for the narrow spreads they currently make on fully-hedged purchases of U.S. Treasuries or German Bunds. Japanese investors have already started selling Treasury holdings. Their total foreign debt investments amounted to $2.1 trillion at the end of 2017 -- data on Thursday will show if these holdings are being pared back.
3/YUAN TRADE
Washington has imposed duties on $34 billion of imports from China, and threatened more. Beijing has announced levies on $60 billion of U.S. goods. And as the trade war gets going, China-watchers will keep eyes trained on next week's July trade figures to gauge the initial damage from the spat.
They will also watch the yuan. Having hit 14-month lows, it rallied after authorities raised forward forex reserve ratio requirements.
It is unclear whether a weak currency is part of China's stimulus toolkit or a means of retaliation against tariffs. Historically, there is no correlation between the exchange rate and the bilateral trade between the two countries. But a weaker currency will doubtless make life easier for exporters.
The week may show if the currency has indeed hit a trough, or if the central bank move was just a warning to speculators who have started seeing yuan weakness as a one-way bet.
4/ITALIAN BONDS AND BANKS
As more Italian banks report second-quarter earnings, numbers from UniCredit, the country's biggest lender by assets, and smaller peers will be scanned for signs of damage from sovereign stress. BPER Banca , Credito Valtellinese (MI:PCVI) and Popolare di Sondrio (MI:BPSI) are among lenders due to report results. A bond market rout in May around the formation of an anti-establishment coalition government is likely to have inflicted painful cuts to the value of banks' holdings of government bonds. Italy's worsening outlook has already driven 10 consecutive weeks of earnings downgrades.
The key metric to watch is the capital adequacy CET1 ratio and how this was impacted by the sell-off in government bonds. Reported by banks alongside profit-and-loss statements, the CET1 highlights the gap between banks with healthy balance sheets and others whose capital buffers are thin.
Fears are that the finances of Italy's weaker banks are on shakier grounds. A drop in bond values caused a 140 basis point (bps) hit to Monte dei Paschi's CET1 (MI:BMPS), while heavyweight  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) announced a manageable 35 bps erosion.
The focus on capital erosion may even overshadow banks' progress in reducing non-performing loans. Executives will also be quizzed on how they assess political risks before the next budget comes up for discussion in autumn.
5/IT'S HOTTER IN TURKEY
Turkey's collapsing lira may have driven inflation to over 14-year highs but it's done wonders for the country's tourist industry, which enjoyed a 30 percent surge in the number of foreign visitors in June.
Those tourism revenues may help with Turkey's other big economic problem -- its current account deficit. They are a major source of funding for the deficit which ballooned to $5.885 billion in May, well above forecasts.
Figures for June are out on Friday. They could determine if the lira suffers another major leg lower, after tumbling this week to new record lows below 5 per dollar <TRY=>.

283,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Carney's Misunderstood BOE Rate Hike Inflames U.K. Brexit Divide,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England’s latest interest-rate increase has become another battleground in the vitriolic Brexit debate -- yet many of the arguments overlook Governor Mark Carney’s reasoning.
Despite Carney’s press conference and media interviews, some politicians and economists have been quick to call the move a mistake ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union, while others said it proves a buoyant economy that has defied Brexit critics.
The BOE’s rationale is that the second hike since the 2016 referendum wasn’t a reaction to booming growth or a vote of confidence in a smooth Brexit. Instead, it’s standard central banking to temper rising inflationary forces in a world that’s changed since the financial crisis.
“There are some -- not red flags, but some amber pointers, that would tell you that being on a gradual tightening path is the right place to be at this point,” said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec. “They don’t want to be in a position, if Brexit has gone relatively to plan, to then have to suddenly sharply adjust policy and put the brakes on growth.”
BOE policy makers, who voted 9-0 in favor of the increase, are trying to strike a balance between taming inflation as the economy runs out of slack, and protecting against the risk that the nation’s Brexit talks will end in a hard rupture that hits growth. Carney said himself on Friday that the risk of the U.K. dropping out of the EU without a deal is unlikely, yet still “uncomfortably high.”
Nevertheless, Brexit defenders said the rate hike was vindication that the economy was strong and Carney was wrong to warn against the negative consequences of leaving. Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, who at one point called for Carney’s resignation, said on Twitter that the governor “has long been the high priest of project fear, whose reputation for inaccurate and politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England.”
Others argued that the economy is just too weak for higher rates with Brexit looming. David Blanchflower, a Dartmouth economics professor who sat on the BOE’s rate-setting committee from 2006 to 2009, wrote in a Guardian column that the increase will have to be reversed, and business groups accused the bank of “jumping the gun.”
For its part, the BOE says the U.K.’s economy’s speed limit is now lower, meaning it can’t expand as quickly as it could before the financial crisis without generating unwanted price pressures. Weaker productivity growth is another drawback that leads policy makers to think that even an historically modest expansion will unleash inflation demons.
“We have to reorient ourselves to the current realities,” Carney said in a press conference after the bank’s policy announcement. “There are a few uncomfortable new normals to reconcile ourselves with.”
With efficiency growth far from its pre-crisis average, unit labor costs -- which can drive domestically generated inflation -- are growing at levels consistent with the BOE’s inflation target, Carney said. They rose at the fastest pace since the end of 2013 in the first quarter.
Brexit surprises could still lead the bank to change course. But that doesn’t automatically mean rate cuts, Carney argued Thursday. And if circumstances warrant it, the bank can quickly change tact and loosen policy. For now, he said the BOE has to work with what it sees.
“The mistake is to always wait wait wait until you have perfect certainty,” he said. “You don’t know when that higher degree of certainty is going to transpire.”"

286,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 09:39AM ET</span>","Payrolls Report Sets Stage for More Jobs Gains, Fed Rate Hikes","Investing.com - Although July’s nonfarm payrolls fell short of consensus, the data continue to paint a picture of a solid labor market poised for strong job creation that will likely keep the Federal Reserve on track for two more rate hikes this year as part of its plan to “gradually” tighten monetary policy.
“The U.S. economy’s powerful job creation engine continues as revisions to prior months, together with 157,000 new jobs in July, take the three-month average to over 220,000 and unemployment falls to 3.9%,” Allianz Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian commented after the release.
“In our estimation, the top line gain in private payrolls of 170,000 is more a function of noise rather than a signal of a move away from the underlying 12-month trend of roughly 200K,” RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas said.
“The labor market is stout and will remain this way throughout 2018,” he added.
ING chief international economist James Knightley noted that “there are certainly worries about protectionism and its potential economic impact, but we also have to remember that the stimulus from tax cuts dwarfs the tax hit from higher tariffs”.
“The economy is growing really strongly and headline inflation set to hit 3% next week, so the case for September and December Fed rate hikes remains strong,” Knightley concluded.
Fed fund futures held up Knightley’s analysis, with markets still pricing in the next rate hike for the next September 25-26 meeting. Odds for an additional increase in December remained little changed after the release at around 70%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool."
287,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. Trade Deficit Widened in June for First Time in Four Months,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. trade deficit grew in June for the first time in four months as imports increased and the value of shipments overseas declined against a backdrop of escalating tensions with America's trading partners.
The gap widened 7.3 percent to $46.3 billion from a revised $43.2 billion in the prior month, Commerce Department data showed Friday.
The June figures capped an otherwise positive quarter for U.S. trade, as a narrowing of the deficit contributed the most to economic growth since 2013. While tariffs and the threat of retaliatory levies prompted a pickup in shipments of soybeans and some other materials, American exports of capital goods, vehicles and consumer goods declined in June, indicating trade may be of less help to the economy going forward.
Overall exports dropped 0.7 percent to $213.8 billion, despite record overseas shipments of petroleum and all industrial supplies and materials. Imports climbed 0.6 percent to $260.2 billion, boosted by pharmaceuticals, crude oil, chemicals and other industrial supplies.
The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a June trade deficit of $46.5 billion.
The trade gap data for July will be more closely watched for signs that developments related to President Donald Trump's trade policies are taking a toll on the economy.
Rising demand by U.S. households and businesses is expected to keep supporting purchases of foreign-made goods in coming months. At the same time, it is hard to predict how exports may perform, given that the headwinds from trade also are a risk to the outlook for the global economy. In addition, the dollar continues to strengthen.
The U.S. economy accelerated to a 4.1 percent pace of growth in the second quarter, the fastest since 2014. A big boost came from net exports, which contributed 1.06 percentage points to growth, the most since 2013. That reflected a jump in shipments abroad of soybeans, up 40 percent in the first half of the year compared with 2017, and petroleum and related products.
The report also showed the merchandise trade gap with China, the world's second-biggest economy, was little changed in June at $32.5 billion after May's $32 billion.
The trade deficit with Mexico widened to $6.7 billion and the gap with European Union countries grew to $12.8 billion.

288,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Canada Overcomes Trump's Metal Tariffs With Record Exports,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s merchandise trade deficit was lower than forecast after the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, as oil producers and aircraft makers led exports to a record high.
The trade gap narrowed to C$626 million ($481 million) in June, down from C$2.7 billion a month earlier, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting a deficit of C$2.3 billion.
Exports rose 4.1 percent to a record C$50.7 billion, with energy shipments rising 7.1 percent to their highest since 2014 and aircraft sales jumping by almost 45 percent. The return of several Canadian refineries to production after shutdowns also played a role in the 0.2 percent decline in imports as demand for foreign gasoline tumbled.
Those boosts to the trade balance more than overcame declines in exports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. of 37 percent 7 percent respectively. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in June, predicated on national security considerations; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government retaliated dollar-for-dollar on July 1.
Canada’s exports are on pace to advance faster than imports over the next year according to Bloomberg forecasts, reflecting higher crude oil prices and demand for building materials in a growing global economy. The Bank of Canada is counting on trade and investment to contribute more to an economic expansion as it raises interest rates, while saying protectionism remains the biggest risk.
Those risks include talks with the U.S. and Mexico to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Trump’s threats of new tariffs on automotive imports.

289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",China Plans Tariffs on $60 Billion of Imports to Counter Trump,"(Bloomberg) -- China announced a list of $60 billion worth of U.S. imports it plans to apply tariffs on should the Trump administration follow through with its latest trade threats.
Duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on 5,207 kinds of American imports if the U.S. delivers its proposed taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website late Friday.
The retaliation stands to further inflame tensions between the world’s two biggest economies and echoes China’s response to the previous round of tariffs which took effect last month.
President Donald Trump this week ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate. The move was intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands for structural changes to the Chinese economy and a cut in the bilateral trade deficit.
The Trump administration slapped duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month, which prompted immediate retaliation from China, and another $16 billion will likely follow in the coming days or weeks.

290,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Raise Intra-Africa Trade to Counter U.S. Effect, World Bank Says","(Bloomberg) -- African nations should consider increasing access to markets within the region to help offset the effects of increased U.S. protectionism, the World Bank’s vice president for the continent said.
“The region may need to expand market access to absorb the costs arising from the hike in tariffs,” Hafez Ghanem said in an interview Thursday in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. “This would include strengthening trade among Africa countries.”
Escalating trade tensions are threatening to derail a global upswing that’s already losing momentum amid weaker-than-expected economic growth in Europe and Japan as financial markets seem complacent to the mounting risks, the International Monetary Fund warned July 16.
In June, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 25 percent duty on steel and 10 percent levy on aluminum from South Africa, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, after refusing their calls for permanent exemptions. The U.S. says the tariffs are needed to protect its industry and national security. The government of Africa’s most-industrialized economy is concerned that the U.S. is considering a new wave of tariffs that could be extended to the auto industry, which is one of the cornerstones of South African manufacturing.
Trade Effect
The extent of the impact will depend on the size and pattern of trade countries have either with the U.S. or with third-party nations that trade with it, Ghanem said. China, upon which the U.S. has imposed billions of dollars of duties, was sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest trading partner last year at about $120 billion.
“Take South Africa for instance: the possible imposition of a tariff on imported cars from Asia may affect the international supply chain of the steel industry and Asia, in general, remains the main export destination of South Africa’s iron and steel products,” Ghanem said. “Tariffs may also affect export volumes of non-oil exporting countries in the region, which typically sell apparel, agricultural and other manufactured edible products abroad.”
While Africa’s trade with the rest of the world expanded 11 percent to $907.6 billion last year, the portion of trade within the continent declined to 14 percent of the total, the African Export-Import Bank said in a July report.
South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria accounted for more than 35 percent of intra-Africa trade last year. South Africa contributed a quarter of the region’s domestic commerce in 2017, mostly in oil imports from Nigeria and Angola.
Talks to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area, with a combined gross domestic product of more than $3 trillion, started in 2015 and in May, Ghana and Kenya became the first countries to ratify the deal. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the agreement in July and will soon ratify it, he said at the time.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>","For emerging market investors, U.S. sanctions on Russia will not pack same punch","By Marc Jones and Daniel Bases
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A threat to impose sanctions on Russian sovereign debt transactions is one of the biggest financial weapons that the U.S. can deploy against the Kremlin, but Moscow's slide down the investment league table in recent years means the move will not pack the punch it once would have. 
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at penalizing Russia for interference in recent elections, something the Kremlin strongly denies, as well as for its annexation of Crimea and actions in Syria.
The sanctions would need to be passed by the full House and receive President Donald Trump's signature, but if they do become a reality it would mark a new low in relations between the former Cold War foes.
They would also hit the energy sector, Russian uranium imports and a host of oligarchs, but it is a move to ban purchases of any new Russian sovereign debt going forward that has raised the most eyebrows.
It is considered one of Washington's most potent tools because it would effectively freeze the Russian government out of international borrowing markets, creating a similar scenario to that faced by Argentina for a decade until 2015, following a default and a U.S. court ruling against it. 
The measure may create fewer problems for Russia though than were faced by Argentina, given Russia has one of the lowest debt levels in the world and nearly half a trillion U.S. dollars in reserves thanks to huge oil and gas export revenues.
Russia is also used to belt-tightening during difficult times and has sharply cut back on issuing dollar debt after the Ukraine crisis. In addition, Russia features less in emerging market investors' portfolios than it did even five years ago. 
""Russia is still an overweight for most people at the moment, but this isn't going to kill the fund industry by any means,"" said Peter Kisler, an emerging market debt manager at North Asset Management.
As overseas borrowing by the Russian government and companies has shrunk, so has the country's weighting on bond indexes that are used by investors. 
For instance, Russia comprises just 3.6 percent of JPMorgan's EMBI Global ""hard currency"" sovereign bond index, compared to 9.0 percent in 2007.
On the CEMBI corporate debt index, it amounts to 5.0 percent, down from 14 percent 10 years ago.
To view a graphic on Russia's weighting in global bond indexes png, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2K7y48s
So in theory at least, it would be relatively easy for investors to bypass Russia in portfolios, even if its debt is a current favorite due to scarcity value and the country's rock-solid payment credentials.
Mike Cirami, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance in Boston said the weighting of Russian debt was now small enough and the premium it offers was low enough for investors to easily be able to jettison it if needed.
""If all you were was an EMBI investor, you could forget that Russia exists in my opinion, and you could manage just fine and not have any problems outperforming (the benchmark EMBI Global Diversified),"" he said.
Russia has a higher 7.6 percent weight in the index for emerging local currency bonds, the GBI-EM. That's up from 1.5 percent in 2007, but off the 10 percent index-maximum it hit during the 2012-14 oil boom.
But while rouble government debt, known as OFZ, has been popular with investors,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts last week highlighted a decline in foreigners' share of the market. Central bank data showed foreign holdings at 28 percent in June, the lowest since February 2017.

STOCK ANSWER
It is by no means certain that U.S. sanctions will be deployed as many reckon the Treasury will hold off from such aggressive measures.
""I would say that our base case is that Russian sovereign would be a last-resort sanction, whereas they are likely to use the corporate sector to target individuals and companies from a sanctions perspective,"" said Shamaila Khan, head of emerging markets fixed income at AllianceBernstein in New York.
""The fact is, once you embark on a sanctions path you just don't know where it ends,"" added Khan, who said unpredictability could weigh on Russian asset prices generally.
The developments nonetheless focus attention on how Russian markets have stagnated relative to those in other developing economies. Its importance over the last decade has declined for bond as well as equity investors.
Russia's weighting on MSCI's emerging equity index, a benchmark for almost $2 trillion in cash, has dwindled to 3.3 percent from over 10 percent in 2007. China's weight, meanwhile, has almost doubled in that period to nearly 30 percent.
That reflects Russia's own stagnation, says Renaissance Capital's global economist, Charles Robertson. He notes the three biggest companies in Russia's equity index are the same ones as back in 2007 - Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Sberbank and Rosneft. All are state-controlled.
""At one point, we were asking whether Russia's GDP was going to catch up with California's,"" said Robertson ""That is certainly not going to happen now.""
And unless there is a shake-up in the Russian political order and economy, these commodity-reliant companies can expect to hang on to their top positions, he predicted.
Contrast this with the United States, where the top rankings change every decade or two. China is replicating that dynamic with technology giants such as Tencent and Baidu taking over from previous companies that topped the rankings, including state-run oil firms and banks. Within MSCI's emerging equity index too, technology firms have displaced commodity producers as the biggest firms.
Russia's Gazprom was the biggest company in the index back in 2007. Today it does not make the top 10.

292,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:56AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, August 3:
1. Wages in focus in jobs report
The U.S. Labor Department will release the nonfarm payrolls report for July at 8:30AM ET on Friday, and it will be watched more for what it says about wages than hiring.
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 193,000, after adding 213,000 positions in June, while the unemployment rate is seen inching down to 3.9% from 4.0%.
However, most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.3%, a tad faster than the 0.2% increase a month earlier. On an annualized basis, wages are forecast to increase 2.7%, the same gain reported in June.
A spike could put the Federal Reserve on notice about inflation as it considers more rate hikes. The Fed said this week it would continue to gradually raise rates should the economy continue to show ""sustained expansion,"" supported by a strong labor market and close-to-target inflation.
2. Japan overtakes China as world’s 2nd largest stock market as tariffs weigh
Chinese stocks have been pummeled by worries over tariffs, losing $2.29 trillion in value since a January high and falling into third place among the world’s biggest stock markets.
As of Thursday’s close, Bloomberg data showed that Chinese equities were worth $6.09 trillion, falling below the $6.16 trillion value of Japanese shares. U.S. stocks remained the biggest market at $31 trillion.
The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and Beijing has sent Chinese stocks on a nosedive along with the yuan.
The Chinese currency hit a 15-month low against the dollar early Friday, heading for its eighth straight weekly decline, the longest run since the start of the country’s modern foreign-exchange rate regime in 1994.
China's services sector expanded at the weakest pace in four months in July, as there was the least growth in new business since December 2015, a private survey showed on Friday.
Forward-looking sentiment meanwhile was the second-weakest on record, with respondents blaming concerns surrounding company restructuring and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
3. U.S. futures cautious ahead of jobs report
U.S. futures pointed to a flat open on Friday as traders switched to a cautious stance ahead of the jobs report. A day earlier, the Nasdaq Composite ended with gains of 1.24%, boosted by buying furor in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that took the tech giant’s market cap beyond the $1 trillion mark.
At 5:55 AM ET (9:55 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures edged forward 2 points, or 0.01%, S&P 500 futures were unchanged, while the Nasdaq 100 futures inched up 6 points, or 0.08%.
Elsewhere, European shares traded higher on Friday as investors celebrated upbeat earnings.
Earlier, Chinese shares increased their losses, falling below Japanese equities in value and losing their spot as the world’s second largest stock market where they had been since 2014. Japan’s Nikkei closed with meager gains of 0.05%.
4. Earnings season winding down
The bulk of second quarter earnings have already hit the wires and more than 80% of the S&P firms that have already reported have beaten profit estimates.
Just 8 S&P firms release earnings on Friday, but that will take the total so far to 406, or 81%.
Still, investors will likely look to a few names expected to release quarterly reports ahead of trading Friday.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is expected to report a quarterly profit of 92 cents per share on sales of about $6.6 billion.
The top line will likely get the most scrutiny as the company has seen softness in sales in recent quarter. Investors will also be looking for signs of cost inflation.
In addition, online coupon company Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will issue results. Analysts expect it to post a profit of 3 cents per share on sales of $632 million. Shares of Groupon are higher in the past three months.
5. Oil prices waver ahead of U.S. shale production data
Oil prices wavered in early morning trade on Friday, passing between gains and losses, as a reported drop in inventories at a key delivery point in the U.S. boosted sentiment, but investors awaited data on U.S. drilling activity amid concerns of escalating production.
Information provider Genscape reportedly said Thursday that U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude stateside, had fallen by 1.1 million barrels since Friday, July 27. That added to official data out on Wednesday that said those stockpiles decreased by 1.338 million barrels last week.
Capping gains, concerns remained about escalating output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia.
Market participants will watch production developments in the U.S. as Baker Hughes releases its weekly data later on Friday.
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by 3 to 861 last week, according to oilfield services firm’s data. That was the first rig count rise in three weeks, pointing to signs of U.S. output growth."
293,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:38AM ET</span>",Italy ministers to meet on budget as markets fret,"ROME (Reuters) - Senior ministers in Italy's government were expected to meet on Friday to discuss next year's budget, two sources said, as investors concerned about the government's spending plans sold Italian bonds.
Ahead of the meeting, which was scheduled to begin at 0900 GMT according to the sources, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the budget would include tax cuts and pensions reform. 
Both moves would likely increase Italy's large public debt, unless balanced by corresponding spending cuts which the government has so far not detailed.
""The (2019) budget will not include all planned measures immediately, but there will be the first steps towards a flat tax and a radical overhaul of the pensions system,"" Salvini, who leads the far-right League, said in a TV interview.
There is no news conference scheduled to follow the meeting and no official announcement is expected.
Salvini's remarks came as Italian government bonds were selling off for a second day in a row on continued speculation over the government's budget plans.
Yields on Italian 10-year bonds (IT10YT=RR) rose to briefly hit 3 percent for the first time since June 11, and the closely watched spread over German debt (DE10YT=RR) was at its widest since late June, at 257 basis points.
The ruling coalition, made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the League, have pledged to cut taxes, roll back a 2011 pension reform that raised the minimum retirement age, and boost welfare spending.
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, a former economics professor who is not a member of either of the ruling parties, has repeatedly said the government will be cautious, and aim to reduce the huge public debt.
Italy's debt, at around 132 percent of gross domestic product, is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's.
Tria has promised to coordinate the government's tax and spending initiatives with the European Commission, which monitors how European Union member states comply with EU fiscal rules.
However, some investors fear he could be sidelined or even forced to resign over the budget, which must be presented to the Commission by October.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Emerging market flows rebound but second-quarter inflow a tenth of first-quarter: IIF,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pumped $11.9 billion into emerging stocks and bonds in July, reversing some of June's hefty outflows, according to the Institute for International Finance (IIF).
The IIF, one of the most authoritative trackers of capital flows to and from the developing world, also said portfolio inflows to developing countries totaled just $11 billion in the second quarter, a tenth of the $118 billion received in Q1.
In a note late on Thursday, the IIF said equity flows in July had totaled $7.9 billion, of which China had received $5.3 billion. Net debt inflow amounted to $4 billion.
The July turnaround came after $24 billion fled emerging markets in June, spooked by signs of a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve and of growth slowdown caused by trade tensions. The June selloff came after five straight months of inflow.
The second quarter net inflow of $11 billion to developing countries compares poorly to the $118 billion received in the Jan-March period, a time when dollar weakness persuaded investors to allocate more capital to emerging markets.
The IIF said also that China, was becoming increasingly important in the flows picture, receiving some 40 percent of overall emerging market portfolio investment in the past two years, up from 25 percent in the 2010-2016 period.
""This reflects, in part, China's gradual efforts to open its domestic bond and stock markets to foreign investors,"" the IIF said, identifying MSCI's decision to include Chinese mainland stocks into its indexes as an important catalyst.
Year-to-date Chinese equity inflows total $41.4 billion versus $16 billion in the first half of 2017, the data shows. Debt inflows so far in 2018 stand at $60 billion, from $9 billion in the same 2017 period.
""However, further yuan weakness could prove to be a significant headwind for such portfolio flows as it has in the past,"" the IIF said, citing the yuan's fall to 13-month lows amid policy easing and trade tensions with the United States.
Excluding China, however, emerging markets saw net outflows of $2 billion in the second quarter, the first net outflow since the last 2015 quarter.
The slowdown in inflow was most pronounced in India, Poland, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey, the note added.

With less than eight months until Britain leaves the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has begun talking more publicly about the prospect of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement on what happens next.
Carney said a no-deal Brexit was ""a relatively unlikely possibility but it is still a possibility"", adding that it would also be ""highly undesirable"".
""I think the possibility of a no deal is uncomfortably high at this point,"" Carney said in an interview with BBC radio.
""People will have things to worry about in a no deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility.""
Consumer prices would likely rise in the case of a no-deal Brexit as companies enacted contingency plans to keep supply chains operating, Carney said.

Sterling slipped to a low of $1.2985 on the comments.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",India chooses between a falling rupee and a banking cash crunch,"By Suvashree Choudhury and Rajendra Jadhav
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank faces a tough choice in how it uses its monetary muscle. Does it protect a fragile rupee or does it ensure there's enough cash in the banking system so lending in the economy doesn't dry up?
The Reserve Bank of India needs to pick one battle at the expense of the other, while also acknowledging that either choice leaves apart of economy vulnerable.
If it defends the rupee, Asia's worst performing currency this year, it risks sucking massive amounts of rupees out of an economy already grappling with tightness in cash and unintended policy tightening.
The alternative is to let the rupee weaken past 70-per-dollar to record lows, eroding confidence and investment in an economy heading into general elections next year.
Economists suspect it may choose currency stability, regardless of how tight funding conditions get, a point the RBI reinforced on Wednesday when it raised rates and emphasized containing inflation as a priority.
""It is a tough balancing act for RBI to keep the rupee stable while maintaining a neutral liquidity stance,"" said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
""The fact that RBI raised the rate once again proves that they are serious about inflation targeting and comfortable with growth. That is why they might actually let the liquidity deficit build on, so that it is in line with its anti-inflation stance.""
Such a decision, however, presents plenty of challenges for policymakers who are concerned about funding constraints in Asia's third largest economy.
The primarily inflation-targeting central bank has sold almost 5 percent of its foreign exchange reserves since April, trying to put a floor under the rupee. The currency is down 7 percent this year.
As it sold dollars for rupees, cash conditions domestically have tightened and yields have jumped.
Rates on 3-month deposits that banks place with each other have risen 100 basis points since April.
That's led to a rise in retail deposit rates, with State Bank of India lifting some of its deposit rates by around 60 basis points on Monday.
At the same time, the RBI's bond purchases, part of its money market operations, have been modest and done little to help bank liquidity.
A second major factor impacting cash supplies is the Indian tendency to stockpile cash, rather than bank it, a practice that picks up in the second half of the year as people keep money aside to spend on the festive season.
Bankers estimate that a slow drain of rupees could result in the banking system having a daily deficit of about one trillion rupees, which is about 1 percent of bank deposits, by March 2019 from a daily surplus of 300-400 billion rupees in June.
""Lending rates could rise by 50-75 basis points going ahead as liquidity is expected to tighten sharply and that could hit consumption demand to some extent,"" said Parthasarathi Mukherjee, chief executive officer at Lakshmi Vilas Bank.
""Given that we are headed towards a festival season when credit offtake will be higher, it will be useful if RBI provides banks with some more liquidity.""
The RBI did not respond to request for a comment. At a press conference on Wednesday after announcing its monetary policy, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya said the central bank will ""actively"" manage cash conditions.
To ease funding conditions, economists say the RBI needs to either cut back its currency intervention or conduct heavier open market operations, such as bond purchases from banks, to replenish the rupees.
But such bond-buying operations would make it cheaper for the government to borrow more, which would be inflationary and at odds with the central bank's efforts to fight price pressures.
The RBI's biggest challenges will be if tighter funding hurts an economy that's been expanding at an annualized pace above 7 percent, one of Asia's fastest.
Analysts think it ought to be doing more, if not through bond purchases then by unwinding forward holdings in dollar swaps to release funds.
""The onus on RBI is really in some form of quantitative easing,"" said Sanjay Mathur, chief economist for Southeast Asia & India at ANZ in Singapore.
""I expect RBI to stick to its neutral stance on liquidity and not move to a tight stance, which means it will leave adequate amount of liquidity to contain any sharp rise in interest rates or bond yields,"" Mathur said.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 03:49AM ET</span>",Japan weighs sovereign wealth fund for U.S infrastructure investment: Nikkei,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering creating a sovereign wealth fund to invest in U.S. infrastructure projects and U.S.-Japan joint projects in third countries and will float the idea at two-way trade talks in Washington next week, the Nikkei daily reported on Friday.
Tokyo is seeking ways to counter U.S. pressure for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) and head off a rise in tariffs on its auto exports when Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi meets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Aug. 9.
Motegi told a news conference on Friday that he wanted to ""take some ideas"" to the talks, adding Japan would not make concessions that would hurt its national interests.
Finance Minister Taro Aso said separately that Japan was in various talks with the United States on infrastructure, but had no specific plan to set up a sovereign wealth fund.
""Japan and the United States are holding various discussions in this area, but at the moment there’s no concrete consideration towards establishing a fund,"" Aso told reporters at a regular news briefing.
The Nikkei said that Japan would raise capital from the private sector through bond issues as early as the business year beginning April 2019 and provide low-cost government and possibly public-private loans, taking advantage of the Bank of Japan's hyper-easy monetary policy.
It added that the size of the fund has yet to be determined.
The proposal for the fund also urges converting money raised into foreign currency if the yen strengthens beyond around 100 yen to the dollar, a move that might open Japan to criticism of currency manipulation to keep the yen weak, Nikkei added.
A ruling party source with knowledge of U.S.-Japan ties said a sovereign wealth fund for infrastructure has been under consideration since April and would likely come up when Motegi meets Lighthizer. But a Japanese government source said such a plan was not being deliberated and was unlikely to be feasible. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.
Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told Reuters on Wednesday that Japanese firms were keen to invest in the robust U.S. market and that the government wants to ""firmly support and back that"". He did not elaborate.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told reporters the carmaker had no room to increase local production capacity in response to threatened tariffs.
Toyota has already committed in 2017 to spend $10 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next five years.
The reported sovereign wealth fund proposal comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week announced a $113 million initiative in technology, energy and infrastructure in Asia and a trilateral push by the United States, Australia and Japan to invest in regional infrastructure projects.
It echoes an idea floated last year to buy dollar-denominated ""infrastructure bonds"" as a way to take part in U.S. President Donald Trump's upgrade of U.S. infrastructure.
Sumitomo Corp (T:8053) Chief Financial Officer Koichi Takahata told reporters the trading house was interested in social infrastructure as a growth sector and would consider it if there were a stable supply of funds and a way to hedge against country risk, a concern in some third countries.
Trump wants a two-way trade pact as a way to cut America’s trade deficit with Japan but Tokyo is wary because an FTA would boost pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture.
Nishimura and other Japanese officials have said Japan is expected to increase its imports of liquefied natural gas from America and buy U.S. military gear needed for its defense, both of which would help reduce the trade imbalance.
But he ruled out setting a numerical limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, a tactic taken during trade wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the 1995 launch of the World Trade Organization, which generally bans such steps.

298,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",It’s Not Just the Economy,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Does James Carville’s famous campaign axiom — “It’s the economy, stupid” — still ring true? Some early indications are that Republican candidates are not trumpeting the strong U.S. economy under President Donald Trump as much as might be expected, given low unemployment and impressive GDP growth.
Do economic issues energize voters only when times are bad? Or, as Democrats claim, are GOP candidates wary of bragging about a boom when wages are still stagnant and the promised benefits of tax cuts haven’t helped the middle class, at least not yet?
Bloomberg Opinion columnists Ramesh Ponnuru, Albert R. Hunt, Virginia Postrel, Noah Smith, Jonathan Bernstein and Conor Sen discuss these questions.
It's the President, Stupid
Jonathan Bernstein: What really matters a lot is how popular the president is — measured by presidential approval. While the economy has only minimal direct effects on midterms, unlike presidential elections, it has indirect effects through the way it changes presidential approval.
That’s almost certainly the case now; even though Trump isn’t very popular, he would presumably be even less so if a recession had hit. It’s possible that the positive effects of the good economy on his approval have been dampened some by the lack of wage growth, although it's extremely difficult to prove such things one way or another.
The other way to look at it is that regardless of how important the economy might be to election results, whether candidates will talk about it a lot has much more to do with their policy agenda and what they think voters want to hear.
During good times, voters may tell pollsters that other issues are more important to them, and candidates will scurry to respond to those stated concerns — but what voters say they want to hear and what prompts their voting behavior may be two very different things.
Bill Clinton, for example, spent his 1996 reelection campaign babbling about a bridge to the 21st century, whatever that was about, but he was almost certainly reelected because the economy was booming.
It’s All Partisan Now
Ramesh Ponnuru: Most voters, especially in this era of polarization, do not base their political decisions mainly on “the economy, stupid.” They are instead partisans for one or the other of the two main parties, whether or not they admit it to themselves.
Their partisan leanings affect their assessment of the economy more than the reverse. And these partisan voters are more likely to turn out in a midterm election than voters with weaker preferences between the parties.
Democratic partisans, Republican partisans and truly independent voters are all likely to base their votes mainly on how they think Trump is doing. Economic conditions are likely to have an effect on that last group’s assessment of Trump: The better the economy is doing, the better they will think of him and the more likely they are to vote for his party.
But they may also decide that they dislike some of his traits and that he needs a congressional check. His supporters may also be more complacent than his opponents, and thus vote at lower rates.
The latest quarterly economic growth rate was the best one we have had since 2014. That wasn’t a good year for the party in power. The Democrats, who held the White House then, lost control of the Senate. Republicans might lose control of the House this year, strong growth notwithstanding.
James Carville Speaks
Al Hunt: The best way to address this may be to go back to the maestro, James Carville, who coined this perfect mantra for Bill Clinton in 1992.
He dismisses the distinction between presidential and midterm elections, and focuses on the durability of economic good, or bad, times. It has less to do with the data — GDP or even unemployment numbers — or the competing claims, and more to do with how voters feel.
“It takes a while for good economic numbers to kick in,” Carville said in an interview. He recalled that while the economy began rebounding in the initial Clinton years (actually it started at the end of the George H.W. Bush term), “We got clobbered in the 1994 midterms — people didn’t feel it yet.”
It’s not unusual for the economy to be a major factor in a non-presidential year, usually as a negative, as in 1982 when the Republicans got clobbered. He doesn’t see the economy helping Republicans much in November.
“Wages are stagnant today,” Carville says. “A lot of working-class voters still are struggling. They don’t feel it’s a good economy.”
Moreover, to drive home a strong economic message requires a political discipline that Trump lacks. “One day he’s talking up the economy, the next he’s attacking Angela Merkel or praising Putin.”
I agree with the Ragin’ Cajun: The only recourse for Republicans is to energize their voters with fear. As Democrats try to rile voters with attacks on tax cuts for the rich and stagnant wages, Republicans can scare people with claims that the Democrats will impeach the president or enact a government-run health-care plan. I don’t think that’ll work.
Identity Still Trumps Economic Interest
Virginia Postrel: The economy matters, but, as I wrote in the run-up to the 1998 midterms, “identity trumps interest.”
Americans care, of course, about their economic interests. But they care first about their identities. Consider the tax-paying, socially conservative Latinos who went Democratic in droves thanks to Pete Wilson’s “They keep coming” campaign for Proposition 187. If voters feel personally attacked — because they are Latinos, or working women, or housewives, or evangelical Christians, or gays — they will bolt the party that serves their economic interests. Their “natural enemies” will start to look like their friends. And if they are courted, valued, and made to feel at home, they will reciprocate. Hence, as the saying goes, American Jews have the incomes of Episcopalians and the voting patterns of Puerto Ricans.
The intervening two decades have only intensified this phenomenon. Trump’s election finally decided the battle for the soul of the Republican Party.
Trump’s GOP is now the party opposed to the open society, including open markets (the party of stasis, as I defined it in my 1998 book “The Future and Its Enemies”). To its benefit, however, it also the party that doesn’t hate traditionalist Christians or white men — two extremely common voter identities.
In the midterms the Democrats benefit from being the anti-Trump brand, able to capitalize on discontent with the president without clearly defining themselves as the sharply leftist party many activists yearn for. The oppositional definition helps in congressional races, allowing candidates to nationalize anti-Trump feelings while tailoring specifics to local sentiments.
Meanwhile, the good economy encourages voters who might otherwise lean Republican but don’t identify with Trump’s policies or character to simply stay home.
Consider Income and Gas Prices
Noah Smith: Unemployment is at record lows, but in the past there hasn’t been much correlation between unemployment and midterm election results.
A better predictor might be the change in real disposable income from the third quarter of the year before the election to the second quarter of the election year. Those numbers are in, and the number for Q2 2018 is 2.3 percent. That’s a strong number, and, according to a 2009 regression run by political scientist Seth Masket, would predict only about a 20-seat loss for the GOP — slightly less than the Democrats need to retake the House.
Of course, that prediction depends on a small sample of past elections, and even so there’s a huge amount of random noise — the GOP under George H.W. Bush in 1990 lost only a few seats, despite real per capita disposable income growth of only around 1 percent, while the Dems under Bill Clinton lost over 50 seats in 1994 despite a better income growth number.
So the predictors we have are pretty weak. There might be other predictors that political scientists just don’t bother to look at very often. Gas prices are almost $3 per gallon, which is reasonably high. Median real weekly earnings for full-time employees were lower in Q1 2018 than in Q2 2017, consistent with generally sluggish wage growth.
Then again, growth has been robust. So there are indicators that point in both directions. It just depends on what people care about.
One wild card is Trump’s trade war. Trump’s tariffs have hurt some manufacturers, and retaliation has hurt farmers. Trump shows no sign of backing down. His offer to bail out affected farmers didn’t seem to go over too well either — very few businesspeople want to be dependent on the government dole.
The economist Mancur Olson theorized that when the benefits of a policy are vague and spread out throughout the economy, while the harms are concentrated on a few victims, people don’t like it. In the case of the trade war, the harms are highly visible and concentrated on a few unlucky businesses and their workers, while the benefits — except to steel and aluminum makers — have yet to materialize.
That could play badly with voters in November. Sometimes what’s important isn’t the economy’s current condition, but what a leader is doing to affect its future condition — and here, Trump doesn’t look great.
Look at the Electoral Evidence
Conor Sen: Carville was a presidential adviser, and that’s the issue here — “It’s the economy, stupid” works for presidential elections, but less so for midterms. The economy was bad during the 2002 midterm election season but the country rallied to Republicans and President George W. Bush in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. By comparison, in 2006 when the economy was good but the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were unpopular, the country turned control of the House over to Democrats.
Whether it’s the special-election results since the beginning of 2017 or generic ballot polling for Congress, the evidence so far suggests that voters are leaning more toward Democrats even with the economy performing well.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers disagreed on how to address soft inflation and the rising cost of its ultra-easy policy, minutes of their June meeting showed, underscoring the challenge they face in achieving their elusive price target.
The minutes showed the BOJ board likely deliberated ways to make its massive stimulus program more sustainable as long ago as June, which led to its decision this week to make tweaks to its asset-buying and allow yields to rise more.
The minutes showed on Friday that some members saw it ""necessary to continue to carefully examine the effects of the prolonged low-yield environment"" on financial institutions' profits.
""One member said it would likely take a certain amount of time to achieve the BOJ's inflation target. This member maintained it was therefore necessary for the BOJ to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing in a sustainable manner,"" according to the minutes.
The central bank does not identify the members in its minutes.
At the June meeting, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady and downgraded its assessment on inflation, reinforcing views Japan will lag well behind its U.S. and European peers in dialling back crisis-mode policies.
The minutes showed one member arguing that the BOJ should not try to forcibly push up demand via additional easing as doing so could create distortions in the economy that was already in good shape.
But another member said recent sluggish inflation had heightened the need to ramp up stimulus to achieve the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible.
With inflation distant from its target, the BOJ has been forced to maintain its massive stimulus program even amid the rising cost of prolonged easing such as the hit to bank profits from near-zero rates.
""One member said the BOJ must consider countermeasures against the side effects of its policy before they materialized,"" as some banks were suffering from low profits and unrealized losses on securities holdings, the minutes showed.
The board also discussed the need to address dwindling trade in Japan's government bond market, as the central bank continued to gobble up huge amount of bonds to flood markets with cash.
""One member expressed the view that, when controlling the long-term yields, it was important to conduct market operations more flexibly with a view to maintaining the functioning of financial markets as much as possible,"" it showed.
""In addition to analyzing recent price moves, the BOJ should examine and discuss at its July meeting the effect its continued powerful monetary easing is having on the Japanese government bond market,"" the minutes quoted one member as saying.

At the subsequent meeting in July, the BOJ kept its yield targets steady but pledged for the first time to keep rates very low for an extended period. It also said it would allow bond yields to rise more and took steps that would give it space to slow its massive buying of government bonds and risky assets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Negotiators for Mexico and the United States have reached agreement on about 20 topics during talks to revamp NAFTA, Mexico's economy minister said on Thursday, although he conceded that some of the thorniest issues remained unresolved. 
Ildefonso Guajardo said after leaving a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that the group had yet to discuss issues such as the ""sunset clause,"" a provision sought by the United States under which the agreement would have to be renegotiated every five years. But he was upbeat about the group's progress. 
""There are a lot of things, at least 20 items, that have been worked through, and there is very good advancement in all of them,"" he said. 
Talks among Mexico, the United States and Canada to modernize the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement have dragged on since last year, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted a better deal for U.S. business and workers.
Guajardo and other Mexican officials returned to Washington this week for another of bilateral talks with the United States. 
Hopes for a deal have risen since Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's victory in the country's July 1 presidential election. 
Lori Wallach, head of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch division, a Washington-based public advocacy group, said the views of the United States and Mexico were converging on NAFTA policy, in large part because Lopez Obrador's team had been backing the U.S. objective to raise wages for automotive workers.
She suggested negotiators for the United States and Mexico would near an agreement in principle and say to Canada: ""Come on in the pool, the water's fine. We're almost there, come make it tri-national with us.'""
The U.S. and Mexican delegations will meet again on Friday morning, Guajardo said. Earlier in the day, he said he was keeping Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland informed on the progress of discussions with the United States. 
Jesus Seade, Lopez Obrador's chief NAFTA negotiator, said earlier on Thursday that the meeting would cover ""A to the Z and everything in between.""
Before entering the trade office with Guajardo, he told reporters he felt confident that negotiators would be able to reach agreements if they moved quickly, but said that auto-sector rules were a ""central part"" of a deal. 

""There won't be any deal until there's everything,"" he said.

With just 11 weeks until a divorce accord is meant to be signed, May needs to chart a path to a deal. One possible course is emerging.
Here’s where we are.
1. A deal is possible, but with the key decisions postponed
May can get an orderly divorce deal, but probably only if she postpones until after Brexit all the difficult decisions about what the future relationship with the bloc should look like. That’s the issue that causes the biggest fights within her party.
Brexit talks are in two parts: First the divorce deal -- the bit both sides want done in October -- and then the future trade deal, which won’t be negotiated until after the U.K. leaves. There will be a political statement about the kind of future relationship the two sides want, attached to the divorce deal. But it’s not binding and can be pretty short. EU officials have been saying since at least March that they don’t expect much to be agreed on the future relationship before exit day. And as the clock ticks down, they are being proved right.
Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier rejected May’s proposal for the future relationship last week, sending her back to the drawing board. But at the same time, he has opened the door to a bit of flexibility on the divorce deal.
2. A solution to the Irish border issue might be emerging
Barnier has said he’s open to new ideas on how to guarantee the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remains open after Brexit. This is the main sticking point in divorce talks.
U.K. officials say in private they are working on a proposal that could solve the Irish border issue. It’s potentially controversial as it would erect some barriers between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. But on Thursday a member of the Northern Irish party that props up May in London -- and therefore a key player that must be satisfied -- gave a hint that his party could potentially accept the plan U.K. officials have been working on.
The plan would put a regulatory border -- checks on things like consumer standards -- between Northern Ireland and Britain but not, crucially, a customs border. Democratic Unionist Party lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson said the red line was a ""customs border.""
If the Irish issue can be fixed, that’s a major obstacle removed from the path to a deal.
3. September is a new milestone
Tune in for an EU leaders summit in Salzburg on Sept. 20. EU officials have said it may become a Brexit summit. (It was meant to be an informal gathering of leaders to discuss immigration.) An October summit, long billed as the key moment for a Brexit deal to be sealed, has now become an EU-Asia gathering about the trade war. Both sides have said they want a deal by October so that the U.K. and EU parliaments have time to approve the agreement before exit day in March.
4. There’s still a big fight in Parliament once a deal is done
Whatever May agrees in Brussels, she needs to bring it back to Parliament for approval. She doesn’t have a majority, and some hardline Brexit supporters in her party might vote against it. That makes the Labour Party key. She will need to pick off members of the opposition to vote with her, even as the party leadership will probably be trying to bring her down and trigger a general election. She will need to convince enough lawmakers that it’s a choice between her deal and chaos. It will be tight.
5. There’s one more unexpected fight to watch out for
The Irish border issue is the main stumbling block in the divorce deal. But there are others. The two sides have still failed to reach an agreement on so-called geographical indications, the location-based trademarks that protect Parmesan cheese, Champagne and Scotch whisky. It’s part of the divorce deal, even though it could end up tying the U.K.’s hands when it comes to negotiating trade deals elsewhere in the future. For many EU countries it’s a priority. Don’t be surprised if it becomes an issue."

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is seeking an exemption to a 25 percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility, the automaker said on Thursday, in a move to prevent the key model in the brand's U.S. lineup from becoming a victim of the U.S.-China trade war.
The midsize SUV, priced starting at about $35,000, has become a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio. The Envision, assembled only in China, last year accounted for about 19 percent of Buick brand sales in the United States.
GM said in a statement that it filed the request on July 30 with the U.S. Trade Representative. An official notice was posted on Thursday on the regulations.gov website, which is tracking requests for exclusions from the so-called Section 301 tariff on certain imported goods from China.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, argued in its request that Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds ""to invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.""
GM said the ""vast majority"" of Envisions, about 200,000 a year, are sold in China. About 41,000 were sold last year in the United States.
Because of the lower U.S. sales volume, ""assembly in our home market is not an option"" for the Envision, which competes with such mid-size crossover vehicles as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac XT5.
GM has taken other steps to soften the blow of tariffs, which hit just as the automaker had lowered the price of the Envision to make it more competitive.
Ahead of the July 6 start for higher import tariffs, GM shipped in a six-month supply of Envisions at the much lower 2.5 percent tariff rate.
Envision sales from April through June plunged to just 7,000 vehicles, while inventories climbed to more than 13,000 vehicles at the end of June. At the current sales rate, the Envision supply should be enough to keep many dealers stocked through the end of the year.
GM had lowered prices by as much as $2,500 on the 2019 models, which it started shipping in late April. That means Buick's 2,000 U.S. dealers should have lower-priced Envisions to sell well into the fall.
""The previous price point was too high"" on the 2018 Envision, said Casey Clark, sales manager at Serra Buick GMC Cadillac in Washington, Michigan, in an interview. ""That put off some customers.""
With help from GM, Casey said, the mid-Michigan dealership has been able to offer hefty discounts on Envision of $5,000 and more.
GM has announced no plans to stop U.S. sales of the Envision or to relocate production of U.S.-bound models to another plant outside China, a source familiar with the company's strategy said on condition of anonymity.
GM has provided Buick dealers with incentives to keep Envisions in stock. These include financial offers to put Envisions into fleets of vehicles loaned to customers whose cars are being repaired, the source said. 

This year, GM plans to cut Envision imports to around 35,000 vehicles, more than half of which will be hit with the higher tariff, the source said.

309,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Kuroda's Deputy Makes Clear BOJ Won't Accept Race to Yield Limit,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors got more of a feel for the new reality of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy Thursday after the central bank stepped into the market to curb a surge in yields to an 18-month high and one of its deputy governors repeatedly warned that sharp yield movements would be addressed quickly and appropriately.
The central bank announced in the afternoon an unscheduled purchasing operation of 400 billion yen ($3.6 billion) of five-to-10 year bonds to kill the momentum of a selloff that saw the benchmark 10-year yield touch an 18-month high of 0.145 percent earlier in the day.
The surprise operation pushed down the yield to a session low of 0.115 percent, underscoring the bank’s determination to keep control of movements in the market after widening its range around a zero target on Tuesday.
“If yields rise rapidly, the bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately,” Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya told reporters in Kyoto.
Central bank watchers and investors are trying to figure out just how firm the BOJ’s new margin around the yield target is and how quickly they can test its outer limit, given that some of the central bank’s targets, such as its 2 percent inflation goal, appear firm, while others, such as its promise to buy bonds at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen a year, appear extremely loose.
Amamiya suggested that some board members had envisioned other ranges around the zero percent target other than the plus or minus 0.2 percent set out by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at his press conference on Tuesday.
“Between the board members there were nuanced differences in their views on how much the yield could go up or down,” Amamiya said. “Still, the common understanding was reached that we should double the movement range.”
Now the board had made its decision, the bank would stick with it for the time being, he suggested, saying that the range couldn’t just be changed by the bank’s operational staff.
Amamiya’s comments on exchange-traded funds suggested the bank’s buying target for ETFs was less firm. He said he couldn’t say whether the actual purchase amount for ETFs would rise or fall from 6 trillion yen a year: it depended on market movements.
That has some echoes with the bank’s JGB purchase target. The bank is now buying at a pace around half the 80 trillion yen goal, an outcome that has been dubbed stealth tapering.
The purpose of ETF purchasing is to lower risk premium, not anything else such as influencing the yield curve, he said, noting that the 6 trillion yen target was unchanged. The bank wouldn’t take a rigid approach to buying and would watch market movements, he said.
“As a result our purchasing amounts may change -- that’s what we clarified,” he said."
310,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Trump Cap on U.S. Auto Fuel Economy May Raise Prices at the Pump,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s proposal to ease U.S. fuel economy standards after 2020 may slow an expected decline in gasoline demand, resulting in higher prices at the pump.
The Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly proposed on Thursday to cap fuel economy requirements at a fleet average of 37 miles per gallon starting in 2020. Under the Obama plan, the fleet-wide fuel economy would have risen gradually to roughly 47 mpg by 2025. The change would mean a 2 percent to 3 percent increase in daily fuel consumption.
“In, say, five or 10 years, there could be some impact to gas prices,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. “This decision would put upward pressure on prices, rather than downward.""
The projected increase of about 500,000 barrels a day in fuel demand comes as U.S. consumption is holding near record levels. The Energy Information Administration forecast in its latest Annual Energy Outlook that demand would begin to decline after this year, shrinking more than 2.5 million barrels a day by 2040.
“Longer-term, what this means, is that gasoline demand in the U.S. won’t decline as quickly,” said Katie Bays, an analyst at Height Securities LLC. “There is less incentive for car makers to try to push plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles, which obviously have higher fuel economy ratings.”
The average price of U.S. retail regular gasoline is about $2.87 a gallon, near a three-year high reached in May, according to data from the American Automobile Association. The four-week average gasoline demand has remained above 9 million barrels a day since February.
The plan “should be bullish for gasoline prices,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management LLC in St. Louis. “Before, you had a double whammy. You had flat driving activity and falling miles per gallon. That fear of every year that goes by, cars become increasingly efficient, goes away.”
A 60-day comment period will begin once the proposal is published in the Federal Register, and a final rule could be finalized by the end of 2018 or early next year.
So how much will consumers be affected when they go to fill up their tanks?
“Does it lift prices relative to where they would have been if CAFE standards remained really stringent? Probably,” Bays said. “But, does it necessarily cause gasoline prices to rise from where they are today? Maybe not.”"
311,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Carney Keeps BOE Rate Hikes on Agenda in Face of Brexit Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Carney won’t rule out raising interest rates again before he leaves the Bank of England next June, though he acknowledges that Brexit could change everything.
After the BOE lifted its key rate on Thursday, some businesses and economists blasted policy makers for being too hasty in acting before Britain knows what deal -- if any -- it can strike with the European Union. Carney’s message as governor is that there’s no reason to deviate from gradual tightening.
“The important thing is that this is the right decision for the economy given the track that it’s on,” he told Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua in an interview. “Certainly there could be circumstances where it would make sense to adjust policy. But I think we’ll all know what those circumstances are on the Monetary Policy Committee, and at that point we’ll take them into account.”
The BOE has opted to work on the assumption that Brexit will be smooth, which means the U.K.’s economic expansion will continue and tight labor markets and limited spare capacity will put upward pressure on prices.
On that basis, policy makers lifted rates for only the second time since the global financial crisis, to 0.75 percent, and Carney said he expects a few more hikes over the next few years. His term finishes at the end of June 2019, three months after the U.K. is set to formally leaves the EU.
“There’s a good chance they’ll go once more before Carney’s term ends,” said Hetal Mehta, an economist at Legal & General Investment Management. “There’s a decent chance they’ll try and do one hike in May on the basis there’s a transition period that kicks in following the official Brexit date in March. They’d probably try to normalize policy if they can.”
At the same time, the BOE has acknowledged and prepared contingency plans for the risk that Brexit is disorderly. With EU and U.K. officials still unable to resolve key issues, that’s a a real possibility, which might mean that Carney has already seen his final rate hike.
“There’s a pretty good chance it’ll be his last,” said Andrew Goodwin, an economist at Oxford Economics. “The story they’re telling about driving up wages and inflation hasn’t borne out so far and it won’t in the next year either. It’ll be difficult to justify hiking.”
If so, this could be the last rate increase Carney pushes through in any role. The former Bank of Canada head hasn’t said whether he’ll remain in central banking after he leaves the BOE and has remained coy when asked about his future, deflecting questions about whether he will definitely return to his native country.
He also shows no sign of wanting to stay any longer in his current role. He’s already extended his planned five-year term by 12 months to help guide the economy through the Brexit negotiations. Asked if he’d do so again, he said talks have to conclude well before his term is up and “nothing’s changed” about his plans.
In an unexpected sign of how united the nine-member policy committee is around the need for higher rates at this time, Thursday’s decision to raise was unanimous. But that doesn’t mean that the MPC’s current view won’t be reshaped by new developments.
“There’s a possibility for one more move before he leaves the scene, but it’s not by any means a done deal,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). “The likelihood is the bank will revisit in May, once the Brexit deadline has passed -- and assuming the economy hasn’t fallen off a cliff.”"
312,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Sanctions on Turkish Officials Are a Necessary Risk,"(The Bloomberg View) -- The decision by the U.S. to level sanctions on Turkey’s interior and justice ministers is the latest blow in relations with an important but troublesome ally. There’s a risk in escalating the dispute, but the measure is justified.
The Trump administration says the action is a targeted punishment for Turkey’s continuing detention of a U.S. pastor, who has worked in the country for many years, on suspicion of supporting groups hostile to the government. The U.S. says the charges are baseless. President Trump had demanded the pastor’s release, threatening sanctions otherwise.
In the background, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds the U.S. partly responsible for the foiled 2016 coup against his regime. He’s angry that Washington won’t deport the cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former political ally who now lives in exile in Pennsylvania. The tension worsened last year when Turkish citizens working for the U.S. consulate in Istanbul were arrested, and Erdogan’s security team assaulted peaceful protesters while he visited Washington. Turkey has also imprisoned a Turkish-American scientist who works for NASA.
Stepping up the conflict with sanctions is admittedly a gamble. Turkey is a longtime NATO ally. It borders Iraq and Syria, where U.S. forces have been engaged, and Iran, led by one of the world’s most dangerous regimes. Turkey might be driven further into the arms of Russia’s Vladimir Putin, who has struck up an unlikely friendship with the Turkish leader. Russia is selling Ankara advanced S-400 anti-missile systems — weapons not compatible with NATO hardware — and will help build Turkey’s first nuclear power plant and a gas pipeline through Turkish territory.
In the quarrel over the pastor, the U.S. tried diplomacy first. Getting nowhere, it threatened sanctions — and, having done so, was left with little choice but to apply them. Backing down would have rewarded Erdogan’s obstinacy.
Repairing the relationship won’t be easy, and it’s Erdogan who needs to change. He’s chosen a disturbing and dangerous course, acquiring vast new powers after the recent elections and stomping on the rule of law by purging judges and civil servants and jailing journalists. He is waging war on U.S.-supported anti-regime rebels in Syria and collaborating with Iran and Russia in efforts to keep the murderous dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. He reportedly imprisoned more than 30 citizens of other Western countries following the coup attempt.
Erdogan’s choices aren’t doing much for his country. The lira has reached a record low, the stock market has plunged by 35 percent this year, external debt has soared, inflation is high, foreign investment is drying up, and wealthy Turks are fleeing.
The faltering economy gives the U.S. and its allies some long-term leverage. And Turkey is unlikely to quit NATO. To be sure, that would be a huge blow to the alliance — but a far bigger one to Turkey’s national security.
The narrow sanctions just imposed are the right approach for now. The Senate should also further proceed with legislation to block a planned sale of advanced F-35 fighters if Turkey goes ahead with its purchase of the Russian air-defense system. Erdogan needs to be told there’s a price to pay for the course he’s on.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 12:52PM ET</span>",Author delves into U.S. Social Security's origins to debunk myths,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Social Security is unaffordable due to our aging population. 
Social Security is a driver of our national debt.
Social Security is built on a house of cards - its assets are just IOUs. 
No doubt you have heard some or all of these statements from politicians and pundits debating how to ""fix"" our most important retirement program. The combined trust funds for the retirement and disability programs will be depleted in 2034, a problem that would require a draconian 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut if left unaddressed. (https://reut.rs/2K8VASy)
But Nancy Altman argues that these claims are not just wrong, but part of a purposeful campaign to undermine and dismantle Social Security that has been under way since the program's creation in the 1930s.
Altman makes her case in a provocative new book, ""The Truth About Social Security: The Founders' Words Refute Revisionist History, Zombie Lies, and Common Misunderstandings"" (Strong Arm Press).
Altman is a well-known progressive advocate for defending and expanding Social Security. She also is an expert on the program's history, having served as a staff member of the bipartisan 1983 commission that developed the most recent set of important reforms to Social Security. Altman also serves on the Social Security Advisory Board, an independent, bipartisan agency that advises the White House, Congress and Social Security Administration. 
Her new book debunks a number of prevalent myths about Social Security, relying on the historical record left by President Franklin Roosevelt and the other founders of the program. 
Below is an edited version of my recent interview with Altman, where I asked her to discuss some common misperceptions about Social Security’s origins. For a more detailed version, please see: (https:// Q: Why is it so important to pay attention to the vision of the founders of Social Security? As you note, the program has always evolved and changed over time. A: Opponents of Social Security mischaracterize the founders’ vision and then use the mischaracterization as a shield against improvements which the founders, I believe, would have applauded. In response to proposals to expand benefits, for example, opponents argue that the founders never intended Social Security to be more than a foundation on which to build.  So, it is important to set the record straight.  Q: You’re referring to the often-heard comment that Social Security is part of a “three-legged stool” of retirement security. Not true? A.  It is historically inaccurate. The metaphor of a three-legged stool was first used in 1949 by an insurance executive whose company sold supplemental annuities. There is no evidence whatsoever that Roosevelt and his colleagues intentionally designed Social Security simply to be part of what is needed in retirement. In fact, there is substantial legislative history that the exact opposite was true. Q: What is the role of Social Security in the federal government’s debt problems? A: Social Security does not and, by law, cannot add even a penny to the federal deficit. It can only pay benefits if it has sufficient revenue not only to cover all benefit costs but also the administrative costs associated with the payment of those benefits. And it has no borrowing authority to make up any shortfall. The federal government issues Treasury bonds to finance its own debt, and  some of those bonds are purchased by Social Security. Though Treasuries held in reserve by Social Security are sometimes derisively called “IOUs,” they are not casual promises. They are legal arrangements, which have the same legal status as bonds bought by you, me, a foreign government, or any other person or entity that invests in U.S. Treasuries. Q: We hear often that Social Security is becoming unaffordable because our population is aging so fast. You argue this is incorrect. Why? A: People are living somewhat longer, on average. It is not the cause of our aging population, however. Rather, it is due to the decline in our fertility rates, and a resulting shift in the ratio of beneficiaries to workers. Social Security is extremely affordable - at the end of the 21st century, Social Security will cost, as a percentage of GDP, around what it costs today. That assumes that life expectancies continue to improve. Q: Why should Social Security not be means-tested? After all, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates don’t need their Social Security benefits, right? A: Social Security is a benefit that is earned; it is not based on need. No one would argue that Buffett or Gates should not collect on their fire insurance, if their home burned down, just because they didn’t “need” the proceeds. The same is true with Social Security. No one has to claim their Social Security benefits; but everyone should know that they have earned them. Q: What should be done to fix Social Security’s financial problems, and should we be doing something beyond that? A. The only problem that I believe Social Security has is that its benefits are too low. They should be increased. Expanding Social Security and restoring it to balance by requiring the wealthiest to pay their fair share is a solution to a number of challenges. In addition to addressing our looming retirement income crisis, it would slow our rising income and wealth inequality and the decline of our middle class.

""While higher interest rates and tax reform should weigh on residential investment, the rate of homebuilding still looks somewhat low relative to demographic trends,"" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research note.

Taking these factors into consideration, they projected residential investment to increase about 1 to 2 percent annually over the next few years.

Senior administration officials told reporters Wednesday that Trump asked the US Trade Representative to explore the possibility of imposing a 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to the US. The original proposal proposed hitting the same amount of goods with a 10% tariff.
""This week, the President has directed that I consider increasing the proposed level of the additional duty from 10 percent to 25%,"" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement. ""The 25% duty would be applied to the proposed list of products previously announced on July 10. ""
The tariffs could not go into effect until September, the officials said, and no final decision had been made on whether to impose the tariffs. The public has until September 5 to comment on the proposal.
In his statement, Lighthizer said the option for higher tariffs on the Chinese goods was designed to pressure Beijing into economic reforms, such as curtailing the theft of US intellectual property by Chinese firms.
""The increase in the possible rate of the additional duty is intended to provide the Administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behavior and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets and prosperity for all of our citizens,"" Lighthizer said.
The tariff increase would represent another major escalation of the trade war between the US and China, which has seen roughly $74 billion worth of trade between the two countries get hit with tariffs.
The proposed increase drew criticism from industry groups like the National Retail Federation, which said the move would ultimately hurt US consumers.
""Increasing the size of the tariffs is merely increasing the harm that will be done. And it’s even more than that — it’s two-and-a-half times the amount originally proposed,"" Matthew Shay, the NRF's CEO, said in a statement. ""Tariffs are an unacceptable gamble with the U.S. economy and the stakes continue to rise with no end in sight.""
This  next wave of tariffs was originally announced in July, after China hit the US with countermeasures in response to Trump's initial wave of tariffs. If tariffs on another $200 billion worth of goods proceeds, about half of all Chinese goods coming into the US would be subject to trade restrictions.
The Trump administration  released a preliminary list of goods that could be subject to this wave of tariffs. The products range from agricultural products like pork and apples to consumer goods like wool hats and vacuum cleaners.
The Chinese government has warned that the country will retaliate with trade restrictions of equal measure if Trump follows through on the threat.
Read more:  Trump's trade war is getting serious — here's why it started, what it means for the US economy, and how it could hit you
The fight over trade kicked off in March when Trump threatened to hit $50 billion worth of Chinese imports with a 25% tariff. Attempts at avoiding the tariffs fell apart in May and the countries officially imposed tariffs in early July.
Trump's trade fights, including the battle with China, are  starting to seep into the US economy based on recent data. Concerns about the trade war are popping up in various business and  consumer confidence surveys,  prices for goods hit by various tariffs are on the rise, and businesses are  starting to feel the squeeze from the increased prices."
317,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>","Brexit Doesn't Automatically Mean Rate Cuts, Carney Says","(Bloomberg) -- Brexit doesn’t necessarily mean that interest rates will need to be cut, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.
In response to a question as to why the bank was raising interest rates while there’s still so much uncertainty, Carney said that officials “can’t be handicapped or tied by the range of Brexit possibilities.”
Policy makers voted unanimously to raise the benchmark rate to 0.75 percent on Thursday, defying critics who said in the run-up to the vote that doing so might prove to be a mistake or need to be reversed in the near future. But Carney said that’s too simplistic a view: “It’s not as simple as saying Brexit equals a reduction in interest rates,” he told reporters during a press conference after the decision.
Britain is set to leave the European Union in March 2019, and options ranging from the U.K. retaining some access to the single market to trading under World Trade Organization rules are still on the table -- and it’s still not clear whether there will be a smooth transition to any new arrangement.
Yet given that the bank estimates the economy is growing fast enough at the moment to keep inflation above target, it couldn’t afford to delay tightening, Carney said.
Higher Certainty
“The mistake is to always wait wait wait until you have perfect certainty,” Carney said Thursday. “You don’t know when that higher degree of certainty is going to transpire.”
Carney laid out potential monetary policy reactions to various Brexit outcomes in a speech in May, saying that if there was a disorderly transition, the MPC would probably have to manage another “trade-off” between growth and inflation, as it did after the referendum. Back then, it cut interest rates and restarted QE.
“If there is a major shift as a consequence of the Brexit negotiations that is disinflationary, or creates a very extreme trade-off, such as the one we saw post referendum, then that could have consequences for monetary policy,” he said Thursday.
Bloomberg economists Jamie Murray and Dan Hanson say that if a disorderly Brexit does take place, it’s likely to be accompanied by “ample liquidity and some emergency stimulus.” While any new tariffs would have an inflationary impact, policy makers would have to focus more on supporting a heavily disrupted economy."
318,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 07:47AM ET</span>","Is meaningful, part-time work in retirement a myth?","By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO - As Pamela Pommer entered her 60s, she planned to work part-time helping aging people deal with financial troubles. But like many baby boomers she realized that a ""meaningful"" position is much harder to find than she had imagined.
About a year ago, Pommer was laid off from a human resources job at a for-profit college in suburban Minneapolis. 
""I had read the book: 'Do What You Love and the Money Will Follow,'"" said Pommer, 64. ""I devoured it. But it turned out to be elusive.""
Numerous studies suggest Pommer's experience is not unusual. Only 11 percent of people aged 61 to 66 found part-time jobs as they transitioned into retirement, according to a 2017 study by the U.S. General Accountability Office.
The research, commissioned by the U.S. Senate's Special Committee on Aging, found that even though baby boomers, unlike earlier generations, want to work part-time before entering full retirement, few employers' policies allow it - essentially the same as 10 years ago.
Companies are reluctant to hire older workers because of legal and operational issues, the study found, citing high health insurance costs and fear of discrimination lawsuits if younger employees are not given the same flexibility. Managers also complain about tracking time on the job, accounting for merit increases, bonuses and juggling schedules, the GAO said.
That does not mean you should give up on a meaningful career move or a part-time job in retirement. Just know that many potential employers may not be there with open arms. 
Here is advice from experts and people who have taken the leap.

Although most organizations are not set up to give people in their 60s flexibility, companies are starting to rethink policies because millennials also want the freedom to work on less rigid schedules, said David DeLong, founder of Smart Workforce Strategies, a consultancy in Concord, Massachusetts.
Long before asking for flexibility, ""have a heart-to-heart with your boss to make sure you are a valued employee,"" said DeLong.
Make sure your job can work on flex-time. Northeast Bank in Minneapolis tried to accommodate a valued branch manager and commercial lender who wanted to semi-retire, but it did not work out, Human Resources Director Sue Johnson LaGue said.
With time away from the office, deals were not getting done quickly enough. The bank ended the arrangement, but continues to offer part-time work to retired tellers and receptionists.
""We love our baby boomers,"" said LaGue. ""They have a ton of experience, need no training and are dedicated and dependable.""
THINK TEMPORARY
Encore careers are often short-term. You may do best by consulting and moving from gig to gig rather than trying to settle into one position.
Matt Budd, founder of Financial Executives Consulting Group in Darien, Connecticut, advised accepting a less-than-ideal job and then seeking a better one from a position of strength. ""Get a title and a business card,"" he said.
JUST DO IT 
Starting an encore business may be easier than finding a willing part-time employer, but start-up costs and attracting new customers can be overwhelming.
When Russ Ferance lost his computer hardware and software sales job in northern Michigan at 65, he could not get rehired at companies which were looking for young salesmen. 
Ferance obtained the necessary certification to sell Medicare-related health insurance. Now the 73-year-old moves between the warm weather of Sarasota, Florida, and his northern Michigan home. It was not easy starting fresh, but the independence is invaluable, he said.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>","China urges U.S. to 'calm down' in trade dispute, says its tactics will not work","By Christian Shepherd and Ben Blanchard
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday urged the United States to ""calm down"" and return to reason after the Trump administration sought to ratchet up pressure for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump directed the increase from a previously proposed 10 percent duty because China has refused to meet U.S. demands and has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.
Trump's threats of higher tariffs weighed on China's financial markets. But Wang Yi, the Chinese government's top diplomat, said U.S. efforts to pressure China would be in vain, urging its trade policymakers to ""calm down"". 
""We hope that those directly involved in the United States' trade policies can calm down, carefully listen to the voices of U.S. consumers...and hear the collective call of the international community,"" Wang, a member of the country's state council, or cabinet, said in Singapore. 
""The United States' method of adding pressure will not, I'm afraid, have any effect,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of a regional forum.
Worsening trade tension between the two countries would not affect China's stance on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, Wang said. ""We deal with diplomatic matters on the basis of principle, not by engaging in trade.""
The Chinese yuan also ticked lower against the dollar, extending its year-to-date decline to more than 4.5 percent.
There have been no formal talks between Washington and Beijing for weeks over Trump's demands that China make fundamental changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers and subsidies for high technology industries.
DISCUSSIONS FOR ""FRUITFUL"" TALKS
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated at a regular news briefing in Beijing that the United States' efforts at ""blackmail"" would fail.
""We would advise the United States to correct its attitude and not try to engage in blackmail. This won't work on China,"" Geng said.
""Secondly, we would advise the U.S. side to return to reason, and not blindly let emotions affect their decisions, because in the end this will harm themselves,"" Geng said.
Two Trump administration officials told reporters on a conference call that Trump remains open to communications with Beijing and that through informal conversations the two countries are discussing whether a ""fruitful negotiation"" is possible.
The higher tariff rate, if adopted, would apply to a list of goods valued at $200 billion identified by the USTR last month as a response to China's retaliatory tariffs on an initial round of U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese electronic components, machinery, autos and industrial goods.
China's commerce ministry said the U.S. tactics would have no effect on China, and would disappoint countries that are against trade wars.
""China is fully prepared for the United States' threats to escalate the two countries' trade war and will have to fight back to defend its dignity and the interests of its people,"" it said in a statement posted on its website. 
Trump has ultimately threatened tariffs on more than $500 billion in Chinese goods, covering virtually all U.S. imports from China.
The USTR said it will extend a public comment period for the $200 billion list to Sept. 5 from Aug. 30 due to the possible tariff rate rise.

The list, unveiled on July 10, hits American consumers harder than previous rounds, with targeted goods ranging from Chinese tilapia fish and dog food to furniture, lighting products, printed circuit boards and building materials.

1. Global Markets Slide On Fresh Trade Worries
Global stocks were on the backfoot, as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ratchet up pressure on China for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday Trump directed the increase from a previously proposed 10% duty because China has refused to meet U.S. demands and has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.
China responded by saying that ""blackmail"" would not work and that it would hit back if the U.S. takes further steps hindering trade, including applying the higher tariff rate.
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check as investors fret over the impact of tariffs on the global economy.
Asian stocks tumbled, with markets in China leading losses. The Shanghai Composite declined 2% and the Shenzhen Composite fell 2.2%, while the yuan sank to a 13-month low against the dollar.
European stocks were similarly affected, as all of the region's major bourses slid lower, with nearly every sector in the red.
Among national indexes, Germany's export-heavy DAX took the brunt of investors' anxieties over trade, dropping by as much as 1.7%, as heavyweights  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) tumbled.
The negative sentiment looked set to carry over to Wall Street.
The blue-chip Dow futures were down 120 points, or around 0.5%, at 5:15AM ET, the S&P 500 futures shed 13 points, or around 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 40 points, or roughly 0.6%.
2. Dollar Stands Tall After Upbeat Fed
The U.S. dollar stood tall against a basket of its peers, after the Federal Reserve gave an upbeat assessment of the world's biggest economy and stayed on course to gradually lift interest rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.3% to 94.75, its best level since July 20.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged as widely expected at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday, and said U.S. economic growth has been rising strongly and the job market has continued to strengthen.
The U.S. central bank's upbeat assessment kept it on track to lift borrowing costs at its next meeting in September.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve, as investors worried about a further escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
The benchmark 10-year yield ticked down to around 2.99%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note slipped to 2.67%.
On the data front, the weekly report on initial jobless claims will be main event.
3. CBS Results Highlight Another Busy Earnings Day
48 members of the S&P 500 will report earnings, with results from CBS (NYSE:CBS) after the bell probably the most anticipated among investors.
CBS CEO Les Moonves remains under intense scrutiny after reports last week that he sexually harassed six employees in incidents dating back to the 1980s.
Fox Business’ Charlie Gasparino tweeted earlier this week that Moonves will be on the company’s earnings call and ready to answer questions.



Other members of the S&P 500 set to report earnings on Thursday include DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP), Teva Pharma (NYSE:TEVA), Wayfair (NYSE:W), Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN), MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), Aetna (NYSE:AET), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), Cigna (NYSE:CI) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), all due ahead of the opening bell.
After the bell, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI),  Take-Two Interactive  (NASDAQ:TTWO), and AIG (NYSE:AIG) are on the docket.
4. Tesla Shines In Pre-Market
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares surged in pre-market trading, as its chief executive, Elon Musk, appeared to restore investor confidence with an apologetic and restrained performance on the company's post-earnings conference call.
The outspoken Musk, who told analysts last quarter that he refused to answer their ""boring"" questions, apologized multiple times last night for his past behavior and sounded upbeat on the company's future.
Musk said on the call that he expected the company to be henceforth profitable and cash flow positive, excluding some debt repayment, and had no plans for an equity raise.
The electric automaker reported $4 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating Wall Street estimates of $3.92 billion. Despite the revenue beat, the company posted a larger-than-expected earnings per share loss of $3.06 for the quarter.
The company also said that it expects production of its Model 3 - Tesla's lowest-priced model and the key to its plans to become a mass-market automaker - to reach between 50,000 and 55,000 units in its third quarter.
Tesla shares were up 8.1% to $325.20, putting it on track to retake the title of most valuable U.S. automaker from General Motors (NYSE:GM).
5. Bank of England Rate Announcement
The Bank of England looks set to raise interest rates to their highest level since the global financial crisis almost a decade ago, despite a weakening outlook for the UK economy and deepening uncertainty over Brexit.
If all goes as scripted, the British central bank will nudge rates up to 0.75%, going beyond last November's increase back up to 0.5%.
A decision is due at 1100GMT (7:00AM ET). Governor Mark Carney will hold a news conference to discuss at 1130 GMT.
With expectations of a rate hike almost entirely priced into the market, investors are mostly focused on what message the Monetary Policy Committee sends about its intentions for further increases in borrowing costs.
Economists mostly expect a 7-2 vote by the MPC in favor of a rate hike on Thursday. A bigger or smaller majority for an increase could be seen as a sign that the committee is more or less likely to move again soon on rates.
Similarly, the BoE's new inflation forecasts will be watched as a sign of whether it thinks investors are being too relaxed by betting on no follow-up rate hike until late 2019 and only one more almost at the end of its three-year forecast period.
The pound sat near a two-week low ahead of the BoE's monetary policy decision, with GBP/USD at 1.3075.

Stakes in listed companies' will have a weighting of 250 percent when banks calculate risk-weighted assets, while stakes in unlisted companies will carry a weighting of 400 percent, the sources said, citing an internal notice of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. 
The regulator did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Compared with previous regulations that have banks' risk weightings at 1,250 percent for equity investments in commercial entities and at 400 percent for policy-directed equity stakes, the new rules reduce capital required for lenders to conduct debt-for-equity swaps.

FAO,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices fell 3.7 percent in July from the month before, the sharpest monthly drop since last December, with declines seen across all crop types, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 168.8 points last month, against an upwardly revised 175.3 in June.
The June figure was previously given as 173.7.
""The decline in July was driven by weaker export quotations for wheat, maize and rice,"" FAO said.
""International wheat prices were generally weaker during the first half of the month, but concerns over production prospects in the EU and the Russian Federation started to push export values higher towards the end of the month,"" it added.
The sharpest individual falls were registered in the dairy price index and the sugar price index.
FAO did not provide any new forecast for cereal output in 2018. The next new forecast will come on Sept. 6.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Myanmar scales back Chinese-backed port project due to debt fears - official,"By Kanupriya Kapoor and Aye Min Thant
NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar has scaled back plans for a Chinese-backed port on its western coast, sharply reducing the cost of the project after concerns it could leave the Southeast Asian nation heavily indebted, a top government official and an advisor told Reuters.
The initial $7.3 billion price tag on the Kyauk Pyu deepwater port, on the western tip of Myanmar's conflict-torn Rakhine state, set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled Chinese-backed projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the official and the advisor said.
Deputy Finance Minister Set Aung, who was appointed to lead project negotiations in May, told Reuters the ""project size has been tremendously scaled down"".
The revised cost would be ""around $1.3 billion, something that's much more plausible for Myanmar's use"", said Sean Turnell, economic advisor to Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.
China's state-run CITIC Group [CITIC.UL], the main developer of the project, said negotiations were ongoing and that the $1.3 billion was to be spent on the ""initial phase"" of the port, adding the project was divided into four phases. It did not elaborate on plans for subsequent stages.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Monday that ""according to what I understand, at present both sides are having commercial negotiations"" on the Kyauk Pyu project.
""The talks are progressing,"" Geng said at a foreign ministry briefing in Beijing. He referred further questions to the companies involved.
The original plan was to develop around 10 berths at the 25-metre deep sea port to accommodate bigger oil tankers, but the size will now be revised to only two berths, Set Aung said in an interview.
He declined to elaborate on other specifications, citing ongoing technical discussions.
The Kyauk Pyu port is a key part of China's ambitious Belt and Road initiative, aimed at expanding trade links across the world. While Beijing says Belt and Road is mutually beneficial for it and its partners, questions have been raised about countries taking on excessive debt to build projects.
In Myanmar, the government faces a delicate balancing act in renegotiating the project with China, analysts say.
The country is increasingly reliant on diplomatic support from Beijing as it faces Western criticism over its treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine state, and needs Beijing's help to end ethnic conflicts on its borders. But many in Myanmar are also wary of becoming too dependent on China.
""There is a strong current of opinion that is nervous about becoming overreliant on China,"" said Richard Horsey, a former U.N. diplomat and a Yangon-based political analyst. ""That debate is playing out within the government.""
DEBT FEARS
Beijing has pushed for strategic opportunities in Myanmar, including preferential access to the Kyauk Pyu port, after being driven to all but abandon a hydroelectric project in the country amid widespread local opposition last year.
Kyauk Pyu is an entry point for a 770-kilometre (480-mile) pipeline delivering oil and natural gas to China's Yunnan province. That gives China an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East that avoids the strategic chokepoint of the Malacca Strait.
Under the original plan, Kyauk Pyu would have had a container capacity to rival that of ports such as Manila or Valencia in Spain.
Construction on the port, and an accompanying special economic zone, which together were supposed to cost up to $10 billion, was expected to start in 2018. A 4,200-acre industrial park worth $2.3 billion was planned to attract textile and oil refining industries.
But Myanmar officials said the experience of Sri Lanka, where this year the government signed over to China the lease on a strategic port to pay off Chinese-backed loans used to finance it, had raised concerns the country could be walking into a debt trap.
The new deal ""reduces the financial risk dramatically"" and shows that ""concerns about indebtedness and sovereignty have been and can be addressed"", said Turnell, an Australian economist. ""This really could become a constructive model for countries that don't have much leverage over a giant like China.""
Set Aung, the deputy finance minister, said Myanmar would give no sovereign guarantees for any loans financing the project.
He added that the project's timeline was likely to be delayed several months as Myanmar was looking to hire an international consulting firm to review costs.
""The new deal ensures that any loans financing this project will not lead back to the Myanmar government but rather they will all be private,"" he said. ""At the moment, my priority is to ensure there is no debt burden for the Myanmar government and these concerns are now quite limited.""
CITIC said the two sides had not discussed hiring a third party company to audit the project.
""START SMALL""
Myanmar government officials said their Chinese counterparts had been ""amenable"" to renegotiating and had agreed in principle to the new deal, but had yet to sign off.
CITIC won a tender in 2015 to develop the project from the previous military-backed government. Set Aung, the deputy finance minister, said disagreements emerged over terms and conditions after the initial tender had been awarded.
""The previous government wanted to go big, whereas we want to start small and expand only if there is demand for it,"" he said.
When asked about the accompanying special economic zone, both Turnell and Set Aung said any expansion plans would depend on the port's viability.
""Each stage has to demonstrate feasibility before the next phase can be rolled out,"" Turnell said.

China has warned the United States it would hit back if the Trump administration takes further steps hindering trade as Washington considers slapping a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
The proposal would increase the potential tariff rate from 10 percent the U.S. administration had initially put forward on July 10 for that wave of duties in a bid to pressure Beijing into making trade concessions, a source familiar with the plan said on Tuesday.
The U.S. tariffs target thousands of Chinese imports, including food products, chemicals, steel and aluminum and consumer goods ranging from dog food, furniture and carpets to car tires, bicycles, and baseball gloves and beauty products.
The DIHK said a survey among its members doing business in China showed that 41 percent were already affected by the higher tariffs when exporting to the United States while 46 percent reported higher costs when importing from the United States.
Among the German companies doing business in the United States, 57 percent said they already faced negative effects when exporting to China while 75 percent reported disadvantages such as higher costs when importing from China.
""The dangerous trade dispute between the U.S. and China is also hitting German companies doing business in the two countries,"" said Volker Treier, foreign trade chief at the DIHK.
""The impact is huge: nearly half of the imports from German companies are directly or indirectly affected by the new tariffs, for example because they source raw materials or components from the other country,"" Treier said.
To avoid the higher costs caused by the tit-for-tat tariffs, many German firms doing business in the United States are considering the closure of production sites and relocation to other countries, the DIHK said.
The DIHK survey showed that German companies producing at home were also hit by the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict due to their international network of suppliers and broad customer relationships around the globe.
""A further escalation of the dispute would be a threat to world trade as a whole,"" Treier said.
The United States is Germany's biggest single export destination while China is the most important business partner in overall trade volumes for German companies.
German companies have invested 400 billion euros ($466.60 billion) in the United States and 80 billion euros in China. They employ more than 850,000 people in the United States and some 700,000 in China, according to DIHK.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 02:01AM ET</span>",Trump administration adds to China trade pressure with higher tariff plan,"By David Lawder and Ben Blanchard
WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ratchet up pressure on China for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, his administration said on Wednesday. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump directed the increase from a previously proposed 10 percent duty because China has refused to meet U.S. demands and has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. 
""The increase in the possible rate of the additional duty is intended to provide the administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behavior and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets and prosperity for all of our citizens,"" Lighthizer said in a statement.
There have been no formal talks between Washington and Beijing for weeks over Trump's demands that China make fundamental changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers and subsidies for high technology industries.
Two trump administration officials told reporters on a conference call that Trump remains open to communications with Beijing and that through informal conversations the two countries are discussing whether a ""fruitful negotiation"" is possible.""We don't have anything to announce today about a specific event, or a specific round of discussions, but communication remains open and we are trying to figure out whether the conditions present themselves for a specific engagement between the two sides,"" one of the officials said.
Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said a 25 percent tariff rate is more likely to shut out Chinese products and shift American supply chains to other countries, as a 10 percent duty could be offset by government subsidies and weakness in China's yuan currency. 
""If we're going to use tariffs, this gives us more flexibility and it's a more meaningful threat,"" he said, adding that Trump's pressure strategy will not work if he does not resolve trade disputes with U.S. allies such as the European Union, Mexico and Canada. 
But the move drew swift condemnation from U.S. business lobby groups worried that tit-for-tat tariffs would start to hamper economic growth.
""Escalating tariffs against China is the wrong approach to address legitimate concerns U.S. businesses have with China’s harmful practices,"" said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
""Each tariff escalation leads to further retaliatory action from China – ultimately inflicting even more harm on American businesses, workers, farmers, ranchers, and consumers.""
PUBLIC COMMENTS EXTENDED
The higher tariff rate, if implemented, would apply to a list of goods valued at $200 billion identified by the USTR last month as a response to China's retaliatory tariffs on an initial round of U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese electronic components, machinery, autos and industrial goods.
Trump has ultimately threatened tariffs on over $500 billion in Chinese goods, covering virtually all U.S. imports from China.
The USTR said it will extend a public comment period for the $200 billion list to Sept. 5 from Aug. 30 due to the possible tariff rate rise. The list, unveiled on July 10, hits American consumers harder than previous rounds, with targeted goods ranging from Chinese tilapia fish and dog food to furniture, lighting products, printed circuit boards and building materials. 
China said on Wednesday that ""blackmail"" would not work and that it would hit back if the United States takes further steps hindering trade, including applying the higher tariff rate.
""U.S. pressure and blackmail won't have an effect. If the United States takes further escalatory steps, China will inevitably take countermeasures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing.
Investors fear an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing could hit global economic growth, and prominent U.S. business groups, while weary of what they see as China's mercantilist trade practices, have condemned Trump's aggressive tariffs.
SENATORS SEEK TARIFF LIMITS 
Trump also got more pushback on his tariff plans from the U.S. Congress on Wednesday as a bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, launched new legislation that would scale back the president's power to impose tariffs for national security reasons under a Cold War-era trade law.
The proposal would require a more robust justification from the Department of Defense for ""Section 232"" tariffs such as those imposed on steel and aluminum imports and those now under consideration for autos. It would also give Congress more oversight of the process.

The move signals displeasure among Trump's own party over his protectionist actions, but chances of it becoming law are slim as Congress would likely need to override a presidential veto by Trump.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Mexico's cenbank seen holding rates steady after peso surge,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank is expected to leave its main interest rate stable on Thursday after a strong appreciation of the peso cooled inflation pressures and data showed a weakening economy.
In its first decision since national elections last month, the Bank of Mexico was seen holding its benchmark rate at an over nine-year high of 7.75 percent, according to 15 of 19 analysts polled by Reuters. 
Mexico's peso has gained around 12 percent since mid-June, just before the landslide victory of leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as president on July 1, buoyed by market friendly comments made by him and his team.
Analysts at Nomura said in a note that the peso's gains were an ""important factor in containing the upside risks in the outlook for inflation, making a hold more likely than not in the upcoming Banxico decision.""
Data this week also showed Mexico's economy shrank slightly in the second quarter, which supports expectations of steady borrowing costs given that any demand-led pressure on inflation was likely to be low, analysts said. 
Mexico's central bank hiked rates in June after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs and following a slump in the peso that fanned concerns inflation could take longer than expected to cool back toward policymakers' 3 percent target.
Still, analysts at Banorte said they expected the central bank would leave the door open to further interest rates hikes in case the peso is battered again.
The peso was hit earlier this year by a broad dollar rally and worries about the success of talks to renegotiate the NAFTA trade deal between Mexico, the United States and Canada. 
The United States and Mexico resumed talks last week, which has helped the peso, but uncertainty about the negotiations could fuel further volatility in the currency.
Four analysts thought the central bank would raise rates again by 25 basis points to 8 percent after the annual inflation rate picked up in early July to 4.85 percent.

The central bank will publish its monetary policy decision at 1 p.m. local time [1800 GMT].

329,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Ethiopia reform push faces major snag: red tape,"By Maggie Fick
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Businessmen who have to deal with Ethiopia's customs system like to joke that if you get a permit to import yellow paintbrushes, make sure every last one is yellow. 
If an orange brush slips into the batch, let alone a red one, forget it - your shipment will be tied up for months.
Ethiopia has achieved one of Africa's fastest growth rates over the past decade, averaging up to 10 percent a year.
But investors complain about its stifling and antiquated socialist bureaucracy, where the default answer from fearful civil servants is ""no"" and importing something as mundane as cotton can take six or 12 months.
Now they hope things might change. Since taking office in April, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has made peace with Eritrea, freed political prisoners and promised to liberalize the economy.
The 41-year-old says outdated ways of thinking and working are holding back his country of 100 million people, nearly half of whom are under 15.
Overhauling the sclerotic government bureaucracy is arguably his biggest challenge, businessmen say.
Abiy, a former military intelligence officer with a doctorate in conflict resolution, is up against an entrenched fear of making decisions by civil servants that delays even routine matters.
""To deliver on our grand reform agenda requires a change in mindset,"" said Belachew Mekuria, head of the Ethiopian Investment Commission. ""It's going to be a very interesting - and at the same time challenging - journey.""
Investors agree, although they remain cautious.
""You don't break down bureaucracy with a couple of speeches. It will take a while, and there's the risk of disappointment,"" said a European investor whose firm began financing two projects several years ago.
TRADITION
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Ethiopian and foreign investors, from entrepreneurs to multinationals. 
All of them applauded Abiy's fresh approach and hoped it would awaken Africa's second most populous nation from its security-obsessed, socialist slumber. 
Fear of the kind of innovation demanded by local businesses and foreign investors has held back what could otherwise become the world's most dynamic economy over the next decade, said a Western investor in the media and e-commerce sectors.
Another problem is that Ethiopia is acutely short of dollars because the government has spent heavily on infrastructure before export earnings from new sectors such as manufacturing have taken off.
Several investors said getting dollars for imports from local banks takes between three and 12 months as weary clerks navigate the central bank's paper-based FX allocation system.
Such idiosyncrasies have their roots in a bureaucracy established over a century ago by King Menelik, who built Ethiopia's railways, telegraph network and tax system, earning comparisons to German nation-builder Otto von Bismarck.
Unlike other African countries, Ethiopia then remained largely untainted by outside influence because it avoided long periods of colonization.
""The bureaucracy is a very old one. It is also typical of a kind of monarchical tradition. Every institution has its own systems, its own turf, its own compartmentalized mandate,"" said Belachew.
The system became even more rigid under the Derg military regime that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, and then under the Marxist-Leninist EPRDF that came to power in the early 1990s after the toppling of the generals.
HIERARCHY
For the past 27 years under the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front the only civil servants able to take decisions with confidence were ministers such was the extent of hierarchy in government and society.
""Everyone was afraid of saying or doing anything,"" said Kjetil Tronvoll, professor of peace and conflict studies at Bjørknes University College in Oslo and an expert on the EPRDF. 
In the latter years of rebel-leader-turned PM Meles Zenawi, who ruled with an iron fist until his death in 2012, even ministers didn't dare make decisions without his blessing.
""If you made a decision on your own, you could be criticized. Better not to make a decision, better to sit in your office and hide,"" Tronvoll said.
Ethiopia scores poorly in the World Bank's Doing Business rankings - 161 out of 190 - and lags behind its East African peers in terms of cutting red tape.
Registering a business takes 33 days, compared to an average of 24 in sub-Saharan Africa and just four in Rwanda, frequently touted as a leading example of a state that has streamlined and modernized its bureaucracy to benefit the private sector.
Many pray Abiy can last the course.
""Abiy says he is going to change this 'Don't do anything and keep your head down' attitude in the civil service,"" said Zafu Eyessuswork Zafu, chairman of United Bank, a private lender. ""Let's hope things change. They have to change.""
Inside sagging, Soviet-style ministries and newer, Chinese-constructed high-rises, civil servants express optimism about the winds of change.
""I'm very happy and motivated"", said one tax collector. Since Abiy took office, he has been promoted to a middle-management role at the Ethiopian Customs and Revenue Authority. He did not want to be quoted by name.
""There's more energy here than in the past,"" he said when asked whether anything had changed at the authority since Abiy took office. 
But in the Ethiopian tradition, when queried about a substantive policy issue, he replied: ""That question should go to my DG."" 

The director general was in a meeting.

Chinese institutional investors spent $4.3 billion on property overseas in the second quarter, according to the report published late Wednesday, a 45 percent slide from a year ago.
For the first half, the volume dropped 37 percent to $9.9 billion.
This led Cushman & Wakefield to downgrade its forecast on the full-year investment volume to be 40 to 50 percent lower than 2017, compared to an original forecast of a 30 to 40 percent drop.
""Things may get worse before they get better,"" said Jason Zhang, head of China Outbound Investment & Advisory Services, Cushman & Wakefield said. ""Geopolitical issues will negatively impact investment, mainly into the US market for the remainder of the year.""
In the second quarter, the firm said China's deleveraging had a bigger impact on investment volume than the country's new rules on outbound property investment that require the approval of the National Development and Reform Commission for the bulk of the investments.
However, investments in the office space increased from the first quarter, up 44 percent to $3.6 billion, though Cushman & Wakefield expected investment activities in the sector would be limited for the rest of the year.
In terms of destination, Hong Kong maintained a leading position for the fourth consecutive quarter, accounting for almost 80 percent of the global volume in the June quarter. Within the financial city, 88 percent was invested in the office sector.
In the United States, volume continued to slow to $81 million, with only one deal each on office and residential property.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 11:31PM ET</span>",Trump's overture to emerging Asia drowned out by trade war,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - When the U.S. Secretary of State flies into Southeast Asia this week with a new investment pitch for the region, the response could be: thanks a million, but please stop threatening a trade war with China that will make us lose billions of dollars.
Analysts say the $113 million of technology, energy and infrastructure initiatives trumpeted by Mike Pompeo earlier this week - the first concrete details of U.S. President Donald Trump's vague 'Indo-Pacific' policy - may be hard to sell to countries that form an integral part of Chinese exporters' supply chains.
It may even further inflame tensions with Beijing, which has been spreading money and influence across the region via its Belt and Road Initiative development scheme.
""The Southeast Asian capitals are more worried about any blowback effects for them of U.S.-China trade tension than they are about how much they can benefit from this $113 million initiative,"" said Malcolm Cook, senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
""Pompeo has a hard selling job. There is still no real positive trade story for Asia coming out of the United States.""
Hot on the heels of Washington's new economic plan for emerging Asia came reports the United States could more than double planned tariffs on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods from dog food to building materials. China called it ""blackmail"" and vowed retaliation.
After a brief meeting with new Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Kuala Lumpur, Pompeo will fly to Singapore - a global trading hub that could be one of the hardest-hit in the region by a trade war - for a sit-down with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Friday.
Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, estimates that a full-scale trade war - defined as 15-25 percent tariffs on all products traded between the U.S. and China - could more than halve Singapore's growth rate next year from a forecast 2.7 percent to 1.2 percent. Malaysia's growth rate in 2019 could fall from an estimated 5 percent to 3.7 percent.
""We are all acutely aware of the storm clouds of trade war,"" Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said at the opening of an ASEAN foreign ministers meeting on Thursday that precedes meetings with the United States and other nations.
Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said earlier this year that a trade war would have a ""big, negative impact"" on the country. 
Ratings agency Moody's said this week that an escalation of trade tensions in 2018 had become its ""baseline expectation"", and that Asia was ""especially vulnerable"" given the integration of regional supply chains. 
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA
As well as trade, Friday's meeting will also cover security issues such as South China Sea disputes and North Korea's nuclear disarmament. The United States will press Southeast Asian leaders to maintain sanctions on Pyongyang following reports of renewed activity at the North Korean factory that produced the country's first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. 
Pompeo will also travel to Indonesia during his trip - Southeast Asia's biggest economy which under Trump faces losing some of the trade preferences given by Washington for poor and developing countries. 
Few officials around the region offered comment on the Indo-Pacific strategy when contacted by Reuters for this story. One said that the ASEAN meeting in Singapore would be an opportunity ""to have clarity and a more unified position"" on the vision.
One reason for caution is that the region has been wrong-footed by U.S. advances before. 
Former U.S. President Barack Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia went on the backburner after Trump won the 2016 election promising to put ""America First"". One of his early acts in office was to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which involved four Southeast Asian states.
The result was that across Asia, more and more countries were pulled into China's orbit: softening their stance on territorial disputes in the South China Sea and borrowing billions of dollars from Beijing to develop infrastructure. 
The Philippines is one example of a country which has taken a more conciliatory approach to China despite a bitter history of disputes over maritime sovereignty.
Its President Rodrigo Duterte frequently praises Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and in February caused a stir when he jokingly offered the Philippines to Beijing as a province of China.
Thailand, one of Washington's oldest allies, is another major regional power perceived to have moved closer to China after U.S. relations came under strain because of concerns about freedoms under its military-dominated government.
Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Busadee Santipitaks told Reuters the country was proceeding with ""a balanced approach"" towards the United States and China.
U.S. officials said the Indo-Pacific strategy does not aim to compete directly with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Yet, in an apparent reference to China, Pompeo said Washington will ""oppose"" any country that seeks dominance in the region. 

While Chinese officials have not criticized the U.S. approach, its influential state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial on Tuesday: ""Belt and Road is destined to continue to flourish. This has nothing to do with certain forces that are selfish and engage in petty practices and make jibes.""

KYOTO, Japan (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said on Thursday the central bank will purchase government bonds ""promptly and appropriately"" if yields rise rapidly.
His comments came as Japanese bond yields  hit a 1-1/2-year high on Thursday with investors continuing to test the limits of the central bank's new commitment announced two days ago to allow debt markets to move more freely.
Amamiya said while the central bank is aware of the potential demerits of its massive stimulus program, it would not reduce monetary support just because it is taking longer for inflation to hit its 2 percent target.
""There has been a growing concern in the government bond market that market functions have been deteriorating,"" Amamiya said, explaining why the BOJ made the new commitment on Tuesday.
""But the target level of long-term yields remains at around zero percent,"" he told a speech to business leaders in Kyoto, western Japan.
""The BOJ does not expect the level of yields to ratchet up,"" he said, adding that the bank will step in to curb any sharp rise in yields as needed.
Under a yield curve control (YCC) program, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent.
The BOJ kept its yield targets steady on Tuesday but said it would allow long-term rates to move more flexibly. It also made tweaks to reduce adverse effects of its policies on markets and commercial banks, reflecting its view that its inflation target remains stubbornly out of reach.
Amamiya conceded that inflation will miss the BOJ's target for another three years given Japan's sticky deflationary mindset. But he stressed that the economy was sustaining momentum for price growth to accelerate toward 2 percent.
He said the best approach for the BOJ was to maintain its ultra-loose policy, while making tweaks to its program to look after the costs of prolonged easing.
""The effects of our monetary easing have been strengthened as a whole, in terms of sustainability,"" he said of Tuesday's measures.
Amamiya said the BOJ was mindful that by maintaining its ultra-easy policy, it was hurting financial institutions' profits and that these costs were cumulative.

""There is no change to the BOJ's intention of thoroughly examining risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy,"" Amamiya said.

333,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",India's Central Bank Flags Currency War Risks as It Hikes Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s central bank governor raised the prospect of global currency wars as he led policy makers in raising interest rates to the highest in two years to shore up the rupee and tackle inflation pressures in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
After delivering the first back-to-back rate increase since the monetary policy committee came into being in September 2016, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel said he’s seeking to maintain economic stability amid growing risks from global trade and currency tensions.
“We have had a few months of turbulence behind us,” Patel told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday. “This is likely to continue and for how long, I don’t know. The trade skirmishes evolved into tariff wars and now we are possibly at the beginning of currency wars.”
The RBI’s rate move follows emerging-market counterparts in Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere who are trying to counter currency routs and inflation risks triggered by a strong dollar and higher U.S. rates. The Federal Reserve left borrowing costs unchanged on Wednesday but stuck with a plan to gradually tighten policy in coming months.
Currency Woes
The rupee is Asia’s worst performing major currency this year, down almost 7 percent against the dollar this year, and is vulnerable to a slump in the yuan amid China’s ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The rupee gained 0.2 percent to 68.4312 against the dollar on Wednesday after five of the six members of the rate-setting panel voted to raise the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent.
Currency and inflation woes aside, the economy is growing faster than any other major nation, strengthening Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s position as he prepares for elections next year. But risks to the outlook are formidable: as the world’s fastest-growing oil consumer, higher crude prices will push up the current-account deficit, while global trade tensions threaten exports and investment.
Inflation has been running well above the central bank’s medium-term target of 4 percent, with the outlook set to worsen because of oil prices and currency weakness.
“Given this, we have to ensure we run a tight ship on the risks we control to maximize the chances of macro-economic stability,” Patel said.
“Every country is adjusting currency to navigate trade turbulence. India will also have to,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings Ltd. in Mumbai. “This raising of rates would help encourage capital flows and in that way protects from currency volatility. That’s what the RBI seems to have aimed at.”
While acknowledging that geopolitical tensions and elevated oil prices continue to be sources of risk to global growth, the RBI was confident that the domestic economic recovery was well entrenched.
“Various indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to be strong,” the central bank said in its policy statement. “The progress of the monsoon so far and a sharper than the usual increase” in support prices for some crops are expected to boost rural demand by raising farmers’ income, the RBI added.
High frequency indicators from purchasing managers’ surveys to auto sales data show the economy is likely to grow above 7 percent, although the recovery could be uneven. The RBI expects growth to pick up in the next financial year, starting April 1.
The economy’s strong performance gives policy makers another reason to hike rates. Core inflation -- which strips out volatile food, fuel and light prices -- has been sticky at a four-year high of more than 6 percent, indicating demand pressures in the economy. Slackness in the economy was disappearing fast, the RBI said.
Further rate hikes will depend on the outlook for inflation and oil prices, as well as domestic factors like looming elections, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of South Asia economic research at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc in Mumbai.
“We don’t expect any further rate hikes but we will need to closely watch out for what happens,” she said. “From now on, it pretty much is a wait and watch on both sides.”

334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",BOE Rate Hike Seen Despite Brexit on Horizon: Decision Day Guide,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England is on track to raise interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, even though Brexit threatens to prove a rough ride for the U.K. economy.
The majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect a quarter-point increase to 0.75 percent on Thursday, the highest since 2009, and investors are pricing it in with near certainty. Yet few anticipate a unanimous decision. A 7-2 split is seen as the mostly likely outcome, with Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden expected to vote to keep rates where they are.
Officials led by Governor Mark Carney are judging whether the economy is overcoming the slowdown it saw at the start of the year, or whether it’s being fundamentally weakened by risks such as the faltering Brexit negotiations and global trade disputes. Some commentators say the U.K. is still too fragile and that any rate hike could end up being reversed within months.
The decision will be published at noon, alongside a statement, minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s deliberations and the Inflation Report, including new forecasts. Carney will take questions at a press conference 30 minutes later.
There are signs of a second-quarter pickup in growth. Retail sales bounced in April and May and joblessness is the lowest since the 1970s, but the backdrop may still be too weak to withstand tighter policy. The U.K. was the only Group of Seven country to see its expansion slow in 2017 and is forecast to lose further momentum this year.
Investors also will be looking for clues about the path of future rates. With the inflation rate at 2.4 percent and forecasts showing it will slip closer to the central bank’s 2 percent target, Carney may choose to strike a dovish tone at his press conference. It’s likely he’ll repeat his favored language, describing future increases as limited and gradual.
The BOE’s scope for further moves will be tested as the U.K. moves closer to next year’s Brexit deadline. The lack of clarity around the shape of Britain’s future relationship with the European Union means the path of growth -- and the central bank’s response -- could look very different depending on what trading agreements can be reached.
Central banks the world over are considering whether they can lifting borrowing costs without undermining the economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept policy unchanged on Wednesday, has slowly been raising borrowing costs for more than two years, while the Bank of Japan said Tuesday that it will keep rates at extremely low levels for an extended period. The ECB is ending a bond-purchasing program at the end of this year and will consider higher rates in the second half of 2019.
Despite the risks for the BOE, money markets are optimistic policy makers will deliver a hike this time. The probability priced in by traders has been steadily building in recent weeks, and 83 percent of economists see it as a done deal.
It’s not only about the main decision though. For the first time, the central bank will also provide an assessment of r*, the rate that keeps the economy neither too hot nor too cool over the long term. The publication could help indicate where officials see the benchmark settling as they move away from ultra-loose monetary policy put in place in the wake of the financial crisis.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>","Deal with U.S. on key NAFTA rule closer, Mexico and Canada say","By Joseph White
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico are nearing a deal on the key issue of autos content rules at talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican and Canadian officials said on Wednesday.
Guillermo Malpica, head of the trade and NAFTA office for the Mexican government, said the United States had ""started showing more flexibility last week"" on autos content and other topics at the negotiations, which have dragged on for almost a year.
Speaking to reporters, Malpica said ""we are getting close"" to an agreement on the so-called autos rules of origin, which dictate how much of a vehicle must be made in the three NAFTA nations to qualify for duty-free status. 
Canadian trade negotiator Colin Bird told an auto industry conference in Michigan on Wednesday that NAFTA negotiators are making progress on auto content rules, and endorsed the concept of linking those rules to improving workers' wages.
""Harnessing the power of trade agreements to promote higher wages is the kind of policy all three countries can get behind,"" Bird said.
Speaking to local media on Tuesday, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo also suggested that negotiators have made progress on auto salaries. U.S. and Canadian trade unions have complained that more manufacturing has gravitated to Mexico due to the country's low wages.
Mexico balked at the prospect of foreign intervention in salaries, but the debate has shifted, Guajardo said. 
""Now what we are talking about is that a percentage of what is made in North America would be made in a high-salary zone,"" he said. ""What does this mean? That clearly, within the component of 100 percent of an automobile made in (the NAFTA zone), a percentage, it could be about 35 to 40 percent, is made in a high-salary zone."" 
The Mexican peso spiked 0.2 percent to its strongest level of the day after news of progress on the autos element of talks, before slipping back. Some analysts forecast the peso will appreciate to below 18 per dollar from its current level of 18.6 if there is a deal. 
Bird and Malpica said they are optimistic about the possibility of reaching a deal to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement and are hopeful of progress when ministers from Mexico and the United States meet this week. Both officials cautioned that the issues remaining in the talks are challenging.
In May, Mexico offered to raise the autos content requirement to 70 percent from a current 62.5 percent. The United States is asking for the threshold to be 75 percent.
Malpica also said the United States was still pushing for a sunset clause that would require the treaty to be reopened every five years. Canada and Mexico strongly oppose the idea.
""Any one country being able to hold the agreement hostage every five years does not provide the certainty” businesses need to invest, Bird said.

Mexico and Canada support including in the main body of a renegotiated NAFTA provisions designed to set labor and environmental standards, Malpica and Bird said. Those issues are addressed in side agreements to the current NAFTA treaty.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Bank of England poised to raise rates in the face of Brexit risk,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to raise interest rates on Thursday to their highest level since the financial crisis almost a decade ago, defying warnings that it is taking a gamble ahead of Brexit, the terms of which remain unclear.
The world's fifth-biggest economy has slowed since the referendum decision in June 2016 to leave the European Union.
And with less than eight months until it leaves the bloc, London and Brussels -- as well as key members of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party -- remain far apart on what the future trading relationship should look like.
But BoE Governor Mark Carney says that even if Britain's economy is growing only modestly, it risks overheating unless borrowing costs rise from their crisis-era emergency lows, something the central bank began in November with its first rate hike in more than 10 years.
All bets on where BoE rates are headed will be off, however, if Britain fails to get a Brexit deal, Carney has said.
Several economists have challenged the need for a rate hike now, given not only the Brexit risks but also the potential damper on global growth from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports, and counter-moves by other countries.
Wage growth -- the main domestic driver of inflation -- has been slow to pick up, too.
""We continue to view even the tentative tightening embarked on since late 2017 as an unnecessary risk, and see several reasons why a hike is not justified at this point in time,"" John Wraith, a strategist with UBS, told clients in a note.
Nevertheless, investors have put almost a 90 percent chance on a hike in Bank Rate to 0.75 percent from 0.50 percent on Thursday, according to market prices. 
The BoE has struggled before to follow through on its signals about when it might raise rates. It had looked set to move in May before Carney stepped in to steer markets towards no change in policy.
This time there has been no last-minute change of message. Instead, the BoE has said it is now convinced that an early 2018 slump in the economy was a one-off caused by extreme winter conditions.
And with unemployment at its lowest rate in more than 40 years, it thinks pay increases will continue to pick up, creating inflation pressure. 
A survey published by the British Chambers of Commerce on Thursday showed half of British firms planned to increase pay by more than 2 percent over the next year, echoing other signs of a slow improvement in pay growth.
MESSAGES
With expectations of a rate hike almost entirely priced into the market, investors are mostly focused on what message the Monetary Policy Committee sends on Thursday about its intentions for further increases in borrowing costs.
Economists polled by Reuters mostly expect a 7-2 vote by the MPC in favor of a rate hike on Thursday. A bigger or smaller majority for an increase could be seen as a sign that the committee is more or less likely to move again soon on rates.
Similarly, the BoE's new inflation forecasts will be watched as a sign of whether it thinks investors are being too relaxed by betting on no follow-up rate hike until late 2019 and only one more almost at the end of its three-year forecast period.
In May, the BoE said inflation in two years' time would fall to its 2 percent target based on expectations in the markets of three 25 basis-point rate hikes over just over two years.
Since then, the worries about Brexit and a global trade war have prompted investors to cut their bets on future BoE hikes.
BoE-watchers will also keep a close eye on a new estimate by the central bank of what it considers the neutral interest rate for Britain's economy which could act as a guide to how far its future rate rises are likely to go.

The BoE is due to announce its interest-rate decision at 1100 GMT (7.00 p.m. ET), and Carney will chair a news conference at 1130 GMT.

337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Brazil Holds Rate at 6.50% as Price Jump Seen as Temporary,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s central bank held its key rate at a record low and signaled plans to keep borrowing costs steady as price pressures ease.
The bank’s board, led by Ilan Goldfajn, kept the benchmark Selic unchanged on Wednesday at 6.5 percent for a third straight meeting. At the previous gathering in June, it signaled a possibility of tightening to counter a currency sell-off. Now, the central bank sees a relatively stable environment for emerging markets, as well as easing pressure on prices from a weaker currency and a nationwide truckers’ strike that started in late May.
""June inflation reflected significant upward pressure from the halt in the transportation sector and other relative price changes. Recent data corroborate the view that these effects should be temporary,"" policy makers wrote in a statement accompanying their decision. They also wrote that the base scenario entails keeping the Selic rate at its current level.
""The central bank sees an improvement from the last meeting,"" said Thais Zara, chief economist at Rosenberg Consultores Associados. ""They will continue to observe.""
Inflation in the month through mid-July accelerated less than forecast as the price shock brought about by May’s strike started to fade. Brazil’s real, along with other emerging market currencies, recovered and has gained roughly 3 percent since the end of June. Over the last month, investor risk perception plunged and prompted traders to back off bets for an August rate hike.
Still, there are risks on the horizon. With no clear favorite and more than 40 percent of the electorate either undecided or planning to cast a protest vote, October’s presidential election is the most uncertain since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985.
Imprisoned President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva leads opinion polls but is likely to be barred from running due to his criminal conviction for corruption and money-laundering. Trailing Lula are a former Army Captain and a leftist former governor pledging to undo recent, market-friendly reforms.
""The central bank will analyze this calmly,"" Zara said. ""But, they are alerting that it’s important to continue with economic adjustments.""

338,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>",Fed Leaves Key Rate Unchanged With Economy Growing at ‘Strong Rate’,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials left U.S. interest rates unchanged and stuck with a plan to gradually lift borrowing costs amid “strong” growth that backs bets for a hike in September.
Economic activity has been “rising at a strong rate,” and unemployment “has stayed low,” the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement released in Washington. “Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly.”
While leaving rates on hold as expected, the committee repeated guidance for “further gradual increases” in its policy benchmark, lining up September’s FOMC meeting for the third hike of the year.
President Donald Trump lashed out at the Fed last month, saying he wasn’t “thrilled” it was raising rates. The comments threw a political cloud over the central bank’s decisions, though economists and investors had widely anticipated Wednesday’s decision.
Policy makers “are not really affected or paying close attention to the political commentary,” said Laura Rosner, senior economist at Macropolicy Perspectives.
Stocks and bonds shrugged off the Fed announcement, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closing down 0.1 percent and the 10-year Treasury yield at 3 percent at 4 p.m. New York time. Odds for a rate hike at the central bank’s Sept. 25-26 meeting held around 80 percent.
“The FOMC did nothing to the statement that would suggest a lower likelihood of a September hike,” said former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer, who runs a policy research firm in Washington. “The market has now priced a September rate hike as a near-certainty, and we agree with that assessment.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is trying to nurture the second longest U.S. expansion on record by slowly reducing the amount of support that monetary policy provides to growth. The economy is riding a tailwind from tax cuts and higher federal spending, though a trade war threatens to dent growth.
The committee described risks to the outlook as “roughly balanced,” and restated that “monetary policy remains accommodative” while leaving the target range for its benchmark policy rate at 1.75 percent to 2 percent.
Most Fed officials in June projected three or four rate hikes for 2018, implying one or two more moves this year.
“There’s a lot of concern that the trade negotiations and the heightened rhetoric surrounding trade negotiations might lead to slower economic activity later in the year,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities LLC in Charlotte, North Carolina. “While it certainly looks like it’s all systems are go for another rate hike in September, and another one in December, the text hasn’t been written just yet on that.”
Pricing in federal funds futures markets imply odds slightly above 60 percent for a fourth rate hike in December.
Policy makers weighed their action against a generally positive backdrop. The U.S. economy grew at a 4.1 percent pace in the second quarter, its fastest pace since 2014. Inflation is close to the Fed’s 2 percent goal, rising at 2.2 percent for the year ending June, while the core rate that excludes food and energy was up 1.9 percent.
The committee noted in the statement that both headline and core inflation “remain near 2 percent.”
Unemployment was 4 percent in June, below the Fed’s 4.5 percent estimate of the level that reflects full employment. The gradual pace of rate increases shows that officials want to see if tight labor markets can continue to draw more people into the workforce and produce higher wages, without sparking unwanted inflation.
Wednesday’s decision was unanimous 8-0. Voting members shifted chairs at this meeting, with John Williams voting for the first time as New York Fed president and FOMC vice chairman, with Kansas City Fed chief Esther George taking his place as an alternate for San Francisco while it seeks a new president.

339,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",U.S. to Analyze Higher Tariff on $200 Billion of China Goods,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration said it’s weighing whether to increase the proposed tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, stepping up pressure on Beijing to change its trade practices.
President Donald Trump has asked U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider hiking the duties, which could be implemented as early as next month.
The proposed higher tariff “is intended to provide the administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behavior and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets,” Lighthizer said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the administration was considering boosting tariffs to 25 percent. The U.S. is open to renewing formal negotiations with China, though Beijing must agree to open its markets to more competition and stop retaliating against U.S. trade measures, according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.
The move to more than double the proposed tariff may inflame already heightened tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The International Monetary Fund has cited escalating trade disputes as a growing downside risk that’s threatening the strongest global economic upswing in seven years.
Increasing the pressure on China by threatening even higher tariffs could backfire. Beijing responded to news reports on Tuesday about the planned tariff increase by cautioning the U.S. against “blackmailing and pressuring” and it vowed to strike back at every escalation.

The administration last month released a list of thousands Chinese products it wants to slap with an additional 10 percent in tariffs, ranging from television components to handbags and seafood to baseball gloves. The duties could take effect after the administration draws up its revised, final list of imports following a public comment period. Hearings are scheduled for Aug. 20 to 23 and the comment period has been extended to Sept. 5 from late August, according to Lighthizer’s office.
The first wave of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods took effect last month, prompting immediate in-kind retaliation from China, and the next round on $16 billion could be implemented by the U.S. in the coming days or weeks.
Trump said last month that he’s willing to impose tariffs on every good imported from China, which totaled more than $500 billion last year. American companies, industry and consumer groups have pleaded with the administration to avoid tariffs, saying they could raise their costs and eventually lead to price hikes for consumers.
Inflation Factor
Implementing the tariffs would complicate the Federal Reserve’s decision-making on interest rates. Omair Sharif, an economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York, said a 25 percent tariff on the entire $200 billion product list could cause inflation to surge by 1.1 percentage point. Assuming the levies get passed along to customers, the annual increase in the consumer price index, excluding food and energy, would jump to 3.4 percent from the current rate of 2.3 percent, he said in a research note on Wednesday.
The Institute for Supply Management’s latest survey released Wednesday indicated that U.S. companies are already mulling significant investment changes. While manufacturers are experiencing healthy demand in the U.S., they’re considering expanding outside the country to avoid tariffs, Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM manufacturing survey, said on a conference call with reporters.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it will fight back should the U.S. further increase tariffs. “If the U.S. takes measures to further escalate the situation, we will surely take countermeasures to uphold our legitimate rights and interests,"" spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press conference on Wednesday.
He said China has always believed that the disputes should be resolved through talks and communications, but the dialogue should be based on “equality and respect as well as established rules and credibility.”
Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations after talks broke down last month, according to people who spoke about the deliberations on condition of anonymity.

340,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>","Brazil Holds 6.50% Rate Amid Trade Spats, Run-Up to October Vote","(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s central bank held its key rate at a record low as emerging market volatility eased and the economy’s recovery from recession faltered.
The bank’s board, led by Ilan Goldfajn, kept the benchmark Selic unchanged Wednesday at 6.50 percent for a third straight meeting. At the previous meeting in June, it signaled a possibility of tightening to counter a currency sell-off. The decision was expected by 37 of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One analyst foresaw a quarter-point rise, and one saw a half-point increase.
Brazil’s economic growth forecast for this year has slumped since the last rate decision, and at 1.5 percent, is now nearly half of what it was at the end of the first quarter. There are also mounting signs that inflation is easing -- after a brief surge triggered by a nationwide truckers’ strike.
That scenario made it easier for the monetary authority to hold fast even amid uncertainty over the October presidential election, according to Newton Rosa, chief economist at Sul America Investimentos and the most accurate Selic forecaster in Bloomberg surveys.
""Both activity and the labor market are weak, and inflation returned to more comfortable levels after being a worry,"" Rosa said. ""That allows them to hold the key rate while they observe global and electoral developments.""
Inflation in the month through mid-July accelerated less than forecast as the price shock brought about by May’s strike started to fade. Brazil’s real, along with other emerging market currencies, recovered and has gained roughly 3 percent since the end of June. Over the last month, investor risk perception plunged and prompted traders to back off bets for an August rate hike.
With no clear favorite and more than 40 percent of the electorate either undecided or planning to cast a protest vote, October’s presidential election is the most uncertain since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985.
Imprisoned President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva leads opinion polls but is likely to be barred from running due to his criminal conviction for corruption and money-laundering. Trailing Lula are a former Army Captain and a leftist former governor pledging to undo recent, market-friendly reforms.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments outlined plans on Wednesday to launch no-fee index funds, hurting the shares of rivals including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) as investors worried about lower profits.
The move marked the latest round of price cutting in the asset management industry, which has benefited from rising markets and steady inflows of investor cash to passively managed products.
""This news has likely led to the significant selling-off of asset manager stocks today with many of the stocks we track down (3 percent to 5 percent) versus flat for the S&P 500 index,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Christopher Harris said in a research note.
""We wouldn't think the Fidelity funds in and of themselves would lead to much change with respect to asset flows, but investors are likely concerned about the follow-on effects,"" Harris said.
Publicly-traded asset managers whose shares declined on Wednesday included BlackRock, which closed down 4.6 percent,  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM), down 4.3 percent, and T. Rowe Price Group, down 1.5 percent.
Spokespeople for Legg Mason and T. Rowe Price declined to comment.
A BlackRock spokeswoman said via e-mail that Fidelity has also expanded to 240 from 70 the number of BlackRock's iShares exchange-traded funds available commission-free on Fidelity's platform.
""This, and the other actions Fidelity has taken, mean that it will be even easier for investors to access iShares ETFs,"" she said via e-mail.
Closely-held Fidelity of Boston said the Zero Total Market Index Fund and the Zero International Index Fund will be available to investors on Friday.
""Investors will pay a 0.00 percent fee, regardless of how much they invest in either fund, while gaining exposure to nearly the entire global stock market,"" Fidelity said.
Fidelity also outlined other changes including requiring no minimum investment to open a retail brokerage account, and said it will cut prices on existing mutual funds.
Todd Rosenbluth of CFRA Research said the lower pricing will help Fidelity grow its online user base.
""Investors are using a combination of index and active mutual funds and ETFs along with stocks in their portfolios and Fidelity can benefit from offering their own and other products around these free funds,"" he said via e-mail.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Fed's plan to raise rates appears intact despite Trump criticism,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If President Donald Trump's comments that the Federal Reserve risked killing U.S. economic growth with higher interest rates was even discussed at a policy meeting that ended on Wednesday, there was no sign of it as the central bank indicated it would stick with its forecast of two more rate increases this year.
The 273-word policy statement from the Fed's rate-setting committee was unanimously agreed by its eight members, including two Trump appointees, Chairman Jerome Powell and Randal Quarles, the central bank's vice chair for supervision.
Wednesday's statement described the economy as ""strong,"" using language that was largely unchanged from the Fed's policy statement in June. Trump blasted the central bank for raising rates in a July 19 interview with CNBC.
The Fed's upbeat assessment keeps it on track to lift borrowing costs at its next meeting in September.
Investors now see a 90 percent probability the Fed will raise rates in September and see a further hike in December, according to an analysis of Fed funds futures contracts compiled by the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
""I don't know if Trump did himself any favors whining about the Fed hiking interest rates. The reality is that the Fed is doing the right thing,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York.
Trump, while stressing that his comments were those of a private person, broke with the tradition that presidents do not comment on Fed policy when he told CNBC that ""all of this work we are putting into the economy"" risked being undermined by the Fed's push for higher rates.
His comments drew charges that he was seeking to influence monetary policy for political gain as President Richard Nixon did when he pressured the Fed to delay raising rates beyond the 1972 elections.
During his 2016 election campaign, Trump accused then-Chair Janet Yellen of playing politics by keeping rates low to help Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's electoral chances. Once in office, Trump replaced Yellen with Powell, breaking with the tradition that Fed chiefs serve two terms.
WARMER WELCOME
While Powell, who trained as a lawyer, may lack his predecessor's economic heft, he also comes without some of the baggage that led to a barrage of criticism from Republican lawmakers who demanded Yellen increase rates and cut regulation.
A former Treasury official in President George H.W. Bush's administration, Powell was appointed a Fed governor in 2012. Since taking the Fed's reins, he has received a warmer welcome than Yellen, even though he says he is broadly following the path she set. The Fed raised rates from near zero and withdrew emergency policy measures during Yellen's one term as Fed chief.
As a governor, Powell's voting record shows he sided with Yellen in every policy decision. As Fed chairman he has overseen two rate rises and has been credited by Republican legislators for bringing predictability to the central bank.
Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, praised Powell's stance, saying that under his leadership, the Fed ""is getting really boring these days"" even though Powell has trodden carefully in Yellen's policy footprints.
Where the Fed under Powell and Quarles has made changes from the Yellen era has been in paring back Obama-era financial regulations introduced to stop a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.
But Quarles has only made modest changes to the central bank's framework since being confirmed as its point person on banking regulation and he has already faced Republican criticism for the Fed's initial efforts to rewrite the crisis-era ""Volcker Rule"" that bars risky trading by banks. 

His defense of U.S. participation in global regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board has also drawn Republican ire, but that has not been accompanied by threats to legislate so as to limit Fed participation in these bodies, as happened during the Obama administration.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>",Trump officials to give update on China tariffs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. administration will give an update on its planned tariffs on goods from China later on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said following reports that President Donald Trump was considering increasing the rate from 10 percent to 25 percent. [L4N1US3HZ]
""We'll have an update later today,"" on the China tariffs, Sanders told reporters at a White House press briefing.
""The president's going to continue to hold China responsible for its unfair trade practices. This has gone on long enough, and he's going to do something about it.""
The U.S. Trade Representative's office has scheduled a media call at 3:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) to provide an update on its ""Section 301"" investigation into China's intellectual property and technology transfer practices, a basis for Trump's threats to ultimately impose tariffs on over $500 billion of Chinese imports. 
So far, his administration has imposed a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion in Chinese imports and on Tuesday completed a public comment period on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods to be targeted for 25 percent tariffs, including semiconductors. Those tariffs could be implemented in the coming weeks.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters late on Tuesday that the administration planned to raise its proposed tariff rate on a subsequent round of $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from an initially proposed 10 percent.
The move is seen as a way to put pressure on Beijing to accept trade concessions as part of talks to ease an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies. 
Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said a 25 percent tariff rate would be more effective in keeping out Chinese goods from U.S. markets from.
He said the Chinese government could more easily offset a 10 percent tariff with subsidies or by weakening China's yuan currency. The yuan has already weakened by about 7 percent against the dollar since the beginning of May, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to tell Reuters recently that he is concerned that Beijing may be manipulating its currency.

""If we're going to use tariffs, this gives us more flexibility and it's a more meaningful threat to say that you might go to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods,"" said Scissors, who is in regular contact with administration officials.

344,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Congress Toughens Foreign Deal Reviews With China in Crosshairs,"(Bloomberg) -- Congress sent President Donald Trump legislation that broadens national-security scrutiny of foreign investments in U.S. firms, imposing new hurdles for technology and real-estate transactions. 
The Senate gave final approval to the measure Wednesday on a 87-10 vote, capping months of wangling by lawmakers and administration officials worried about Chinese acquisitions of U.S. technology. It was part of a $717 billion defense policy bill that passed the House last week and which Trump is expected to sign.
Trump embraced the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act in June as a way to curb Chinese investment rather than relying on a rarely used national-emergency law.
The legislation gives the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which is led by the Treasury Department, broader authority to scrutinize and potentially block foreign deals on national security grounds. It promises to heighten Trump’s standoff with China, which the administration accuses of widespread violations of U.S. intellectual property rights.
Although the bill doesn’t single out nations deserving special scrutiny, investors from some countries, particularly China, will have a harder time winning approval for deals in critical technology and other businesses identified by Congress as deserving comprehensive review, said Anne Salladin, a lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP in Washington who advises companies on CFIUS reviews.
""The bill would significantly broaden CFIUS’s power and scope,"" she said. ""The practical import of this is that acquisitions in some areas from some countries such as China will be subject to intense scrutiny and certain areas may effectively be off limits.""
The legislation could also mean a tougher road for foreign investors outside of China as reviews become longer and encompass even minority investments in critical technology, infrastructure and businesses that handle sensitive personal data. Among pending deals that need approval from CFIUS is T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed purchase of Sprint Corp. Both wireless carriers are owned by foreign companies.
Daniel Rosenthal, a former Obama administration counter-terrorism official and co-chair of Kroll’s CFIUS practice, said some firms already doing deals subject to CFIUS review may benefit from the law while others, notably in the real estate sector, will be now subjected to new risks and delays.
Depending on how the law is implemented, CFIUS could start reviewing office space leases in northern Virginia neighborhoods near the Pentagon, he said. While CFIUS now has authority to examine acquisitions of buildings, the bill expands that jurisdiction to include real estate purchases, leases and concessions if the properties are near military facilities or ports.
""The volume of deals being reviewed could easily double,"" Rosenthal said.
BGOV OnPoint: Comparing CFIUS Proposals With Final Agreement
CFIUS, which includes officials from the Defense, Justice and Homeland Security departments in addition to Treasury, already has significant power. It can impose changes to deals to protect national security and can recommend that the president block a transaction.
Only five deals have been blocked by presidents on the panel’s recommendation, but often just the threat of a presidential order is enough to scuttle a deal because the companies walk away. Since Trump took office last year, at least a dozen deals have collapsed due to opposition from CFIUS, most of which were acquisitions by Chinese investors.
There was fear among some members of Congress that China was getting access to American technology, often through startup investments and joint ventures, that weren’t reviewed by the committee. CFIUS reviews are now limited to transactions affecting control of U.S. businesses, though that can include minority stakes if they carry significant governance rights.
Although the bill doesn’t call out China, lawmakers said CFIUS ""may consider"" in its reviews whether the deal involves a country of ""special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security."" That appears to target China and its “Made in China 2025” plan to become globally competitive in strategic industries like robotics and aviation.
While the final bill was watered down from earlier versions, the measure would broaden technology deals reviewed by the panel to include emerging technologies that would be defined later by officials. It also gives CFIUS authority to review investments in companies that hold sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens.
While CFIUS reviews are technically voluntary, the legislation also requires mandatory reviews of deals in which a foreign government will hold a ""substantial interest"" in critical technology, critical infrastructure or a firm with personal data.
With key terms still to be fleshed out by officials, it will take time to for companies to learn just how aggressive CFIUS will be in using its new authorities in the legislation, according to lawyers.
""It casts a wider net for the committee,"" said Brian Fleming, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier in Washington who previously worked at the Justice Department’s national security division. ""It’s not really going to be until there’s a track record to know how the committee will work and where the boundaries are.""

345,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 02:37PM ET</span>","Fed leaves rates unchanged, stays on course for September hike","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday but characterized the economy as strong, keeping the central bank on track to increase borrowing costs in September.
The Fed said economic growth has been rising strongly and the job market has continued to strengthen while inflation has remained near the central bank's 2 percent target since its last policy meeting in June, when it raised rates.
""Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly,"" the Fed said in a unanimous statement following the conclusion of its latest two-day policy meeting.
The Fed's decision left its benchmark overnight lending rate in a range of 1.75 percent to 2.00 percent.
The Fed currently expects another two rate rises by the end of the year. Investors had all but ruled out a move at this week's meeting, with their sights set on rate hikes next month and in December.
Federal funds futures implied traders are pricing in about a 91 percent chance of a rate rise in September and a 71 percent chance of an additional hike in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
Market reaction to the Fed decision was muted as it met expectations on where the central bank would push policy rates, with the dollar (DXY) slightly stronger against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields little changed. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently said the economy is in a ""really good place"" and pledged to continue with gradual increases in borrowing costs in order to maintain the second-longest U.S. economic expansion on record.
""This is consistent with what Powell told Congress: the economy is doing really well right now,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.
The economy grew at a pace of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, its best showing in nearly four years, as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs, Commerce Department data showed on Friday.
Inflation is also perking up after six years of undershooting the Fed's target. The central bank's preferred measure of inflation - the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy components - increased at a 2.0 percent pace in the second quarter. 
The latest monthly figures released on Tuesday showed the core PCE in June was 1.9 percent higher than a year ago. That measure hit the central bank's inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011.
U.S. labor costs, viewed as one of the better gauges of how much slack is left in the market, also posted their largest annual gain since 2008 in the second quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
LIGHTS FLASH GREEN
U.S. President Donald Trump, breaking with the White House's traditional practice of not commenting on Fed policy, recently criticized policymakers for raising rates. The central bank acts independently when setting monetary policy.
Economic growth has been buoyed by the fiscal stimulus from the Trump administration's tax cuts and spending. The unemployment rate, currently at 4.0 percent, is lower than the level seen sustainable by Fed policymakers.
But policymakers expect economic growth to slow next year as the fiscal stimulus fades, and they are keenly watching for signs of an acceleration in inflation that could push them to ramp up the pace of rate hikes to prevent the economy from overheating.
They also remain wary of the potential harm to the U.S. economy of a protracted trade war between the United States and China which could push the cost of goods higher and hurt corporate investment.
Some firms say the steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration already have had an impact. Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR) said last week that the tariffs had sharply raised the costs of the appliance maker's raw materials, contributing to a slump in its second-quarter earnings.

Wednesday's policy statement made no mention of the administration's protectionist trade policies and maintained that the risks to the outlook were ""roughly balanced.""

346,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Trump Lifts Debt Sales to Near-Recession Levels as Economy Booms,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is boosting long-term U.S. debt sales to the highest since 2010, matching the pace when the country was digging itself out of the worst recession since World War II, even as the economy is booming.
To cope with the fiscal expansion driven in part by Trump’s tax cuts and spending measures approved by Congress, the Treasury Department said Wednesday that it will raise long-term debt issuance to $78 billion this quarter. It is also launching a new two-month bill and will lean more heavily on maturities out to five years.
Trump’s policies are further weighing on the fiscal outlook that he inherited from his predecessor, Barack Obama. Treasury has also highlighted the need to sell debt as the Federal Reserve allows maturing securities on its $4.3 trillion balance sheet to roll off gradually.
In its quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday, Treasury said it boosted the auction sizes of coupon-bearing and floating-rate debt from $73 billion the previous quarter. It was the third consecutive quarterly increase, as Trump’s fiscal policies widen the nation’s budget deficit.
The Treasury will sell $34 billion in three-year notes on Aug. 7, compared with $33 billion last month and $31 billion in May. The government increased to $26 billion the sale of 10-year notes to be auctioned on Aug. 8, from $25 billion last quarter, and the 30-year bonds to be sold on Aug. 9 to $18 billion from $17 billion in May, Treasury said. The sales will raise new cash of $39.8 billion.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose above 3 percent for the first time since June 13 in the wake of the refunding announcement. The yield curve from 5 years to 30 years steepened, with the spread rising to over 26 basis points earlier Wednesday, before retreating to about 25 basis points.
The deficit totaled $607 billion through the first nine months of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, compared with $523 billion from the same period a year earlier. The Congressional Budget Office in late June predicted total government spending would exceed revenue by $1 trillion in 2020.
Still, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that a stronger economy will boost government revenue and help shrink the budget deficit. The U.S. economy is “well on the path” for four or five years of sustained annual growth of 3 percent, he said on Sunday.
Treasury officials Wednesday said that flattening of the yield curve -- with the gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields touching last month its narrowest since 2007 -- wasn’t dictating their choices. Investors and some Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern that the curve may invert –- which has historically been a harbinger of recession.
“Being the U.S. government, being one of the largest sovereign debt markets in the world, obviously we need to continue to issue debt and meet our financing needs no matter what the shape of the curve is -- whether the curve is steep or flat, or interest rates are rising or falling,” Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Clay Berry told reporters in Washington. “We really don’t have the flexibility or the ability to time the market, if you will, since we are kind of a consistent, large issuer over time, no matter what the interest rate environment.”
The Treasury is in an overall process of lifting coupon auction sizes back toward their historical maximums, which occurred in the years just after the financial crisis, says Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.
“We are about halfway through the auction size increases that will be necessary to cover financing needs over the next two or three years,’’ Stanley wrote in a note Wednesday. “Eventually, every coupon issue will be at all-time highs, which should come as no surprise given that deficits are projected to be over $1 trillion per year as far as the eye can see. ‘’
Other Maturities
The department said Wednesday it will start sales of a new two-month bill in October. This security will settle on Tuesdays rather than Thursdays.
The Treasury also said it plans to boost auction sizes of all other maturities over the coming quarter. Treasury will boost the size of its two-, three- and five-year notes by $1 billion per month over the quarter, while increasing the floating two-year auction by $1 billion in August. The department will raise the size of its seven-, 10- and 30-year notes by $1 billion in August, holding auction sizes at that level through October. The changes will result in an additional $30 billion of new issuance.
The department again left unchanged the size of inflation-linked securities, or TIPS. Treasury is studying whether to introduce a second new five-year TIPS to its auction calendar. The department is still analyzing potential additions and expects to make an announcement in November.
Given seasonal patterns, “bill supply is anticipated to gradually increase,” Treasury said. “This increased bill supply will include the launch of the new benchmark 2-month bill in October.” The department said it will meet any unexpected change in financing needs with increased bill sales.
The Treasury’s borrowing needs in the second half of the year will be the most since the financial crisis a decade ago, with the Treasury expecting to issue $769 billion in net marketable debt, the department said Monday. That compares with $1.1 trillion in July-December 2008, when America was in the midst of its worst recession in generations.
Budget Shortfall
Tax cuts, higher government spending and an aging population are expected to push the federal budget shortfall to $804 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Mnuchin has said repeatedly that corporate and individual tax cuts will fuel faster economic growth that will boost tax revenue and shrink the deficit. Gross domestic product accelerated in the second quarter to the fastest pace since 2014, though many economists say the expansion will moderate in coming quarters and years."

LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian lawmakers have given President Hassan Rouhani one month to appear before parliament to answer questions on his government's handling of Iran's economic struggles, state media reported on Wednesday.
It is the first time parliament has summoned Rouhani, who is under pressure from hardline rivals to change his cabinet following a deterioration in relations with the United States and Iran's growing economic difficulties.
Lawmakers want to question Rouhani on topics including the rial's decline, which has lost more than half its value since April, weak economic growth and rising unemployment, according to semi-official ISNA news agency.
Rouhani, a pragmatist who reduced tensions with the West by striking a nuclear deal in 2015, is facing a growing backlash since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out from the pact in May and said he will reimpose sanctions that seek to throttle Iran’s economy, including its lifeblood oil exports.
ISNA said lawmakers also want Rouhani to explain why, more than two years after the landmark deal, Iranian banks still have only limited access to global financial services. 
The nuclear accord curbed Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions. 
Rouhani's summon coincides with further shows of public discontent. A number of protests have broken out in Iran since the beginning of the year over high prices, water shortage, power cuts, and alleged corruption in the Islamic Republic.
On Tuesday, hundreds of people rallied in cities across the country, including Isfahan, Karaj, Shiraz and Ahvaz, in protest against high inflation caused in part by the weak rial.
Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani was quoted by state television as saying that Rouhani will have one month to attend a parliamentary session and address the issues.
Rouhani canceled an interview on state television last week, a move that seems to have encouraged many lawmakers to question him about his economic records in the parliament.
Although 80 lawmakers submitted their questions for Rouhani, a Rouhani ally, vice president for parliamentary affairs Hosseinali Amiri, called the process ""unconstitutional.""
""Some lawmakers, who were convinced to take back their questions, were encouraged by other members of parliament to submit the questions again,"" Amiri was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.
""MAXIMUM SHAKE-UP""
Trump said on Monday he would be willing to meet Rouhani without preconditions to discuss how to improve relations, but senior Iranian officials and military commanders rejected the offer as worthless and ""a dream"". 
Addressing Washington, Hesamoddin Ashna, a Rouhani advisor, said in a tweet on Wednesday that ""You launched an economic war against us by imposing sanctions. First stop this war and then ask for talks. Without preconditions means without sanctions."" 
Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a member of Israel's security cabinet, said on Wednesday Trump's offer of talks was a ""ladder"" to safety for a ruling system he said was on the point of collapse, but he was not surprised that Tehran rejected it.
""It is hard to see the Iranians… being agreeable to such a meeting with someone who only a few weeks ago basically sank an agreement with which they were so pleased. But this is the right kind of process with the Iranians,"" Hanegbi told Israel Radio.
Rouhani appointed a new central bank governor last week and accepted the government spokesman's resignation on Tuesday, suggesting he accepts a need to reshuffle his economic team.
In a separate letter to Rouhani on Wednesday, 193 lawmakers welcomed these changes ""as a good starting point"" and asked for the ""maximum shake-up"" in the government.
Hardline general prosecutor Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said on Wednesday Iran's enemies were trying to divide government and people by creating economic hardship. He vowed that those who follow the ""enemies' plot"" would face the ""harshest punishment"".

Many people decide to invest in flood insurance policies after a scary weather event. But sometimes they let the insurance lapse because it is too expensive, and also because they might misunderstand that familiar term from news and weather reports, ""100-year flood."" 
It is natural to think that ""100-year flood"" means that once a big flood hits, you then have 99 more years before you have to worry about another one. But what it actually refers to is a flood event that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year, said Lynne McChristian, consultant with the Insurance Information Institute and a professor of risk management at Florida State University. 
Even the U.S. government, which provides funding for the National Flood Insurance Program (floodsmart.gov), is examining whether flood insurance is worth the cost. The 50-year-old program was set to expire by July 31, but Congress on Tuesday approved a stopgap extension hours before the deadline to take it through hurricane season. 
With so many recent flooding disasters - from hurricanes Sandy, Harvey and Maria to unnamed ones like the waters that overtook Ellicott City, Maryland, in May - payouts are huge, raising the cost of premiums. 
Since flood insurance tends to be bought only by certain residents of the most danger-prone areas, it is expensive because the risk pool is not large enough to spread around the cost. The NFIP has only about 5 million policies in force, despite the fact that flooding can hit any part of the United States at any time, even if it is only a creek overflow or sewer backup. 
FINE PRINT
The biggest mistake people make with flood insurance is that they believe it is included with their homeowners' policy. In reality, it is specifically excluded. 
While the lack of coverage is usually noted in a footnote on annual declarations for homeowners' policies, some states are making an effort to better inform consumers. Florida, for instance, mandates that policy statements point this out in big bold letters. 
Many homeowners also think that in the event of flooding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will come to their aid. Yet FEMA grants come into play only in major disasters, and even then they will likely not cover the cost to rebuild your home. Most funds available to homeowners are in the form of loans. 
For those who do wade into the flood insurance process, the government is not the only option, said Craig Poulton, an insurance consultant based in Utah. Private companies broker policies for the National Flood Insurance Program, and there are also fully private policies, underwritten by insurance companies. 
The range of coverage is large. Donna Childs' very low-risk house costs just $350 a year to insure against flooding. A mansion on a coastal waterway in Florida may run $2,500 or more.
On average, homeowners pay $700 annually for flood insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The NFIP will insure only up to $250,000 in losses, but private insurance can go into the millions. 
The amount is largely determined by the flood map for your area, which assigns risk zones. These are drawn with very broad strokes - not gerrymandered like political precincts. 
HOW TO SAVE
First, decide what risk you are willing to take and how much you are comfortable spending for protection.
The best way to save is to obtain a flood elevation certificate specifically for your house, which could cost from $500 to $800 from a survey company or engineer. 
If you live in a high-risk area but happen to be in a safer section, you could shave hundreds of dollars a year off your insurance bill. 
Some municipalities are jumping in to help residents get these certificates. New York City, for one, has a pilot program funded by Hurricane Sandy recovery money to provide free certificates for homeowners, said Rachel Stein, deputy director of sustainability and resiliency for the Center for NYC Neighborhoods. 
Another way to lower costs is to install flood vents in your crawl spaces to help give the water a path to exit your house instead of building up. 

When purchasing flood insurance, you could also consider a policy to cover just the structure of your house and not the contents to save money. It is a risky move if a flood hits, because if water comes into your house, all of your stuff will be soggy.

350,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Reading the runes of the UK economy ahead of Bank of England decision,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - With the Bank of England looking poised to raise interest rates to a new post-financial crisis high, evidence about the health of Britain's economy appears mixed.
Most economists polled by Reuters think the BoE will raise rates to 0.75 percent on Thursday, although given the conflicting signals ahead of Brexit, some think this may prove unnecessary.
Inflation and pay trends have been subdued of late, although most indicators of economic growth point to a modest rebound from a weak start to the year that the BoE believes was caused by bad weather.
Below are a few other indicators, some of them less closely watched, which also show the mixed fortunes of the world's fifth-biggest economy.
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY
Movements in Britain's commercial property can be a good guide to shifts in the wider economy.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' Commercial Market Survey was one of the first that pointed to a serious slowdown on the way ahead of the 2008/09 recession. 
It generally links well with the closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers Index, a gauge of the wider economy.
The RICS survey has pointed to slowing activity in the commercial property market lately, and although the PMI has yet to follow suit, it may do soon if history is a guide.

HOUSEHOLD DEBT
Although consumer confidence has mostly held up in recent months, there are longer-term warning signals about the financial health of consumers.
Official data last week showed the number of people in England and Wales registering as insolvent hit a six-year high in the second quarter.
The Office for National Statistics also said households' outgoings surpassed their income last year for the first time since 1988, adding to concerns about debt problems among many consumers. 
(For a graphic on 'UK personal insolvencies' click https://reut.rs/2JZ6D0D)
WAGE GROWTH
Wage growth has repeatedly failed to pick up as the BoE has forecast although the central bank has become less bullish about the outlook more recently.
In May the BoE said it thought overall wage growth would average more than 3 percent in 2018 and 2019 -- it stood at 2.5 percent in its most recent reading -- but some economists think even that may prove optimistic.
Academics David Bell and former BoE rate-setter David Blanchflower say the jobless rate may need to fall below 3 percent from 4.2 percent now before wages rise notably.
They argue that under-employment, rather than unemployment, should be the main gauge of labor market slack. It remains elevated compared with pre-financial crisis levels.
A look at the relationship between wage growth and the unemployment rate over the last 15 years shows pay has failed to budge significantly higher -- as would typically be expected -- despite the jobless rate falling to its lowest since the 1970s.
(For a graphic on 'Unemployment and pay' click https://reut.rs/2M98BgH)
UNCERTAINTY
BoE Governor Mark Carney has had to endure the ""unreliable boyfriend"" epithet that a lawmaker gave him in 2014 after apparently flip-flopping over guidance about interest rates. 
Carney says the BoE's guidance is aimed at consumers and businesses rather than traders and journalists. Still, the BoE's last survey of public attitudes showed a quarter of people -- a record high -- had no idea where interest rates were headed.
The British Chambers of Commerce has argued against a rate hike on the grounds that its member firms prefer a stable path for monetary policy during times of such political uncertainty.
(For a graphic on 'UK public's interest rate expectations' click https://reut.rs/2LJGf0n)
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE
No major business surveys are showing levels of growth in Britain's private sector that in the past have been consistent with interest rate increases from the BoE.
The Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Business Barometer shows business confidence remained subdued ahead of Brexit and has weakened of late.
But the Bank of England thinks the ""speed limit"" of Britain's economy -- the rate of growth it can sustain without generating excess inflation -- has dropped to around 1.5 percent year-on-year.
If the BoE is right, rate hikes will be needed at weaker levels of growth than in the past in order to keep inflation under control.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","U.S. Treasury to introduce new two-month bill, increase coupon sizes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday it will introduce a new benchmark 2-month bill starting in October 2018 and also increase the size of its debt auctions in the coming months.
The measures are to deal with a rising budget deficit and fill gaps left by the Federal Reserve continuing to reduce its massive bond portfolio.
Rising federal borrowing, while not entirely a surprise, rekindled some concerns about its effect on the bond market, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) to 3 percent for the first time since mid-June.
""Some of the selling in the bond market can be attributed to the auction sizes continuing to increase,"" said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York.
The new 2-month bill will settle on a Tuesday, unlike the department's traditional settlement day of Thursday, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Clay Berry said in a statement.
He said the first auction for the 2-month bill will be announced on Oct. 15, 2018.
Treasury said that it will increase the sizes of the 2-,3- and 5-year note auctions by $1 billion per month over the next three months. It will also increase auction sizes by $1 billion for each of the next 7- and 10-year notes and 30-year bond auctions in August and hold auction sizes steady at that level through October.
It will also boost the auction size of its next 2-year floating rate note issue by $1 billion.
The U.S. fiscal deficit is expected to hit $833 billion this year, up from $666 billion in the budget year ended last September, according to the Treasury's June budget report.
The U.S. central bank has also been gradually cutting its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it bought in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
The Treasury announcement follows previous increases in auction sizes following the department's quarterly meetings in February and May.
On Monday, the Treasury said in a statement it expects to issue $329 billion through credit markets during the July-September period, assuming an end-September balance of $350 billion.
The borrowing estimate for the third quarter is the highest since the same period in 2010 and fourth largest on record for the July-September quarter.
In its quarterly refunding announcement, Treasury said it would auction $78 billion in coupon debt next week and was still studying the possibility of an additional sale of 5-year TIPS securities in the second half of the year.
It said auction sizes of TIPS would remain unchanged over the next quarter.
"
352,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 09:42AM ET</span>",The Fed is struggling with one key sentence in its post-meeting statement,"This is how the internal debate at the US central bank was characterized in minutes to the  Fed’s June meeting. 
""Many (officials) noted that, if gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate continued, the federal funds rate could be at or above their estimates of its neutral level sometime next year. In that regard, participants discussed how the Committee's communications might evolve over coming meetings if the economy progressed about as anticipated; in particular, a number of them noted that it might soon be appropriate to modify the language in the post-meeting statement indicating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.""
Ward McCarthy, Jefferies chief financial economist, says he does not expect any tweaks to come at this week’s meeting, which is also not expected to yield another interest rate hike.
""How soon is soon? We think that August 1 is too soon,"" he writes in a research note. ""However, we cannot preclude the possibility that the FOMC alters the language in the August 1 policy statement to set the stage for the modification of the phrase 'the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.'""
But McCarthy adds: ""The most efficient change on August 1 would be to change the statement to 'the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative for now.'""
The Fed has raised interest rates several times since December 2015 to a range of 1.75% to 2%. That may seem low historically, but comes in the context of an employment recovery that has taken so many years to make up the ground lost during the Great Recession.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Ellen Zentner and her colleagues are on the same page on the likely timing of the Federal Open Market Committee's language shift:
""We do expect that after raising rates at the September meeting, the FOMC may look to adjust its assessment that the stance of policy 'remains accommodative,' but that reference is likely to remain unchanged in the August statement for now,"" the bank's economists write in a research note. 
""The bulk of the changes we expect will be a mark-to-market in the section describing current economic conditions to reflect recent data."""
353,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Trump could more than double his proposed tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods — and China is preparing to strike back against US 'blackmail',"After a handful of quiet days in President Donald Trump's trade war, it looks as if a further escalation may be on its way following reports that another round of tariffs on China could be announced imminently and a statement from the Chinese government saying it is readying a retaliation.
 According to Bloomberg, the Trump administration is considering levying tariffs of 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the US, a move that would inevitably deepen tensions between the two nations. Trump so far has publicly threatened 10% tariffs on this tranche of imports.
Citing three sources familiar with the plans, Bloomberg said the US would raise its threat to 25% tariffs as a means of getting the Chinese government to enter into negotiations to de-escalate the conflict, which has seen tit-for-tat tariff impositions largely on industrial goods.
The increased tariff proposals could be announced in a Federal Register notice as early as Wednesday, one of Bloomberg's sources said.
The US has already placed 25% tariffs on about $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, and it has just finished consulting on another set to be imposed on goods worth $16 billion. It earlier imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from China and other countries.
Goods already affected by Trump's tariffs against China include batteries, trains, and ball bearings, but they could extend to more consumer goods if further tariffs are imposed.  You can see a full list of goods subject to tariffs here.
Before his latest tariff threat,  Trump previously signaled a readiness to ""go to 500,"" or impose tariffs on all $505 billion of goods coming from China to the US.
""I'm not doing this for politics — I'm doing this to do the right thing for our country,"" he told CNBC during the interview in which he made that threat. ""We have been ripped off by China for a long time.""
The latest reports of Trump's willingness to increase tariffs on China were met with anger in Beijing, with a government representative accusing the US of attempting to ""blackmail"" China. The government also made clear that it was willing to hit back at any additional tariffs.
""US pressure and blackmail won't have an effect,"" Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, according to Reuters. ""If the United States takes further escalatory steps, China will inevitably take countermeasures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights.""
As the Trump administration ratchets up its threats to China about rising tariffs, the worst of its conflict with the European Union over trade appears to be over, after last week  Trump climbed down on imposing tariffs on European automobiles imported by the US.
During a meeting in Washington, DC, last Wednesday, Trump and the European Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed to the beginnings of a deal meant to lower tensions between the two parties.
""This was a very big day for free and fair trade,""  Trump said in a press conference after the two met.
In the meeting, the EU agreed to import more American soybeans and liquefied natural gas. The two sides committed to work to lower industrial tariffs and adjust regulations to allow US medical devices to be traded more easily in European markets."

356,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 1:
1. Markets Await Fed Policy Statement
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its policy meeting this afternoon, but solid economic growth combined with rising inflation are likely to keep it on track for another two hikes this year even as President Donald Trump has ramped up criticism of its push to raise rates.
The Fed will announce its decision at 2PM ET and release its accompanying rate statement at the same time.
No press conference is scheduled and only minor changes are anticipated compared with the Fed's June policy statement, which emphasized accelerating economic growth, strong business investment and rising inflation.
The U.S. central bank so far this year has increased borrowing costs in March and June, and investors see additional moves in September and December.
Besides the Fed, the economic calendar will also be busy on Wednesday, as investors get a look back at July.
ADP will release its July report on private payroll growth at 8:15AM ET. The July report on auto sales and the July reports on manufacturing activity from the Institute of Supply Management and Markit Economics also will be released.
Investors will pay particular attention to the surveys for any impact tariffs are having on the sector.
There is also weekly oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) scheduled for this morning.
2. U.S.-China Trade War Back In Focus
Conflicting signs over the state of U.S.-China trade relations pulled markets in opposite directions. A Bloomberg report on Tuesday said that the United States and China were seeking to resume trade talks to defuse a battle over import tariffs.
However, later reports that the Trump administration plans to propose tariffs of 25%, instead of the initially proposed 10%, on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods injected uncertainty back into financial markets.
A source familiar with the plan said the announcement could come as early as Wednesday.
While the tariffs would not be imposed until after a period of public comment, raising the proposed level to 25% could escalate the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies.
China's Foreign Ministry warned earlier that it will retaliate if the U.S. takes further steps hindering trade.
Investors fear an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
3. Apple In Touching Distance Of $1 Trillion After Earnings Beat
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose 3.7% in pre-market trade to $197.34, a record high, putting its market capitalization at $954 billion.
The stock would need to hit $206.49 for Apple to become the first publicly traded U.S. company to cross the $1 trillion threshold, based on Apple's share count at the end of the quarter. Apple may have reduced its share count since then.
The tech giant reported strong results for its fiscal third quarter after the closing bell on Tuesday, with subscriptions from App Store, Apple Music and iCloud services bolstering business.
While Apple sold 41.3 million iPhones in the fiscal third quarter, half a million less than expected, the average iPhone selling price topped expectation by $30, hitting $724, according to FactSet.
The world's most valuable technology company also forecast revenue above expectations for the fall, when it typically launches new iPhone models.
4. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Mixed Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed open, with technology shares set to get a boost as sentiment improved after results from tech bellwether Apple topped Wall Street forecasts.
At 5:30AM ET, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 12 points, or about 0.2%, at the open.
However, the blue-chip Dow futures and S&P 500 futures indicated a slightly lower start to their respective trading sessions, as fears of an imminent escalation in the tariff war between the U.S. and China weighed.
Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was a shade higher at 94.45.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield ticking up to around 2.98%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near a two-decade high of 2.68%.
5. Tesla Results Highlight Another Busy Earnings Day
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) results due out after the market close will be the main event on the earnings calendar, in what should be another busy day of corporate earnings.
Wall Street analysts expect the company to report an adjusted loss per share of $2.78 on revenue of $4.03 billion. As has been the case in previous reports, analysts have been squarely focused on the Model 3, as well as its cash burn and potential capital needs in the coming years.
Bloomberg, citing sources, reported earlier that the company plans to invest $5 billion building a factory in China, as the trade war with the U.S. makes establishing production in the world’s fastest-growing auto market more imperative for the electric-car pioneer.
Besides Tesla, a slew of S&P 500 companies are also set to report results on Wednesday.
Before the market open, Sprint (NYSE:S), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Humana (NYSE:HUM), Sodastream (NASDAQ:SODA),  Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP), and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) will be the highlights.
After the close, joining Tesla, will be Square (NYSE:SQ), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), US Steel X, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE).

357,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Pakistan says U.S. concerns about IMF bailout and China 'totally wrong',"By Drazen Jorgic
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Wednesday dismissed U.S. concerns that any new International Monetary Fund bailout for the South Asian nation would be used to repay Chinese debt as ""totally wrong"".
Pakistan's economy has hit severe turbulence over the past year and most analysts expect the nuclear-armed nation to seek a bailout, either from the IMF or closest ally China, to avoid a currency crisis.
Beijing has pledged $57 billion in loans for Pakistan as part of China's vast Belt and Road initiative, deepening economic and diplomatic ties between the neighbors at a time when relations between Islamabad and Washington are fraying.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday warned that any potential IMF bailout for Pakistan's incoming government should not provide funds to pay off Chinese lenders.
In response, Pakistan's finance ministry sought to de-couple the link between any potential IMF bailout and Beijing's loans for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which spans mostly energy and transport infrastructure.
""First and foremost it is totally wrong to link the IMF package with CPEC. It is affirmed that Pakistan Government is fully committed to undertake and complete CPEC projects in their totality,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
""Third parties cannot weaken our collective resolve to make CPEC a success story.""
CPEC is billed as Pakistan's most important national project, while Beijing has touted CPEC as the ""flagship"" project in the vast Belt and Road initiative to build rail, road and maritime links across the globe.
Both countries are very sensitive of any criticism about CPEC.
The United States has been concerned that China is saddling smaller countries with debt as a way to gain influence and control around the globe.
Pakistan is struggling to avert a currency crisis that has presented the new government with its biggest challenge. Many analysts and business leaders expect that another IMF bailout, the second in five years, will be needed to plug an external financing gap. [nL5N1UN1TV]
""Make no mistake. We will be watching what the IMF does,"" Pompeo said.
""There's no rationale for IMF tax dollars, and associated with that American dollars that are part of the IMF funding, for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,"" Pompeo added.
On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the IMF had its own standards and operating rules when cooperating with countries.
""I believe they will handle it appropriately,"" he told reporters, without elaborating.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 05:02AM ET</span>",China vows retaliation if Trump slaps 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese imports,"By Ben Blanchard and Steve Holland
BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday that ""blackmail"" wouldn't work and that it would hit back if the United States takes further steps hindering trade, as the Trump administration considers slapping a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
The proposal would increase the potential tariff rate from 10 percent the administration had initially put forward on July 10 for that wave of duties in a bid to pressure Beijing into making trade concessions, a source familiar with the plan said on Tuesday. 
The tariffs target thousands of Chinese imports, including food products, chemicals, steel and aluminum and consumer goods ranging from dog food, furniture and carpets to car tires, bicycles, and baseball gloves and beauty products.
While the duties would not be imposed until after a period of public comment, raising the proposed level to 25 percent would escalate the already bitter trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies. 
The source said President Donald Trump's administration could announce the tougher proposal as early as Wednesday in Washington. The plan to more than double the tariff rate was first reported by Bloomberg News.
China, which has accused the United States of bullying, again vowed to retaliate if Trump proceeds with the measures, warning that pressure tactics would fail.
""U.S. pressure and blackmail won't have an effect. If the United States takes further escalatory steps, China will inevitably take countermeasures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing.
Investors fear an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing could hit global growth, and prominent U.S. business groups, while weary of what they see as China's mercantilist trade practices, have condemned Trump's aggressive tariffs.
Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have been speaking privately as they seek to restart negotiations to defuse the budding trade war, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office declined to comment on the proposed tariff rate increase or on whether any changes would alter the deadlines laid out for comment period before implementation.
Asked about communication between the two countries on the dispute, Geng said China had ""always upheld using dialogue and consultations to handle trade frictions"", but that dialogue must be based on mutual respect and equality.
""Unilateral threats and pressure will only produce the opposite of the desired result,"" Geng said.
""AMERICANS' POCKETBOOKS""
In early July, the U.S. government imposed 25 percent tariffs on an initial $34 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
Washington is preparing to also impose tariffs on an extra $16 billion of goods in coming weeks, and Trump has warned he may ultimately put them on over half a trillion dollars of goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
The $200 billion list of goods targeted for tariffs - which also include Chinese tilapia fish, printed circuit boards and lighting products - would have a bigger impact on consumers than previous rounds of tariffs. 
Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said a 10 percent tariff on these products is already problematic, but more than doubling that to 25 percent would be much worse.
""Given the scope of the products covered, about half of all imports from China are facing tariffs, including consumer goods,"" Ennis said. ""The cost increases will be passed on to customers, so it will affect most Americans' pocketbooks.""
Trump had said he would implement the $200 billion round as punishment for China's retaliation against the initial tariffs aimed at forcing change in China's joint venture, technology transfer and other trade-related policies.
He also has threatened a further round of tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office initially had set a deadline for final public comments on the proposed 10 percent tariffs to be filed by Aug. 30, with public hearings scheduled for Aug. 20-23. 
It typically has taken several weeks after the close of public comments for the tariffs to be activated.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Japan's labor crunch is reshaping how companies attract workers,"By Stanley White and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Misaki Harada wants to quit her job as a receptionist at a restaurant management company in Tokyo and move into marketing for an apparel maker. 
But the 24-year-old said she wanted more than just a bigger paycheck. Her next employer would need to improve her quality of life.
""If you ask me whether I prefer more money or more flexible working hours, I would choose more flexible working hours,"" she said. ""I want to get married soon and start a family. I want to make sure I have time to take care of my children."" 
As Japan's population dwindles, its companies are being forced to change how they attract job seekers like Harada from an ever-shrinking labor pool.
Nationwide, there are 1.62 jobs available for every job seeker, the strongest demand for labor in more than 44 years. The jobless rate is 2.4 percent, near a 25-year low, and real wages adjusted for inflation have fallen in five of the past six years.
Flexible working hours, personal benefits like day care and even rent assistance are now on the table alongside salary.
Such perks, common in the United States and Europe, are only just catching on Japan, which until recently relied on a culture of complete devotion to an employer in exchange for job security and steady pay increases.
Toyota, for instance, opened a 24-hour day care facility in April for shift workers at its plants near its headquarters in Toyota City.
""Japanese companies are becoming more flexible about when and where you work,"" said Toshiaki Matsumoto, chief executive of HR Strategy, a human resources consultancy.
Some companies, like Jtekt Corp (T:6473), the world's biggest supplier of vehicle steering systems, are simply moving some of their operations away from competition.
Jtekt last year cut the ribbon on a new technology development center in Akita Prefecture, northern Japan, known more for its rice, sake and namesake dog breed than engineering. The facility, which will develop technology for self-driving cars, is far from other companies hiring into the industry.
So far the company, a key supplier of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), has hired about 20 engineers and plans to roughly double its workforce by the end of the year.
""In larger cities, it's difficult to get across the message that we are hiring because we're competing with many companies for the same talent,"" said Fukami Imai, the center's representative director. 
Denso Corp (T:6902), another Toyota supplier, took the opposite route, moving part of its self-driving research program to Tokyo because it is a more attractive locale than its headquarters in gritty Nagoya.
""Some companies are offering free food or subsidizing rent so workers can shorten commuting time,"" Matsumoto said. ""Some companies even provide counseling and time off for couples trying to conceive."" 
FORCED TO ADAPT
Japan's working-age population peaked in 1995 at 87 million and is forecast to fall to 45 million by 2065. Businesses slow to respond to that demographic change have been hit hard.
Silicon Technology, a semiconductor material maker, is running one rural plant at half-capacity because it can't hire enough workers. Toyobo Co Ltd (T:3101) said it needs to ramp up production of film used in flat-panel displays, but can't fully staff the production line. 
Keeping employees from quitting - and not just throwing money at the problem - is another crucial piece of the labor puzzle, experts say.
""My new employer paid me more money, but the working hours were awful,"" said Daisuke Okamoto, 42, an accountant who left a job in advertising in April for a position at a consumer goods company. ""At first, I had a lot of regret. Now the company has given me more flexible working hours and the freedom to occasionally work from home, so I feel better about the job.""
Daikisangyo, which assembles plane fuselages and wings for  Boeing Co  (N:BA), was having trouble retaining new employees. Then it introduced a mentoring program that reduced turnover to zero, at least for now. 
""It's not just about the money anymore,"" said Tsuyoshi Saso, a manager at Interworks, a nationwide recruitment site for jobs in manufacturing. ""They also want to work in a positive work environment with good colleagues.""
CHANGING THE WORKFORCE
Foreign workers can help fill some of the gaps, although they make up only about 2 percent of the current labor force, and companies hiring for ""unskilled"" positions like farm work must rely on trainees under an internship program that lasts up to five years.
The government has said it will create new categories for foreign workers with more limited skills, but will issue only a small number of such visas. 
Mazda Motor Corp's (T:7261) suppliers, which typically operate independently, are cooperating to figure out the best way to use artificial intelligence and robots to remove human workers from the equation altogether.
""Our goal is to create unmanned production lines that can operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,"" said Masato Uno, chairman of the Hiroshima Manufacturing Engineering Association, a consortium of Mazda suppliers and IT companies. ""We expect this to address problems with productivity and labor shortages.""

360,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 03:43AM ET</span>",Fed Expected to Back Gradual Rate Hikes Despite Trump Criticism,"Investing.com - While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold when it announces its decision at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT) Wednesday, it will likely emphasize its plans to continue with gradual rate hikes this year, despite recent criticism from President Donald Trump.
Trump told CNBC that he was “not thrilled” about the Fed’s tightening of monetary policy in excerpts of an interview aired on July 19.
“I don’t like all of this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,” he explained, although he added that he was “letting them do what they feel is best.”
Markets expect the Fed to keep rates steady at 1.75%-2.00% at Wednesday’s decision, but are pricing in the FOMC’s self-professed intention to gradually hike with another increase forecast for September and the probability for an additional increase in December hovering around 70%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The Fed has already hiked twice in 2018 and increased interest rates a total of seven times since December 2015.
Data Supports Plans for Gradual Hikes
Recent data lent support to the central bank’s intentions, with second-quarter growth at 4.1%, its strongest rate in nearly four years.
Data released Tuesday showed that the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, remained steady at 1.9% in June, hovering just below the central bank’s 2% target.
Labor market data have been strong, with economists forecasting the July jobless rate to drop back to 3.9% when the report is released this Friday.
The diminishing slack in the labor market is expected to increase wages, providing upward inflationary pressure. Indeed, the most recent Fed Beige Book - which shows current economic conditions in the 12 Federal Reserve districts - noted growing signs that companies were “raising compensation to attract and retain employees”.
Thawing Trade Tensions May Reinforce Fed Position
Fed chairman Jerome Powell told Congress on July 17 that it was “difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy,” but insisted that the risk of the economy unexpectedly weakening was roughly balanced with the possibility of the economy growing faster than the Fed anticipated.
“The best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Powell stated.
Add in the fact that trade tensions seem to be thawing after the European Union and the U.S. agreed to study ways to do away with tariffs and other trade barriers.
On Tuesday, it was further reported that the U.S. and China were working to restart talks aimed at avoiding a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
Although Wednesday’s decision, unaccompanied by economic projections or a press conference from Powell, is not anticipated to change the Fed’s playbook, the central bank may choose to reinforce its position.
“A rapid economic expansion, above-target inflation and a slice of better news on trade could mean a more forceful statement of intent from the Federal Reserve,” ING economists said."

Measures to restrict the sale, marketing and distribution of CFDs to retail clients put forward by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) apply across the EU from Aug. 1.
The FCA said it was ""concerned"" that firms may consider getting around ESMA's measures by selling other similarly complex or highly-leveraged products to retail clients.
The watchdog said it would work with ESMA and other European regulators to monitor and assess the sale of these alternative products and push for further regulation if it found evidence that these products were causing similar harm.
It drew particular attention to one product with comparable features to CFDs, known as Turbo Certificates, which allow investors to make leveraged returns to the upside and the downside of the price of the underlying asset.
""ESMA makes clear that firms ""should pay particular attention to the leverage made available to retail clients and consider whether the product is offered on terms that act in the best interests of the client"", the FCA said in a statement.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian farmers, suffering from a second year of drought, are unlikely to benefit from a U.S.-China trade war because of lower production of key crops including wheat and sorghum, traders and industry officials said on Wednesday.
The withering dry spell across Australia's east coast is expected to reduce wheat crop yields in the world's fourth largest exporter of the grain. It has already hit summer crops such as sorghum, where China is a major buyer.
""The area of Australia that has been dealt the hardest blow by drought is the sorghum producing area,"" said Nick Carracher, head of Asia Commodities Advisory Platform at INTL FCStone.
China is looking to boost grain and oilseed imports from alternative regions after imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans amid an escalating trade spat between the two biggest economies.
Dry weather in other key producing areas of Europe and the Black Sea has already driven up wheat prices, while China's wheat output is also expected to fall.. Chicago wheat prices are up 11 percent in the past three weeks.
""Price is almost irrelevant to seasonal conditions given how bad it is in the north,"" said Carracher.
SEVERE DROUGHT
Australia's last winter, which runs from June to August, was the warmest since records began more than a century ago and also one of the 10 driest ever, sapping moisture ahead of this year's planting.
This year the weather has improved in parts of Western Australia but winter rain has gone missing across much of eastern Australia, with rainfall at or near record low levels across vast tracts of the country.
Australia is expected to produce around 20 million tonnes of wheat this year, traders said, down from last year's 21.2 million tonnes and below a record 31.8 million tonnes in 2016/17.
Some forecasters say the harvest could fall as low as 13 million tonnes without rain in the next few months.
China's state planner has discussed ways of reducing soymeal levels in animal feed with top feed makers as Beijing tries to help its farmers cope with lower supplies from the United States.
However, sorghum production in Australia fell to just 994,000 tonnes last year, around half of typical national production, official data shows.
This year's crop will depend on summer rains in November and December, but there may be less available for export, said a grain broker on the sidelines of an industry conference in Melbourne.
""There will be big domestic consumption for the animal feed as grass-fed cows turn to grains,"" he said.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>","BOJ says rising female, senior workers keeping inflation low","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - An increase in the number of women and seniors entering the job market and a push by companies to streamline operations through automation are keeping Japan's wages and inflation from rising significantly, the central bank said on Wednesday.
Companies and households are also showing no signs that they are more accepting of price hikes, as prolonged periods of deflation have made them accustomed to low wage and price growth, the Bank of Japan said.
""A rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations has been lagging behind,"" the BOJ said in a quarterly report on the economic and price outlook.
At a two-day rate review that ended on Tuesday, the BOJ cut its price forecasts and took steps to make its massive stimulus program more sustainable on the view it will take longer than expected to meet its 2 percent target.
In a full version of its quarterly report on the economic and price outlook released on Wednesday, the BOJ pointed to several structural factors that may be behind Japan's stubbornly low inflation.
Among them was a rise in female and senior part-time workers, who tend to join the job market in greater numbers than men for the same rate of wage increases and thus suppress overall wage gains, the BOJ said.
Surveys also showed there have been no clear signs that households are becoming more accepting of price hikes in recent years, despite the country's solid economic growth, it said.
Such cost-sensitive households are discouraging companies from raising price hikes, particularly those in the retail, service, hotel and restaurant industries, the BOJ said.
Many firms in such industries are coping with intense labor shortages not through wage hikes but investment in automation, another factor keeping inflation low, it said.
""Productivity of Japanese firms is relatively low and there is significant room to raise productivity, mainly in the non-manufacturing sector,"" the BOJ said, adding that Japan's labor productivity is only 60 to 70 percent of the U.S. level.
While such structural factors will weigh on inflation in the near-term, their effect will gradually dissipate as the economy continues to expand, the BOJ said.

""While it may take more time than expected, Japan will see inflation gradually accelerate toward 2 percent,"" it said.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary says U.S. trade talks not a prelude to FTA,"By Linda Sieg and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Talks next week between Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are not a prelude to a two-way free trade agreement (FTA), Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Wednesday.
Nishimura also told Reuters in an interview that Japan did not intend to set numerical targets on either exports or imports.
The Aug. 9 talks in Washington come as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration explores raising tariffs on foreign auto imports, including those from Japan, a step that officials say would do serious damage to the two economies and world trade.
The United States is a major market for Japan's automakers, which produced 3.8 million vehicles at their U.S. plants in 2017, roughly one-third of the 12 million total units produced in the country each year.
An additional 1.7 million vehicles were exported from Japan last year.
Trump wants a two-way trade pact as a way to reduce America's trade deficit with Japan but Tokyo is wary of FTA talks because they would increase pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture.
""Japan does not desire an FTA and these talks are not at all preliminary discussions on an FTA,"" Nishimura said.
Nishimura reiterated that Japan would keep trying to persuade Washington to return to a multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership pact abandoned by Trump soon after he took office last year. However, he acknowledged that Washington's preference was for bilateral deals.
""We will be looking for the best path for both the United States and Japan,"" Nishimura said.
He repeated that Japan was expected to increase imports of liquefied natural gas from America and buy U.S. military gear needed for its defense. Japanese firms want to invest in the robust U.S. market and Japan wants to support that, he said.
However, Nishimura ruled out setting a numerical limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, a tactic taken during trade wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the 1995 launch of the World Trade Organization, which generally bans such steps.
""Whether it's exports or imports, we will not set numerical targets,"" Nishimura said. ""The fundamental thing is to maintain free and fair trade.""
Nishimura declined to say what steps Japan would take if Washington raised its tariffs on auto imports.
""Raising tariffs on autos would have a big impact on the world economy and would be a big minus for the American economy, so we want to talk firmly so that does no happen,"" he said.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:09AM ET</span>",Mexican officials optimistic about NAFTA news in coming days,"By Tom Miles and Frank Jack Daniel
GENEVA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican negotiators are optimistic about the possibility of getting a NAFTA deal and are hopeful of progress in coming days, the country's deputy economy minister said ahead of a second ministerial meeting in Washington later this week. 
""You are going to see hopefully news coming out of Washington in the next few days. There is optimism,"" Juan Carlos Baker, deputy economy minister and member of the NAFTA negotiating team, said on Tuesday. 
""I would say that we realized there might be conditions for getting a NAFTA deal,"" he said in Geneva, where he met other trade allies to discuss possible responses to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to unilaterally impose tariffs on car imports.
Stop-start talks to renegotiate NAFTA have dragged on for more than a year, with similar moments of optimism in the past. The talks recently suffered a setback when Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs, triggering retaliation from Mexico and Canada, and followed by his threat to target cars next. 
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said sticking points in the NAFTA negotiations that restarted between Mexico and the United States last week include dispute resolution, auto sector rules and a U.S. proposal to scrap the $1 trillion trade deal if it is not renegotiated every five years.
Guajardo, who has said in recent days he thought the outline of a deal could be agreed in August, is due in Washington to talk with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday.
Jesus Seade, the chief NAFTA negotiator for Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, told French television on Tuesday he thought a final agreement could be ratified by the new U.S. Congress after the November U.S. mid-term elections.
Mexico, the United States and Canada have been trying to forge a revamped version of the 1994 trade pact since last year at the behest of Trump, who says he wants a better deal for U.S. business and workers.
Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is not taking part in the current round of talks, as Mexico and the United States try to thrash out an agreement on including more North American content in autos made in the region, and possibly increasing wages. 
There are signs Mexico has shown some flexibility since it offered in May to raise the content requirement to 70 percent from a current 62.5 percent. The United States is asking for the threshold to be 75 percent. 
""We are going to give serious consideration to all the ideas presented, we are going to be flexible if that is possible,"" Baker said, adding that talks were focused on several issues at once, not only autos. 
Two industry sources in Mexico said an informal offer had been made to raise the content threshold a little higher, although a government official with knowledge of the talks denied that was Mexico's proposal.
Bloomberg on Tuesday reported the U.S. and Mexico were in final stages of negotiating a deal on auto rules, saying the two sides had exchanged new proposals.
Lighthizer's office denied the absence of Freeland from the latest round of talks was an attempt to negotiate a bilateral NAFTA with Mexico. 
""In addition to the trilateral meetings, throughout the renegotiation of NAFTA there have been numerous bilateral meetings,"" said USTR spokeswoman Emily Davis.
A Canadian government official, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the situation, said there had been no chance of Freeland traveling to Washington since she was scheduled to attend a meeting in Singapore this week.
AUTO TARIFFS
Mexico's Baker had met with senior trade officials from Canada, Japan, South Korea and the European Union in Geneva, which is also home to the World Trade Organization.
The countries -- long term U.S. allies at odds with Trump over trade relations -- were all determined to respond if tariffs on cars were imposed under a national security investigation, he said, noting the U.S. process to introduce such tariffs had not halted despite U.S.-European talks last week that were supposed to have seen off the immediate threat.
Last week European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he had secured a ""major concession"" from President Donald Trump, having agreed that as long as the two sides were negotiating on trade, they would hold off on imposing further measures, including U.S. tariffs on cars and auto parts.

""Until that process is fully concluded and no tariffs are imposed, we need to be serious and consider the possibility that those tariffs may be established. We need to make clear that we are prepared to react,"" Baker said.

367,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Fed to Discuss When to Pause Gradual Hikes: Decision Day Guide,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled the U.S. central bank could take a break from increasing interest rates at some point. His colleagues are now debating how quickly to consider such a pause.
The Federal Open Market Committee is almost certain to keep rates steady at the close of its two-day meeting Wednesday in Washington, and will reinforce bets on a move in September if it repeats a reference to further gradual rate hikes in the accompanying policy statement.
Pricing in federal funds futures contracts show almost zero expectation for a move at this meeting versus a probability a little above 80 percent in September.
Powell told Congress on July 17 that gradual rate moves were the plan “for now,” which is the kind of qualifier the committee could add to its statement to hint at a future breather in the tightening campaign.
“Given that there’s no visible inflation threat -- not in the data and not in the FOMC forecasts -- it makes sense to inject conditionality on future moves,” said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is a partner at Washington-based consultancy Cornerstone Macro LLC. “So the ‘for now’ language seems appropriate and seems likely to make it into the statement, if not this time, soon.”
The Fed is trying to keep the U.S. economic expansion on track after growth was buoyed by strong consumer spending in the second quarter following tax cuts, and as it closes in on the central bank’s twin goals: Stable prices, which it defines as 2 percent inflation, and maximum employment.
Policy makers are close on inflation after undershooting their target for years, and are arguably already past the level of long-term sustainable full employment, with the jobless rate at 4 percent in June. They’ve raised rates twice this year and have two more moves penciled in for 2018, according to forecasts that officials updated in June.
The FOMC is also considering changing its description of monetary policy from “accommodative” to something closer to neutral, the committee indicated in minutes of its June meeting. But with Powell not scheduled to brief the media on Wednesday, the easiest course would be to keep the statement’s guidance nearly identical to its June meeting.
“I don’t expect any major change in the message because Powell will not be holding a press conference to clarify it,” said Ward McCarthy, Jefferies LLC chief financial economist. “They do seem to be trying to update where they are on the policy normalization path, and that’s going to be a communications challenge.”
Powell’s next scheduled press conference will be after the FOMC meeting on Sept. 26.
The FOMC has pegged a neutral funds rate -- the rate that neither promotes nor holds back growth -- at 2.9 percent, according to their median estimate in June. But there’s considerable uncertainty around that projection, and the Fed’s monetary policy report in July includes estimates that would suggest they’re already very close to that level.
The possibility of a pause reflects a split in the committee’s June forecasts, with eight participants favoring at least two more rate hikes this year, but seven favoring one or none.
A flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve adds urgency to the discussion. Fed presidents James Bullard of St. Louis, Raphael Bostic of Atlanta and Neel Kashkari of Minneapolis have raised concern that being too aggressive on rate hikes could invert the curve.
That happens when yields on short-dated securities rise above long-term ones and an inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession in the last 50 years.
While the FOMC updates its statement each meeting describing conditions, changes might be modest since the June statement was already upbeat, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
While inflation by the Fed’s preferred measure was 2.2 percent in June -- with core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 1.9 percent -- the FOMC is likely to be somewhat concerned.
“As inflation has fallen short of 2 percent for more than six years, inflation can also be allowed to run above the Fed’s objective for a number of years and is expected to do so by at least a number of Fed members,” Piegza said.
There will be a shift among voters this meeting. The San Francisco Fed is looking for a new president after former chief John Williams relocated in June to run the New York branch. As a result, Kansas City’s Esther George will cast San Francisco’s FOMC vote until a new leader has been installed, though interim president Mark Gould will attend the meeting and speak on its behalf.
George, one of the most hawkish FOMC participants, recently endorsed continued gradual rate hikes, while saying an inverted yield curve may not necessarily be an economic signal.

TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump defended his trade policies on Tuesday in a speech in Florida and said American farmers hurt by retaliatory tariffs from China were bearing up, in a sign he is feeling some political heat on the issue.
Trump's rally speech in Tampa contained many elements familiar to his political events. Several hecklers were ejected and the crowd at the state fairgrounds was big and loud. Trump attacked public opinion polls, except one that said he was popular among Republicans.
The president, in Florida to campaign for Republican Governor Rick Scott's bid for a U.S. Senate seat and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis' campaign for governor, said he could tame his raucous presidential style if he wanted.
“I can be more presidential than any president in history except for maybe Abe Lincoln with the big hat,” Trump said. “I admit it, Abe Lincoln is tough.”
The president spent considerable time talking about his trade policies, including tit-for-tat tariffs with China that he said would eventually pay dividends for the United States.
The tariffs are causing unease among Republican lawmakers facing tough re-election battles in November, and Trump's focus on them suggested he was concerned about their potential political impact.
China and other top U.S. trade partners zeroed in on American farmers with retaliatory tariffs after the administration imposed duties on Chinese goods as well as steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
""China and others have targeted our farmers. Not good. Not nice. And you know what our farmers are saying? 'It’s OK. We can take it,'"" Trump said.
The Trump administration announced a $12 billion farm aid package last week, prompting some farmers and farm-state lawmakers, including Trump’s fellow Republicans, to criticize the move, saying they would rather trade with no tariffs than receive government help.
""I want to thank our farmers,"" Trump said. ""Our farmers are true patriots.""
Trump also defended the denuclearization deal he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June in Singapore after reports surfaced that North Korea was proceeding with its missile program.
The Singapore summit was long on positive imagery but short on specific benchmarks for North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.
Trump said the fact that North Korea was starting to return the remains of American dead from the 1950s Korean War and that there had been no nuclear or missile tests were offshoots of the summit.""I think it's going to work out very well,"" he said. ""No tests, no rockets flying. But we'll see what happens.""

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>","India's central bank, in a tight spot, is expected to raise rates again","By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India is likely to raise interest rates on Wednesday while retaining a neutral policy stance as it aims to strike a balance between rising inflationary pressures and still recovering growth.
If the RBI increases the rates by 25 basis points, it would be the first time since October 2013 that the central bank has hiked borrowing costs at two consecutive policy meetings.
In June, the repo rate , or the benchmark lending rate, was raised for the first time in over four years, by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent.
Thirty-seven of 63 economists in a Reuters poll last week said the RBI will raise rates n Wednesday, while 22 said the next hike would come later this year, or early in 2019. [ECILT/IN]
""Since the RBI is committed to bringing down inflation, they don't have a choice but to raise rates,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings.
""The RBI did not change its policy stance in June due to the various uncertainties they faced and the degree of uncertainty has gone up considerably compared to the last policy, so they would continue to retain the neutral stance,"" she said.
India's annual consumer inflation  hit 5 percent in June, the eighth straight month it topped the RBI's medium-term 4 percent target.
Global crude oil prices have surged nearly 20 percent this year and crossed $80 a barrel in May, their highest since 2014. 
This has driven the prices of fuel - the biggest item on India's import bill - to record highs at a time the rupee is testing new life lows, raising the threat of imported inflation.
CLOSE CALL
Moreover, the monsoons, one of the largest determinants of India's inflation path, have been erratic and patchy in several regions this year, muddying the outlook for winter-harvested crops and adding to inflationary pressures.
Still, a sizable numbers of analysts and market participants believe the RBI could hold off and not hike interest rates, noting that the recovery is nascent and bank credit to corporates is not yet free flowing.
The monetary policy committee ""could afford to do a 'wait and watch' at this juncture and consider more data points before a rate action,"" said Lakshmi Iyer, Kotak Mutual Fund's chief investment officer debt.
""There might not be much urgency in delivering back-to-back rate hikes when the policy stance is still neutral.""
Traders said though the market was largely prepared for a rate hike on Wednesday, yields would still shoot up by 5-10 basis points after one, and the surge would be much more if the RBI also tightens its stance.

Wednesday's decision is ""likely to be a close call, with odds of a hike marginally higher than a pause,"" said DBS economist Radhika Rao. ""While the tentative calm in the financial markets provides the RBI with the time and space to keep rates on hold, a pre-emptive move is preferable.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England should raise interest rates this week but also tell the public it will be ready to make a U-turn if Brexit talks sour or trade tensions with the United States escalate, a leading economic think tank said on Wednesday.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) stuck to its forecast for British economic growth of 1.4 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year, though this assumes a softer Brexit than Prime Minister Theresa May is aiming for.
The BoE should raise rates on Thursday for only the second time since the global financial crisis, as even the modest economic growth ahead is likely to generate inflation, it said.
""However, we think the Bank should emphasize the uncertainty of the future path for the policy rate,"" NIESR economist Amit Kara said.
""It is entirely possible that in three months' time, because of the Brexit negotiations, because of the trade wars or some other reason, the August rate increase could look like a mistake,"" Kara added.
Holding off on a rate move now was not an option as the uncertainty was unlikely to lift, Kara said.
However, a separate article published by NIESR on Wednesday, by former BoE policymaker David Blanchflower and fellow academic David Bell, said wage growth ""is not going to take off any time soon"", due to high levels of under-employment.
To date, the BoE has said it expects interest rates to rise at a gradual and limited pace, assuming Brexit goes smoothly. BoE Governor Mark Carney has also said rates could be cut in some scenarios if there is a disorderly Brexit.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 next year, but May has not finalised a transitional deal and her ministers agreed on negotiating demands for a longer-term trade relationship only in July - more than two years after Britain voted to leave the EU.
NIESR said May's plan was likely to cost 2.5 percent of economic output relative to a softer Brexit under which Britain would have trade ties to the EU similar to Norway's. That was equivalent to about 500 pounds ($656) per person per year over time.
May has rejected a Norway-style agreement as offering Britain too little control over EU immigration and laws.
A 'no deal' Brexit -- favored by lawmakers in May's Conservative Party if the EU will not make enough concessions -- would cost 800 pounds.

Both estimates look only at the short-term costs of a loss of trade with the EU, and do not estimate the likely longer-term hit to productivity as businesses face less foreign competition.

However, the gap is expected to widen over the next two fiscal years as the city is required to allocate more revenue toward pension funding.
A chronic deficit along with a big unfunded pension liability have led to low credit ratings and high borrowing costs for the nation's third-largest city.
“In 2012, our structural budget deficit was $635 million and all four of Chicago’s pension funds were on the road to insolvency,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. “Today, the city’s finances are in a much different place."" 
Chicago has taken big steps in recent years to shore up its four employee retirement systems by hiking property taxes for its police and fire fighter funds, levying a new tax on water and sewer usage for its municipal workers’ fund, and increasing a telephone surcharge for its laborers’ fund.
The unfunded pension liability fell to $28 billion this year from $35 billion the prior year, according to city officials.
Under Illinois law, the city must make actuarially determined contributions to its police and fire funds starting in 2020. The analysis shows city payments to its four retirement funds will climb from $1.02 billion this year to $2.13 billion in 2023. 
Chicago Chief Financial Officer Carole Brown said the higher payments should be manageable.
""When you get to 2023, the increased amount year over year is less than 8 percent of our budget,"" she said in an interview.
For the fiscal year that begins on Jan. 1, the analysis pegged operating fund revenue at $3.74 billion, with expenses estimated at $3.84 billion.
Chicago's budget gap is projected to grow to nearly $252 million in fiscal 2020 and $362 million in fiscal 2021, according to the analysis. It noted a squeeze on Chicago's share of state sales taxes, which the city has pledged to pay off debt issued through its new Sales Tax Securitization Corp.
Payments on the city's long-term general obligation and revenue debt, including airport and water and sewer bonds, will climb to just over $2 billion in fiscal 2019 from $1.89 billion this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator said on Tuesday it would start accepting national charter applications from financial technology companies, giving so-called fintech firms a path to federal oversight for the first time.
The move by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will be cheered by the likes of OnDeck Capital Inc (N:ONDK), Kabbage and  LendingClub Corp  (N:LC) because it opens the door to operating nationwide under a single licensing and regulatory regime instead of a patchwork of state licenses.
The decision came hours after the Treasury Department endorsed the approach. Effective immediately, the OCC will accept applications from non-depository fintech companies for a special purpose national bank charter.
The regulator said successful applicants would be supervised similarly to comparable banks, and companies must provide a contingency plan for how they would navigate financial stress that could threaten their operations.
There is no current federal regulatory regime for fintech firms, meaning online lenders must seek licenses in every state they wish to operate, an onerous and expensive process, or partner with traditional banks.
The OCC charter would allow fintech firms to operate independently across the country under a single federal license.
""If they can create a national standard of sorts and harmonize that regulatory burden then that will provide a real benefit to America’s small businesses and hopefully in the long run decrease of the cost of credit,” said Scott Stewart, chief executive of trade group Innovative Lending Platform Association.
A fintech charter was first floated by the OCC in 2016. State regulators have vigorously opposed the idea, saying it exceeds the OCC's statutory authority.
The New York Department of Financial Services and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) unsuccessfully sued the OCC last year to block the charter.
In a statement, the New York regulator said the OCC decision will impose an ""unjustified"" federal regulatory scheme on the state regulatory landscape.
The CSBS did not rule out further litigation. “State regulators are keeping all options open to stop this regulatory overreach,"" the group said in a statement.
The Independent Community Bankers of America has also raised concerns, saying such a charter may allow fintech firms to circumvent tough banking rules.
But the Treasury and many conservative Republicans see promoting fintech as a way to boost small companies and create jobs.
In a report earlier on Tuesday, the Treasury recommended the charter as a way to support non-bank financial institutions and foster technology-driven innovation.
But the Treasury recommended against allowing fintech firms to collect government-insured deposits under such a charter.
The OCC will only accept applications from non-depository firms. This limitation, which aims to reduce risks to taxpayers, could undermine the use of a charter for some fintech firms, according to industry insiders.

Tuesday's report was the last of four by the Treasury as part of a review of financial rules mandated by an executive order from U.S. President Donald Trump in February.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday that short-maturity U.S. Treasuries ""look as good"" relative to stocks and long-maturing bonds than they have in a long time.
Gundlach, known as Wall Street's Bond King, said the tariff threat pulls U.S. economic growth forward, as reflected in second quarter gross domestic product, but ""growth moving ahead will be incrementally weaker."" 
There should also be higher measured inflation as a result of any tariff implementation, Gundlach said. That should mean a steeper Treasury yield curve, though not necessarily in the near term, he added.
Gundlach, who oversees $121 billion in assets under management, said he likes front-pay RMBS (residential mortgage-backed securities) and floating rate CMBS (commercial mortgage-backed securities). 
""There's almost no risk and higher yield than the long bond and about double the dividend yield of the SPX,"" said Gundlach, referring to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (P:SPY). Front-pay RMBS is securitized non-agency RMBS that is tranched sequentially. The front pay is paid first, so the security has a short average life.
Gundlach, closely watched by investors for his bold and often prescient market calls, made waves in April at the Sohn Investment Conference when he recommended a pair trade of shorting, or betting against,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) while betting on gains in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks oil-and-gas explorers and producers who could benefit from rising inflation. 
Last week, Facebook shares plunged more than 20 percent as the social network missed projections on revenue and global daily active users this quarter after struggling with data leaks and fake news scandals.
In April, Gundlach said the worst likely is not over for Facebook, saying it is not unprecedented for equity bubbles being ended by regulation. Facebook’s strengths are being redefined as weaknesses, he said. ""We hear the good things about Facebook, which is 2.2 billion users,"" Gundlach said. ""I hear 2.2 billion compliance breaches.""

Gundlach said about last week's Facebook second-quarter earnings results: ""The fundamentals today are no different than they were April 23rd. It is the interpretation that has changed. Exactly what I talked about in my (Sohn) presentation. And I expect the interpretation will get far worse.""

374,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Trump's Outreach to Rogues Follows in Obama's Footsteps,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There was a time in Washington when the establishments in both major parties believed that a meeting with a U.S. president was something a foreign adversary had to earn. Unless concessions are offered and conditions are met, the leader of the free world should avoid parleys with rogues. Think of George W. Bush's refusal for America to enter nuclear talks with Iran until it stopped uranium enrichment.
This was a hot button issue back in 2007 and 2008 when an upstart Democratic senator named Barack Obama proposed that if elected president, he would meet with leaders of Iran, Cuba and North Korea in his first year. His opponents pounced. Hillary Clinton said she wouldn't want a meeting with such dictators to be ""used for propaganda purposes.""
In his recent memoir, Obama's deputy national security adviser and speechwriter, Ben Rhodes, described the reaction to hiscritics from inside the bubble. The campaign team was reading a news story in which Madeleine Albright, formerly Bill Clinton's secretary of state, criticized Obama's naive offer. Obama responded, according to Rhodes, by pounding his open palm on a table to emphasize every syllable: ""It. Is. Not. A. Reward. To. Talk. To. Folks.""
Fast forward to 2018 and it's fair to say that Trump takes the Obama view of talking to bad guys. After all, Trump met North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un in Singapore. He met with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. If aliens threatened to vaporize Los Angeles, Trump would first tweet some threats and insults and then a few days later propose a summit on a neighboring planet.
Now the president says he is open to talks with Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, without preconditions. “If they want to meet, I’ll meet,"" he said at a joint press conference with Italy's prime minister.
Anyone who has paid close attention to Trump's Iran policy should not be surprised. As I wrote last week, Trump has consistently said he wants to negotiate a new deal with Iran's leaders now that he has withdrawn the U.S. from the one negotiated by Obama.
What is interesting is not the desire for a meeting, but rather its potential substance. Trump says he has no preconditions for a meeting. However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo proposed some when asked about this Monday by CNBC.
“If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it’s worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation,"" Pompeo said. ""Then the president has said he is prepared to sit down and have the conversation with him.”
With that mention of how the Tehran regime abuses its own people, Pompeo added a new requirement to his own list of preconditions for talks. In a May 21 speech laying out U.S. demands for Iran, he focused on the regime's support for terror, missile testing and nuclear program. Even a speech earlier this month at the Reagan library, which highlighted the stolen wealth of Iran's leaders, did not link the regime's treatment of its own citizens to U.S. outreach.
The questions here are whether Trump would go ahead with direct talks even if Iran meets none of Pompeo's stipulations, and whether he would bring up these issues if he did so.
There is also an irony to Trump's desire to talk with rogues. In his two terms, Obama largely made good on his campaign promise. He traveled to Cuba and met with Raul Castro. He hit the reset button with Russia. He helped bring Myanmar into the community of nations. And while he pressed Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013 for a face-to-face meeting at the United Nations, he had to settle for a phone call.
Now Obama's successor, who withdrew the U.S. from his nuclear deal, wants a meeting with the man who denied one to Obama.
Given the Tehran regime's current legitimacy crisis, it's a possibility. Rouhani is desperate. Even before severe sanctions on Iran's oil exports and banking system formally kick in, the value of the rial is in free fall. The demonstrations and strikes that began late last year continue to roil Iran's ruling class. A meeting with Trump could be a lifeline to an Iranian president who has failed to deliver the prosperity and reforms he promised in his campaigns in 2013 and 2017.
Whatever happens, it's a moment worth marking. Eleven years ago, Washington's foreign policy establishment believed U.S. presidents shouldn't meet with foreign adversaries until they changed their malign behavior. Obama as a candidate challenged that consensus and as a president he changed it. Trump this week was just following his lead."

The rand fell.
This will be done to promote redress, advance economic development, increase agricultural production and food security, the African National Congress said in an emailed statement after after a meeting of its National Executive Committee in Pretoria, the capital.
Lawmakers started a process to change the constitution to allow for expropriation without compensation in February after the ANC decided last year to adopt the measure as a policy to speed up giving black people more land. Access to land is one of the symbols of inequality in the nation of about 56 million where wealth and poverty are largely divided along racial lines.
Public hearings about the proposal started last month.
“The lekgotla reaffirmed its position that a comprehensive land reform program that enables equitable access to land will unlock economic growth, by bringing more land in South Africa to full use, and enable the productive participation of millions more South Africans in the economy,” the ANC said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Mexico is still preparing all options to respond to possible U.S. tariffs on car imports, Deputy Economy Minister Juan Carlos Baker said on Tuesday, despite U.S.-European talks last week that were supposed to have seen off the immediate threat.
Last week European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he had secured a ""major concession"" from President Donald Trump, having agreed that as long as the two sides were negotiating on trade, they would hold off on imposing further measures, including U.S. tariffs on cars and auto parts.
Baker was speaking after meeting senior trade officials from Canada, Japan, South Korea and the European Union in Geneva, which is also home to the World Trade Organization.
The countries -- long term U.S. allies which are at odds with Trump over trade relations -- were not coordinating their response, Baker told reporters. However, they were all determined to respond if tariffs on cars were imposed, he said, noting that the U.S. process to introduce them had not stopped.
""We take that very seriously. Until that process is fully concluded and no tariffs are imposed, we need to be serious and consider the possibility that those tariffs may be established. We need to make clear that we are prepared to react,"" he said.
Over several hours of talks at the EU mission, the five powers -- all of them hit by Trump's steel tariffs imposed in March, and concerned about his disruption of the WTO -- also discussed reform of the 23-year-old trading club.
Trump is demanding a shake-up of the WTO, saying it treats the United States unfairly and gives China undue advantages.
To force the issue, he has brought the WTO's system for settling international trade disputes to the brink of collapse by blocking the appointment of judges when the terms of others expire, a situation that diplomats and trade officials have described as hostage taking and the ""asphyxiation"" of the WTO. 
Baker said there were several sets of reform ideas on the table for the WTO and he was encouraged. ""We would not be doing this if we believed the process is doomed to fail,"" he said. ""We all feel the sense of urgency here. We do not necessarily have a due date… but the sooner we start the better.""
Proposals are likely to be polished in the next few months, including at meetings of the G20 major economies, an APEC forum of Pacific rim countries, and at a Canadian-hosted meeting in October. A trade ministers' meeting in Davos in January would be an important moment to take stock of progress, he said. 

""Today was only a very initial, incipient discussion but I believe it was good in terms of knowing how much running round we have ahead of us.""

379,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>","Iran’s Zarif Tells Trump to ‘Try Respect’ Instead of Threats, Sanctions","(Bloomberg) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif pushed back on U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that he’d be willing to meet President Hassan Rouhani with “no preconditions,” saying the two countries spent plenty of time in negotiations already.
“Iran and US had 2 yrs of talks,” Zarif wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “With EU/E3+Russia+China, we produced a unique multilateral accord—the JCPOA,” he added, referencing the 2015 accord that eased some economic sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program.
Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in May, saying it didn’t address the Islamic Republic’s malign behavior in the Middle East and would eventually allow Iran to resume enrichment activities. The move was broadly criticized internationally, including by U.S. allies France, Germany and the U.K.
Now the U.S. is preparing to sanction countries whose companies continue to import Iranian oil. And in a sign of the escalating rhetoric between Washington and Tehran, the president said on Twitter last week that the U.S. won’t tolerate Iran’s “DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH,” a reference to comments that Iran’s leader made to Trump.
The nuclear deal has “been working,” Zarif wrote. “US can only blame itself for pulling out & leaving the table. Threats, sanctions & PR stunts won’t work. Try respect: for Iranians & for int’l commitments.”
Despite the rising tensions, the administration on Monday sent mixed signals on its openness to high-level talks with Iran. Trump told reporters at the White House that “I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet.” Hours later, administration officials appeared to walk that statement back, suggesting there actually are preconditions.
“If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it’s worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he’s prepared to sit down and have the conversation with them,” Pompeo said.

381,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Housing’s Headwinds Are Getting Stiffer,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Expectations were approaching ebullience heading into this spring’s U.S. home selling season. The National Association of Realtors entered the year expecting home sales to grow by 3.7 percent in 2018 after last year’s lackluster 1.1 percent increase. But now, the NAR’s chief economist has tempered his call with existing homes changing hands at the slowest pace since September and new home sales having fallen to the lowest level since October 2017.
With home prices at or near record highs, it takes more than a small boost to income to call potential buyers to action. The average household has to save for almost six-and-a-half years to cover a 20 percent down payment on a home at current prices, according to a recent study by Zillow HotPads. That’s based on the steep assumption that workers can sock away 20 percent of their monthly take home pay. Saving money is especially tough for renters. Zillow calculated last year that just 42 percent of rentals were affordable, defined as requiring 30 percent or less of one's median monthly income to cover rent payments. 
Perhaps reflecting the affordability obstacles, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence data for July released Tuesday showed that plans to buy a home in the next six months tumbled to the lowest level since June 2016.
The cost to rent and buy has become particularly acute in major markets, especially if you prefer a home to an apartment. Renting a three-bedroom house is more expensive than buying a median-priced home in 54 percent of major markets, according to ATTOM Data Solutions. The average three-bedroom runs renters 38.8 percent of their annual income.
There are other factors that have hamstrung the housing market in 2018 besides record high home prices. Mortgage rates for 30-year fixed loans are up by more than 0.8 percentage point on average. Separately, the new tax law limits all state and local income taxes and property taxes that can be deducted to $10,000. 
Affordability is even more elusive among middle-tier income earners, who tend to be in the market for move-up homes after they’ve outgrown their starter home. And that’s in second-tier markets. In the nation’s costliest cities, median home prices often exceed the wherewithal of most regardless of how much they make. In San Francisco, average home prices exceed $1.6 million.
Let’s take the example of moving from what Zillow classifies as the middle-third of homes nationwide, which is the median price we always hear quoted of $217,300, up to what Zillow categorizes as the top-third of homes by price nationwide, the median price of which is $380,100. Those are what many realtors would call “move-up” homes.
For the sake of simple illustration, let’s compare the rate two years ago to what it is today for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Back then, the rate was (assuming no points) 3.63 percent compared with 4.75 percent today. The monthly payment for a couple who has just had a second child and wants to upsize would double from about $792 to $1,585. Had mortgage rates stayed where they were two years back, that same payment to move up today would be $1,386. It's no wonder that according to the University of Michigan, buying conditions among middle-tier income earners has fallen out of bed of late. If you have designs on living in a better school district that doesn’t require private school tuition for the tykes, be prepared to pay a hefty premium.
The Bottom of the Housing Market Falls out of the Middle
The protracted decline in top-tier home buying conditions could be a mere starting point that trickles down through the lower tiers. The top third of income earners account for 60 percent of the dollar value of “owned dwellings,” as per the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey. This group, albeit small, has more incentive than ever to stay put or move to a lower-tax state.
Consider a homeowner who bought a home a few years back who locked in a low-rate on a $700,000 mortgage. That home has appreciated to $1 million but interest payments remain about $24,500 a year, or $15,500 when adjusted to a top 37 percent tax rate and principal paid down. If this homeowner upgrades to a $1.2-million abode with a $975,000 mortgage, which takes into account transaction costs, mortgage interest would jump to $45,500. Adjusted for taxes, the marginal cost would be $32,500. 
The alternative to the $17,000 budgetary upcharge is a facelift. For the same homeowner, a maximum of $50,000 would be deductible on a home equity line of credit given they would bump up against the new $750,000 limit. Even so, if the homeowner plunked $100,000 into an upgrade, the tax-adjusted, bottom-line interest increase would only be $4,000.
It would seem mobility will no longer be a hinderance unique to the millennials. The economy has always keyed off residential real estate. Investors would be well-advised to keep housing at the top of their watch lists."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - After one of its toughest years ever, U.S. ""brick and mortar"" retailers are witnessing a rebound and boosting wages for hourly workers and bonuses for senior executives, according to two separate studies released on Tuesday.
Wages have grown for cashiers and retail buyers among others, a sign that a tight labor market is finally translating into base-pay gains for workers at retailers, according to data gathered from millions of U.S. worker salaries by Glassdoor, a job website operator.
A separate study by consultant and executive search firm Korn Ferry showed nearly one-third of retail corporate executives received at least 100 percent of their targeted bonus, more than double the 15 percent during the same period in early 2017. 
A record number of mid-decade store closures and bankruptcy filings, along with rapid growth of online sales, especially at Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), led investors to sour on the sector over the past two years. But stronger-than-expected earnings in the previous three quarters from many department stores, bargain outlets and apparel brands have started to turn things around.
Growth for retailers comes as the U.S. economy expanded in the second quarter at its fastest pace in nearly four years thanks to a boost in consumers spending, much of it by the bottom 60 percent of income earners - a break with a decades-old trend where the top 40 percent primarily fueled consumption growth, a Reuters study found. 
The Glassdoor study shows wages for retail cashiers in July grew by 5.4 percent to $28,145 from a year earlier and rose 2.1 percent to $58,090 annually for retail buyers, who purchase merchandise from manufacturers. 
""Despite weak hiring ... retail jobs experienced pay gains above the national average, likely caused by the increasing demand for workers who specialize in customer service and integrate more technical knowledge,"" Glassdoor chief economist Andrew Chamberlain said in a statement.
Chamberlain said he did not expect wage growth to slow anytime soon as low unemployment spurs competition for workers
Korn Ferry senior partner Craig Rowley told Reuters that the current fiscal year has reversed a five-year trend of fewer executives receiving bonuses. Senior retail executives who received no bonuses grew from 10 percent in 2013 to 29 percent last year but have fallen to 5 percent in 2018, he said.

Rowley said Korn Ferry analyzed data from 65 North American retailers, with median annual sales of approximately $5.2 billion.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",China will strive to hit growth target despite trade tensions with U.S.,"By Kevin Yao and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China will keep its economic growth within a reasonable range and achieve this year's target despite challenges, the state-run Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday as a trade war with the United States intensifies.
The world's second-largest economy has already felt the pinch from Beijing's multi-year deleveraging drive that has driven up corporate borrowing costs and delayed government projects.
Beijing is also aware that friction with the United States over trade is creating uncertainty for its job market, and has pledged not to let the row trigger large-scale unemployment.
In July, growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed more than expected, partly due to the worsening trade dispute with Washington, according to an official poll of Chinese firms on Tuesday.
Earlier in July, the United States had imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and said it could potentially impose levies on an additional $16 billion of shipments. 
Beijing has responded by levying taxes on U.S. products, leading President Donald Trump to threaten tariffs on $500 billion of Chinese goods.
""We must do a good job in stabilizing employment, finance, foreign trade and investment, and expectations,"" Xinhua said, citing a statement released after a meeting of ruling Communist Party's Politburo.
China's economy faces some new problems and new challenges, including ""significant changes in the external environment"", Xinhua cited the Politburo meeting - chaired by President Xi Jinping - as saying.
""We must seize the main contradictions and take targeted measures to solve them,"" it said.
The trade tensions with the United States were not specifically mentioned.
China is ready to respond to any U.S. tariff measures, whether they are tariffs on $16 billion or $500 billion of goods, a Chinese government official said last week.
China's economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter, but was still above the official 2018 growth target of about 6.5 percent.
However, the trade row with Washington, a slowing domestic property market and reduced outbound shipments have sharply increased the risks to China's economic outlook. 
Trade tensions between the two sides have remained taut as Beijing expresses antitrust concerns about a planned takeover by U.S.-based  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) of  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI). 
Qualcomm last week abandoned what would have been the world's biggest ever semiconductor sector takeover after a deadline the companies set passed without the deal winning China's required approval.
SOFTER INDICATORS
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday fell to 51.2 in July, from 51.5 in June and below the 51.3 in a Reuters poll of economists. It was also the lowest index reading since February.
Another survey released by the NBS on Tuesday showed growth in the service sector moderating in July, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipping to 54.0 from 55.0 the previous month.
While Chinese markets reacted little to the softer indicators, the economic moderation points to a more challenging second half in 2018, many economists say.
A widely watched private survey on Wednesday may shed more clues on China's manufacturing sector in July. In June, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell from May.
""We will have a better idea of how the economy has performed recently when the July reading of the Caixin manufacturing PMI, a better guide to cyclical trends than the official index, is published tomorrow,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""But for now, today's data are consistent with our view that China's economy is on track to slow further this quarter and next, triggering additional policy easing.""
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT
China will step up infrastructure investment in targeted areas, support innovations and lower corporate costs, the Politburo was quoted as saying.
Reuters reported last week that Beijing plans to put more money into infrastructure projects and ease borrowing curbs on local governments to support the economy.
Shares in Chinese infrastructure firms have since risen, bucking broad weakness in the stock market. An index tracking major infrastructure firms on the mainland <.CSI300II> has gained about 0.7 percent since Friday. 
China is able to win the battle against various economic risks and challenges and needs to maintain confidence, state radio on Tuesday quoted Xi as saying.
It will better balance its financial risk prevention and support for the real economy, maintaining its deleveraging drive but paying attention to its pace and intensity, it added.
It will ensure the fulfilment of the annual economic growth target, while maintaining a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy to ensure ample liquidly, the agency said.
""Fiscal policy should play a greater role in expanding domestic demand and promoting structural adjustments,"" the Politburo was quoted as saying.
Last week, China's cabinet pledged to make fiscal policy more proactive to help tackle external uncertainties without resorting to strong policy stimulus.

But the Politburo meeting also pledged to ""resolutely curb"" housing price rises and speed the process of establishing a long-term mechanism for the property sector, the agency said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but solid economic growth combined with rising inflation are likely to keep it on track for another two hikes this year even as President Donald Trump has ramped up criticism of its push to raise rates.
The U.S. central bank so far this year has increased borrowing costs in March and June, and investors see additional moves in September and December. Policymakers have raised rates seven times since December 2015.
The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. No press conference is scheduled and only minor changes are anticipated compared with the Fed's June policy statement, which emphasized accelerating economic growth, strong business investment and rising inflation.
""They've got expectations pretty much where they want them,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). ""They may need to finesse how they word the language on inflation, but I think the ultimate message is going to be the same."" 
The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs, Commerce Department data showed on Friday.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation - the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy components- increased at a 2.0 percent pace in the second quarter, the data also showed. The latest monthly figures released on Tuesday showed prices in June were 1.9 percent higher than a year earlier. 
The core PCE hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March for the first time since December 2011.
U.S. labor costs, a key measure of how much slack is left in the market, posted their largest annual gain since 2008 in the second quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
TRUMP CRITICISM
Economic growth has been buoyed by the Trump administration's package of tax cuts and government spending, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said overall the economy is in a ""really good place.""
The unemployment rate stands at 4.0 percent, lower than the level seen sustainable by Fed policymakers. 
The central bank is expected to continue to raise rates through 2019 but policymakers are keenly debating when the so-called ""neutral rate"" - the sweet spot in which monetary policy is neither expansive nor restrictive - will be hit.
Rate setters are closely watching for signs that inflation is accelerating and they are expecting economic growth to slow as the fiscal stimulus fades. 
They also remain wary of the potential effects of a protracted trade war between the United States and China which could push the cost of goods higher and hurt company investment plans. 
The Fed's policy path will see interest rates peak at much lower levels than in previous economic cycles. Even so, Trump, in a departure from usual practice that presidents do not comment on Fed policy, said he was worried growth would be hit by higher rates. 
Administration officials played down the president's comments, saying he was not seeking to influence the Fed.
On the campaign trail, Trump criticized Powell's predecessor as Fed chief, Janet Yellen, for keeping rates too low. 
Trump appointed Powell and Fed Governor Randal Quarles, and he has three other nominees to the rate-setting committee awaiting U.S. Senate confirmation. Almost all have been seen as mainstream in their attitude to economic policy. Economists say Trump has little influence over Fed policy beyond the personnel changes he has already made. 
Trump's tweets are a far cry from the 1970s when then-President Richard Nixon told the Fed chairman to kick rate setters ""in the rump"" to keep rates low until after an election. That stoked inflation and eventually strengthened the Fed's independence, something that has become even more entrenched since.

""Powell is obviously someone who values the Fed's independence,"" said Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics. ""I don't expect them to change tack because of political pressure.""

Thus far, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has only confirmed expectations of two more hikes, but analysts say the Fed is likely to be more explicit about it at this point.Economists point to the minutes from the June FOMC meeting and more recently Powell's testimony before Congress.
A majority of the FOMC committee indicated at the June meeting they were in favor of two more hikes this year.
Plus, both the FOMC meeting minutes and Powell's testimony cited a strengthening economy and a rate of inflation ""close"" to the Fed's objective of 2%.
That economic strength was evident in the recent GDP report, which showed a 4.1% annual growth rate in the second quarter

387,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 05:35AM ET</span>","Turkey's central bank hikes inflation view, defends independence","By Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank on Tuesday sharply raised its inflation forecast for this year and next, saying price pressures were the only factor in its policy decisions as it sought to emphasize its independence from political interference.
The bank raised its 2018 estimate to 13.4 percent from 8.4 percent and its 2019 year-end forecast to 9.3 percent from 6.5 percent, reflecting the impact of a free-falling lira and rising import prices.
It surprised financial markets this month with a decision to keep rates on hold, even after inflation spiked to a 14-year high of 15.39 percent in June. 
The bank's apparent reluctance to deliver the big rate hikes investors say are necessary to rebalance the economy has increased concern it is under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan. 
Erdogan - a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"" who said prior to being re-elected last month that he planned to exercise greater control over monetary policy - has repeatedly called for cheaper borrowing costs.
His interventions have contributed to sending the lira down by a fifth this year.
""The central bank and monetary policy committee make decisions based on the inflation outlook alone,"" Governor Murat Cetinkaya told a news conference following the release of the bank's quarterly inflation report.
""The central bank is granted independence of its objectives and tools.""
Inflation has helped drive the lira beyond 4.9 to the dollar in recent weeks, despite interest rate hikes of 500 basis points since April.
At 0915 GMT the lira  stood at 4.900, unchanged from 0730 GMT, when Cetinkaya started speaking.
Data from the second quarter suggested economic activity was decelerating and had started rebalancing, Cetinkaya said.

However, inflation would show a limited increase in the third quarter, he said, adding that a tight monetary policy stance would be maintained for a long time.

388,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Tuesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, July 31:
1. Apple Reports Earnings
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) results due out after the market close will be today's main event, as a busy week for earnings rolls along.
The world’s largest company by market cap is expected to report adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share for its fiscal third-quarter, a 29% increase from the same period last year, on revenue of $52.3 billion, up about 15% over last year.
In addition to those top- and bottom-line numbers, investors will be paying close attention to iPhone unit sales. Growth in Apple's services business will also be in focus.
More importantly, investors will be looking for crucial second half guidance after disappointing forecasts from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earlier this month spurred concerns about future growth for a sector that has led U.S. equities to record highs.
The company will host an earnings call at 5:00PM ET.
Besides Apple, a slew of S&P 500 companies are also set to report results on Tuesday.
Before the market open, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM), Cummins (NYSE:CMI), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL),  Steven Madden  (NASDAQ:SHOO), Intelsat (NYSE:I), Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), and Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) will be the highlights.
And after the market close, Apple earnings will also be accompanied by results from Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ), Pandora (NYSE:P), Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC).



2. Federal Reserve Kicks Off Policy Meeting
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins its two-day policy meeting today, with a decision due Wednesday afternoon.
The U.S. central bank is not expected to take any action on interest rates, but solid economic growth combined with rising inflation are likely keep it on track for another two hikes this year even as President Donald Trump has ramped up criticism of its push to raise rates.
The Fed so far this year has increased borrowing costs in March and June, and investors see additional moves in September and December.
In other central bank news, the Bank of Japan made small tweaks to its ultra-easy monetary policy, rather than more drastic changes that some traders in the market had anticipated.
Those include allowing long-term rates to fluctuate depending on economic and price developments, and conduct asset purchases more flexibly.
In response, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) pulled back sharply to 0.05% from a 1-1/2 year high of 0.11%. The move in JGBs pushed U.S. 10-year Treasury yields lower too.
3. Fed's Preferred Inflation Metric in Focus
Tuesday's calendar features a closely-watched report on personal income and spending for June, which includes the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data - the Fed's preferred metric for inflation - at 8:30AM ET.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show that the core PCE price index inched up 0.1% last month, after rising 0.2% a month earlier. On an annualized basis, core PCE prices are expected to rise 2.0%.
The Fed uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.
There is also the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index (HPI) for May at 9AM ET, followed by the July reading on manufacturing activity in the Midwest at 9:45AM ET, and the CB's latest consumer confidence survey at 10AM ET.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was barely changed at around 94.15.
4. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Small Gains 
U.S. stock futures pointed to small gains at the open, with the major indices on track to break a three-session losing streak, as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings and economic data.
At 5:30AM ET, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 9 points, or about 0.1%, at the open. The blue-chip Dow futures and S&P 500 futures also indicated a slightly higher start to their respective trading sessions.
Wall Street fell on Monday, as an unraveling of popular technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite to its lowest close in more than three weeks.
Elsewhere, in Europe, the region's major bourses struggled for direction, with most sectors moving in different directions, amid a slew of data and corporate releases.
Data showed that while inflation in the euro zone accelerated further above the European Central Bank's goal in July, growth unexpectedly slowed to the weakest in two years.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed narrowly mixed, taking cues from the rout in global technology shares.
5. Oil Prices Limp Lower Ahead Of API Data
In commodity markets, oil prices edged lower, as oversupply concerns mounted amid indications that OPEC output rose in July to its highest for 2018.
Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, shed 39 cents, or 0.5%, to $75.16 a barrel, while U.S. crude dipped 44 cents, or 0.6%, to $69.69.
Oil traders turned their attention to fresh data on U.S. commercial crude inventories to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
The American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report for the week ended July 27 at 4:30PM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 3.1 million barrels.

In an interview with CNBC television, Pompeo said the United States looked forward to engagement with the government of Pakistan's expected new prime minister, Imran Khan, but said there was ""no rationale"" for a bailout that pays off Chinese loans to Pakistan.
""Make no mistake. We will be watching what the IMF does,"" Pompeo said. ""There's no rationale for IMF tax dollars, and associated with that American dollars that are part of the IMF funding, for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,"" Pompeo said.
The Financial Times reported on Sunday that senior Pakistani finance officials were drawing up options for Khan to seek an IMF bailout of up to $12 billion.
An IMF spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that we have so far not received a request for a Fund arrangement from Pakistan and that we have not had discussions with the authorities about any possible intentions.""
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the IMF has its own standards and operating rules when cooperating with relevant countries. 
""I believe they will handle it appropriately,"" he told reporters, without elaborating. 
Pakistan is struggling to avert a currency crisis that has presented the new government with its biggest challenge. Many analysts and business leaders expect that another IMF bailout, the second in five years, will be needed to plug an external financing gap.
Pakistan, which already has around $5 billion in loans from China and its banks to fund major infrastructure projects, had sought another $1 billion in loans to stabilize its plummeting foreign currency reserves.
Officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have criticized China's infrastructure lending to developing countries, arguing that this has saddled them with unsustainable debt.
The $57 China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a series of port and rail improvements associated with China's One Belt One Road infrastructure push, has led to massive imports of Chinese equipment and materials, swelling Pakistan's current account deficit.

Pakistan has had 14 IMF financing programs since 1980, according to fund data, including a $6.7 billion three-year loan program in 2013.

Indonesia requires foreign inflows to finance its current account deficit and the central bank has spent about $12 billion of its forex reserves in recent months to defend the rupiah , which has lost about 6 percent this year.
""The country needs dollars now,"" Joko Widodo told a cabinet meeting. ""I don't want to keep doing meetings without good implementations.""
The cabinet has met at least six times since the start of July to tackle concerns over trade and the rupiah currency, and Widodo called for swifter action to prop up the currency.
He sought immediate implementation of a government's plan to widen the mandatory use of B20 biodiesel to all diesel vehicles, including locomotive engines and heavy equipment. 
Expansion of the B20 program could be launched as soon as Thursday, Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto told reporters this week. He estimated the measure could save Indonesia $5 billion in diesel imports each year.
Replacing imports could benefit Indonesia, one analyst said.
""In the short term, this would be a faster solution, compared to trying to boost exports,"" said Josua Pardede, an economist with Bank Permata in Jakarta.
""Replacing imports would be one alternative to maintain the current account deficit at a healthy level,"" he added. ""The oil and gas deficit has been continuously expanding in the last year due to the rising oil price.""
Biodiesel can cut fuel costs and reduce emissions, but some varieties need special handling and equipment as the fuel has a solvent effect, corroding engine seals and gasket materials, and it can solidify in the cold.

Indonesia's auto industries group, GAIKINDO, has said stepping up biodiesel blends can increase fuel consumption and could cause engines to overheat.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When you are known for starting a personal finance company, people expect you to have your own financial house in order. But that was not always the case for Alexa von Tobel, founder of LearnVest.com. 
After graduating from Harvard, von Tobel felt unprepared for the money aspect of adult life. In 2007, she started a company to help young people understand spending and saving options. 
Now 34, von Tobel has traded in the entrepreneurial life to be a corporate officer at Northwestern Mutual, the financial services giant that bought LearnVest in 2015. 
Von Tobel spoke to Reuters for the latest installment of ""Life Lessons"" about making the transition from graduate school dropout to chief innovation officer.
Q: Growing up in Jacksonville, Florida, what did your parents teach you about money? 
A: My mom and dad both influenced me in different ways. My dad used to make money something he’d include me in. We’d look at my savings statements together and say, 'this is how much we’re saving toward college.' Essentially, money was a part of a conversation. It wasn’t stressful. 
My mom had a massive impact on me because she came from a very frugal background. I remember I wanted a pair of white Keds. They were $40 or something like that. She said you’re not getting Keds, you’re getting the Sam’s Club $9 version. It was a battle, but she didn’t budge. She said she'd rather spend money on our family vacation. 
Q: What was your first experience with working? 
A: I babysat a ton. I worked at my parents' office, filing, for both of them. I got $10 an hour, and every single day, I’d go 9-5 in the back office. 
Q: When you first got out of college, why were you overwhelmed by money decisions? 
A: I couldn’t believe that practical info hadn’t been imparted to me. Roth vs. IRA? How many credit cards should you have? How much can I afford in rent?
So I founded LearnVest. I enrolled in Harvard Business School in 2008 and took a leave after one semester - and I never finished. 
Q: At what point did you realize you needed to step it up and get some financial certifications? 
A: I’m very curious. So I started studying to be a certified financial planner. Two or three years into doing LearnVest, I (spent) a few months of nights and weekends and took the CFP exam and passed. It’s a brutal test.
It’s helpful to be a successful entrepreneur who is also a CFP, because it’s very grounding. You only need so much money. And being a financial planner, you can make a little bit of money go a lot of ways. 
Q: What did you learn from starting your own business? 
A: There are no shortcuts. When you are trying to build a successful business, you put one foot in front of another. 
Q: Now what have you learned about the corporate world? 
A: Northwestern Mutual is a massive company and touches millions of families. They took the core platform of LearnVest – the software we built - and that will go out to millions. We’re relaunching LearnVest, strong as ever. You’ll see it soon. 
Many acquisitions have the founder running out the door, but it's three years later, and we’re here, still embracing major amounts of change. 
Q: What is your philosophy around charitable giving? 
A: Charity for people is a very personal decision. Rather than spraying money around in ad hoc ways, it’s better to be focused. Young people will say, they do not have a lot of money, and I say, you have time - roll up your sleeves. 
Q: You have two young children. What do you hope to teach them about money values? 

A: I think of money as habit-building. My daughter, who is 3, has five piggy banks. One is massive, and they get smaller. The big one is for college. The very small ones are for things like a bike and a cupcake. We’re drilling into her the concept of saving.

The Beijing News said the new body, set up by the standing committee of the Liaoning People's Congress, was part of the province's push to tackle rising debt.
Earlier this month, the Ministry of Finance said total debt in Liaoning stood at around 845.5 billion yuan ($124 billion) at the end of last year, 168.8 billion yuan higher than the figure given by the provincial government in February, the Beijing News said on Monday.
According to a notice issued by the Liaoning People's Congress last week, the province's performance when it comes to controlling expenditure has not been satisfactory, and some old industrial regions have relied too much on high debt to drive growth.
It said the new body would bring spending budgets at all levels under greater scrutiny and control.
The official China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday that the move would ""set a good example"" for other regions when it comes to tackling debt.
Liaoning province, which has long depended on heavy industries like steel, coal and machinery manufacturing, has sought to spend its way out of a long-term economic decline, investing huge amounts of public money on new infrastructure as part of the state's 15-year ""Rejuvenate the Northeast"" program.
But it continues to struggle to overcome slowing growth as well as a rapidly ageing population. After reporting negative economic growth in 2016, Liaoning began to recover last year and its GDP rose 5.6 percent in the first half of 2018, though it still lagged the national rate.

394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",U.S.-Led Infrastructure Aid to Counter China in Indo-Pacific,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S., Japan and Australia agreed to invest in infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific in a move that will be seen as a counter to China’s rising influence in a region that stretches from the east coast of Africa, through Australia to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
“This trilateral partnership is in recognition that more support is needed to enhance peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” Australia Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Tuesday in an emailed statement. The pact will mobilize investment in energy, transportation, tourism and technology infrastructure, according to the statement, which didn’t give any funding details.
The announcement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump’s National Security Strategy in December called for policies to answer rival powers’ infrastructure-building efforts. Chief among these is Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global plan to build or expand highways, railways, ports, pipelines and power plants that  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) forecasts could grow as large as $1.3 trillion over the next decade.
U.S. infrastructure cooperation with Japan and Australia would dovetail with the Trump administration’s evolving national security policies, which have cast the U.S. as in “long-term, strategic competition” with China and Russia. Beijing’s BRI calls for half a trillion dollars in investment in infrastructure along trade routes to China, which is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest economy before 2030.
Before visiting China in November, Trump signed two deals with Japan, pledging cooperation on infrastructure projects in the region.
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, speaking Monday before a trip to Asia amid an escalating trade war with China, said the U.S. believes in “strategic partnerships, not strategic dependency” -- a veiled criticism of Beijing’s efforts to woo countries with cheap financing for infrastructure projects.
“With American companies, citizens around the world know that what you see is what you get: honest contracts, honest terms and no need for off-the-books nonsense,” Pompeo said. Another advantage of the U.S. is that “we will help them keep their people free from coercion or great power domination,” he said.
Pompeo is likely to make announcements about the pact’s funding arrangements during his visit to Asia, which will include Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, according to Stephen Kirchner, director of trade and investment program at the U.S. Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.
“This is designed to provide mechanism that will allow more private-sector funding for the infrastructure projects that countries in this region need,” Kirchner said. That will mean it will operate in different ways to established funds such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, he said.
In February, Bishop said the three nations, along with India, had discussed opportunities to address “the enormous need for infrastructure” in the region, which encompasses some of the world’s poorest as well as fastest-growing economies.
India wasn’t mentioned in Tuesday’s announcement. Instead, the pact will be organized by the U.S.’s Overseas Private Investment Corp., the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
“This partnership represents our commitment to an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open and prosperous,” the three nations said in a joint statement issued on Monday, according to Bishop. The trilateral partnership will be formalized “in due course,” Bishop said.
Strained Ties
Australia’s diplomatic relationship with China, its most important trading partner, has been strained since December when Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Chinese meddling in the nation’s government and media were a catalyst for new anti-foreign interference laws, which passed parliament last month.
China lodged a formal protest with Australia in January after Turnbull’s minister for international development, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, said the Belt and Road plan risked building “useless buildings” and “roads to nowhere.”
Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo denied the new pact was designed to counter China and said he wasn’t expecting a backlash from Beijing.
“Why would there be any?” Ciobo said in a Sky News interview on Tuesday. “The fact is that we demonstrate consistently that Australia is very focused on making sure we can help the least-developed economies in our region.”

395,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",The BOJ Should Throw Japan's Banks a Bone,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s decision time again for the Bank of Japan, and the most important issue for markets boils down to this: Will there be a hint from policymakers that the side effects of monetary easing are beginning to worry them?
The answer to that question may lie as much in geopolitics as in economics.
The BOJ is in a corner, not least because it may have to shift more of its exchange-traded-fund purchases to a broader benchmark like the Topix, and away from the Nikkei 225, “a Flintsones index from an abacus age,” according to CLSA analyst Nicholas Smith.
The central bank’s real difficulty lies in the bond market. Even with negative interest rates (since January 2016) and yield-curve controls (since September 2016), the 2 percent inflation target for Japan remains elusive. More worryingly, the impact of those policies now poses a threat to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s larger game plan.
Consider the consensus analyst estimate of the one-year-forward return on assets for lenders in the Topix Bank Index. It was 0.39 percent in December 2015, just before the imposition of negative interest rates. For lenders in the S&P 500 index, the similar return-on-asset expectation was 0.95 percent in December 2015, when Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election was nowhere in sight.
Fast forward to now, and analysts have bumped up their return-on-asset expectations for U.S. lenders to 1.2 percent, while scaling down forecasts for Japanese banks to 0.3 percent. What used to be a profitability gap of 3:1 is now a 4:1 advantage in favor of the Americans.
Negative interest rates have flattened Japanese banks’ ability to earn a spread on deposits. Should the BOJ not try to build them a new profit ladder, their ability to generate capital for future growth will be constrained; and without that capital, they’ll find it hard to go head-to-head with Beijing’s belt-and-road infrastructure projects in Asia and beyond. 
Recall that Abe’s popular appeal in the December 2012 election was built on the promise of a great reset, one that would make Japan reemerge as a force by preventing its aging, shrinking population from pulling the nation into a vortex of deepening deflation and increasing irrelevance. However, the bold monetary experiment that his campaign required is now inhibiting banks’ expansion, militating against the prime minister’s goal of countering Chinese influence.
More than any threat to the stability of Japan’s financial system, this speed limit on Abenomics is the side effect BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda needs to watch.
In 2017, the top Japanese lenders – Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. – saw a 19 percent slump in project-finance loans for which they were the main arrangers, to $27 billion, even though global activity dropped back by less than 3 percent, according to data compiled by Project Finance International. 
One could argue that by making it hard for them to turn a profit at home, the BOJ is pushing even regional lenders like Iyo Bank Ltd. to hitch a ride with the state-backed Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Together with Japanese heavyweights, Iyo is also financing the construction of a hospital in Istanbul. However, a desperate hunt for yield in risky projects overseas is bound to lead to credit mistakes; a foreign lending boom backed by stable profitability at home would prove more enduring. 
What will be the exact nature of Tuesday’s “Operation Tweaks,” as Nomura Securities analysts term the policy fine-tuning? Any major change to the current system of keeping the short-term policy rate at -0.1 percent – and holding the 10-year government bond yield at around zero – could be misconstrued as the start of a much-feared reversal of quantitative easing, a possibility that raised its head with Kuroda’s speech at the University of Zurich last November. 
It may not be a bad idea, however, for the monetary authority to signal greater comfort with 10-year yields at, say, 0.25 percent, which Nomura says could be a new cap. Such a shifting of gears could cause some temporary panic. But refusing to throw a bone to the profit-starved banks could eventually be more expensive to Abenomics.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will likely trim its inflation forecasts on Tuesday and consider changes to its massive stimulus program to make it more sustainable, reflecting a growing recognition it will take longer than expected to meet its elusive price goal.
The central bank has failed to break Japan's entrenched deflationary mindset despite years of heavy money printing, with stubbornly soft inflation sapping its ammunition and global trade woes clouding the outlook for an export-reliant economy.
(Graphic: BOJ stirs talk of change to yield curve control - https://tmsnrt.rs/2JYsmFZ)
But there is uncertainty on how long it can sustain the current ultra-easy policy given the strain near-zero rates are inflicting on Japanese banks and the bond market.
The BOJ's nine-member board will debate ways to address the conflicting challenges, with options including tweaks to its asset-buying techniques and guidance on its yield targets, say sources familiar with the bank's thinking.
The changes, although small, would be the latest sign Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is walking away from his radical stimulus program deployed five years ago to shock the public out of deflation.
""The BOJ may be losing confidence over its ability to drive up inflation. If it had confidence, it could keep insisting that inflation will reach 2 percent at some point,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""The only lasting solution for the BOJ would be to make its inflation target a long-term goal. But that could take time and prove difficult.""
At the two-day rate review concluding on Tuesday, the board will also discuss how simmering trade tensions between the United States and China could affect global trade and Japan's export-reliant economy, analysts say.
Data released on Tuesday showed factory output fell 2.1 percent in June to mark the second straight month of declines, though manufacturers expect to increase output in July and August reflecting robust global demand.
JITTERY AHEAD OF BOJ
Expectations that the BOJ may announce a tweak in its monetary stimulus weighed on global bond markets, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rising to a six-week high just shy of 3 percent on Monday.
Japan's 10-year yield hit its highest level in nearly a year and a half on Monday, forcing the BOJ to conduct a special bond buying operation for two straight sessions.
Under its yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ pledges to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and 10-year bond yields around zero percent.
It also buys risky assets such as exchange-traded funds (ETF) and corporate bonds, and keeps a loose pledge to increase its government bond holdings by 80 trillion yen ($720.79 billion) per year.
Many BOJ policymakers are wary of hiking rates just yet, as inflation remains distant from their target and markets are jittery of any sign central banks are whittling down stimulus.
The central bank may instead tweak its guidance on the yield targets to signal it would allow rates to move more flexibly, the sources say.
It may also modify the way it buys risky assets such as ETFs, nodding to concerns its purchases are distorting markets. 
The BOJ meeting would precede the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day rate review through Wednesday, which is expected to reaffirm the outlook for further gradual rate rises.
In a quarterly review of its projections on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to trim its price forecasts and concede inflation could fall short of its target for three more years.

Governor Kuroda is expected to hold a media briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630GMT) to explain the policy decision.

The move is part of a broader effort by the United States and its allies to reassert their influence in the Pacific amid fears that the region is increasingly susceptible to diplomatic pressure from Beijing.
""The United States, Japan and Australia have formed a trilateral partnership to mobilize investment in projects that drive economic growth, create opportunities, and foster a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific,"" Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation said in a statement.
The investments will include energy, transportation, tourism and technology infrastructure, with the governments aiming to attract private capital to projects.

LONDON (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit is not an option for Britain's car industry, given the costs and disruption that carmakers and consumers would suffer, the head of the country's automobile industry group said on Tuesday.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said carmakers were ""increasingly concerned"" about the lack of clarity around the manner of Britain's departure from the European Union.
With less than eight months until the divorce is due to take place, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a proposal to maintain economic ties with the bloc that pleases both sides of her divided party and is acceptable to negotiators in Brussels.
That has raised the prospect of Britain leaving the EU with no deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules that could leave British car exporters facing EU import tariffs of around 10 percent.
""No deal... is just not an option. It would be seriously damaging to the industry not just in the UK but in Europe as well,"" Hawes told reporters as he presented SMMT's mid-year update on British car production.
The industry employs more than 850,000 people directly and indirectly in Britain.
While carmakers were encouraged by May's Brexit proposals published this month, Hawes said big questions remained around the costs of any new customs arrangements, Hawes said.
British car output in the first six months of 2018 fell by an annual 3.3 percent to 834,402 with disappointing domestic demand cancelling out strong exports, SMMT said.
In June alone, production fell 5.5 percent compared with June 2017, despite output for export markets rising 6.0 percent.
Production for the domestic market slumped 47 percent. Hawes said this mainly reflected an unusual combination of changes in model cycles and manufacturers getting ready for new emission standards, with production set to recover in subsequent months.
""Looking at the long-term picture, the sector is performing as expected in the context of market conditions at home and abroad,"" Hawes said.
BRACING FOR BREXIT 
Production of motor vehicles accounts for almost a tenth of British manufacturing output, making it is one of the key battleground industries ahead of Britain's exit from the EU.
Hawes said Britain's car manufacturers were getting as ""ready as possible"" for any disruption from a no-deal Brexit. 
While the major international car manufacturers were used to dealing with complex issues around global trade, Brexit preparations were more of a concern for the smaller companies across the supply chain, Hawes said.
Economists polled by Reuters have said a no-deal Brexit is the third most-likely outcome, behind a new free trade deal between Britain and the EU and continued membership by Britain of the European Economic Area's single market. [BOE/INT]
Hawes said the tone of a recent meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on trade was encouraging, even though their statement excluded reference to automotive tariffs which Trump had previously suggested for European car imports.

""What we would say is that any increase in tariffs would be significant and would be damaging both to the U.S. and in Europe, and I include (Britain) in Europe when it comes to exports,"" Hawes said.

Unemployment peaked at 16 percent in 2012, when Ireland was midway through a three-year international bailout, but has fallen especially sharply in recent months as the economy rebounded to be the best performing in Europe since 2014.
With the jobless rate already at 5.1 percent at the end of June, the central bank estimated unemployment would average 5.4 percent across this year as a whole versus 5.6 percent in its last quarterly update. 
As the country gets closer to full employment, the central bank has called on the government to start running budget surpluses sooner than currently planned to enable counter-cyclical fiscal easing during the next downturn.
""The continued growth in the economy, which is broadly balanced between domestic and export activity, is to be welcomed,"" Mark Cassidy, Director of Economics and Statistics, said in a statement.
""Domestically, the strength of economic growth means our economy risks hitting full capacity, which gives rise to the risk of overheating or boom-bust cycles. This underscores the importance of building fiscal buffers during the good times.""
The central bank expects gross domestic product to grow by 4.7 percent this year and by 4.2 percent next while underlying domestic demand - seen as a better gauge of activity by most economists - is set to grow 4.4 percent in 2018 and 4.1 percent in 2019, up from 2.9 percent last year. 
Risks to the Irish economy include a costly diversion of resources to logistics and trade-processing systems in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit and protectionist pressures and shifts in the international tax regime.

The central bank has calculated that if Britain leaves the European Union without a formal divorce agreement, this would shave 3.2 percent off the Irish economy over 10 years, and result in the creation of around 40,000 fewer jobs.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Payment due: Pacific islands in the red as debts to China mount,"By Charlotte Greenfield and Jonathan Barrett
WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Just over a decade ago, deadly riots in the capital of Tonga, Nuku'alofa, destroyed much of the small Pacific nation's central business and government districts.
Out of the rubble, the government hatched a plan to rebuild the city, including constructing a new cruise ship wharf and renovating the Royal Palace – all bankrolled by a new lender, China.
The initial roughly $65 million in Chinese lending now exceeds $115 million - almost one-third of Tonga's annual gross domestic product - as interest mounted and the government took out a second loan for road development across the country.
An onerous principal repayment schedule starts in September that will double Tonga's debt financing bill has left the government scrambling.
Tonga's precarious position is indicative of a wider debt-fueled hangover hitting small Pacific economies, stoking fears the region risks falling into financial distress and becoming more susceptible to diplomatic pressure from Beijing.
In particular, the loans give Beijing a lever in one of the most contested areas in the world over recognition of Taiwan, which has strong diplomatic ties to the region.
Reuters' analysis of the financial books of 11 South Pacific island nations shows China's lending programs have gone from almost zero to over $1.3 billion currently outstanding in a decade.
The documents show China is now the region's biggest bilateral lender, although Australia's significant aid programs mean it remains the largest financial backer in the South Pacific.
Chinese loans accounts for more than 60 percent of Tonga's total external debt burden, and almost half the external debt of Vanuatu. In dollar figures, Papua New Guinea has the biggest debt to China, at almost $590 million, representing about one-quarter of its total external debt.
""Given the vulnerabilities of their economies, given the very few sources of revenues they have, they tend to be in many cases at high risk of debt distress,"" World Bank director for the Pacific, Michel Kerf, told Reuters in a phone interview.
""Their debt is reaching the limit of what would be considered sustainable.""
END-GAME POLITICS
Most experts believe China's lending in the Pacific, which picked up from 2006, stemmed from Beijing's broader push to increase overseas ties as its economy and global clout rose. Financing packages also provided opportunities for state-owned enterprises to take part in infrastructure projects.
Chinese firms have built facilities throughout the Pacific, from Vanuatu's Luganville Wharf - built by Shanghai Construction Group - to a water network in the Cook Islands' Rarotonga, which is being built by state-owned China Civil Engineering Construction Co.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said there was no evidence China was responsible for creating unsustainable debt.
""We have, according to the relevant countries' wishes, given financing support to the best of our ability, which has provided assistance in the hour of need in promoting relevant countries' social and economic development, and received the affirmation and welcome of each country,"" Hua said at a news briefing in Beijing in response to Reuters questions.
She said China's relationship with Tonga was ""very good"".
Yet experts say China's recent possession of the strategically important Sri Lankan port at Hambantota as Colombo struggled with a spiraling debt crisis demonstrated the Asian giant's awareness its loans are also a powerful strategic tool.
Last year, a Chinese state-owned firm took over a 99-year lease of the port, part of a plan to convert $6 billion of loans that Sri Lanka owes China into equity.
The deal raised concerns from the United States, India and Japan that Beijing might use the port as an Indian Ocean naval base, which both the Sri Lankan government and Chinese embassy in Colombo have denied.
Sam Parker, the co-author of a Harvard analysis of China's offshore financing and diplomacy, said Hambantota was a ""wake up call"" and identified the Pacific as being similarly vulnerable.
""We don't think there was some huge Chinese plot to lure countries into debt,"" Parker said in a phone interview. ""But now that they have it, we think they'd be willing to use it. They've started to be a lot more aggressive in geo-economics.""
Indeed, a recent U.S. National Defence Strategy paper warned China was using ""predatory economics"" to achieve its strategic ends in particular by coercing neighbors to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to China's advantage. And New Zealand's defense policy statement released last month highlighted growing disruption in the Pacific from the rise of China.
""Steep debt burdens associated with infrastructure projects have potential implications for influence, access and governance,"" New Zealand noted, drawing a rebuke from China.
The issue ignited recently over media reports China wanted to establish a military base in Vanuatu after funding a wharf big enough to handle warships. Both China and Vanuatu denied the reports.
Despite Beijing's growing clout in the region, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week he was confident South Pacific nations would choose the United States as an ally over China.
""I think the South Pacific, like most places in the world, understands the enormity of having an American ally - a country that consistently over decades projects the democratic values,"" Pompeo said after meetings with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.
THE TAIWAN QUESTION
While the loans are relatively small on a global scale and the Pacific islands are less obviously of strategic significance, the region has attractions for the ascending power.
Washington and its allies have warned Beijing against any attempt to establish military bases in an area that proved pivotal in the Pacific battles of World War II.
Each Pacific state represents a vote at international forums such as the United Nations, and they control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean.
What's more, one-third of countries which have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan are in the South Pacific. China views the island as a wayward province, to be taken back by force if necessary.
Both Taiwan and China have used lending and aid packages to help keep their supporters loyal, after decades of several Pacific nations switching allegiances.
In February, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said China had forced Papua New Guinea to change the name of Taipei's representative office in the country and remove diplomatic license plates from diplomats' cars.
""Recent moves suggest a return to heightened cross-Strait competition in Pacific islands,"" said a June report from the U.S. Congress's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Much of the criticism around Chinese lending in the Pacific has focused on the projects debts have been used for, and conditions tied to loans.
The Cook Islands has been critical of some of its China-led projects after accepting grants for public buildings including a courthouse and a police station, and a concessional loan for a stadium that used imported labor and materials.
""A lot of the buildings are so substandard that they are starting to fall apart,"" said Mark Short, former secretary of justice for the Cook Islands.
Short said the stadium was rusted and unsafe less than a decade after being built. A make-shift pen was built outside the courthouse because the cells beneath it ran out of oxygen if occupied for more than two hours.
Cook Islands Deputy Prime Minister Mark Brown acknowledged there had been some issues with the selection of materials and quality of workmanship in parts of the buildings.
""To their credit, China has recognized the shortcomings...by undertaking to carry out renovations work on all three buildings,"" Brown said in an email. ""Chinese assistance was available to meet urgent infrastructure needs in the Cook Islands and we took advantage of those opportunities.""
The majority of China's financial support comes in the form of concessional loans, while traditional regional players like Australia, New Zealand and the United States tend to provide gifts and leave lending to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Australia and New Zealand have both recently diverted more funding to the region after years of apparent indifference.
Vanuatu's recently retired Sydney consul, William Longwah, told Reuters China was an easier financier to deal with than Australia.
""And Australia, when they do something they take so long to process, so long to send the funds,"" Longwah said in a phone interview.
Now, debt pressure is mounting on several Pacific island governments.
China has showed no signs it will forgive debt, refusing Tonga's request to do so in 2013, although it did suspend principal repayments for five years.
Tonga plans to repay principal of about $5.7 million of its China loans in 2018-19; almost doubling the country's annual external debt service bill and representing about 4 percent of its overall budget of $135 million.
Tonga's financial challenges have already prompted the government to withdraw from hosting the 2019 Pacific Games, an Olympic Games-style event held every four years, sparking anger and legal action from the council responsible for organizing the games in the sports-mad nation.
Lopeti Senituli, political and media advisor to Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pōhiva told Reuters Tonga is still negotiating with Beijing to see if it can get its debts forgiven, but is preparing to start payments.
""Of course it would put any government under major financial stress and we are doing the best we can.""
He acknowledged Pacific islands experienced pressure from Beijing but denied it was different to any other country with an economic relationship with China, which is asserting ""massive"" pressure globally.
""You cannot simply say it's only happening in the Pacific islands. No, it's happening to all of us regardless of the size of your economy, regardless of the political status of your government structure.""

402,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 07:09PM ET</span>","U.S., Mexico plan NAFTA ministerial talks on Thursday: sources","By Anthony Esposito and David Ljunggren
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico plan to hold ministerial-level NAFTA trade talks on Thursday in Washington, the second such meeting within a week as efforts are ramped up to seal a deal on updating the 24-year-old accord, two sources said.
Mexico and the United States agreed last week to step up talks on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in hopes of reaching an agreement on major issues by August.
There will be ""technical meetings probably until Wednesday and a ministerial meeting on Thursday,"" a Mexican source close to the talks told Reuters on Monday. A second Mexican source close to the talks also said a ministerial meeting was planned for Thursday.
""We will be there,"" but it is not yet clear if the meeting will be trilateral and include Canada, said the first source.
A spokesman at Mexico's economy ministry said there would be technical meetings this week, but said he did not know whether a ministerial meeting would take place.
Mexican Economy Minster Ildefonso Guajardo last week held what he described as ""constructive"" and ""very positive"" talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is scheduled to leave Canada on Tuesday for a meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Singapore, the Canadian foreign ministry said. With the ASEAN meetings running from July 30-Aug. 4, it is unlikely Freeland would make it to Washington for the Thursday talks.
A spokesman for Freeland did not respond to a request for comment about the NAFTA talks this week. The office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) could not be immediately reached for comment.
U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested he could seek a bilateral deal with Mexico, but Guajardo said the U.S.-Mexico talks would lead to discussions with Canada and ""a trilateral dialogue when we get closer to the conclusion.""
Freeland visited Mexico on July 25 and she and Guajardo insisted that NAFTA remain a trilateral pact.
Talks began last August but stalled in the run-up to the July 1 Mexican presidential election. That was due, at least in part, to U.S. calls for a so-called sunset clause, that would put the deal forming one of the world's largest trading blocs up for renewal every five years. U.S. demands for sweeping changes in the auto sector have also been controversial.
""There has been progress (on autos)."" We are ""working on proposals from both"" nations, said one of the sources close to the talks.
However, Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association in Canada, said he did not think there was a new Mexican proposal and that there are still complicated issues between the United States and Mexico. 
""I saw (U.S. Commerce) Secretary (Wilbur) Ross yesterday say that they've got more complicated issues with Mexico than with us. Frankly, when we left the table in May, we were also very close except for the high wage labor content proposal that the Americans had (presented) to the Mexicans,"" said Volpe.
The United States wants 40 percent of North American auto content to be sourced from areas paying at least $16 hour. 
""I imagine they’re trying to work out the Mexican feel for it with the new administration,"" said Volpe.
Guajardo was joined in Washington last week by Jesus Seade, whom Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has tipped as his lead trade negotiator.

Volpe concluded: ""I wouldn't be surprised if the Americans and the Mexicans came to some resolution on that piece (autos) and then the Americans flip it back to Canada and say 'Take it or leave it'.""

""I always leave room for negotiation,"" Trump said during a press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the White House, adding that he has drawn no ""red line"" on the matter.
Congress must pass a spending bill by the end of September to avert a government shutdown, and Trump on Monday reiterated his demand that immigration reforms, including $25 billion for construction of a wall on U.S. border with Mexico, be included in any spending package. 
""If we don't get border security, after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would have no problem doing a shutdown,"" Trump said. 
The notion of a government shutdown was criticized by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby.
Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, Shelby said, ""I'm hoping the idea of shutting down the government is not a serious thing and it goes away."" He added that Trump's threats would not help lawmakers craft the necessary spending bills by a Sept. 30 deadline ""because we're trying to work together in a bipartisan way."" 
Beyond building a wall, the administration also wants to do away with so-called ""chain migration"" allowing relatives of immigrants to come to the country, and the diversity visa-lottery program, and to move toward what Trump calls a ""merit-based"" immigration system. 
The Republican president said on Sunday he would allow the federal government to shut down if Democrats do not fund his border wall and back immigration law changes, betting that maintaining a hard line will work in Republicans' favor in November congressional elections.

However, a disruption in federal government operations could backfire on Trump if voters blame Republicans, who control Congress, for the interruption in services.

404,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Italy's Populist Leader Stakes Claim to Be Trump's Man in Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took his cues from Donald Trump at their first White House meeting, backing the president’s views on trade, migration, security and defense spending and setting himself up as an advocate for U.S. policy in the heart of the European Union.
“We are two governments of change -- many things unite us,” Conte said at a joint press conference Monday. “Italy and the U.S. are twin countries.”
The Italian premier offers Trump some rare support among European leaders, echoing his populist rhetoric, skepticism toward the EU status quo and push to improve relations with Russia. Trump in turn praised Italy’s crackdown on immigration, saying other European countries should follow its example.
While he may be the closest on policy, Conte is just the latest in a string of European leaders to court the U.S. leader and the mixed results of his predecessors offers a note of caution. British Prime Minister Theresa May was openly criticized by Trump when he visited London this month and she also faced a backlash from angry voters. France’s Emmanuel Macron has attempted to craft his own special relationship through a mixture of tough talk and flattery, but saw the U.S. walk out on the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear deal all the same.
Mediterranean Coordination
The U.S. president won Conte’s endorsement on Russia and defense spending and the Italian leader said Trump’s demands that European allies to step up their military funding is “reasonable.”
For his part, Conte said the U.S. shares its goal of organizing a peace conference on Libya, where Italy is trying to delay a French-backed plan for elections on December 10. The U.S. and Italy have agreed to step up coordination in the Mediterranean to counter terrorism and control illegal immigration.
“With both Trump and Conte, every meeting is greeted as a success,” said Armando Sanguini, a former Italian diplomat who’s now an adviser at think tank Ispi. “But Italy and U.S. have been partners for decades, and no one spoke about military commitments this evening.”
One potential banana skin was the $31-billion U.S. trade deficit with Italy. Although Trump last week walked back from threats to impose an extra tariff on European cars and signed a truce with the region, tensions over global commercial imbalances remain. Conte expressed understanding for the U.S. administration demands of “more equitable” trade relations.
While Germany -- a regular target of Trump’s twitter barbs -- would be the main loser, Italy would also suffer a major blow if Trump were to eventually follow through on his threat to slap tariffs on car imports from Europe.
Attacking EU Partners
In the run-up to the meeting, Conte’s two deputy premiers and political sponsors -- Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant League and Luigi Di Maio, who heads the anti-establishment Five Star movement -- stepped up their own confrontation with Italy’s European partners.
Salvini said Italy would back the U.K. in trade talks with the EU, threatening the bloc’s policy of speaking with a single voice on commerce. Di Maio pledged to forge ahead with the government’s plans to increase spending, setting up a clash with the EU’s fiscal rules.
Conte flew to Washington with the aim of touting his country as a potential “facilitator” between the U.S. and the EU, according to source’s close to the premier’s office cited by the news agency Ansa.
The meeting on Monday was the third between Conte and Trump. The two leaders first met in Canada in June, where the Italian premier backed Trump’s call to readmit Russia to Group of Seven meetings -- a proposal that was promptly shunned by the other leaders.
“We’ve become friendly over the G-7 meetings and some phone calls,” Trump said on meeting Conte. “I agree very much what you’re doing with respect to migration and illegal immigration and even legal immigration.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has eased export controls for high technology product sales to India, granting it the same access as NATO allies, Australia, Japan and South Korea, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday.
Ross, speaking at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, said the move to grant Strategic Trade Authorization status STA1 to India reflects its efforts to improve its own export-control regime, its adherence to multilateral export rules and its growing status as a U.S. defense partner.
""STA1 provides India greater supply chain efficiency, both for defense, and for other high-tech products,"" Ross said, adding that the elevated status would have affected about $9.7 billion worth of Indian goods purchases over the past seven years.
India's ambassador to the United States, Navtej Sarna, told the same forum the U.S. move was a logical step after the United States designated India a major defense partner in 2016.
""It is a sign of trust, not only in the relationship, but also (in) Indian’s capabilities as an economy and as a security partner, because it also presupposes that India has the multilateral export control regime in place which would allow the transfer of more sensitive defense technologies,"" he said.
""It also testifies to the excellent record we have had in maintaining non-proliferation of these technologies,"" he said. ""I certainly think it fleshes out our defense partnership in a big way.""
Political and military ties between the countries have expanded significantly in recent years although trade differences have arisen since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in 2017.
Ross's announcement comes ahead of high-level talks between the United States and India in September that will be attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The Sept. 6 talks have been twice postponed this year.
India and the United States share an interest in countering China's expanding economic and military weight and the United States has emerged as a top arms supplier to India, selling more than $15 billion of weapons over the past decade as New Delhi modernizes its Soviet-era military.

Washington has offered India the armed version of drones that were originally authorized for sale as unarmed and for surveillance purposes. If the deal comes to fruition, it would be the first time the United States has sold a large armed drone to a country outside the NATO alliance.

The new projections put total net borrowing at $769 billion for the second half of 2018 and $1.33 trillion for the whole year.
The department expects to issue $329 billion in net marketable debt from July through September, the fourth-largest total for that quarter on record and higher than the $273 billion estimated in April, according to a statement released Monday in Washington. The Treasury sees an end-of-September cash balance of $350 billion, matching its previous estimate.
From October through December, the Treasury predicted issuance of $440 billion in net marketable debt, with a $390 billion cash balance at the end of the period.
The yield on U.S. 10-year rates edged higher to almost 2.98 percent following the release of the borrowing outlook, but remained within its daily trading range. The two-year rate was steady around 2.67 percent, close to its low for the day.
The Treasury is boosting sales of bills, notes and bonds to help finance a budget gap that’s widening after President Donald Trump signed $1.5 trillion in tax cuts late last year and the Republican-controlled Congress approved a roughly $300 billion spending increase.
The deficit totaled $607 billion through the first nine months of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, compared with $523 billion from the same period a year earlier. The Congressional Budget Office in late June predicted total government spending would exceed revenue by $1 trillion in 2020.
From April through June, the Treasury said it issued $72 billion in net marketable debt, compared with its earlier prediction of $75 billion in borrowing. The cash balance was $333 billion at the end of June.
The quarterly borrowing estimates released Monday precede the department’s quarterly refunding announcement on Aug. 1, when the sizes of government debt auctions are announced.

Wang began in response to a reporter’s trade question, saying “let me share with you some basic facts and I believe you will make an objective and sensible assessment.”
“The U.S. often says that it is taken advantage of, but this is perplexing. It’s like someone who buys a $100 product in a supermarket, has the product in hand, and then complains that he is $100 short,” Wang said. “Does that logic stand up?”
Wang’s defiant remarks underscored deep divisions between the two sides with just a month before the public comment ends on Donald Trump’s proposal to levy tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. While American and Chinese officials have hinted at the possibility of restarting talks, it’s been almost two months they last held high-level negotiations.
“China and the U.S. have had several rounds of consultations and reached important consensus, but regrettably the U.S. did not fulfill its obligations,” Wang said. “Nor did it make concerted efforts with China.”
Wang was adopting a common argument against Trump’s trade policies, in particular his focus on the U.S. trade deficits. A June 18 essay by  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co’s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly titled “My Trade Deficit with Costco (NASDAQ:COST)” is one example.
“In fact, the U.S. has gained a lot from its trade deficit with China,” Wang said. “It gains massive, inexpensive resources and goods, which increase the welfare of consumers and increase the strength of the dollar.”
U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt -- on his first official Asia trip since assuming the post earlier this month -- looked on awkwardly as Wang criticized his country’s close ally. While the U.K. is seeking alternative sources of trade after leaving the European Union next year, China is courting international support in its trade dispute with the U.S.
Wang said that he and Hunt had agreed to work together to uphold free trade, multilateral agreements and World Trade Organization rules. Still, he said that China was willing to resume talks with the U.S. if the conditions were right.
“China’s door of dialogue and negotiation remains open, but any dialogue must be based on equality and mutual respect,” Wang said. “Any threats or pressure by one side will only be counterproductive.”

408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Investors Aren’t Prepared for an Exciting Japan,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Japan has, more or less, constantly been in the midst of the most radical monetary policy experiment in modern history since 2012. Is it working? It probably depends who you ask.
A brief recap: Abenomics (a program named after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that combined ultra-loose monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy and selective deregulation to boost the economy) sparked an extreme form of quantitative easing that saw the Bank of Japan print yen to buy almost all of the $9.5 trillion in Japanese government bonds outstanding, as well as a huge portion of the equity market via exchange-traded funds. 
The good news for Japan is that the yen is weaker, which has helped exporters. And while it’s hard to separate causation from correlation, deflation is no longer a persistent threat and the Japanese economy is arguably getting somewhat hot with the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest since the first half of the 1990s. These developments have not really gained widespread attention. In the public consciousness, most still think that Japan exists in a purgatory of deflation and bad demographics, but gross domestic product is starting to rise again, most notably on a nominal basis.
Investors should pay attention, because these changes come with special risks and challenges. In short, a hot Japan has the potential to blow up the world of macro investing. When an economy begins to accelerate, the typical response would be for longer-term bond yields to rise. But in Japan, they’re not permitted to do so. That’s because the BOJ’s QE program has morphed into something called yield curve control, where it buys as many bonds as needed to keep yields on 10-year notes from exceeding 0.1 percent. 
This means that as bond yields rise globally, a pseudo-arbitrage exists between Japan’s bond market and the rest of the world. In other words, if an investor can successfully borrow and short Japanese government bonds, or JGBs, with yields around 0 percent currently and buy 10-year U.S. Treasury notes at 3 percent, somewhat riskless profits are possible.
But therein lies the problem. In free markets, prices — especially interest rates — are signals that help determine the correct allocation of capital. The bond market in Japan, home to the world’s third-largest economy, no longer performs that function because the BOJ has purchased so many bonds that there are many days when nothing is traded. So that trade probably couldn’t be put in place because an investor couldn’t find any bonds to short. 
What would happen in a normal world is that speculators would aggressively short JGBs, driving up yields, strengthening the currency and holding off inflation. With yields pegged at zero, short selling JGBs simply results in more government bonds being bought by the BOJ — and the creation of a lot more yen, which will undoubtedly weaken.
That’s the theory, anyway, but it’s almost impossible to predict what can happen in some kind of economic zero-gravity environment, where the typical rules of supply and demand no longer exist. Although nobody really knows how this is going to play out, I can say with confidence that if the economy continues to strengthen and inflation rates rise further, the prospect of a hawkish BOJ is going to result in one of the biggest macro-investment challenges in memory.
If Japan spooks the bond market and yields skyrocket, the country faces a potential insolvency and possibly even default. At 224 percent of GDP, Japan's economy is more leveraged than Greece, where the debt-to-GDP is 180 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the U.S., it’s 77.4 percent. Some people think Japan doesn’t even have to exit QE, and all officials have to do is cancel out the debt and start over (which seems very inflationary). 
Japan has a large economy, and is underrepresented in the financial news relative to the size of that economy and the risks that it poses to the world. Foreign investors have lost a lot of money over the years attempting to short Japan’s markets, but for the first time in a long time it seems as though the trade might be closer to working. Nobody is prepared for a Japan that is a little more exciting."
409,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Pompeo Knocks China in Pitching U.S. Interests in Southeast Asia,"(Bloomberg) -- Secretary of State Michael Pompeo took not-so-subtle digs at China in pitching U.S. commitment to a “free and open” Indo-Pacific region despite President Donald Trump’s decision last year to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.
Pompeo, speaking Monday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce before a trip to Asia, said the U.S. believes in “strategic partnerships, not strategic dependency,” a veiled criticism of China’s efforts to woo countries with cheap financing for infrastructure projects and its Belt and Road Initiative, a project aimed at forging new economic ties with Europe, Asia and Africa.
“With American companies, citizens around the world know that what you see is what you get: honest contracts, honest terms and no need for off-the-books nonsense,” Pompeo said. Another advantage of the U.S., he said, is that “we will help them keep their people free from coercion or great power domination.”
Pompeo’s speech comes as the U.S. and China find themselves in an escalating trade war that economists warn could undermine global growth. The Trump administration is giving the public until Tuesday to comment on its plan to impose tariffs on a further $16 billion in Chinese imports. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last week that tensions with China are a “chronic problem” that could take years to resolve.
The secretary of state conceded that some nations may doubt U.S. commitments to the region after Trump quit talks over the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Pompeo said the U.S. is working to build “higher-standard” bilateral trade deals, though many Asia analysts and even House Speaker Paul Ryan say the U.S. decision was a mistake, partly because the TPP was intended as a counterbalance to China.
After the U.S. withdrawal, trade ministers from the 11 nations that stuck with TPP talks -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam -- signed a new agreement in Chile on March 8.
The new accord expands free-trade rules beyond agriculture and services, embracing the digital economy and adopting stronger protections for intellectual property. Unlike a traditional trade deal that merely covers the exchange of goods and services, there are broader requirements in areas such as labor issues, the environment and government procurement.
Bilateral Trade Deals
Pompeo’s speech didn’t suggest any change in the U.S. stance toward the agreement.
“While we work with our partners to craft better and higher-standard bilateral trade agreements, our companies are continuing to advance U.S. economic interests by growing their presence in the region,” Pompeo said.
Separately, one of Japan’s top policy makers indicated the government will resist U.S. efforts to create a bilateral free trade agreement between the two nations, saying it should return to the TPP instead.
Trump addressed the issue on Twitter in April, writing, “While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don’t like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.”
Pompeo delivered the speech as he prepares to travel to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia from Aug. 1-5 for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The top U.S. diplomat will also be seeking to ensure that countries remain committed to maintaining economic sanctions on North Korea.

410,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Why the Bank of England Will Probably Raise Rates, and Why It Might Not","(Bloomberg) -- There are still plenty of reasons why Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues might hold fire on an interest-rate increase this week.
Investors are betting there’s a 90 percent chance of a quarter-point hike to 0.75 percent on Thursday, which would be only the second increase since the financial crisis. That’s despite Brexit weighing on the U.K., and the economy is already lagging behind its peers.
“This isn’t a done deal,” said Dean Turner, U.K. economist at UBS Wealth Management.
Here are the reasons for and against.
The Data Say Go
In May, policy makers said that rates will need to go up a few times over the next three years to keep a lid on inflation if the economy performs as expected. Since then, the data have shown that growth picked up after a first-quarter slowdown.
Retail sales bounced back after a snow-blighted start to the year, employment is growing and the jobless rate has dropped to about 4 percent, the lowest since the 1970s. The bank’s growth forecast of 0.4 percent for the second quarter looks achievable.
At the same time, oil prices are up and the pound is back near a 10-month low, both of which will push inflation higher.
If Not Now, When?
Timing is key. Consumer-price growth is currently running at 2.4 percent, above the BOE’s 2 percent target, but it may not be there for long. Economists forecast it will be back at the goal by early next year, which could make selling a hike harder.
There’s also the argument that the BOE needs to get moving to get rates up before the next downturn if it wants to have decent space for cuts when they’re next needed.
Spending Splurge
Ultra-low interest rates since the financial crisis may be encouraging Britons to live beyond their means. Spending exceeded incomes in 2017 for the first time in three decades, a report last week showed.
“If there’s one thing that tips the balance it should be that,” said Andrew Sentance, a former BOE policy maker and currently an adviser at PwC. “Keeping interest rates the same isn’t the same as having neutral policy. If you keep going down that path you’ll hit a recession at some point.”
Brexit
On the other hand, the prospect of a disorderly exit from the European Union could be a reason to hold off. The U.K. is set to leave in March and it’s not yet clear what the future relationship will be like. If things go wrong, the BOE could quickly revert to crisis-fighting mode.
Carney himself said this month that having no deal in place could present a “financial stability event” for both Britain and the EU and the bank is preparing contingency measures.
Going Ballistic
For some, the growth background isn’t strong enough to withstand tighter policy. While the BOE argues that Brexit has reduced the supply capacity of the economy, meaning that domestic inflation will ramp up even at weaker rates of expansion, Britain is still an underperformer in Europe. Along with Italy, it will have the slowest growth of any EU country this year.
David Blanchflower, who sat on the BOE’s rate-setting committee from 2006 to 2009, said he’d go “ballistic” if rates are raised. “There’s no evidence of any kind -- no data, nothing -- to support it whatsoever.”
A marked pick-up in headline wage growth remains elusive and an anticipated acceleration in annual price gains failed to materialize in June. Stripping away external influences, domestic inflation is actually slowing toward its weakest rate since 2009.
Trade Wars
The tariff battle that the U.S. has initiated with both China and the EU has dominated the outlook for much of this year, and a full-blown trade war has implications for both growth and inflation.
For Sentance, that prospect shouldn’t be a major factor in the MPC’s decision because “there’ll always be something to worry about.”
Blanchflower, who has long been on the more dovish side of debates with Sentance, disagrees. The risk of escalating tariffs is a major threat to the economy and should be reason enough to wait on a rate move, he said.
Housing Slump
The U.K. housing market, which has traditionally underpinned consumption, is weakening after a three-decade boom. Asking prices fell for the first time in seven months, Rightmove Plc reported this month, and London in particular has been hit hard.
History
There are plenty of examples of premature rate hikes in central banking history, most recently when the European Central Bank raised interest rates in 2011 as the economy slid into recession. Economists at BofA Merrill Lynch,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and UBS Group AG have said there’s a chance that a BOE move now will look like a mistake in hindsight.
“The massive uncertainty -- mostly downside risk -- of Brexit makes it possible that they raise today and cut in November,” Willem Buiter, special economic adviser at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and former BOE policy maker, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “That would look a bit silly.”

411,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",WTO ruling derails bulk of Ukrainian trade dispute against Russia,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Ukraine lost the bulk of a legal dispute against Russia on Monday, when a World Trade Organization dispute panel struck out many of its arguments about Russia refusing to import Ukrainian railway equipment, a major export earner for Kiev. 
Ukraine complained to the WTO in 2015 after Russia suspended conformity assessment certificates for Ukrainian rolling stock, railroad switches and other railroad equipment, which Ukraine said amounted to an effective ban.
The ruling by the WTO panel of three adjudicators said Ukraine had failed to make the case that Russia was systematically blocking imports of its railway products.
Locomotives, rolling stock and other railway equipment had been Ukraine's most valuable export to Russia in 2011, before the diplomatic estrangement of the two former allies, accounting for $3.2 billion out of a total of $19.8 billion of export sales to Russia in that year. 
The value of the railway exports subsequently collapsed, and were worth less than $150 million annually in the past three years.
But the WTO ruled that the security situation was such that Russian inspectors sent to check that Ukraine's exports complied with Russian standards would have been risking their lives, and Russia was therefore justified in not sending them to Ukraine.
""The panel fully agreed with Russia's position and recognized that there was no systematic restriction of imports of Ukrainian equipment by Russia,"" Russia's Ministry of Trade and Economy said in a statement.
However, the WTO panel also said that Russia could have carried out the inspections outside Ukraine, and Russia had broken the rules by not accepting conformity assessment certificates issued by Belarus and Kazakhstan, its partners in the Eurasian Economic Union trading bloc. 
""With regard to the so-called non-recognition of certificates issued by the competent authorities of other EEU member states, Russia intends to act in full compliance with the contractual base of the EEU and the technical regulations of the Union,"" Russia's statement said.

Either side can appeal the ruling within 60 days.

The announcement comes at a time when trade frictions with China have given U.S. trade diplomacy a sharper edge.
A senior U.S. official said the investments were not aimed at countering China's Belt and Road Initiative, which consists of mostly state-led infrastructure projects linking Asia, parts of Africa and Europe. 
""These funds represent just a down payment on a new era in U.S. economic commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Pompeo said a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
He said he would visit Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia this week, where he would also announce new security assistance in the region. 
Pompeo said the United States ""will oppose any country"" which seeks to dominate the region in what appeared to be a reference to Beijing amid heightened tensions in the South China Sea.
""Like so many of our Asian allies and friends, our country fought for its own independence from an empire that expected deference,"" Pompeo said. ""We thus have never and will never seek domination in the Indo-Pacific, and we will oppose any country that does,"" he added.
Countries in the region have been worried by Trump's ""America first"" policy, withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, and pursuit of a trade conflict with China that threatens to disrupt regional supply chains.
The United States first outlined its strategy to develop the Indo-Pacific economy at an Asia-Pacific summit last year.
""Indo-Pacific"" has become known in diplomatic circles as shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of ""Asia-Pacific,"" which from some perspectives had authoritarian China too firmly at its center.
Among the new investments outlined by Pompeo, the United States will invest $25 million to expand U.S. technology exports to the region, add nearly $50 million this year to help countries produce and store their energy resources, and create a new assistance network to boost infrastructure development.
CHINA'S WAY, U.S. WAY
Speaking to reporters ahead of the speech, Brian Hook, senior policy adviser to Pompeo, said the United States was not competing with China's mostly state-led infrastructure initiatives.
""It is a made-in-China, made-for-China initiative,"" Hook told reporters on a conference call. ""Our way of doing things is to keep the government's role very modest and it's focused on helping businesses do what they do best.""
Critics of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to recreate the ancient Silk Road, say it is more about spreading Chinese influence and hooking countries on massive debts. Beijing says it is simply a development project that any country is welcome to join.
Hook said Washington ""welcomed"" Chinese contributions to regional development, but said it wanted China to adhere to international standards on transparency, the rule of law and sustainable financing.

""We know that America's model of economic engagement is the healthiest for nations in the region. It's high-quality, it's transparent and it is financially sustainable,"" Hook said.

The Guardian said that about 7,000 European based investment funds could be hit by regulators, citing a section of a presentation, seen by the newspaper, which made by Britain to EU negotiators during talks last week.
A spokeswoman for Britain's Department for Exiting the European Union declined to comment on the report.
Last week, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that he had agreed with Brexit minister Dominic Raab that future financial market access would be governed by autonomous decisions on both sides, but questions remain on how the relationship will work.
Many had pinned hopes on a bid for ""mutual recognition"" for the financial sector - whereby Britain and the EU would accept each other's rules in exchange for broad two-way market access - as the best way to protect financial contracts and activity worth trillions of euros once Britain exits the EU on March 29.
Prime Minister Theresa May has instead chosen to build trading ties on a legal mechanism known as ""equivalence"", whereby the EU deems a country's rules to be as robust as its own.
But critics said the regime exposed firms to sudden loss of EU market access, and  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' chairman told Reuters last week the government should act fast to negotiate ""expanded equivalence"".

1. Dollar Dips At Start Of Busy Week For Central Banks, Data
The U.S. dollar was a shade lower against its peers, as market participants awaited key central bank meetings this week that could set the near-term course for currencies.
Central banks in focus include the Bank of Japan, which ends a two-day meeting on Tuesday, and the Federal Reserve, which concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday. The Bank of England also makes a policy decision on Thursday.
There's also a gusher of economic reports in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to August from July, with data on U.S. inflation and payrolls in the spotlight.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% at 94.34, after dipping slightly on Friday, when upbeat second quarter U.S. gross domestic product data failed to lift the greenback, as markets had mostly priced in strong figures.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield ticking up to around 2.98%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near a two-decade high of 2.68%.
2. Another Big Week Of Earnings Kicks Off 
More than 140 companies listed on the S&P 500 are set to report corporate results in what will be the last big week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Monday sees  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), Loews (NYSE:L), Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN), Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH),  Diamond Offshore  (NYSE:DO), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) report ahead of the opening bell.
AK Steel (NYSE:AKS), Denny’s (NASDAQ:DENN), Rent-A-Center (NASDAQ:RCII), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), and KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) are due after the bell.
But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will get the most attention when it reports Tuesday after hours. The iPhone-maker's results will be closely watched after disappointing forecasts from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) last week shook investor belief in tech resilience.
Some of other high-profile tech names reporting this week are Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Sprint (NYSE:S), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Square (NYSE:SQ), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), CBS (NYSE:CBS), Teva Pharma (NYSE:TEVA), DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa).




3. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Lower Open 
U.S. stock futures looked set to kick off the week on a downbeat note, with the major indices on track to open with modest losses, as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings.
At 5:10AM ET, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 7 points, or about 0.1%, at the open. The blue-chip Dow futures and S&P 500 futures also indicated a slightly lower start to their respective trading sessions.
Wall Street fell on Friday, as disappointing results from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Twitter soured the mood on the Nasdaq.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses traded lower, with almost every sector in the red. Earlier, Asian stocks closed in negative territory, as markets took cues from declines in Wall Street's last session.
4. Oil Prices Edge Higher
In commodity markets, oil prices edged higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI outperforming thanks to recent upbeat news on the U.S. economy, but gains were limited as the fallout from trade tensions weighed on markets.
U.S. crude jumped 81 cents, or 1.2%, to $69.50 a barrel, while Brent, the global benchmark, tacked on 45 cents, or 0.6%, to $75.21.
The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter, but trade tensions remain high between Washington and Beijing despite an easing between the U.S. and the European Union.
5. Trump Threatens Government Shutdown
U.S. President Donald Trump called on Congress to enact sweeping immigration reform, including a border wall, and threatened a federal government shutdown if Democrats refused to back his proposals.
In a series of early Sunday morning posts on Twitter, the president lambasted Congress over immigration reform. He then threatened to shut down the government if Congress didn't move U.S. laws ""based on MERIT!""



Trump has threatened a shutdown several times since taking office in a bid to get immigration priorities in congressional spending bills, especially funding for a wall along the southern U.S. border. Trump has asked for $25 billion to build the wall.
Congress must agree on a spending measure to fund the government by a Sept. 30 deadline.

417,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>","China tempts Britain with free trade, says door to U.S. talks open","By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - China offered Britain talks on a post-Brexit free trade deal on Monday, reaching out to London as Beijing remains mired in an increasingly bitter trade war with Washington, even as a senior Chinese diplomat reiterated its door remained open for dialogue.
China has been looking for allies in its fight with the United States, initiated by the Trump administration, which says China's high-tech industries have stolen intellectual property from American firms and demanded Beijing act to buy more U.S. products to reduce a $350 billion trade surplus.
Britain has pushed a strong message to Chinese companies that it is fully open for business as it prepares to leave the European Union next year, and China is one of the countries with which Britain would like to sign a post-Brexit free trade deal.
Speaking to reporters in Beijing after meeting British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said both countries agreed to step up trade with and investment in each other.
Hunt said Wang had made an offer ""to open discussions about a possible free trade deal done between Britain and China post Brexit"".
""That's something that we welcome and we said that we will explore,"" Hunt said, without elaborating.
Wang, standing next to Hunt at a state guest house in the western suburbs of Beijing, made no direct mention of the free trade talks offer but said both countries had ""agreed to proactively join up each others' development strategies, and expand the scale of trade and mutual investment"".
China and Britain should also oppose trade protectionism and uphold global free trade, Wang added.
While a trade pact with China would be a political win for Britain's government, formal talks cannot begin until it officially leaves the EU next year. Free trade talks typically take many years to conclude.
CHINA-U.S. TRADE TENSIONS
In the briefing, Wang again slammed Washington for intransigence and intentionally hyping up the idea that the United States is the real victim in their trade dispute.
""The responsibility for the trade imbalance between China and the United States lies not with China,"" Wang said, citing the global role of the U.S. dollar, low U.S. savings rates, huge levels of U.S. consumption and U.S. restrictions on high tech exports as amongst the reasons.
The United States has benefited a great deal from trade with China, getting lots of cheap goods, which is good for U.S. consumers, and U.S. companies benefit hugely in China too, he added.
Both China and the United States had appeared to have avoided a full-scale trade war in May, with China agreeing to buy more U.S. agriculture and energy products, but the deal collapsed and the two sides slapped import tariffs on their respective goods.
Washington has since threatened to set tariffs on an additional $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, and no formal negotiations between the two countries have taken place since early June.
China says it is committed to resolving the dispute via talks, and has appealed to other countries to support it in upholding free trade and the multilateral trading system, though European countries in particular have many of the same market access complaints as the United States.
Wang said the current tensions were initiated by the United States, and the two should resolve their issues under the World Trade Organization framework, rather than in accordance with U.S. law.
""China does not want to fight a trade war, but in the face of this aggressive attitude from the United States and violation of rights, we cannot but and must take countermeasures,"" he said
China and the United States have had talks and had reached a consensus, but the United States did not meet China half way, he noted.

""China's door to dialogue and negotiations is always open, but dialogue needs to be based on equality and mutual respect and on rules,"" Wang said. ""Any unilateral threats and pressure will only have the opposite effect.

""The low road will cost jobs, growth, and stability. The high road can support a more inclusive and resilient globalization.""
Asked about the increase in U.S. trade tariffs under President Donald Trump, Carney said the impact of actions taken as of June were likely to be small. 
""However, a larger increase in tariffs would have a substantial impact"" and there would also be indirect effects on the economy via business confidence and overall financial conditions, he said.
Carney said global interest rates might eventually return to their pre-financial crisis averages, which in Britain was around 5 percent - 10 times their current level - ""but a lot of things have to go right in order for that to be the case.""
The Bank of England's top policymakers are due to publish a first estimate this week of the so-called equilibrium level of interest rates that will keep inflation and growth rates stable when the economy is running at full capacity.
Carney told Bloomberg it was ""more likely than not"" that the equilibrium rate had begun to rise.
""But any given jurisdiction has to take into account its own domestic forces, whether there are headwinds from fiscal policy, headwinds from uncertainty, headwinds from trade discussions or other factors,"" he said.
Carney said banks might face a ""disorderly Brexit stress test"" in March next year if London and Brussels fail to strike a deal over their future relationship in time for Britain's departure from the European Union.
He also said EU countries were unlikely to replicate London's global standing as a financial center. 

""In some circles in Europe there is a greater predisposition to ring-fence financial activities,"" he said. ""That could lead to a very large but effectively local financial center in Europe, as opposed to a global financial center, which I believe London will continue to be.""

420,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",How to Gauge the Fed’s Reaction to Trump's Tweet,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Judging from commentary in markets late last week, an additional factor now features in the calculus of some Fed watchers as they look forward to this week’s two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting: how will policy makers respond to President Donald Trump’s tweets suggesting that the central bank refrain from raising interest rates and risk “taking away our big competitive edge.”
Opinions vary a great deal, and for understandable reasons. Some feel that the Federal Reserve policy makers will go out of its way to ignore the pressure while others believe that it will have no choice but to be influenced by the president’s remarks. Within this latter group, there is even disagreement on how this influence will play out. With that, comes a higher risk of a policy mistake at a complicated time for central banking around the world.
Appreciating this, the Fed is likely to decide on policies and behave -- both internally and externally -- as if Trump’s remarks were never made. Yet, the Fed may have a difficult time avoiding misinterpretations of what it ends up doing and why.
The issue of political challenges for central banks is a longstanding one. History is full of cases of both overt and behind-the-scene politically motivated demands on these institutions to be more stimulative. A brief survey of them points to three basic things that traders and investors may wish to keep in mind as they think about how the Fed will -- and should -- respond this week.
No. 1. The influence of politics on central banks is not a new issue
The Fed has had a variable relationship with U.S. political leaders. To this day, Arthur Burns, Fed chairman from 1970 to 1978, is remembered for succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to relax monetary policy in the run up to the 1972 election. This pressure was imposed both directly in face-to-face meetings (including Nixon urging Burns to “think of goosing it … late summer and fall of this year and next year”) and indirectly through newspaper leaks and threats to structurally increase the White House’s control of the institution. It followed earlier (and unsuccessful) attempts by President Lyndon Johnson to persuade Fed Chairman Willian McChesney Martin, to ease policy -- including one meeting in which Johnson is said to have complained that “my boys are dying in Vietnam, and you won’t print the money I need.” President George H.W. Bush, in the middle of a hotly contested re-election bid in 1992, also tried to not-so-subtly influence the Fed, saying “I’d like to see another lowering of interest rates.… I can understand people worrying about inflation. But I don’t think that’s the big problem now.”
The Fed isn't the only central bank dealing with political issues these days. Politicians haven't been shy in expressing strong opinions about the policies of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.
Of course, the most egregious cases of persistent political influence on central banks come in emerging markets, and the outcome has typically included some mix of inflation, domestic and external financial turmoil and a de-stabilizing run on reserves. In the last few months it has been playing out most visibly for markets in countries such as Argentina and Turkey where concerns about political interference have led to considerable instability in exchange rates and risk spreads. And then there is Venezuela where heavy government interference in the central bank's operations has helped fuel an inflation rate that is heading to 1 million percent, according to the latest International Monetary Fund assessment.
No. 2. Political pressure tends to put central banks in a lose-lose position
No central banker wishes to wake up to news of increased political pressure.
Resistance would risk antagonizing politicians and exposing the central bank to bigger and more enduring structural damage. But agreeing to political demands that have no economic justification would lead to central banks abrogating their policy objectives. And whatever they end up doing, communication is always very tricky -- exposing the institution to major reputational harm and other risks.
No. 3. That’s why central banks prize their structural autonomy so much, as do economists
Because of all this, many central banks have sought and secured varying degrees of autonomy. In many cases, this involves the freedom to decide on the tools to use to meet objectives that, although specified by politicians, are not easy to change. (This is what economists call instrument independence but not goal independence.) To make sure that structure does the heavy lifting, central-bank autonomy is often established by legislation.
The desirability of central-bank autonomy is one of the few things that the vast majority of economists readily agree on. It is seen to have played a key role in breaking inflationary spirals, including in the 1970s, that disrupted many advanced and emerging economies. And, when just less than 10 years ago the global economy was facing the real and present danger of falling into a devastating multiyear depression, autonomy ensured that central banks had the leeway to deploy unconventional policies. That is something for which we should all be grateful.
With this as background, expect the Fed to respond -- very carefully -- in the following way to Trump's tweets:

This, however, will not make the Fed’s public communication task any easier. Indeed, whatever the Fed decides to do, it will be blamed by someone somewhere to have fallen under the influence of the president in one of two ways: Succumbing to his pressures if it decides on Wednesday not to signal high likelihood of a rate hike in September; and, should it indeed send such a signal, be accused by some to have gone too hawkish in order to show that it prizes its independence.
There are good reasons why so many have warned politicians away from commenting on central banks. We will likely see some of the underlying reasoning play out again this week even though the Fed will end up behaving exactly as it would have had Trump not commented on its policies."
421,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Malaysia mulls curbs on foreign car imports, says PM Mahathir","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia may consider restrictions on foreign car imports to protect the country's ""infant industry"", Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday.
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy had liberalized its automotive industry over the past decade, allowing for cheaper imports but at the expense of local automaker Proton which struggled to stay afloat as it faced increased competition.
""All the countries which produce motor vehicles have got restrictions, either on standards or because of taxes... so we need to protect our infant industry,"" Mahathir said at a press conference at the parliament lobby.
""We may think about the standards (to impose). We also may have to consider certain weaknesses that we have, which should be protected,"" the 93-year-old prime minister said, without elaborating.
Besides Proton, the other Malaysian automakers are Perodua and Naza. Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Toyota (T:7203) and Nissan (T:7201) sell both imported and locally assembled units in the Southeast Asian country.
Perodua is the domestic market leader, with about 40 percent share in 2017, according to data from the Malaysian Automotive Association. Japan's Honda is the top-selling foreign brand in Malaysia, with about 21 percent market share last year, the data shows.
Proton was founded in 1983 in an industrialization push during Mahathir's previous tenure as prime minister. Its domestic market share peaked at 74 percent a decade later as drivers took advantage of cheap loans as the government encouraged Malaysians to buy home-grown products.
But lower-standard cars, limited after-sales service and competition from foreign automakers saw its domestic market share drop, to around 14 percent in 2017, according to data from the automotive association.
Proton received a boost last year, when Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd [GEELY.UL] bought a 49.9 percent stake in the Malaysian car company. The deal marked Geely's first push into Southeast Asia.
Earlier, during question time, Mahathir said developed countries have used conditions such as Euro 5 emission standards and certain tax structures to work around free trade arrangements and block Malaysian car exports.
""But we are very open. Every car that is produced, even if it is made using Milo tins, can enter Malaysia,"" Mahathir said, referring to a beverage popular in the country.

""That is why we need to study the possibility of certain conditions, so that foreign cars cannot enter so easily into our country and also give Proton and local cars the chance to dominate the local market.""

424,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Charles Koch Says Trump Tariffs Could Trigger U.S. Recession,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Charles Koch said Sunday he worries President Donald Trump’s actions on trade and tariffs put the booming U.S. economy at risk of recession.
“It depends on the degree” of the trade conflict that the U.S. pursues with countries such as China and Canada, Koch said in Colorado during a rare on-the-record meeting with reporters. “If it’s severe enough it could” end in recession.
“Any protectionism at any level, and certainly at the national level, is very detrimental,” Koch said. “Every nation that’s prospered is one that didn’t engage in trade wars.”
It would be “disastrous,” Koch said, if the U.S. were to “completely close” itself off from trading with other nations. The Trump administration hasn’t proposed that step. But Trump said this month, for example, that he was ready to put tariffs on all goods imported from China. “I’m ready to go to 500,” Trump said on CNBC on July 19, referring to $500 billion.
National Security
Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in the name of national security, as well as duties on certain Chinese products in response to allegations of intellectual property theft. That’s drawn retaliatory tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. goods in an escalating conflict, although Trump struck a truce with the European Union last week pending further negotiations.
The U.S. economy in the second quarter expanded at its strongest pace since 2014, the government reported on Friday. But many economists see growth tailing off from here, and the potential for a trade war are part of their assessments.
Charles and brother David Koch didn’t support Trump in the 2016 campaign, but the conservative political and policy donor network they built has since praised his administration’s efforts to cut taxes and regulations. A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Koch’s comments came as donors to the network are gathered for a three-day meeting at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs.
The network, with more than 700 donors who give at least $100,000 per year, has convened such gatherings twice annually since 2003. It has long opposed protectionism and promoted the benefits of free trade, as have other most other groups aligned with Republicans.
Battleground States
So far this weekend, the network sought to downplay its role in this year’s midterm congressional campaign, even as ads it paid for have hammered Democrats in battleground states. Planned spending on campaign-associated activities was prominent when the network last assembled in January.
Since then, analysts and polling have increasingly suggested Democrats have a good chance of winning control of the U.S. House in November’s midterm elections, in line with historical trends. The party needs a net gain of 23 seats to do that.
In June, the Koch network said it was planning a “multi-year, multi-million-dollar” campaign to promote free trade and oppose Trump’s moves to impose tariffs. The effort is to include advertising, voter mobilization and lobbying.
Some of the elected officials attending the gathering include Governor Rick Scott of Florida, who’s running for U.S. Senate; Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin; Senator John Cornyn of Texas; Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina; Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who’s running for U.S. Senate; Representative Doug Collins of Georgia; and Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who’s running for governor. All are Republicans.
Plans call for the network to spend about $400 million on state and federal policy and politics during the two-year cycle that culminates with November’s balloting, a 60 percent increase over 2015-16. Besides trying to influence electoral politics, the network also works on education, criminal justice, workforce and poverty issues.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 12:37PM ET</span>",Protesters chant anti-Putin slogans at Moscow rally against retirement age plan,"By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Thousands protested in central Moscow on Sunday against a proposed increase to the retirement age and the crowd chanted slogans critical of President Vladimir Putin whose approval ratings have been dented by the bill.
The rally organized by the opposition Libertarian Party chanted ""Putin is a thief"" and ""away with the tsar,"" slogans common at anti-Putin and anti-government protests.
The retirement age proposal is politically sensitive for Putin, who was re-elected in March, because it has prompted a series of protests across Russia since it was announced on June 14, the day Russia played the first match of its soccer World Cup.
Around 90 percent of the population oppose the bill, according to a recent opinion poll, and a petition against it has attracted 3 million signatures online.
More than 6,000 people came to Sunday's rally some 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the Kremlin, according to White Counter, an NGO that counts participants at rallies using metal detector frames. Police put the number at around 2,500.
People held placards with slogans against the higher retirement age and one read: ""stop stealing our future"". Authorities detained two protest organizers, Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister and now an opposition campaigner, told Reuters.
The proposal to raise the retirement age, to 65 from 60 for men and to 63 from 55 for women, is part of an unpopular budget package designed to shore up government finances that is backed by lawmakers.
Putin, who once promised not to raise the retirement age, has tried to distance himself from the pension plan.
This month he said he did not like any of the proposals. He said Russia could avoid raising the retirement age for years, though a decision would have to be made eventually.
""We have to proceed not from emotions, but from the real assessment of economic conditions and prospects of its development and (the development of) the social sphere,"" Putin said.
On Saturday, more than 12 thousand rallied on the same street in Moscow, according to the White Counter data.
The changes to the retirement age would be introduced gradually, starting in 2019, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said when presenting the plan. Officials said the measure should help to raise an average pension in Russia, now at around 14,400 rubles ($229.52).

""I don't think this is a one- or two-year phenomenon. I think we definitely are in a period of four or five years of sustained 3 percent growth at least,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with 'Fox News Sunday.'
The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter - at a 4.1 percent rate - as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July.
Economists have cautioned against putting much weight on the surge, with the soybean boost seen likely to reverse in the coming quarters and the fiscal stimulus seen fading in 2019.
"
427,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 05:34AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things To Watch This Week,"Investing.com - The coming week will be dominated by several market-moving events, with the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting, July's jobs report and earnings from tech bellwether Apple on the agenda.
Markets are also keeping an eye on Europe amid widespread speculation the Bank of England will finally raise interest rates above their emergency levels set more than nine years ago.
Elsewhere, in Asia, the Bank of Japan's policy meeting is expected to be a focus point for investors, following chatter it could soon start scaling back its massive monetary stimulus.
Meantime, investors will be keeping abreast of the ongoing trade spat between the U.S. and major economies, such as China and the European Union, to see if any more news materializes.
$16 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to be implemented on Wednesday, with China expected to put tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods in return. These tariffs are part of a bigger, $50 billion package that had been put in place earlier in July.
Trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies have stalled and not yet been restarted, according to Chinese and U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
At the same time, concerns over a transatlantic trade war eased somewhat following a positive meeting last week between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
The Trump administration was also making progress with Mexico and Canada toward a revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions having an impact on global economic growth.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. Federal Reserve Rate Decision
The Federal Reserve is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting at 2:00PM ET on Wednesday, keeping it in a range between 1.75%-2.0%.
The central bank will release its post-meeting statement as investors look for any clues on whether it will follow through with rate hikes in September and again in December.
The Fed has forecast it will raise rates two more times in 2018, having already tightened policy twice this year.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said recently that the case for continued gradual rate hikes remains strong, signaling that borrowing costs will continue to climb this year despite the recent market volatility caused by the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
Traders are currently pricing in around a 90% chance of a third rate hike in September, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a fourth rate hike by December was seen at about 70%.
2. U.S. Jobs Report
There's a gusher of economic reports in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to August from July, with the monthly employment data in the spotlight.
The U.S. Labor Department will release the nonfarm payrolls report for July at 8:30AM ET on Friday, and it will be watched more for what it says about wages than hiring.
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 190,000, after adding 213,000 positions in June, while the unemployment rate is seen inching down to 3.9% from 4.0%.
However, most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.3%, a tad faster than the 0.2% increase a month earlier. On an annualized basis, wages are forecast to increase 2.8%, the same gain reported in June.
This week's economic calendar also features reports on personal income and spending, which includes the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation.
Top-tier data on CB consumer confidence, ADP private sector payrolls, car sales, trade figures, construction spending and the ISM surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity will also be on the agenda.
3. Apple Highlights Another Busy Week Of Earnings
About a quarter of S&P 500 companies report in what will be the last big week for second-quarter earnings.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will get the most attention when it reports Tuesday after the closing bell. The iPhone-maker follows a string of tech earnings that have been largely positive, with the glaring exceptions of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which all suffered massive sell-offs after disappointing forecasts.
Some of other high-profile tech names reporting this week are  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), Loews (NYSE:L), AK Steel (NYSE:AKS), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Sprint (NYSE:S), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Square (NYSE:SQ), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Teva (NYSE:TEVA), DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC).



4. Bank of England Rate Announcement
The Bank of England (BoE) will announce its rate decision at 1200GMT (8:00AM ET) on Thursday. If all goes as scripted, the British central bank will nudge rates up to 0.75%, going beyond last November's increase back up to 0.5%.
It would be symbolic as it would get BoE rates above the emergency lows of the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown for the first time, but with a potentially messy Brexit nearing, Governor Mark Carney may sound cautious about further moves.
Markets are not pricing in another hike for at least a year.
Besides the BoE, traders will focus on a trio of reports on activity in the manufacturing, construction and services sectors for further indications on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy.
The terms of Britain's future relationship with the European Union are still unclear, eight months before Brexit, and Prime Minister Theresa May could yet be unseated by her own Conservative Party which is split on how close the country should remain to the bloc.
5. Bank Of Japan Policy Meeting 
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is widely expected to start preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Tuesday.
Media reports last week indicated that the BoJ is now considering adjusting its massive stimulus program to make it more sustainable, such as allowing greater swings in interest rates and widening its stock-buying selection.
The changes, although small, would be the first since 2016 and the latest sign Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is gradually walking away from his radical stimulus program deployed five years ago to shock the public out of a sticky deflationary mindset.
After half a decade of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation, the BoJ is under pressure to address the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as the hit to bank profits from near-zero rates, which would require raising rates.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Global auto powers plotting response to Trump auto tariff threats,"By Anthony Esposito and David Ljunggren
MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico and South Korea will meet in Geneva next week to discuss how to respond to threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on U.S. imports of autos and car parts, officials familiar with the talks said.
The Trump administration has come under heavy criticism from automakers, foreign governments and others as it considers tariffs of up to 25 percent, a levy critics warn will hike vehicle costs, hurting auto sales and global industry jobs.
Several auto manufacturing powers have been talking to each other in recent days about their fears and a possible coordinated response to Trump's ""Section 232"" investigation, which he ordered on May 23, into whether auto imports are a threat to U.S. security, sources say.
The probe could be completed within weeks, although similar ones ordered last year that led to tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum took about 10 months. The Commerce Department has 270 days to offer recommendations to the president after such a probe starts. He then has 90 days to act upon them.
It was not immediately clear what kind of response the countries could be looking at, although Canada, the EU and Mexico retaliated with their own tariffs after Trump imposed levies on steel and aluminum imports in March. Another option is to fight the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Deputy ministers will gather in Geneva on July 31 to hear each other's views, a Canadian official and a Mexican official told Reuters, asking to not be named because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
""The meeting is meant to bring together major auto producing nations so we can discuss our concerns over the U.S. Department of Commerce's Section 232 investigation of automobiles and parts,"" said the Canadian government official.
Mexico's economy ministry confirmed Deputy Economy Minister Juan Carlos Baker will travel to Geneva for ""work meetings about several subjects,"" including meeting World Trade Organization (WTO) chief Roberto Azevedo. The Canadian foreign ministry declined to comment.
According to the WTO website, Azevedo will meet Baker on Monday, followed by Canada's Deputy Trade Minister Timothy Sargent and Japan's Senior Deputy Foreign Minister Kazuyuki Yamazaki on Tuesday. The Mexican official said the meetings were related to the auto tariff issue.
Eventual tariffs on autos could hit companies including Korea's Hyundai Motor Co, Japan's Toyota Motor Corp and Germany's BMW, as well as global factories for U.S. brands General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
Trump's agreement on Wednesday to refrain from imposing car tariffs on the EU in return for reduced trade barriers for U.S. products has helped cool fears of a trade war, but his final decision will not be known until the security investigation is concluded in coming months.
The U.S. automakers lowered their full-year profit forecasts on Wednesday due to the trade frictions, and their stocks fell as investors bet the disputes would hurt margins and sales.
Although hopes of a breakthrough in U.S.-EU trade talks boosted carmakers on Thursday, the planned meetings are a sign that auto-producing nations want to prepare for the worst.
MANAGED TRADE
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland raised the need for ""cooperation by major interested nations"" regarding the U.S. auto investigation during a meeting in Ottawa with South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong last week, the South Korean ministry said in a statement after the meeting.
On a tour that also took in the United States, Kim broached the idea of working together to face tariffs at a meeting of the Pacific Alliance trade bloc in Mexico on Monday, said another Mexican official and a diplomat with knowledge of the matter, asking to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak about it.
Officials consulted by Reuters in Canada, Mexico and South Korea all said such discussions were preliminary, with another Canadian official characterizing them as comparing notes on the state of play of the tariff investigation, rather than discussing a coordinated reaction in detail.
""We have checked and listened to each other's stance. However, as the auto tariff probe is still under way, it's hard to know how things will turn out at this stage,"" said a South Korean trade ministry official who declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media.
""(Probe) results should come out first to work on a joint response,"" the official said.
Canada is concerned South Korea may achieve an exemption that would give it a competitive advantage, the diplomat said, after the Asian country accepted quotas on its steel exports in return for an exemption from the metals tariffs that hit Canada, Mexico and other allies.
Ahn Dukgeun, a Seoul National University professor who advises the government on trade matters, said South Korea's government was divided over what course to take.
""South Korea is at crossroads,"" he said, on whether to ""deepen managed trade"" with the United States or to get tough, such as complaining to the WTO and using retaliatory tariffs.
Because of varying domestic rules on tariff retaliation, coordinating any action between several countries ""quickly becomes fiendishly difficult,"" the diplomat said.
""The idea is that we want to know that if we go to the WTO, if we use NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) in our case or if we retaliate,"" our partners will be doing similar things, said the diplomat.
The conversations are more intense than before the steel and aluminum tariffs, the diplomat and the Canadian official said. One reason may be that countries now know Trump does not hesitate to pull the trigger on tariffs.
Another is the economic weight of the auto industry. The United States imported $173 billion of cars and $70 billion of auto parts in 2016, compared to $21 billion of steel.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>","G20 agriculture ministers slam protectionism, pledge WTO reforms","By Scott Squires and Luc Cohen
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Agriculture ministers from the G20 countries criticized protectionism in a joint statement on Saturday, and vowed to reform World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but did not detail what steps they would take to improve the food trade system.
In the statement, they said they were ""concerned about the increasing use of protectionist non-tariff trade measures, inconsistently with WTO rules.""
The ministers from countries including the United States and China, in Buenos Aires for the G20 meeting of agriculture ministers, said in the statement they had affirmed their commitment not to adopt ""unnecessary obstacles"" to trade, and affirmed their rights and obligations under WTO agreements.
The meeting came amid rising trade tensions that have rocked agricultural markets. China and other top U.S. trade partners have placed retaliatory tariffs on American farmers after the Trump administration put duties on Chinese goods as well as steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
U.S. growers are expected to take an estimated $11 billion hit due to China's retaliatory tariffs. Last week, the Trump administration said it would pay up to $12 billion to help farmers weather the trade war.
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the meeting that Trump's plan would include between $7 billion and $8 billion in direct cash relief that U.S. farmers could see as early as late September.
Despite the payments, the measures are ""not going to make farmers whole,"" Perdue said.
Citing the Trump administration's relief measures, German Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner said farmers ""don't need aid, (they) need trade.""
""We had a very frank discussion about the fact that we don't want unilateral protectionist measures,"" Kloeckner said in a news conference after the meeting. 
The ministers, whose countries represent 60 percent of the world's agricultural land and 80 percent of food and agricultural commodities trade, did not specify which measures they were referring to in the statement. Asked for details, Kloeckner said the ministers did not want to ""criticize a single country.""
""We all know what happens if a single person or country doesn't adhere to WTO rules, trying to get a benefit for themselves through protectionism,"" she said. ""This will usually lead to retaliatory tariffs.""
In the statement, the ministers said they agreed to continue reforming the WTO's agricultural trade rules.
""Independent of all the news there was surrounding (the meeting), we managed to reach a unanimous consensus,"" Argentine Agriculture Minister Luis Miguel Etchevehere said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker struck a surprise deal on Wednesday that ended the risk of further escalating trade tensions between the two powers.
After the meeting, Trump said the European Union would buy ""a lot"" of U.S. soybeans.

Earlier, Kloeckner told Reuters that the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union was improving, but that there was no guarantee the bloc would import the quantity of soybeans that Washington expects.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The trade relationship between the United States and Europe is improving, German Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner said on Saturday, but there is no guarantee the bloc will buy the quantity of soybeans that Washington expects.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the EU's executive body, struck a surprise deal on Wednesday that ended the risk of an immediate trade war between the two powers.
After the talks, Trump highlighted benefits for U.S. farmers. ""The European Union is going to start, almost immediately, to buy a lot of soybeans,"" he told reporters.
Kloeckner, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, said the amount of soy Europe will import is yet to be determined.
""Will we be able to do whatever President Trump wishes for? I don't know. Let's see whether this will be the case or not,"" she said.
The EU was expected to import 15.3 million tonnes of soybeans in the 2018/19 crop year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on July 12. The United States is the world's No. 2 exporter of the oilseed after Brazil.
After Wednesday's meeting at the White House, Trump agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the European Union and the United States start talks on cutting other trade barriers. 
Trump faced a backlash from some U.S. Midwestern farmers and lawmakers after announcing on Tuesday a $12 billion aid package intended as a temporary boost to growers hit by the escalating trade war between the United States and China.
China imposed tariffs of farm products including soybeans after Washington slapped duties on Chinese goods.
""A lot of U.S. farmers are currently under a lot of pressure caused primarily by the reactive tariffs and they are suffering a lot,"" Kloeckner said.
""If you keep in mind that a lot of these farmers are supporters of President Trump, they have really felt the pressure. I think this has really helped Trump to understand that these tariffs can be potentially harmful and he has now reined in and we are moving towards a more positive situation,"" she said. 
Other European officials also expressed relief after Trump and Juncker agreed to tackle their transatlantic trade dispute.
""It's a good thing for both the EU and the United States to have come together and agree to keep their conversation going, instead of seeing an exacerbation of the trade dispute,"" Kloeckner added.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>","Iran woos local investors as U.S. sanctions loom, currency falls","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran plans to offer price and tax incentives to private investors to take over idle state projects and help boost the economy, state media reported on Saturday, as the country faces likely U.S. sanctions and the exit of many foreign companies.
In May the United States pulled out of a multinational deal to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program, and Washington has told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures.
The new Iranian plan, along with action against alleged financial crime, appears to be aimed at easing concern over the U.S. decision.
The probable return of sanctions has triggered a rapid fall of Iran’s currency, protests by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers, and a public outcry over alleged profiteering.
The plan will offer attractive prices and flexible terms as well as tax holidays for investors who agree to take over some of the 76,000 government projects which are unfinished or idle, Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri said on state television.
""Over the past few months, the country's liquidity has gone into housing, foreign exchange and gold coins, raising prices and provoking public concerns,"" Jahangiri was quoted as saying by the website of the state broadcaster.
""A main issue in the meeting ... was to find solutions to push liquidity towards employment and activating manufacturing,"" Jahangiri added after the meeting attended by President Hassan Rouhani, and the heads of parliament and the judiciary.
PULLING OUT 
The sanctions start to come into effect in August but some European companies investing in Iran and with big U.S. operations have already announced they will pull out of business deals with Tehran. 
The Iranian rial plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Saturday. The dollar was offered for as much as 97,500 rials, compared to about 85,500 a week ago, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com.
The currency has lost more than half of its value this year because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions.
Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Saturday that 18 people had been arrested over alleged profiteering from foreign exchange dealings and the illegal importing of luxury cars, state television reported.
In late December, demonstrations which began over economic hardship spread to more than 80 Iranian cities and towns. At least 25 people died in the unrest, the biggest expression of public discontent in almost a decade.

Demonstrators initially vented their anger over high prices and alleged corruption, but the protests took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to increase soy imports in a deal reached with U.S. President Donald Trump, under which Washington will suspend the imposition of new tariffs on the EU.
Kloeckner told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper she saw ""no disadvantages for European farmers of any kind"" as a result of the decision because Germany and the EU were dependent on soy imports to meet demand for animal feed.
Europe had previously relied on soy imports from South America, but would now shift its demand to U.S. suppliers, she told the paper. 
Wednesday's surprise deal suspends the imposition of a proposed U.S. 25 percent levy on auto imports, with Washington and Brussels to hold talks over tariffs on imports of European steel and aluminum. The agreement sent shares higher as fears of a transatlantic trade war ebbed.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>","California farmers and Mexican cheese sales, U.S. trade war takes a toll","By Jane Ross
TULARE, Calif. (Reuters) - Stephen Mancebo, a fourth-generation California dairy farmer with 2,300 cows, has battled ups and downs in his temperamental industry for a quarter-century only to find himself a casualty of a U.S trade war with one of his biggest customers - Mexico.
Mancebo, 47, represents one of approximately 1,300 dairy farm families eking out a living in California on the narrow margins of an enterprise that increasingly relies on exports.
For Mancebo and other U.S. dairy farmers and processors who turn milk into cheese, butter and other products, the trade war is threatening to snuff out a nascent rebound from three years of slumping prices that have driven nearly 140 California dairies out of business.
In retaliation for tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports of steel and aluminum, Mexico in late May announced duties on cheeses, other farm products and metals from the United States.
Milk and cheese prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a key part of the formula that determines what dairy producers are paid, faltered immediately on expectations Mexico's tariffs would translate into U.S. surpluses.
The extent of export disruption has yet to be quantified. But sudden downturns in demand are challenging for dairy farmers, whose means of production need to be fed and milked on a daily basis.
""Our product is perishable. I can't sit on my milk for a month or two months,"" Mancebo told Reuters outside his dairy in Tulare, in California's Central Valley. ""These cows can't be shut off."" 
After several years of showing little if any profit, Mancebo said he had been looking forward to a turnaround in prices that might have netted his operation $50,000 to $80,000 a month later this year, allowing him to break even for 2018.
""Most months I don't make anything, so to take that, it's a considerable loss at this time,"" said Mancebo, whose support for Trump has been undiminished despite the effect of the trade policies.
CALIFORNIA MOST VULNERABLE
The United States is Mexico's leading foreign supplier of dairy goods, including nearly $400 million in cheese last year. Dairy operators in California, the nation's top milk-producing state, are especially vulnerable to Mexico's 25 percent cheese tariffs.
California dairies, like Mancebo's, export 30 percent of all they produce, compared with 17 percent for U.S. dairies on average, and Mexico is their No. 1 buyer.
California accounted for 35 percent of U.S. cheese exports to Mexico alone last year, estimated at 33,600 metric tons (74 million-plus pounds), said economist Annie AcMoody of the trade group Western United Dairymen.
But beyond immediate price swings, U.S. dairy exporters worry about losing hard-earned market share to the European Union, which has just reached a free-trade accord with Mexico.
In a letter sent to the White House last month, 65 dairy producers, processors and cooperatives from around the country urged Trump to reach an accommodation with Mexico.
The $12 billion aid package Trump announced this week to offset damage to farmers from the trade war could potentially replace some short-term income losses, but it will do nothing to rebuild any market share seized by foreign competitors, said Bill Schiek, economist for the Dairy Institute of California.
Concerns also are growing that China could retaliate against U.S. tariffs with a fresh set of duties on U.S. dairy.
Schiek said anecdotal evidence shows orders are being canceled in anticipation of export demands softening as Mexico's duties add to the cost of made-in-America cheese, and buyers there turn elsewhere for supplies.
AcMoody said that even minor fluctuations can undercut American dairy producers because international pricing is so competitive.

Mancebo said that even as Trump's policies are hurting him, he backs the measures: ""Our trade deficit needed to be addressed.""And it was going to be a struggle whenever it happened,"" he said. ""So it's kind of like holding our breath. Problem is, we're holding our breath underwater.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiating teams for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are ready to kick off talks again after they stalled last month.
NAFTA talks between the United States, Mexico and Canada had stalled since June when the United States imposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum. Both countries responded with levies on products including U.S. pork, ketchup and Kentucky bourbon.
""I think we have agreed on the process and the method on how to start solving from the less complex to the most complex issues and that's the way we're approaching this,"" said Guajardo, who is in Washington for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
Mexico and the United States agreed on Thursday to step up talks on updating NAFTA in hopes of reaching an agreement on major issues by August, after Guajardo had what he described as ""constructive"" and ""very positive"" talks with Lighthizer and Kushner.
Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto said in Mexico City on Friday that he hoped the accelerated talks would allow for a deal in August.
Asked if Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland will join the talks soon, Guajardo said: ""What I am expecting is that we have to engage with Canada, either two bilaterals, one trilateral, whatever we agree to.""
Freeland visited Mexico on Wednesday and she and Guajardo insisted that NAFTA remain a trilateral pact, in response to Trump's suggestion that he could seek a bilateral deal with Mexico.
Guajardo was joined in Washington by Jesus Seade, whom Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has tipped as his lead trade negotiator.
Mexico's government said in a statement that teams from both nations would continue to work over the coming days to prepare for an upcoming ministerial meeting.
""NAFTA talks seem to be entering another wave of optimism now that the Mexican election has been decided ... But we should not rush to pop the champagne just yet,"" Fernando Murillo, senior economist for Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients.

""NAFTA talks have gone through several painful waves of optimism and pessimism over the last year, and it is still unclear how the contentious issues, which include automotive rules of origin, five-year sunset provision, and dispute settlement process will be sorted out,"" he added.

MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has refused to recognize the country's hyperinflationary problem and has no plan to address it, a former finance minister, who served under the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, said in an interview.
The South American nation's annualized inflation topped 46,000 percent in June, and the IMF estimates it will surge to 1 million percent by the end of the year as the socialist economic system continues to unravel.
Maduro, who says his country is the victim of an ""economic war,"" this week said the government was cutting five zeroes off prices, a move that critics say will do nothing to rein in soaring prices or ease chronic shortages of food and medicine.
""Ending any hyperinflation requires a monetary program, Venezuela will not escape it through rhetoric,"" said Rodrigo Cabeza, who during his term as minister led an effort to remove three zeros from the country's currency.
""What the government needs to realize is that hyperinflationary situations are created by governments,"" he said, adding that indicates the root problem is indiscriminate expansion of the money supply.
Cabeza was named finance minister in 2007, at a time when rising global oil prices were swelling the OPEC nation's coffers and allowing Chavez to provide generous subsidies for the poor and to finance imports of consumer goods.
The 2014 collapse of oil prices left the country unable to maintain that system, with the economy in free fall and Venezuelans increasingly emigrating to escape the crisis.
Cabeza comments come in the run-up to a congress of the ruling Socialist Party that starts this weekend, in which Maduro has promised to discuss new measures to improve the economy.
""There is no professional management of Venezuela's economic policy,"" said Cabeza, who says he has distanced himself from the Socialist Party's leadership.
Venezuela stopped publishing inflation figures three years ago. Maduro says opposition businesses leaders are arbitrarily increasing prices as a way of undermining his government.

436,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Chile’s President Washes His Hands of Blame for Nation’s Credit Downgrade,"(Bloomberg) -- President Sebastian Pinera wanted to make one thing perfectly clear about Moody’s Investors Service’s decision to downgrade Chile’s credit rating: It’s not my fault.
“The reaction of the rating agency is due to things that happened in previous years,” Pinera, who took office March 11, told reporters Friday. “As you well know, our government is correcting those reasons.”
Moody’s reduced Chile’s senior unsecured debt ratings to A1 from Aa3, citing a gradual and broad-based deterioration in the country’s credit profile. Public debt has more than doubled to 23.6 percent of gross domestic product in the past eight years, while social pressures to improve education and health-care pose a “major challenge” to any attempt to restrain fiscal spending.
Despite those pressures, Pinera was adamant that Chile would stabilize debt levels.
“You know the commitments we have made, reducing the fiscal deficit and stabilizing the level of public debt,” the president said today. “Our intention, and this won’t happen immediately, is to recover the risk classification we have lost.”
Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings both downgraded Chile last year as the budget deficit widened, fiscal expenditure increased and economic growth slowed. Finance Minister Felipe Larrain has pledged to narrow the deficit as he seeks to reverse the rating downgrade within four years.
Chile “is paying the consequences for the fiscal deterioration and slow growth over the past four years,” Larrain said Thursday. He met with Moody’s in April and June and obviously failed to persuade them that he was doing enough to turn the situation around.
Moody’s said it expected Larrain to improve the situation, but it is unclear whether it will be enough to regain Chile’s risk rating.
“Debt metrics are likely to stabilize, but a reversal in the deterioration of fiscal and debt metrics is unlikely,” Moody’s said. “Low income levels relative to Aa-rated peers, dependence on commodities and external vulnerabilities have also become more salient aspects of Chile’s credit profile given lower medium-term growth prospects.”

That’s how Sam Finkelstein, the firm’s emerging markets chief, responded today when asked if he owned Turkish assets. “One has to be nervous about Turkey,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg television. “They are doing everything wrong.”
The lira plunged 22 percent this year after a series of policy missteps including the central bank’s decision to hold interest rates unchanged to arrest the currency’s slide. Then, yesterday, the U.S. threatened anew to impose sanctions on its NATO ally for the imprisonment of an American pastor, sending Istanbul markets reeling.
“It is a vicious cocktail,” Finkelstein said.
The backdrop is bleak. Amid local political turmoil, many international investors say Turkey is most at risk to rising U.S. interest rates as inflation accelerates and the current account deficit widens. Spiking prices and the lira’s plunge leaves no room for the central bank to cut rates, while the cost of financing the deficit increases on par with higher U.S. rates.
Markets also lack confidence in the government. One reason, Finkelstein said: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named as economy czar his son-in-law, rather than a mainstream economist. Erdogan has pushed out market-friendly cabinet members since being sworn in to another term this month. Stocks, bonds and the lira plunged after the central bank kept rates on hold, a decision that Nomura economist Inan Demir said confirmed the “worst fears” of markets.
The standoff with the U.S. is just another unwelcome complication. President Donald Trump said he will impose “large sanctions” on Turkey over the detention of Andrew Brunson, the pastor accused of aiding a failed 2016 coup."
438,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 01:51PM ET</span>",Ohio workers' pension fund woes are symbolic of national problem,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Roberta Dell has worked for 46 years making lollipops, and she loves her job. But she worries that retirement may not be as sweet as the Dum Dum lollipops she bags.
Dell works for the Spangler Candy Company in Bryan, Ohio - a family-owned business that employs 550 workers, and makes the venerable candy. Spangler was organized by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters labor union in 1950, and it became part of the Central States multiemployer pension plan in 1972.
But the outlook for her pension is highly uncertain. The Central States Pension Fund has said it is on a path to insolvency within 10 years. The fund, which covers more than 400,000 retirees and active workers, has become a symbol for all that has gone wrong with multiemployer pension plans - traditional defined-benefit plans jointly funded by groups of employers. These are typically small companies in industries like construction, trucking, mining and food retailing that would not typically sponsor a pension plan of their own. 
“I always thought the pensions would be there for me when it came time to retire,” Dell said in an interview. “I thought of it as my savings plan.” 
Dell, who is the Teamster chief steward at Spangler, testified earlier this month at a hearing of the special U.S. congressional committee in Columbus, Ohio, that examined possible solutions for workers like her.
More than 10 million U.S. workers and retirees are covered by 1,400 multiemployer pension plans. But roughly 200 plans are severely underfunded - the result of stock market crashes in 2001 and 2008-2009, and industrial decline that led to consolidation and declining employment. 
The problems threaten not only the pensions of individual workers, but also could cause the multiemployer insurance program of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to become insolvent within a decade. The PBGC is the U.S. government agency that acts as a backstop to troubled pension plans by insuring the pensions of millions of American workers.
Almost four years ago, U.S. Congress passed legislation that aimed to head off an implosion of multiemployer plans. The Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) allows troubled plans to seek federal government permission to make deep cuts to the future pensions of workers - and even for current retirees - if they can show that cuts would prolong the life of the plan. 
The size of the cuts depends on what a plan proposes, and the tenure of the worker - but they can be severe. For example, a worker with 25 years of service and a $36,000 benefit could see her pension cut as low as $11,800 according to a cutback calculator created by the Pension Rights Center (https:// The MPRA pension reforms have met with stiff political resistance from workers asked to take steep benefit cuts, and in some cases from regulators. In 2016, the U.S. Treasury - which plays the key role under MPRA of reviewing applications - rejected a proposal by Central States to cut benefits, saying the plan sponsors had not met certain MPRA hurdles. Treasury said the plan failed to demonstrate that the cuts were properly estimated to avoid plan insolvency, and that it did not distribute reductions equitably or explain the actions to plan participants in an understandable way. Congress this year empaneled a special committee to seek new solutions. The joint special committee was instructed to write a report and deliver proposed legislative language by Nov. 30. This month, the committee has been holding hearings to obtain feedback from stakeholders like Dell, as well as pension experts. A LID ON GROWTH Dell is 65 and widowed - her husband also worked at Spangler before his death from cancer in 2015. She expects to work a few more years before retiring, and expects her pension to pay about $1,200 a month. Social Security will provide another $1,400. But as things stand now, pension benefit cuts loom in 2025.  At the Columbus hearing, Dell spoke alongside Spangler’s president, Bill Martin, who urged the committee to back one reform idea under consideration - a plan to offer low-cost loans to aid troubled pension plans like Central States. In an interview, Martin pointed to another side-effect of the multiemployer pension mess beyond the threat it poses to workers’ retirement security. The pension woes have put the lid on growth for Spangler, dampening job-creation in Bryan, a community of about 8,000. The cost of pension contributions has jumped 85 percent over the past decade, with more than half of the higher costs going to cover so-called orphans - retirees from companies that have exited the plans. Employers also are assessed penalties - which are levied using a per-employee formula - in the event they withdraw from the plan. Martin said he would like to be expanding the business more aggressively, but cannot add to his current base of 550 workers due to the withdrawal fees. “As employers in Central States, we’re stuck,” he said.  “We can’t grow because every employee adds over $200,000 to withdrawal liabilities. If we hired 100, that would add $20 million. What company in its right mind would do that?” Under the loan plan, the U.S. Treasury Department would sell bonds to large investors, lending proceeds to troubled pension plans to help stabilize them. The other approach that has been floated is to shift some of the liability for orphaned participants to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, in essence a partition. That would put plans in better position to fund their ongoing costs with contributions. Partition is a better long-range solution, according to Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. “The entire liability to the PBGC would be between $35 billion and $66 billion,” she said. “That’s a situation where the government is ideally suited to solve the problem - once you remove orphan liabilities, the problem for plans becomes more manageable.”  But she thinks loans will be more palatable politically than direct assumption of cost by the government. Meanwhile, Dell is optimistic that something will be worked out. “I truly believe in all these folks,” she said. “I’m a very optimistic person.”

The WTO is facing an increasingly serious crisis amid complaints by U.S. President Donald Trump that the body is biased against the United States.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 12:44PM ET</span>",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.
1/WHAT'S THE JAPLAN?
The Bank of Japan meets on Tuesday and might be doing some 'jinarashi' i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. 
Sources have told Reuters that having failed to raise Japan's inflation to anywhere near its 2 percent target despite some intense effort, it is now considering changing its targets or its bond-buying program.
Five years of the qualitative and quantitative easing policy, which was last tweaked in 2016 to keep rates negative and cap the 10-year bond yield at zero, have had mixed results at best. Unemployment has dropped and the economy is no longer mired in deep deflation, but the yen hasn’t weakened enough to create noticeable inflation or ramp up economic growth.
And with a global trade war now threatening trouble for its big exporters and zero interest rates hurting its banks, the BOJ seems to have recognized that something needs to give.

2/FED HOT 
It might be holiday season but U.S markets won't be taking much of a break next week.
Closely-scrutinized non-farm jobs data is due on Friday, two days before that the Federal Reserve will probably lay the groundwork for its third rate hike of the year in September. 
The Fed's mandate is to promote maximum employment along with price stability. The unemployment rate rose to 4.0 percent in June from 3.8 in May, when it matched the lowest since 2000. Analysts are expecting Friday's figure for July to be 3.9 percent and for 190,000 jobs to have been added nationwide.
Given a severe labor shortage, is the economy up against maximum employment? And what does the Fed think about it all? Wednesday's statement will get parsed, as always, for any worry about overheating in the economy or in inflation. Even tiny changes to its language can raise the temperature in markets.

3/MR RELIABLE 
The Bank of England's Mark Carney is looking to throw off his ""unreliable boyfriend"" tag on Thursday and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 percent. 
It would be symbolic as it would get BoE rates above the emergency lows of the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown for the first time, but with a potentially messy Brexit nearing the bank may sound cautious about further moves. 
Market pricing doesn't anticipate another hike for at least a year. That has been flattening the UK gilt bond curve and suppressing the pound, so unless Carney reverts to teasing about hikes again that is likely to continue. 
(For a graphic on 'UK markets since BoE's November rate hike' click https://reut.rs/2K05Ps8)
4/LONG IN THE FAANG
The spectacular dive by Facebook’s shares this week has unnerved those crowded into the tech sector. 
The $120 billion rout was the biggest one-day wipeout in value terms in U.S. stock market history and having seen fellow-FAANG Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) tumble, and Twitter slump on Friday, there have been some painful memories of the early 2000s dot.com bubble. 
The final FAANG, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), reports next week and any disappointments in its numbers could cause more pain for U.S. and world stocks – as Wall Street has rallied 6 percent this year, its tech sub-set is up 16 percent.
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) who keep a close eye on where investors are putting their money are warning too that the FAANGs - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are the other two in the quintet - are the most overcrowded trade in the world and to get out. 
(For a graphic on 'Long in the FAANG?' click https://reut.rs/2JXecF2)
5/HUNGRY CATERPILLAR 
Tech-aside,  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a company heavily geared to world growth reports on Monday – its CEO notably said during Q1 results that those would likely be the high water mark of the cycle so if that looks to be coming true markets will take notice.
In Europe, more than 70 companies on the pan-European STOXX 600 will report. It is a particularly big week for the region's banks, which have underperformed the broader index with a 10 percent fall so far this year. 
The big guns on the list include BNP Paribas,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Lloyds (LON:LLOY), ING,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), SocGen, RBS (LON:RBS),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI). With issues like stuttering euro zone growth, a long-running struggle to keep up with U.S. rivals as well as bad loans and trouble in Turkey, there will be plenty to drill into.

Flanked by his top economic advisers, Trump delivered remarks on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday to celebrate a report that the economy expanded in the second quarter at the fastest pace in four years. He said the economy is on track to reach an annual growth rate of more than 3 percent.
“These numbers are very, very sustainable. This isn’t a one-time shot,” he said. “Everywhere we look we are seeing the effects of the American economic miracle.”
Investors don’t seem as impressed. The dollar fell, stocks were little changed and Treasuries gained Friday after the Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product grew 4.1 percent, slightly short of the consensus estimate. The president had built up expectations by predicting on Thursday that the data would show the economy in “terrific shape.”
“I’m left with a ’meh’ kind of mood as expectations were built up for this to be a strong number--including by administration officials,” said Mazen Issa, a senior currency strategist at TD Securities.
The economy’s solid performance last quarter gave Trump a chance to bask in his policy victories, including the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era. It also allows him to change the channel from the growing pressure he faces from an investigation into whether Trump and his associates played a role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.
But few economists expect the U.S. can attain the president’s goal of sustained growth of three percent. Many analysts believe growth will weaken as the effects fade from the tax cuts and a government spending increase.
‘Maxed Out’
“It’s a stretch to get it to 3.0,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFC Union Bank NA in New York. “It’s a nine-year-old expansion. A lot of the spending we’ve seen is maxed out.”
The president portrays an economy breaking free of its shackles as his administration cuts red tape and lowers taxes. He argues that his hawkish trade agenda, which includes tariffs on steel and aluminum, is attracting jobs back to the nation’s manufacturing sector. Trump visited Granite City, Illinois, this week to celebrate the reopening of a U.S. steel mill.
“We had an audience of steel workers, some of the roughest, toughest people you’ve ever seen, and half of them had tears coming down their faces,” Trump said Friday. “The steel industry is back. They’re open for business.”
U.S. factory employment is growing. That could help Republican lawmakers in the midterm elections in Congress in November. Trump rode to the White House partly on his popularity on Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Ohio.
But the surge in factory jobs started while Barack Obama was president, as companies recovered from the global financial crisis, and manufacturing employment is well below its peak in the 1970s.
More generally, economists question whether the animal spirits awakened by the U.S. fiscal stimulus can continue to boost growth. Private-sector economists predict growth will slow to 2.8 percent in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg polling.
‘Likely Peaking’
Fed officials estimate the U.S. economy’s sustainable long-term growth rate to be 1.8 percent, according to their median estimate in June, though their forecast for this year is a percentage point faster.
That modest assessment of the long-run rate implicitly resists arguments that Trump’s tax cuts will lift the economy’s potential to grow without hitting the speed-bump of inflation, though there’s a range of views among policy makers.
Trump’s victory lap caps a week in which he softened his stance on trade. A deal with the European Union to freeze tariffs blunted concerns that the president’s trade wars could undercut the economy. Still, Trump may have been looking in the rear-view mirror when he predicted a growth boom.
“The economy is currently firing on all cylinders, and that growth is likely peaking,” Bricklin Dwyer, senior U.S. economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), said in a research note.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy should have a ""plan B"" to quit the euro zone with a referendum if economic conditions dictate, the founder of the co-ruling 5-Star Movement said, sending ripples through financial markets.
The anti-establishment movement's founder Beppe Grillo holds no post in the coalition where 5-Star governs with the League. But his remarks may fuel new doubts over Italy's intention to maintain the single currency.
""You must have a plan B,"" Grillo said in an interview on Friday with Gzero Media, a subsidiary of risk analysis firm Eurasia Group.
His comments came as Italy's new anti-establishment government designated a eurosceptic as president of the national public broadcaster RAI, whose TV channels are the most popular among Italians.
Grillo said the country had not devised any contingency plan yet, and Italians should vote in a referendum to see if a majority wanted to quit the currency.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria have both said the government has no intention of leading Italy out of the euro.
However, Italian shares (FTMIB) erased gains on Friday and two-year bond yields briefly hit a two-week high. Traders cited Grillo's comments, which echoed the controversial position of Italian minister for European affairs, Paolo Savona.
Meanwhile, the government designated journalist Marcello Foa as president of RAI. In his blog, Foa has criticised European Central Bank's president Mario Draghi for saying that the euro is irreversible.
""Only the people can decide on whether a currency is irreversible or not,"" he wrote in February.
""I am sure that Germany and France have their plan B,"" Grillo said in his interview, citing the two largest economies of the euro zone. ""I am not saying that we should quit the euro without discussion, but we should let the Italian people decide with a referendum.""
Grillo remains influential but plays little role in the day-to-day management of the 5-Star Movement.
Savona was forced by Italian President Sergio Mattarella to renounce the post of finance minister because of his statements on the need for such a contingency plan.
In a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Foa expressed ""disgust"" at Mattarella's doubts over Savona.
His appointment as RAI president will need to be confirmed by parliament where the League and 5-Star have a comfortable majority.
Separately on Friday, the Italian government appointed experienced manager Fabrizio Salini in the more powerful position of RAI chief executive officer.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","Global foreign investment flows tumble on Trump's tax reform, OECD says","PARIS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's tax reform caused a major disruption in global investment flows, with the United States bringing more money home than it sent out in the first quarter for the first time since 2005, an OECD study showed on Friday.
The study from the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is the first to reveal data on the impact of Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, the OECD said.
It found that global foreign direct investment outflows tumbled 44 percent to $136 billion in the first quarter of this year, from $242 billion in the previous quarter.
That was largely due to a switch to negative outward investments from the United States - meaning that American companies brought back more money home than they sent abroad in the quarter.
""The U.S. normally is the largest outward investor in the world. So when it switches to negative that has a big impact on the global flows,"" Maria Borga, a statistician at the OECD's investment division told Reuters.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December was touted as a way to create more jobs, drive U.S. economic growth and level the playing field with companies based outside the United States. It slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and charges multinationals a one-time tax on profits held overseas.
Outward investment from the United States fell to $-145 billion, registering negative for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2005. The change was due to large repatriations of profits by U.S. parent companies from their foreign affiliates.
""At this point it probably is essentially their financial assets, cash holdings that they're bringing and it's probably not going to have an immediate impact in terms of employment or value added at their foreign operations,"" the OECD's Borga said.
The long-term impact is more difficult to predict but could be significant and long-lasting, she said.
""We don't really know what's going to happen in the long term. But this has really shifted a lot of the incentives,"" Borga said.
""For example the cut in the tax rate might make the U.S. a more attractive destination for foreign investment, so you might see more foreign investment into the U.S.,"" she said, adding that other countries might also be tempted to respond.

With U.S. foreign investment outflows tumbling, Japan became the world's top outward investor in the quarter, Borga said.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Pakistan's Imran Khan faces tough test in looming economic crisis,"By Drazen Jorgic
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Equity and bond markets have welcomed Imran Khan's victory in Pakistan's disputed election, but the former cricket hero faces a tough slog to avert a currency crisis and implement long-term reforms needed to end decades of boom-and-bust cycles.
Khan's first major economic call will be to decide whether to ease pressure on the rupee by seeking Pakistan's 12th bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since the late 1980s.
Harder still will be to persuade more people to pay taxes in a nation famous for tax dodging, turn off subsidy taps draining government coffers, and reform loss-making state-run enterprises that past governments have struggled to sell off.
""The country's position is such that now you can no longer sustain the status quo,"" said Suleman Maniya, head of research at local brokerage house Shajar Capital. ""Speed is of the essence.""
Pakistan's central bank has devalued the currency four times since December, weakening the rupee by more than 20 percent, amid efforts to avert a balance of payments crisis in the $305 billion economy. A similar scenario in 2013 led to Pakistan obtaining a $6.7 billion loan from the IMF.
While the economy is growing at 5.8 percent, the fastest pace in 13 years, pressures on Pakistan's current account show no signs abating.
The country's central bank is concerned by rising global oil prices - Pakistan imports about 80 percent of oil needs - and dwindling foreign reserves, which plunged to just over $9 billion last week from $16.4 billion in May 2017.
Pakistan's current account deficit widened 43 percent to $18 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, while the fiscal deficit has ballooned to 6.8 percent of the economy.
""Pakistan is facing the biggest economic challenge in the country's history,"" Khan said in his victory speech on Thursday, where he outlined a reform agenda.
""Our economy is going down because of our dysfunctional institutions. We need to fix our governance systems.""
If Khan does turn to the IMF, the Washington-based body will likely require spending cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit, which could imperil his populist promises to improve the lives of the poor by building world-class schools and hospitals.
On the campaign trail Khan has zeroed in on Pakistan's culture of tax evasion, which is prevalent across South Asia and means only about 1 percent of population pays income tax. 
Increasing that figure would be a major coup for the economy and Khan, who has vowed to reform the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) in his first six months in office.
He has also promised to step up an anti-corruption drive, though this risks triggering capital flight in a country where vast wealth is undocumented, analysts say.
Another immediate focus will be on reforming state giants such as Pakistan International Airlines and various power utilities, which the previous government struggled to privatize.
Exotix Capital, a research house, said Pakistan's long-term outlook hangs on whether Khan can improve governance and end the culture of the powerful avoiding taxes and sucking cash out of state-run enterprises, which adds to the fiscal burden.
""Otherwise, we are simply in for more the same (advice to investors): buy Pakistan as it heads to the IMF and sell before the IMF loan ends,"" Exotix said in a research note.
STRUCTURAL CHANGES
Khan's reform ambitions will be boosted by his strong relations with the powerful military and the judiciary's favorable view of his anti-corruption stance, analysts say. 
His better-than-expected performance at the polls also means he will be able to form a coalition with a handful of small parties unlikely to stand in the way of his reforms.
""Imran Khan is unlikely to be any investor's top choice to run a country in such a precarious position, but any leader with the ability to form a government and take hard decisions is better than a protracted stalemate,"" said Carmen Altenkirch, Emerging Markets Sovereign Analyst at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
Pakistan's benchmark stocks index (KSE) has surged about 3.5 percent since it became clear on Thursday morning that Khan would win a strong mandate, while Pakistan's sovereign dollar bonds have risen across the curve.
Khan's economic agenda is likely to be entrusted to Asad Umar, the former chief executive of Engro, Pakistan's biggest conglomerate, widely tipped to be chosen as finance minister.
Days before the vote, Umar told Reuters that a PTI government would not rule out asking China for a bailout instead of turning to the IMF, which he held partly ""culpable"" for the economic crisis because it allowed the last government to skip reforms.
""The real issue is that the competitiveness of Pakistan's economy has eroded badly - crop after crop, industry after industry has become uncompetitive,"" said Umar, blaming low productivity and skill levels of businesses, high input costs, lack of scale, and political intervention in some industries.

""Until you restore that core competitiveness, we will keep going through this.""

446,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Trump Claims Victory as GDP Grows at Fastest Pace Since 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said the U.S. economy is on track to reach an annual growth rate of more than 3 percent, as he celebrated a report Friday that the economy expanded in the second quarter at the fastest pace in four years.
“As the trade deals come in one-by-one, we’re going to go a lot higher than these numbers, and these are great numbers,” Trump said Friday at the White House.
The Commerce Department said Friday that the economy accelerated to a 4.1 percent pace of growth in the second quarter, the fastest since 2014. The numbers give Trump a chance to highlight his policy victories, including the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, which probably boosted consumer spending and business investment.
Yet, even as he touted the benefits of future trade deals, analysts say the risks from tariff wars and a fading effect from tax cuts could limit the pace of growth going forward.
Trump said the pace of growth was “very sustainable” and could create as many as 12 million jobs over the next decade.
During his campaign, Trump regularly promised that GDP would grow above 4 percent annually -- at times saying that the number would go as high as 6 or 7 percent. Trump claimed that such a rate of economic growth would help reduce the deficit.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",'R-star' in the limelight as Bank of England opens up on rates,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's central bank is about to shed more light on a concept that may explain why it thinks borrowing costs must rise even as the economy grows only slowly - ""R-star"" (or ""R-dagger""), the 'equilibrium', 'neutral' or 'natural' interest rate.
While these terms may be familiar to economists, the man in the street could be left scratching his head as he tries to work out how far the Bank of England plans to increase rates in the next few years.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and other top officials say they need to tighten monetary policy because Britain's economy cannot cope with even its current sluggish growth without generating too much inflation.
Most economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank to raise its benchmark rate to 0.75 percent next Thursday, passing a milestone by taking it above 0.50 percent for the first time in more than nine years.
But there is much more debate about how fast it will raise borrowing costs after that, given a lack of clear signs of home-grown inflationary pressure -- with wages growing more slowly than before the financial crisis -- and the economy facing headwinds from the approach of Brexit.
This is where R-star comes in. The term itself is simple enough: it represents the level of interest rates set by a central bank that will keep inflation and growth rates stable when the economy is running at full capacity.
The BoE has long said it expects any increases in interest rates to be limited and gradual. By putting a number on 'R-star' for the first time alongside its rate decision on Thursday, it may give a clearer indication of where it thinks borrowing costs need to head in the longer term -- though if Britain crashes out of the European Union next March, all bets are off.
""(This) will help frame discussion of how accommodative policy is,"" said David Owen, an economist at investment bank Jefferies. ""It could also be used to justify a rate rise.""
Policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve are used to discussing the neutral level of interest rates, and they give individual forecasts of where they see rates heading. But such public debate is much rarer at other major central banks.
'R-star' appears in most economic models for setting interest rates and has its roots in the 19th-century work of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell on the natural rate of interest.
The further interest rates are below their 'natural' level, the more stimulus they offer to growth, and the more likely they are to contribute to higher inflation if the economy is close to full capacity.
R-STAR CENTRAL BANKERS
Based on statements by BoE policymakers and analysis of BoE growth, inflation and spare capacity forecasts, estimates for r-star range from minus 0.5 to zero percent, according to economists at HSBC, JP Morgan and consultancy Heteronomics.
Adjusted for the BoE's 2 percent inflation target, this implies that a level of Bank Rate of 1.5-2.0 percent will ultimately be needed to keep inflation steady.
Perhaps coincidentally, 1.5 percent also matches the level at which the BoE unexpectedly said last month it would begin to consider selling some of the 435 billion pounds of government bonds it amassed as part of its attempts to shore up Britain's economy over the 10 years since the financial crisis.
JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said the likely 'neutral' range was lower than financial market forecasts for Bank Rate. They mostly see it struggling to get above 1 percent over the next three years, reflecting concerns about a disruptive Brexit.
""But without those risks crystallizing, the implication of the August Inflation Report is likely to be that rates will need to rise several times more,"" he said.
Britain is due to leave the European Union in March next year but it remains at odds with Brussels over key parts of its future relationship with the bloc.
After disquiet from some economists at Carney's previous attempts to give 'forward guidance' on interest rates, he is likely to stress uncertainties around the new estimate, and that it is not a target for the BoE.
""It demonstrably wants to provide some guidance, else it may as well have not bothered saying anything. But the Monetary Policy Committee also won't want to imply excessive confidence lest it strengthens the charge that it's an unreliable partner,"" Heteronomics's Philip Rush said.
Carney said in May the BoE would give a range of estimates for the 'equilibrium rate' and that it would change over time.
He also noted that Britain was exposed to rising borrowing costs overseas as the world economy grows more strongly.
That means that even keeping rates on hold would be increasingly stimulative for Britain's economy, said Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC.

""To take an extreme example, if the MPC concluded the natural rate was set to rise by 1 percentage point over the next two years, we could look forward to a much steeper path for Bank Rate,"" she said.

The U.S. economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter, in line with consensus and its strongest reading since the third quarter of 2014.
Viraj Patel, FX and global macro strategist at ING, noted that the 4.0% growth in personal consumption implied that the American consumer is “propping up entire global economy”.
“Markets may question how sustainable one source of growth is,” Patel warned, as he pointed to the dip in the dollar.
Other experts pointed to the surge in exports and suggested that the jump was due to foreign countries raking in supplies ahead of expected tariff implementation.
“(There was a) 13.3% increase in exports which were clustered in agriculture exports,” RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas said. “Soy is the word of the day.”
Strong Growth Not a Game Changer for the Fed
The data as a whole was in line with expectations, but did little to change the Fed’s game plan of continuing with “gradual” rate hikes.
“With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testified to Congress on July 17.
Despite, his upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy, Powell was very clear that that “it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy” and left the ball in U.S. President Donald Trump’s court for how to handle negotiations with China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, among others.
Markets clearly judged that the Fed’s future decisions were not impacted by Friday’s GDP data. Fed fund futures continued to price in a rate hike in September and the probability for a hike in December was last at 69.4%, compared to 69.5% before the release."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Chinese investors signed agreements to build a $10 billion metallurgical complex in South Africa during President Xi Jinping's state visit this week and hope to start construction next year, an executive involved in the project and a provincial official told Reuters.
South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a joint news conference with Xi on Tuesday that China had committed to invest $14.7 billion in the South African economy, but neither leader mentioned the $10 billion complex. 
Ramaphosa is on a mission to kick-start economic growth after a decade of stagnation and is targeting $100 billion in new investment over five years.
The complex, which is still in the planning stage and envisages building a stainless steel plant, a ferrochrome plant and a silicomanganese plant, is a much-needed vote of confidence in the sputtering South African economy.
Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said on Tuesday that China was considering a metallurgical project in a special economic zone (SEZ), but he did not reveal the scale of the project or timeframe.
The executive involved in the project, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said memoranda on the complex were signed before Xi and Ramaphosa gave news conference on Tuesday.
""The investors for the SEZ project were in the room when Ramaphosa and Xi spoke to the press,"" the executive said.
Richard Zitha, a project executive at the Musina-Makhado SEZ where the complex will be based, said the project was being led by Chinese state-owned companies, but he declined to name them.
He said the Chinese investors would look for Black Economic Empowerment partners to comply with South African rules designed to address racial disparities more than two decades after the end of apartheid. 
The investors were open to investors from other countries joining at a later stage, he said.
""The investors have been in South Africa for around a week and have visited mines to look for inputs for the project,"" Zitha said.
The Musina-Makhado SEZ is in Limpopo province close to South Africa's borders with Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
The SEZ plans to house plants with a capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum of stainless steel, 3 million tonnes per annum of ferrochrome and 500,000 tonnes per annum of silicomanganese. Those capacity targets are subject to change and will be finalised by the end of the year, the executive said.
A coal-fired power plant, coking plant and coal washery will be built alongside the metallurgical plants, a presentation prepared for investors showed.
Some of the steel output for the complex has been earmarked for export to China, while other products would be sold to countries in southern Africa, the executive said.
South Africa is already a major exporter of metal alloys to China.
Investors are hoping to receive the necessary environmental approvals by the end of March and would then start construction, Zitha said.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 07:29AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China eyes infrastructure boost to cushion growth as trade war escalates - sources,"By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to put more money into infrastructure projects and ease borrowing curbs on local governments to help soften the blow to the economy from the Sino-U.S. trade war, policy sources told Reuters.
China's trade war with the United States has clouded the outlook for the world's second-largest economy and roiled financial markets. A sharper slowdown in the Chinese economy could fuel job losses, a concern that Beijing has raised.
But Chinese leaders have ruled out another round of strong fiscal stimulus, wary of inflaming debt risks. A 4 trillion yuan ($590 billion) spending package in 2008-09 shielded China's economy from the global crisis but saddled local governments and state firms with piles of debt. 
The amount of infrastructure spending this time will depend on how the trade war evolves, said four sources who are familiar with government policy. The sources are involved in internal policy discussions but are not part the final decision-making process.  
""In the short term, the most effective way is to boost infrastructure investment,"" said one policy insider who advises the government, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We will let fiscal policy play a bigger role in supporting the economy as monetary policy is less effective."" 
The economy has already felt the pinch from Beijing's multi-year deleveraging drive that has driven up corporate borrowing costs and delayed government projects. 
Economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter - still above the official 2018 growth target of around 6.5 percent.
However, the trade row with Washington, a slowing domestic property market and reduced outbound shipments have sharply increased the risks to China's economic outlook.
Earlier this month, the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. China promptly levied taxes on the same value of U.S. products, leading U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten to tariffs on all $500 billion of goods imported from China.
China's infrastructure investment growth tumbled to 7.3 percent in the first half from 21.1 percent a year earlier - dragging fixed-asset investment growth to a record low - due to due to stricter checks on investment projects to curb debt risks. 
Fiscal policy will become ""more proactive"", China's cabinet said after a meeting on Monday, pledging to deliver more tax cuts and quicken the issuance of local governments' special bonds to support infrastructure investment.
The meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, also called for banks to ensure funding to existing projects and meet reasonable funding needs of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), which have been subjected to tight official scrutiny. 
ROOM FOR FISCAL OUTLAYS
Room for boosting fiscal outlays is ample. Government spending surpassed revenues by 726 billion yuan in the first half, which was only about a third of the budgeted deficit of 2.38 trillion yuan for 2018.
China has cut its annual budget deficit target to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product from 3 percent in 2017 - the first reduction since 2012, boosting the amount of special bond issuance by local governments by 550 billon yuan to offset the drop.
""Fiscal spending could be quickened and investment in some projects under construction will be expedited. This will provide support for the economy,"" said a second policy insider. 
Another policy insider said China can step up spending on much-needed urban facilities such as parking lots and retirement homes, instead of mega projects.
The finance ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission and the People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
POLICY DEBATEThe cabinet's policy move signaled a victory for the PBOC following debate among researchers from the PBOC and finance ministry on whether fiscal policy should do more to spur growth, the policy insiders said.
That could take some heat off the PBOC, as it faces difficulty in channeling credit to small firms, which are vital for economic growth and job creation, they said. 
State banks remain reluctant to lend to small firms, which are considered riskier than state-controlled firms. 
The PBOC has cut banks' reserve requirements three times this year, with further reductions widely expected. But aggressive policy easing could re-ignite debt risks and weigh on the weakening yuan , sparking capital outflows. 
While authorities are seen pushing ahead with reducing debt, there have been some signs of softening in their stance. 
Chinese policymakers have recently replaced use of the term ""deleveraging"" with ""structural deleveraging"", a change that suggests less harsh curbs on debt.

""The deleveraging should consider external changes and the intensity could be weakened to avoid having a big impact on the economy,"" said one of the policy sources.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 07:25AM ET</span>","Iowa farmers wary of aid, trade wars but still turn out for Trump","By Tom Polansek
DUBUQUE, Iowa (Reuters) - Iowa farmers criticized President Donald Trump's $12 billion farm aid package and worried about trade wars impacting their business, but many still turned out to support him on Thursday during a visit to the top corn-producing state.
Eugene Wiederholt, who rents out land used to produce soybeans in the town of Zwingle, said the farm assistance package announced Tuesday to help farmers weather lost markets and low prices from the trade disputes reminded him of welfare.
“I don’t want nothing to do with it,” he said at a public viewing area next to Dubuque’s airport, awaiting Trump. “It’s just not wholesome.”
The concern from Wiederholt, a supporter who said Trump ""is one of us,"" shows a dilemma facing many Republicans who have traditionally shunned aid and prefer free trade. 
Many Republican lawmakers have spoken out against Trump's trade policy and the aid. 
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Trump should work to resolve the trade dispute with top soybean buyer China.
“I hope President Trump’s trip to Iowa gives him a sense of urgency,"" he said in a statement. ""Farmers are depending on the President for a speedy resolution.""
China and other top U.S. trade partners zeroed in on American farmers with retaliatory tariffs after the Trump administration imposed duties on Chinese goods as well as steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Rural and agricultural states supported Trump by wide margins in the 2016 election, and China has targeted them with tariffs on soybeans and other products. The aid package comes ahead of U.S. mid-term elections in November. 
Trump may be taking on fights with too many trading partners at once, said Bob Weber, a corn farmer in nearby Bellevue, Iowa. But Weber still turned out to watch Trump, for whom he voted, land on Air Force One.
“What he’s doing is right but he might be doing too much at the same time,” Weber said.
Trump visited a community college in Peosta, Iowa, in Dubuque County, which flipped from supporting Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. 
Eleven people interviewed by Reuters who earn incomes from farming around Dubuque said they voted for Trump and continue to back him.
Still, BJ Reeg, a farmer in nearby Bellevue, worries that trade tensions have hurt prices for the soybeans he grows and meat he produces from cattle.
“This trade war thing, it has to be done,” Reeg said as he leaned on his silver pickup truck. “In the long run, it’s gonna be good, if a guy can hang on.”
Reeg said he was glad the Trump administration offered aid to farmers but worried it would not be enough.
“The whole farm industry is really in the gutter,” he said. “You take $12 billion and divide it by all the crops out here and it does not amount to much,” he said.
The largest emergency farm assistance announcement since 1998 will offer cash payments to farmers from a depression-era program, buy foods for food banks and other programs and aim to promote trade starting in September.
Reeg has contracts to sell about 60 percent of the soybeans he expects to harvest this autumn to global grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co and a local cooperative.
He plans to put the remainder of his harvest into storage because of low prices.
Trump spoke down the road from where Pat Merkes raises 80 dairy cows.
It is a tough time for dairy producers because milk prices have been low for more than a year, farmers said. They hope the government helps to open new markets for U.S. products. 

“He’s not afraid to stand up to anybody,” Merkes said of Trump from atop a rusted red tractor. He also voted for the Republican.

The online retailer forecast operating income of between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion for the third quarter, beating analyst estimates of $843 million, and shares rose more than 3% in extended trading.
Friday marks the end of one of the busiest weeks in the earnings season with an additional 55 companies reporting.
The focus will likely be on Twitter’s (NYSE:TWTR) results, scheduled for release at around 7:00 AM ET (11:00 GMT). Analysts, on average, are expecting Twitter to report a profit of 16 cents per share, up from 5 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue is forecast to come in a little less than $698 million.
Attention will also be paid to earnings from Dow components Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).
2. U.S. set for best growth in nearly 4 years
Investors will keep an eye on a preliminary reading of second-quarter U.S. growth due at 8:30AM ET (12:30 GMT) Friday for further clues on when and how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
The report is expected to show the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.1% in the April-June period, more than double the first quarter's output. That would be the highest since the third quarter of 2014.
Speaking at a steel mill in Granite City, Illinois, on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump doubted the expansion would reach the 5.3% some economists have penciled in, but said that “if it has a four in front of it, we’re happy.”
A strong reading would back Fed chair Jerome Powell’s recent upbeat assessment of the economy as markets currently expect the next rate hike to arrive in September. Fed fund futures currently discount the possibility of an additional increase in December at just above 70%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Also on the economic docket, the University of Michigan will release its revised consumer sentiment for July at 10:00 AM ET (14:00GMT).
3. Trade tensions remain in focus
Trade tensions remained in focus as representatives from the U.S. and China clashed at the World Trade Organization meeting on Thursday. 
During the meeting, Washington asked for reforms targeting China’s responsiveness to the market, while Beijing said it would not respond to the U.S.’s tactics. 
“Extortion, distortion or demonization does no good to resolve the issues,” Chinese Ambassador Zhang Xiangchen said.
“Holding our feet to the fire has never worked,” he added.  
Another Chinese official noted at the event that China will retaliate against any additional U.S. tariffs, regardless of the volume of goods targeted.
“We clearly have a chronic problem with China,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in Senate testimony on Thursday, adding that trade problems with Beijing will take years to resolve.
Discussions over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) seemed to paint a more optimistic picture.
Mexico and the U.S. agreed on Thursday to step up talks on updating the NAFTA trade deal in hopes of reaching an agreement on major issues by August, Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said.
Guajardo said he had ""constructive"" and ""very positive"" talks with Lighthizer and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
4. Global stocks mostly higher ahead of U.S. earnings, GDP
Global stocks were mostly higher on Friday as strong company earnings reports and an easing of transatlantic trade tensions on an agreement between the U.S. and Europe this week to try to cut trade barriers boosted investor confidence.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open as traders awaited the final deluge of earnings this week and the latest take on growth in the American economy. At 5:50 AM ET (9:50GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures edged forward 23 points, or 0.09%, S&P 500 futures inched up 2 points, or 0.08%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 29 points, or 0.38%.
European stocks moved higher nearing midday trade on Friday, helped by easing fears over U.S. tariffs and positive company earnings.
Earlier, Asian shares showed mixed signs, as trade tensions between the U.S. and China kept continued to weigh on the Shanghai Composite.
5. Oil prices trade slightly lower ahead of U.S. drilling data
Oil prices traded slightly lower on Friday, breaking three consecutive days of gains despite support from news that Saudi Arabia is suspending oil shipping in the Red Sea, while investors looked ahead to the latest gauge of U.S. shale production.
U.S. crude oil futures lost 0.29% to $69.42 by 5:53 AM ET (9:53 GMT), while Brent oil fell 0.17% to $74.41.
Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter in the world, said it was temporarily halting oil shipments through the Red Sea after an attack by Yemen’s Houthi movement.
The exports through the shipping lane of Bab al-Mandeb links Egypt’s Suez canal and SUMED crude pipeline. An estimated 4.8 million barrels per day flow through the Bab al-Mandeb in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Investors looked ahead to weekly rig count data from Baker Hughes at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by 5 to 858 last week. The rate of growth has slowed over the past month or so with a decline in crude prices from late May through late June.
The rig count is still up 94 from a year ago, when there were 764 rigs."

Africa's most industrialized economy grew by 3.1 percent in the final quarter of 2017, but contracted in the first quarter of this year. 
""At this stage, the high-frequency data for the second quarter indicate that a modest improvement is likely in the quarter, and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) does not expect a second consecutive quarter of contraction,"" Kganyago said at the bank's annual general meeting. 
Last week, the bank held benchmark interest rates and cut its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.2 percent from 1.7 percent.
It said economic activity would be constrained in the near term by weak consumer spending linked to the recent increase to value added tax and by unemployment, which is near record levels.
On Friday, Kganyago said growth of 1.9 percent is expected in 2019, while the forecast for 2020 remains unchanged at 2.0 percent, he said.
""At these growth levels, we cannot expect to make appreciable inroads into the unemployment problem of the country,"" Kganyago said.

South Africa's unemployment rate stands at a near-record 27 percent.

It has proposed extending existing marketing restrictions for investment-based crowdfunding platforms to loan-based platforms.

The ECB, which targets inflation at just below 2 percent, decided on Thursday to stay on course to end asset purchases this year and hike rates by late 2019. The bank is satisfied that a five-year growth run will push price growth higher but also has concerns that a global trade war could unravel the expansion.
Headline inflation is seen at 1.7 percent this year, above a previous projection for 1.5 percent, while next year's rate is also seen at 1.7 percent, above the 1.6 percent projected three months ago, according to the survey of 56 forecasters, an important input in the ECB's policy deliberations.
The figures also match the ECB's own staff projections, which see inflation holding at 1.7 percent through 2020, a rate that is close to the bank's target but still seen by ECB chief Mario Draghi as a miss.
By 2023, deemed 'long term' in the survey, the inflation rate is seen accelerating to 1.9 percent.
But most of the improvement in the forecasts was due to volatile food and energy prices as underlying inflation forecasts were unchanged in the survey.
With regard to growth, the survey sees a somewhat slower expansion in the near term than projected three months ago, but long-term expectations remained unchanged.
For this year, the growth projection was cut to 2.2 percent from 2.4 percent while for next year, it was reduced to 1.9 percent from 2 percent. Over the long-term, growth is seen at 1.6 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso on Friday said he wanted next year's Group of 20 meetings in Osaka to focus on identifying problems in the global economy before they worsen, and ruled out pursuing a two-way free trade pact with the United States. 
The G20 grouping of policymakers from rich and developing countries faces a range of problems that could derail global growth, such as trade protectionism, U.S. monetary policy, investment flows from emerging markets and currency swings.
""The role the G20 should play next year is to nip crises in the bud before they develop further,"" Aso added, saying he wanted next year's gathering ""to promote investment in high-quality infrastructure to ensure economic growth"".
He added, ""As the chair, I want to make sure we work toward these ends."" 
At last week's meeting in Argentina, G20 finance ministers and central bankers discussed downside risks to the global economy and reaffirmed their consensus over currency market issues, Aso said.
But they failed to reach consensus on ways to resolve multiple disputes over U.S. tariff actions, raising fears that the grouping could struggle to reach agreement next year, at a time when risks to the global economy could be increasing.
Japan's talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will take place in August, rather than July, as had originally been expected, Aso also told reporters.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed this year to set up the dialogue as the Trump administration renegotiates trade relationships it considers unfair to U.S. companies and workers.
Trump has made clear he prefers a bilateral trade deal with Japan to lower its trade surplus with the United States, but Aso on Friday reiterated Japan's lack of interest in such a pact.

The stakes are high for Japan because Trump's administration could ask the Asian nation to take specific measures to shrink its trade surplus, which would hurt its export-oriented economy.

Speaking at a steel mill in Granite City, Illinois, on Thursday, Trump doubted the expansion would reach the 5.3 percent some economists have penciled in, but said that “if it has a four in front of it, we’re happy.” He called recent economic figures “unthinkable.”
Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the April-June period, according to the Bloomberg survey median, with forecasts ranging as high as 5 percent. The Commerce Department will release the statistics at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.
Among the forces behind the pickup from 2 percent growth in the first quarter is the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era boosting company and corporate spending. The traditionally volatile categories of inventories and trade also probably lifted the number -- helped by a likely temporary jump in soybean exports ahead of retaliatory tariffs
Analysts aren’t convinced the acceleration will last, predicting solid yet less spectacular growth in the second half of the year as the tax stimulus begins to fade, the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs again and the expansion ages. The simmering trade war with China will also weigh on the economy.
At Bloomberg Economics, economists Carl Riccadonna and Tim Mahedy estimate growth of 3.8 percent in the quarter. “This reflects a number of one-time idiosyncratic factors and should not be viewed as an indication of what is to come in the second half,” they wrote in a report.
Trump said a number just short of 4 percent would also “OK.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output likely slipped for a second straight month in June as demand for electronic parts slowed, forcing companies to cut production, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Concerns over Japan's trade disputes with the United States remain ahead of new trade talks between Tokyo and Washington in the coming month, with President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies seen raising risks to the economic outlook.
Industrial production was seen down 0.4 percent in June from the previous month after it fell 0.2 percent in May, the poll of 16 economists found.
""Although an inventory adjustment of electronic parts and devices dragged down the industrial production, domestic and overseas demand are likely to remain supportive,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikkei Securities.
""It remains on the moderate recovery trend though it is not strong.""
Analysts noted an earthquake in western Osaka area in June, which forced some companies to halt factories temporarily, may have also impacted output.
The trade ministry will publish the factory output data at 8:50 a.m. on Tuesday July 31, Japan time (2350 GMT July 30).
Retail sales, which will be announced on Monday, are expected to show a 1.6 percent rise in June from a year ago, up for an eight straight month, the poll showed.
""High temperature helped increase demand for seasonal products and sales of clothes and items such as cosmetics rose as department stores' summer discount sales started earlier,"" said Yusuke Koshiyama, economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
Japan will also issue labor market figures next week.
The jobless rate is seen at 2.3 percent in June, up from 2.2 percent in May which was the lowest in over 25 years. 
The poll found the jobs-to-applicants ratio stood steady at 1.60 percent in June, staying at the highest level since 1.64 in January 1974, the poll found. 
The government will release the jobs data at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday July 31 (2330 GMT on July 30). 
Economists also forecast the Bank of Japan will retain its short-term interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent at the July 30-31 rate review.

However, the BOJ could also consider changes to its massive stimulus program to make it more sustainable, such as allowing greater swings in interest rates and widening its stock-buying selection, people familiar with its thinking said.

459,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 03:09AM ET</span>",Strong U.S. Q2 Economic Growth Should Cement Fed Rate Hikes,"Investing.com - Investors anticipate U.S. economic growth in the second quarter will register its strongest expansion in nearly four years, providing a solid case for the Federal Reserve to move forward with a plan for gradual rate hikes that would include two further increases this year.
The U.S. GDP report for the second quarter will be released Friday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) and the consensus predicts growth of 4.1%. That would be more than twice the 2.0% expansion seen in the first three months of the year and its strongest since the 5.2% reading in the third quarter of 2014.
The range of forecasts is wide with more pessimistic economists pegging it at 3%, while the most optimistic see growth as high as 5.4%. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta cut its projection to 3.8% on Thursday from 4.5% after a weaker-than-expected increase in durable goods orders, while the New York Fed’s last estimate on July 20 pointed to just 2.7%.
But the word from the White House is the number will be to the upside. Fox Business reported this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic advisers are privately telling associates that GDP growth should rise to 4.3% to 4.4%.
“President Trump is even more optimistic, telling one associate he expects second quarter GDP to rise to as much as 4.8% in the second quarter,” according to the report.
Trump publicly insisted via Twitter on Tuesday that the U.S. is “doing great” with the “best financial numbers on the planet,” sparking memories of when the president tweeted about employment numbers head of May’s jobs report.
In any case, stronger-than-expected economic growth would support the Fed’s plans to continue with gradual rate hikes. Fed fund futures currently price in a quarter-point hike for September, with the probability for a second increase in December hovering just above 70%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
“With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testified to Congress on July 17.
The only caveat to the Fed’s current outlook is, in Powell’s own words, “the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy”."
460,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>","After sprinting to aid rupiah, Indonesia c.bank could struggle in a marathon","By Maikel Jefriando and Fransiska Nangoy
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Bank Indonesia has done more than any Asian peer to defend its currency amid a global rout in emerging markets, but the fact that the rupiah has kept slipping suggests the central bank would struggle to maintain the pace in a prolonged battle.
Like many developing markets with current account or trade deficits, Southeast Asia's largest economy is hostage to forces outside its control, including rising U.S. interest rates, higher oil prices and the Washington-Beijing trade conflict.
And the difficult position Indonesia authorities face ""may not end quickly"", PT Bank Central Asia CEO Jahja Setiaatmadja told reporters on Thursday. ""This is truly a marathon."" 
What differentiates Indonesia is how strongly the central bank has come out of the blocks.
Bank Indonesia (BI) has lifted rates 100 basis points, twice what the Philippines has done, and has drawn more heavily on its foreign reserves than other Asian nations have. 
Still, the rupiah  is down more than 6 percent in 2018, nearly as much as the peso  and Indian rupee . Bond yields went down after Indonesia's 50 bps June rate hike - which BI said reflected a ""pre-emptive, front-loading and ahead-of-the-curve"" policy - as investors gave their thumbs-up, but the reprieve proved temporary.
AN OPEN ECONOMY
For sure, economists do not perceive the lackluster results in stabilizing the market as a failure. Much is due to the fact Indonesia's economy is more open than India's or the Philippines' and its financial markets have larger foreign investor participation.
But limited results raise concerns about BI's firepower in case the Sino-U.S. trade conflict escalates and lasts for years, or U.S. heads into recession.
In such an environment, BI's traditional tools won't be enough. Further hiking rates at this pace will choke growth and add to pressure on the currency. And foreign exchange reserves are only $20 billion above the $100 billion mark at which some economists expect BI to turn less interventionist.
Given policy constraints, the economy ""may not be able to able to handle more rate hikes"", Paul Mackel, HSBC head of global emerging markets FX research in Hong Kong, said in a note.
Mackel said Indonesia might consider temporarily requiring exporters to sell some FX proceeds and curb importers' FX purchases, similar to what Malaysia did in 2016. 
President Joko Widodo on Thursday pleaded with exporters to bring home earnings they currently keep offshore to help manage the rupiah from falling further, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Friday.
Indonesian authorities, who know they need a multi-pronged approach, have revived an old tool and created a new one they hope will help the rupiah. 
To give foreign investors more instrument choices, they auctioned 9- and 12-month Bank Indonesia Certificates (SBI) for the first time since 2016, raising 6 trillion rupiah ($412.51 million). The instruments, which foreigners can buy in secondary markets, help bring more capital in and let BI mop up the dollars investors sell to purchase the bonds and rebuild reserves.
Next week, BI launches a new benchmark for overnight interbank money markets, called Indonia, mirroring euro zone's and Britain's Eonia and Sonia. It aims to improve the transmission of BI rate moves to the financial sector.
Beyond reserves, the central bank ""has at its disposal a number of measures"" to counter FX volatility, said Roland Mieth, emerging markets portfolio manager at PIMCO in Singapore.
FINDING DOLLARS
The finance ministry is also reducing rupiah bond issuance, hoping to meet some financing needs with additional foreign-currency loans from lenders such as the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank.
""We are getting many offers, but we are only taking what is needed to cover the shortfall in our rupiah bond issuance,"" Scenaider Siahaan, finance ministry director of borrowing strategy told Reuters.
Foreigners, who hold more than one-third of Indonesia's government bonds, sold nearly 29 trillion rupiah ($2 billion) of local currency bonds in April to June. Following BI's 50 bps benchmark hike, this month has seen 5 trillion rupiah returning. 
While the central bank has been ""very much"" proactive, that doesn't mean Indonesia is out of trouble, said Rohit Garg, emerging market fixed-income and foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore.

""If trade tensions do increase... there is only so much that BI can do to make sure that rupiah weakness is limited,"" he said.

Repatriated earnings could help Southeast Asia's largest economy refill its declining foreign exchange reserves, which the central bank has been using to keep the rupiah from falling too sharply amid a heavy selloff in emerging market currencies.
The president on Thursday met with executives from about 40 exporters, including Budi Hartono, the owner of cigarette maker Djarum, chief executive of Indofood Sukses Makmur (JK:INDF) Anthony Salim and chairman of GarudaFood Group Sudhamek Agung, for two and a half hours to make his case, according to several media reports.
""We hope they keep their export earnings in Indonesia. If they have to use it to buy raw materials and imports, the FX could be used .. but we hope the rest can be kept in Indonesia and be converted to rupiah,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told a press briefing.
BI in 2012 ordered exporters to receive their payments through local banks, in the hope that some of the money would stay in the country and be converted into rupiah. However, some still prefer to keep their earnings abroad.
Indrawati said BI and the government will continue to maintain close communication with the business community, while monitoring whether they need to issue new policies on the matter. She did not elaborate.
BI Governor Perry Warjiyo has repeatedly said he has no plans to implement tougher rules for export earnings.
Between February to June, forex reserves had declined $12.2 billion or about 9 percent, according to Bank Indonesia (BI) data, yet the rupiah is still down more than 6 percent in 2018. The currency was trading near its weakest level in nearly three years on Friday, at 14,460 a dollar.
The central bank said that the end-June reserves level of $119.8 billion was equal to 7.2 months of imports, higher than the international adequacy standard of 3 months of imports.

463,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",What Economists Are Saying Ahead of Friday's U.S. GDP Report,"(Bloomberg) -- White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow is expecting a “very good” number for second-quarter U.S. growth, while one economist has warned that the pace of expansion is “close to a peak.” Either way, analysts are largely projecting that the main number in Friday’s report on gross domestic product will be a standout.
The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for an annualized growth rate of 4.2 percent, which would be the fastest since the third quarter of 2014. Projections range from 3 percent to 5 percent. Here’s what some of the forecasters say ahead of the Commerce Department figures due at 8:30 a.m., which will also include comprehensive revisions to historical GDP numbers:
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) (4.7%)
“The factors driving the headline print are trade related and will likely reverse in the second half of the year, at least in part,” analysts led by Ellen Zentner wrote. They estimate trade and inventories contributed about 2.2 percentage points to the pace of second-quarter growth, which is “likely a reflection of stockpiling ahead of the implementation of trade tariffs.” They estimate final private domestic demand, “a clearer fundamental picture of the economy,” expanded at a “much more modest” 2.5 percent pace in the quarter.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) (4.7%)
“Personal and corporate tax reform has proven beneficial to domestic demand, with solid growth in consumer spending and business investment growth in recent months,” economist Sam Bullard wrote. Net exports probably contributed 1.2 percentage point to growth, which “should fully reverse” in the second half. “While the robust Q2 pace should not be sustained, underlying economic fundamentals remain solid and support our outlook for U.S. real GDP to run around a 3 percent annualized rate for the remainder of the year.” Trade policy poses the main risk to the outlook.
Natixis (4.4%)
“We expect real GDP growth to increase at a hefty pace in Q2 after a trend-like increase” in the first quarter, economist Joseph LaVorgna wrote. “With the trade debate heating up, uncertainty is mounting on the near-term outlook. However, available regional surveys for July either remained steady or surprised on the consensus to the upside. This means that business confidence remains upbeat which is likely to translate into another quarter of solid GDP growth.”
Amherst Pierpont (4.7%)
“As it turns out, consumer spending did improve dramatically, but the main driver of growth in the second quarter was likely a massive narrowing in the trade gap, due primarily to a sharp increase in real exports,” economist Stephen Stanley wrote. “Domestic final demand was strong (projected to rise 3.1 percent) but unspectacular, and perhaps more importantly, largely sustainable.”
Bloomberg Economics (3.8%)
“Second-quarter growth will be robust, to be sure, and could potentially top 4 percent,” economists Carl Riccadonna and Tim Mahedy wrote. “However, this reflects a number of one-time idiosyncratic factors and should not be viewed as an indication of what is to come in the second half. Growth in the second quarter will be elevated in response to residual seasonality that depressed first-quarter activity. It will also be lifted by a substantial narrowing of the trade deficit in the quarter, which appears to be more a reflection of supply-chain adjustments in anticipation of trade-war escalation than any lasting improvement as a result of tariffs.”

464,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",May's Brexit Options Narrow After EU Tears Up Her Customs Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit on Twitter, join our Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin.
Theresa May’s Brexit options are narrowing.
The European Union rejected a key part of her proposal for a trade deal with the bloc on Thursday, sending her back to the drawing board with just 12 weeks to go until a divorce deal is meant to be signed.
May thought her customs proposal was the best hope of getting a Brexit deal she could also sell to a divided Parliament in London. But in a blunt and public critique, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he will never accept her plan.
Now, she’s boxed in, with all options bringing the risk of her being ousted, and increasing the chances of Britain tumbling out of the bloc with no deal at all.
Barnier even suggested one way out of the impasse would be for the U.K. to stay inside the EU customs union, though that would enrage parts of her Conservative Party and mean May having to renege on her repeated promises to leave it.
“I have always said the EU is open to a customs union,” Barnier told reporters as he stood next to U.K. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab in Brussels in the first full news conference the two have held since the minister took over from David Davis on July 9.
Staying inside such an arrangement is the official policy of the U.K.’s main opposition Labour Party, and is favored by the pro-EU members of May’s party who have rebelled against her. That makes Barnier’s suggestion particularly provocative.
On July 12, May put forward a model under which the U.K. would collect the EU’s tariffs on goods entering the country, as part of a plan to keep trade with the bloc flowing freely after the split. But Barnier said the EU would never allow a non-member to collect its tariffs.
The pound weakened on Barnier’s comments and was down 0.5 percent at $1.3129 as of 6:25 p.m. London time.
If the premier can’t persuade her own members of Parliament to back an agreement, the U.K. will be on course to crash out of the bloc with no deal on March 29 next year. Equally, unless she can agree to a blueprint that the EU also accepts, she won’t have any deal to sell at all.
The most important negotiations have virtually stalled and both sides have stepped up “no-deal” contingency planning.
For his part, Raab put a more positive gloss on the state of play in negotiations. “We’ve got a template for a good relationship,” he said of May’s blueprint.
Raab said the Brexit negotiations will resume in mid-August, with weekly discussions from then onward in order to “clear away all the obstacles that lie in our path.”
Both sides say they want to finalize a deal in October to give the U.K. and European parliaments time to approve it before Britain’s departure from the EU eight months from now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico and the United States agreed on Thursday to step up talks on updating the NAFTA trade deal in hopes of reaching an agreement on major issues by August, Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said.
Guajardo said he had ""constructive"" and ""very positive"" talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
North American Free Trade Agreement talks among the United States, Mexico and Canada had stalled since June when the United States slapped tariffs on Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum and both countries responded with tit-for-tat measures on products like U.S. pork, ketchup and Kentucky bourbon.
Guajardo told reporters after the talks in Washington that he and Lighthizer agreed they would need to get to work in order to hammer out a deal by August.
""We agree that in order to align the times and to eventually reach an agreement in principle, we should give ourselves the opportunity to move forward and try to bring this to fruition,"" Guajardo said. 
Lighthizer told U.S. lawmakers earlier on Thursday that he expected to reach a deal with Mexico ""some time in August"" and that an agreement with Canada on NAFTA could follow.
Trump has suggested he could seek a bilateral deal with Mexico, but Guajardo said the U.S.-Mexico talks would lead to discussions with Canada and ""a trilateral dialogue when we get closer to the conclusion.""
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland visited Mexico on Wednesday and she and Guajardo insisted that NAFTA remain a trilateral pact.
Both reiterated their opposition to U.S. calls for a ""sunset clause"" that would put the deal forming one of the world's largest trading blocs up for renewal every five years.
U.S. demands for sweeping changes in the auto sector have also been a stumbling block.
""The idea is to face complex issues,"" Guajardo told reporters on Thursday before meeting Lighthizer. 
The talks to revamp NAFTA began in August 2017 at the request of Trump, who threatened to leave the pact if he did not get more benefits for U.S. workers.
The run-up to Mexico's July presidential election, where leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won in a landslide, had also complicated holding talks. 
Guajardo was joined on Thursday by Jesus Seade, whom Lopez Obrador has tipped as his lead trade negotiator.

Trump told Lopez Obrador in a letter that a quick conclusion to NAFTA talks would bring more jobs for both countries, but warned of a very different route otherwise.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in U.S. funds traded international equities for domestic stocks during the latest week as earnings beat expectations while trade tensions simmered, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
U.S.-based equity funds posted $620 million in withdrawals for the week ended Wednesday, after attracting $1 billion the week prior, Lipper said.
The withdrawals were driven in large part by investors leaving non-domestic equity funds, which saw $1.1 billion in withdrawals. 
U.S.-based domestic equity funds, by contrast, attracted $474 million and a second straight week of inflows, Lipper said.
The strong performance by domestic equity funds came as 83.9 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter profits that beat analyst expectations so far, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""When we get back to the brass tacks, we really had a good beginning to the earnings season,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Thomson Reuters Lipper.
Investors freed up more cash by withdrawing $1.3 billion from U.S.-based money market funds.
Yet trade tensions kept investors on edge, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying during the week that he is ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China.
Fund investors deposited $1.4 billion into U.S.-based taxable-bond funds, a third straight week netting cash. Their municipal bond counterparts took in $550 million, according to Lipper.
U.S.-based precious metals commodities funds ended a streak of outflows that began in early May, attracting $211 million for the period.
Dollar-denominated metals, such as gold, became more affordable for investors abroad after Trump criticized the greenback's strength in an interview aired on Friday and sent the currency lower.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo's core consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating for a second straight month but offering little comfort to the Bank of Japan as it struggles to reach its elusive 2 percent inflation target.
The figure for Tokyo, considered a leading indicator for nationwide price trends, heightens the chance the central bank will concede next week that inflation could fall short of its target for as long as three more years.
The increase in Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, was slightly higher than a median market forecast for a 0.7 percent gain. It followed a 0.7 percent gain in June.
The core-core price index, which excludes both energy and fresh food costs, was up 0.5 percent in July, accelerating from a 0.4 percent increase in June, the data showed.
Tokyo CPI data is available a month before nationwide figures.
Sources have told Reuters that the BOJ, facing stubbornly low inflation, is in unusually active discussions on ways to make its policy framework more sustainable on the view it will take more time than expected to meet its price goal.
Data out last week showed nationwide core consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, accelerating slightly from the previous month but was due largely to higher energy costs.

An index stripping away energy and fresh food costs showed nationwide inflation slowed for the third straight month in June, a setback for the BOJ's efforts to meet its inflation target via aggressive monetary easing.

The economic growth estimate was unchanged from the IMF's last forecast made in May. The IMF raised its estimate for China's growth in 2018 in January after the economy unexpectedly accelerated last year.
While the IMF praised China's progress on reducing financial sector risks and in further opening its economy, it said credit growth was still unsustainably high as some aspects of the country's rebalancing had slowed. 
Beijing has over the last two years sought to rein in rapid credit growth, which economists and analysts say will result in slower growth in the near term but is needed to avoid a sharp slowdown and the risk of a financial crisis longer term.
The IMF said China needs to stick to its deleveraging agenda while implementing much-needed fiscal reforms and economic rebalancing. 
""China is at an historic juncture. After decades of high-speed growth, the authorities are now focusing on high-quality growth,"" the report said. 
""Whether and how this shift is carried through will determine China's development path for decades to come."" 
Economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter as Beijing's efforts to contain debt hurt activity, sparking concerns the economy was slowing faster than expected.
Beijing has taken steps to increase credit to small firms and has said it will adopt a more active fiscal policy, though it will refrain from a repeat of strong stimulus to boost economic growth. 
The IMF said ""China's near-term outlook remains robust due to strong domestic momentum, recovering global trade, and significant reform progress"".
But the IMF cited widespread state intervention, a still relatively closed economy, and a slowdown in rebalancing toward consumption last year as challenges, and reiterated its long-standing call for China to de-emphasize growth targets.
The IMF said China's headline inflation is expected to rise gradually to around 2.5 percent, while producer price inflation would moderate.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Chinese and U.S. envoys presented radically differing visions of Beijing's economic model at the World Trade Organization on Thursday, a choice between ""the world's most protectionist economy"" and a growth story that has benefited all countries.
The clash came as the two face off in a multi-billion dollar trade war - U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a barrage of tariffs, accusing China of unfair practices and stealing innovation. China has targeted U.S. farm produce.
U.S. Ambassador Dennis Shea was presenting a paper entitled ""China's trade-disruptive economic model"" to the last WTO meeting before a summer break.
""Despite China’s repeated portrayal of itself as a staunch defender of free trade and the global trading system, China is in fact the most protectionist, mercantilist economy in the world,"" Shea said.
Aside from the tariffs, the two sides are wrestling to get the WTO to see things their way: Washington says China cheats by having an economy run by the state, Beijing says it plays by the rules agreed when it joined the WTO in 2001.
Shea said the harm done by China's state-led approach to trade and investment ""can no longer be tolerated"", and it was not enough to assert that it was following WTO rules.
State-owned enterprises play an outsized role in China, with control exercised by the government and Communist Party, which appoint top executives and hold the keys to crucial inputs such as land and capital, Shea said. 
GUNPOWDER
He said the law was an instrument of the state, and courts were structured to respond to the Communist Party's direction. 
""For China, economic reform means perfecting the government’s and the Communist Party’s management of the economy and strengthening the state sector, particularly state-owned enterprises."" 
China's Ambassador Zhang Xiangchen said Shea's remarks had a whiff of gunpowder about them and his report was ""half-cooked"", with no evidence to support its assertion that the Chinese state ""controls"" enterprises.
In a statement to Reuters, Zhang said the United States was trying to demonise China to take the heat off itself, but it was an illusion to think China would bow down and accept a tailor-made set of rules that sought to tie its hands.
Zhang told the WTO meeting that Shea wanted WTO members to believe that enterprises controlled by the government were ""public bodies"" subject to WTO subsidy rules. But WTO judges had definitively thrown out that argument, he added.
Beijing's industrial policies were ""guidance"" and state-owned enterprises were autonomous market entities responsible for their own profits or losses, he said. Overcapacity in some industries was due not to the state but to contraction of global demand following the financial crisis, he added.

The U.S. paper had misleadingly edited China's official policy, cutting out references to the ""decisive role"" of the market in allocating resources, he said.
""A fiction repeated enough times may become a belief,"" he said, adding that he had read Shea's paper very carefully, including its 88 footnotes.
""For some footnotes, I could not find the sources as referred,"" he said. ""But as we all know, the devil is in the details. If a paper has flaws in its footnote, then its evidence may be called into question and its arguments will be put into doubt.""

“A good trade negotiation, as I have said before, can be only done on balanced and reciprocal basis and under no circumstances under threat,” Macron said during a joint press conference in Madrid with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. “We have some questions that we will want to clarify in the coming days with our European partners.”
Macron’s reservations about the deal sealed Wednesday in Washington reflect concern that the accord may create imbalances among European countries, and Germany in particular. Sanchez matched his French counterpart’s caution.
“The Spanish don’t believe in unilateralism or that a specific economy imposes its policies and criteria in international trade,” said Sanchez.
In return for a pledge by Trump to suspend the threat of an extra tariff on European Union car exports, Juncker reheated proposals to bolster transatlantic economic ties and buy more liquefied natural gas from the U.S. Such a move would ease Europe’s reliance on Russian gas.
Macron said that agricultural products should be excluded from talks, citing European standards on food safety and environment that should not be abandoned in talks.
“This is the principle at the heart of the European sovereignty I am calling for,” he said. The deal points to increased imports of U.S. soybeans.
He said that European firms should be given better access to public-sector tenders in the U.S. and called from Trump to make a gesture of goodwill over the “illegal tariffs” he’s imposed on steel and aluminum.
“This must comes ahead of any concrete advances” on trade, he said.

472,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",China's Easing Move Draws Value Hunters to Unloved Bank Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Value hunters are paying more attention to China’s unloved banking stocks after the government softened its deleveraging drive.
Spurned for months, they’ve been some of the biggest beneficiaries of China’s coordinated efforts to mitigate growing risks to its slowing economy. The policy shift triggered a 6.8 percent rally in the country’s largest lenders over four days through Wednesday, putting Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. on course for their first monthly gain since January.
Evidence of a liquidity squeeze this year and a tougher regulatory environment had clouded the outlook for banks, taking their shares to the cheapest since 2014 relative to a benchmark of global lenders. Despite the recent bounce, the risks mean banks still trade below the value of their assets on average, a valuation that stands out as China refocuses policy on boosting demand.
“Banking stocks are pricing in such a negative scenario that the risk-reward is quite favorable,” said Felix Lam, a fund manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in Hong Kong. “Authorities have a lot of tools at their disposal if the environment turns sour again.”
Banks have languished in a bear market since May. They make up 17 percent of the CSI 300 Index, the largest industry group, and generate the majority of the profits. Analysts have yet to change their tune: the 21 lenders on the CSI 300 have average rating of 3.97, where 5 is the highest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the second-lowest rating among the 23 industries on the benchmark.
Steps taken by policy makers in July have started to lift the mood. China’s central bank told some banks on Wednesday that a specific capital requirement will be eased to support lending. That was just days after it made a record injection of longer-term funding available to commercial banks, and followed its looser-than-expected rules for the asset management industry. Analysts also predict more cuts to the reserve-requirement ratio this year.
To be sure, Thursday’s 0.6 percent drop in the CSI 300 Banks index suggests investors are still cautious. The government is clearly still committed to reducing risk in the financial system, a transition which for banks may take years. Skeptics also say that China’s policy tweaks won’t immediately alleviate tightening credit conditions.
“The rebound earlier in the week is overdone,” said Dai Ming, Shanghai-based fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co. “People bet on policy easing and a liquidity boost, but that takes time to materialize and authorities have said it’s not going to be an aggressive stimulus.”
For now, all eyes are on whether lending data shows that bet will pay off. While China’s broadest measure of new credit expanded in June, that followed a slump in May which had taken it to the lowest in almost two years.
The policy tweaks “indicate a shift towards a more ‘pragmatic’ regulatory environment, which may help ease the headwinds,” China International Capital Corp. analysts including Shuaishuai Zhang wrote in a July 25 note. They have buy ratings on almost all Chinese banks in their coverage, Bloomberg data show."
473,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:09PM ET</span>",Maduro move to lop five zeroes off currency worries Venezuelans,"By Deisy Buitrago and Mayela Armas
CARACAS/MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Some Venezuelans worried on Thursday about how to pay for public transport and gasoline after leftist President Nicolas Maduro announced plans to slash five zeroes off the country's bolivar currency, rather than the three originally planned. 
The more aggressive so-called currency redomination comes in response to Venezuela's hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund has said will soar to 1 million percent this year, destroying salaries and throwing the OPEC nation's already battered economy into a deeper tailspin. 
Maduro's announcement late Wednesday night spawned confusion as to whether there would be legal tender small enough to pay for public transit or gasoline - which is so subsidized that filling up a car at a gas station costs less than the equivalent of $0.01 at the black market exchange rate.
""How will I pay for transport? They charge me 60,000 bolivars. With five zeroes fewer, that would be in cents,"" said Griselda Osorio, 55, as she shopped at a market in the western city of Maracaibo near Colombia. 
""I am going to have to forget about transport and just walk. How will I put (prepaid credit) on my phone? Where do I find cents for that? This will just make things worse,"" said Osorio, a nurse whose current salary of 4 million bolivars - about $1.30 - will turn into 40 bolivars. 
It also remains unclear whether banks can adjust their systems and cash machines by the announced deadline of Aug. 20, as well as when all the new bills will arrive in Venezuela. 
Maduro's plan to lop five zeroes off the currency highlights the reversal of fortune in a once wealthy country, which has seen the bolivar lose over 99 percent of its value in the last year alone amid an economic meltdown.
The measure, according to economists, fails to attack the root of Venezuela's crisis - namely two decades of distorted state-led economic policy and excess expansion of the money supply.
""Eliminating the zeroes, although necessary, is insufficient because hyperinflation's underlying problem, which is a deep imbalance of the economy, is not attacked,"" said economist Asdrubal Oliveros of local consultancy Ecoanalitica.
The government has said it is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by opposition leaders with backing from Washington, which last year levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro's administration and a group of top officials.
Many Venezuelans say that is a smokescreen designed to hide incompetence and bad policy decisions.

""We are more screwed by the day,"" said motorbike deliveryman Luis Ramirez, 60, as he delivered a package in Caracas. ""This measure, which I do not understand very well, does not change anything.""

474,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Turnbull Aims for Australia Election Boost From Super Saturday,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is looking for a strong showing for his Liberal-National coalition in special by-elections being held in Australia this weekend as he looks to bolster his leadership ahead of a nationwide election to be held within a year.
Polls show the coalition has a chance to win as many as two of the five electorates up for grabs in the so-called Super Saturday by-elections, the bulk of which have been triggered because incumbent Labor candidates were deemed ineligible due to holding citizenship of other nations at the time of the last election in 2016.
Should Labor lose a seat to the government, it will place pressure on party leader Bill Shorten and give the prime minister bragging rights: The last time an incumbent government won a seat from the opposition in a by-election was 1920. While his coalition marginally trails Labor in national polls, some political pundits say a strong showing may embolden Turnbull to call an election as early as this year, months before it must be held by May.
“There could be significant consequences from these elections,” said Nick Economou, a political analyst at Monash University in Melbourne. “A poor result for Labor may tempt Turnbull to go to the polls as soon as possible to lock the opposition in with an unpopular leader.”
Labor, which is campaigning on its promise to bolster health and education spending, holds two of the seats -- one in Brisbane’s northern fringes and one in rural Tasmania -- by a 2.2 percent margin or less, and Turnbull’s government has been campaigning heavily to win them back. Another electorate the government is aiming to reclaim is in Adelaide, which is held by an independent. It’s not contesting the other two Perth-based seats safely held by Labor.
Bolstered by a strengthening economy and surging employment, Turnbull’s government has improved its performance in opinion polls this year and has a reasonable chance to win re-election. The prime minister has shrugged off gaffes that threatened to derail his coalition, including an extramarital affair by his then-deputy Barnaby Joyce, allowing him to better focus voters’ attention on his core message of providing economic and defense security.
Still, Turnbull, 63, has downplayed the chances of winning a seat on Saturday and says he remains committed to holding the national ballot next year. He won the last election by only one seat.
“It is very clear that they are close, obviously, but you have to remember that the last time a government won a by-election from the opposition was 100 years ago,” Turnbull told reporters on Monday.
A poor showing on Saturday for Labor would weigh heavily on Shorten, 51. Polls show he’s less popular than Turnbull as voters’ preferred prime minister.
“It is not about me or Malcolm -- it is about more of the same from the Turnbull government,” Shorten told reporters on Tuesday. “What we are going to do is keep focusing on the issues.”

The pact with the EU to refrain from new tariffs, announced Wednesday, has Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). economists suggesting a possible turning point in the global trade war. To celebrate the breakthrough, Trump tweeted a photo of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker greeting him with a kiss on the cheek.
Meanwhile, relations between Washington and Beijing showed no signs of improvement Thursday as Trump’s top trade negotiator played down the prospect of a quick compromise and a top Chinese trade official railed against U.S. trade strategy as “extortion.” Those were the latest signs that common ground with China remains a major challenge. A negotiating framework with Beijing in May lasted just days before Trump called for deeper concessions.
“We clearly have a chronic problem with China,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in Senate testimony, estimating that trade issues with Beijing will take years to resolve. He said the Trump administration believes it must push back against China because it uses “state capitalism” to take advantage of the openness of the U.S. economy, costing Americans jobs and wealth.
“Some issues will be dealt with in a short period of time,” Lighthizer said. “Directionally, we’re going to have a problem with China that’s going to go on for years.”
In the early stages of talks, it appeared that Beijing might mollify the president by pledging to buy more American soybeans and energy, as the Europeans did this week. But Lighthizer’s remarks portray the trade dispute as a longer-term clash between radically different systems. If such a view prevails in coming months, it signals slimmer odds Trump can reach a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who’s shown little desire for abrupt economic strategy shifts.
In the most recent sign of the U.S. and China’s frayed economic ties, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc., based in San Diego, scrapped its $44 billion bid for rival chipmaker  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) after Chinese regulators failed to approve the largest-ever deal in the chip industry. Interviewed earlier Thursday on CNBC, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was “very disappointed” in China’s decision.
The hearing gave both Democrats and Republicans a chance to criticize Trump’s trade policies, highlight the pain on American farmers and businesses, and point out the lack of a timetable for resolving the disputes. China’s authoritarian political system offers its officials the ability to wait out the U.S. on trade issues, said Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii.
“How do we have leverage in a situation where they have unending patience and we have almost none?” he asked Lighthizer. “You don’t pick stupid fights.”
“If your conclusion is that China taking over all of our technology and the future of our children is a stupid fight, then you’re right, we should capitulate,” Lighthizer responded. “My view is that’s how we got where we are.”
The deal with the EU suggests Trump will take an even harder line with China, rather than backing down, said Dan DiMicco, a former steel-industry executive who advised Trump during the 2016 campaign.
“Trump is playing hardball,” he said in an interview. “The president is going to build a coalition to deal with the real issue, which is China’s mercantilism.”
Tariffs, Retaliation
The Trump administration this week held public hearings on its plan to target $16 billion in Chinese goods targeted with duties of 25 percent, which could be imposed after a comment period ends July 31. The administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion of products on July 6, after similar hearings in May.
The U.S. has also identified an additional $200 billion of goods slated for a 10 percent duty after China announced retaliatory levies, and Trump has said he’s “ready to go” with tariffs on $500 billion in imports -- roughly the annual value of all U.S. imports from China.
High-level talks between the U.S. and China are on hold, and neither side appears ready to dial down the rhetoric. “Holding our feet to the fire has never worked,” China’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization, Zhang Xiangchen, said Thursday in Geneva. “Extortion, distortion or demonization does no good to resolve the issues.”
The U.S. deal with the EU is a “clear negative for China,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong.
“It means the EU is on the U.S. side,” she said. “We should expect the EU to align to some of the protectionist measures taken by Trump on China.”
Even as he criticized China, Lighthizer expressed optimism of a deal on a new North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. hopes to conclude an agreement-in-principle with Canada and Mexico in August, Lighthizer said. The Mexican peso rose following his comments.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",EU rejects Britain's key elements of special customs plan after Brexit,"By Jan Strupczewski and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected key elements of Britain's new trade proposals on Thursday even as he and his new British counterpart Dominic Raab voiced a shared determination to reach a deal by October.
At a joint news conference with the Brexit secretary after three days of talks among officials in Brussels, Barnier made clear British offers to collect customs duties for the EU as part of efforts to avoid friction on Northern Ireland's new EU border had failed to convince already skeptical Europeans.
""The EU cannot and ... will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and excise duty collection to a non-member, who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures,"" Barnier said. ""Any customs arrangements or customs union ... must respect this principle.""
""The UK wants to take back control of its money, law, and borders. We will respect that,"" he said. 
""But the EU also wants to keep control of its money, law, and borders. The UK should respect that.""
Barnier added that Prime Minister Theresa May might instead offer to join a customs union with the EU, although that would prevent London cutting its own trade deals with other countries. May has ruled out a customs union and Raab said Britain still believed it could reach a deal to avoid a ""hard border"".
Negotiations to provide an outline of how trade will work between Britain and the EU after Brexit next March and, more particularly, after the end of a status quo transition in 2021, have become tangled up with resolving the Irish question, which Brussels says must be done in a pre-Brexit withdrawal treaty.
Raab said his officials had answered EU counterparts' concerns on the customs plan, part of a White Paper which May pushed through her cabinet at the expense of the resignation of Raab's predecessor and fellow Brexit campaigner David Davis.
At the heart of the conundrum lies an EU insistence that the way to avoid a ""hard border"" is for Northern Ireland to follow EU rules as in Ireland and, if need be, different from those on the British mainland, while May rejects new barriers to goods moving from the mainland to the troubled province.
Raab said he believed a so-called ""backstop"" clause in the treaty on Ireland could be agreed, though he said Britain would insist it was not valid forever - something Barnier says it must be in case Britain's promised better proposals do not work.
""With pragmatism on both sides I am confident we can find a way to resolve it into a workable solution and that will be easier to achieve if the backstop, if it were to be exercised at all, could only be for a time-limited period before the future arrangements become operational,"" Raab told reporters.
Barnier, however, said the talks this week had failed to convince him: ""We have no objections in principle to this,"" he said of what he calls an ""all-UK backstop"". 
""But,"" he added, ""We have doubts that it can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue. 
""We have had an open and frank and therefore useful discussion with Dominic on these issues. I think the UK has understood our concerns and respects our principles and the UK had promised to come back to us with concrete proposals on how to address our concerns.""

Both men said negotiations would resume in mid-August - normally a time when the EU institutions are closed for summer holidays - and would continue weekly thereafter.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's president backed investor expectations for a rate hike in October 2019, saying on Thursday the risks from an unpredictable global trade conflict did not warrant any deviation from its plan now.
Mario Draghi struck a relatively upbeat tone on the economic outlook and reaffirmed plans to end the central bank's 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program this year and keep rates at their record low level ""through the summer of 2019"".
Asked to unpack this formulation, which has given rise to diverging interpretations by investors and even policymakers, Draghi said market expectations were ""very well aligned"" with the central bank's own.
Money markets currently price in a 10 basis points increase in the ECB's deposit rate in October 2019, in what would be the first hike since 2011 after years of monetary largesse.
""As far as pure (market) expectations are concerned, they are very well aligned with the anticipation of the Governing Council,"" Draghi said.
Sources told Reuters earlier this month ECB rate-setters were split over when the ECB might raise interest rates and the very meaning of ""through the summer"". Some said an increase was possible as early as July 2019 while others ruled out a move until autumn.
Draghi said on Thursday they did not feel the need to change that wording.
""At this stage, we don't see the need to modify or to add new language to our forward guidance on rates,"" Draghi told reporters.
He added that the ECB would follow its capital key, the amount of capital each member central bank has paid in, when deciding how to reinvest the cash it will receive from maturing bonds from next year, without providing more details..
A key challenge is that the remaining maturity of the bond pile declines over time, so the ECB will have to decide whether to target longer-dated bonds or to accept the natural aging of its portfolio.
(For a graphic on 'ECB policy vs. inflation and bond yields' click https://reut.rs/2JPYo6Y)
UPBEAT ON GROWTH
Draghi played down the recent stream of mostly disappointing economic data and said the central bank continued to expect solid and widespread economic growth.
The composite PMI indicator dipped in June, consumer confidence eased and the German IFO business climate index for July fell - all pointing to a slowdown that might mean the ECB lowers its growth projections when it publishes new forecasts in September.
Draghi did point to some signs of weakness that have started to emerge in the bloc's economy. Exports have lost some momentum, he said, while a global trade war would change the picture altogether if it snowballed.
""Clearly a trade war where you would have rounds of retaliation and rounds of responses, would create an entirely different climate."" 
There were hopes though it could be avoided after U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday that they would negotiate rather than rush into imposing trade tariffs on each other.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Leaders of the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, meeting in the wake of tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump, signed a declaration supporting an open and inclusive multilateral trading system under World Trade Organization rules at their summit in South Africa on Thursday. 
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa agreed at the three-day meeting to fight unilateralism and protectionism.
""We reaffirm the centrality of the rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, as embodied in the World Trade Organization, that promotes a predictable trade environment and the centrality of the WTO,"" the declaration signed by the five leaders said.
The leaders said: ""We recognize that the multilateral trading system is facing unprecedented challenges. We underscore the importance of an open world economy.""
They called on all WTO members to abide by WTO rules. 
The meeting of BRICS leaders is the first since the U.S. administration launched a push to rebalance trade multilateralism that Trump has deemed unfair - relationships that the United States once championed.
Earlier on Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a concerted effort by global institutions such as the United Nations and the WTO to fight unilateralism and protectionism. 
Xi, who leads the world's second-biggest economy, also called for dialogue to settle disputes on global trade, underlining remarks he made at the opening of the summit the previous day. 
'REJECT PROTECTIONISM'
""We must work together ... to safeguard the rule-based multilateral trading regime, promote trade and investment, globalization and facilitation, and reject protectionism outright,"" Xi said.
On Wednesday, Xi said there would be no winner in a global trade war.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called for more trade within the BRICS bloc. 
""We should work to reduce administrative barriers to stimulate trade between our countries,"" Putin said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for the bloc's members to harness technology to develop their economies.
A handful of protesters gathered near the conference hall where the summit was being held. Their leader, activist Trevor Ngwane, said ""none of these heads of state speak for the working class or the poor"". 
He handed a list of complaints to South African Public Works Minister Thilas Nxesi, who said the BRICS forum would help attract investment and create jobs.

""The forum must not be seen as if it is for the rich or the bourgeoisie,"" he said.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Bank of England poised to push rates above crisis lows,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to pass a post-financial crisis milestone next week by finally raising interest rates above their emergency levels set more than nine years ago.
But with a potentially messy Brexit nearing, Governor Mark Carney may sound cautious about the pace of further moves away from the BoE's still-powerful stimulus program.
In March 2009, when the financial crisis was raging, the BoE slashed its benchmark rate to 0.5 percent to stave off the risk of a depression. 
Bank Rate has sat there since, apart from a 15-month period after the shock referendum vote in 2016 for Britain to leave the European Union, when it was cut again to 0.25 percent - the lowest in the three-century history of the central bank.
Now, Carney and his colleagues are expected to nudge rates up to 0.75 percent on Aug. 2, going beyond last November's increase back up to 0.5 percent. 
However, taking rates above their crisis levels will not be a vote of confidence in the world's fifth-biggest economy. 
Britain has gone from having the strongest growth of the Group of Seven rich nations to being one of the slowest after the Brexit decision. 
The terms of Britain's future relationship with the EU are still unclear, eight months before Brexit, and Prime Minister Theresa May could yet be unseated by her own Conservative Party which is split on how close the country should remain to the bloc.
At the same time, consumers are still feeling a squeeze on their spending power. And inflation, while above the BoE's 2 percent target at 2.4 percent, has been weaker than expected.
Nonetheless, the BoE says the economy cannot grow even at its current sluggish rate without causing too much inflation, given Britain's chronically weak productivity growth.
A BoE decision to raise borrowing costs could also be backed up by a new estimate of what it considers the neutral interest rate for Britain's economy, which neither stimulates nor suppresses demand and which is likely to be rising in the coming years as the effects of the financial crisis fade.
U-TURN AHEAD?
BoE officials have tried to soothe concerns about raising rates, something they promise will be gradual and limited.
""Voting for a 25 basis-point rate rise, a full decade after monetary policy was first placed on an emergency setting, is hardly either surprising or radical,"" Chief Economist Andy Haldane said in late June.
But some analysts believe raising borrowing costs is an unnecessary risk that the central bank is taking because it failed to deliver on previous signals that a hike was coming.
John Wraith, a strategist at UBS, said domestic inflation pressure -- chiefly from wage growth -- was very benign while tighter monetary conditions risked triggering a squeeze on indebted consumers and cooling domestic demand.
""If and when that happens, the interest rate market may start to anticipate a reversion by the (BoE) to a neutral policy stance, especially if there are ongoing headwinds and downside risks to the outlook emanating from the UK's protracted exit from the EU,"" he said in a note to clients, adding that investors might even start to bet on a rate cut ahead.
Yet the chance of an increase on Thursday is rated at 80 percent by financial markets, and eight of the BoE's nine monetary policymakers are likely to back a rise, analysts say.
Investors will be listening closely for whatever signals Carney gives about the outlook for further increases.
Markets are not pricing in an increase in borrowing costs to 1 percent for at least another year.
In the past, Carney has warned investors they are being too relaxed about the prospect of further hikes.
Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec, said the BoE might want to send another reminder to the market to remain on guard, as long as Britain manages to secure a deal with the EU and avoid a damaging ""cliff-edge"" Brexit.

""We don't know what politics will bring but I think Carney would want to push those expectations up a bit,"" Clarke said.

481,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",China Plans Retaliation for Any Amount of U.S. Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese government has a plan to retaliate against increases in U.S. tariffs regardless of the volume of goods targeted, according to an official in Beijing.
China is ready to respond to measures from U.S. President Donald Trump whether they involve $16 billion or $200 billion of Chinese imports, the official said Thursday, asking not to be identified.
The comments came as the world’s two biggest economies are locked in a trade standoff after imposing tariffs on $34 billion of each other’s goods earlier this month. Another $16 billion of trade is likely to be targeted soon.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has identified an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods and Trump said he is “ready to go” with tariffs on as much as $500 billion, roughly the value of all China’s annual exports to the U.S. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency during the yuan’s monthlong losing streak.
China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday that the two sides have had no contact about renewing talks and the U.S. is fueling tensions while putting all the blame on China.

"
483,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 09:57AM ET</span>",Trump finally seems to be realizing the political risks that tariffs pose for him,"He has floated plans to pay $12 billion in additional farm support payments to offset crop price declines driven by the tariffs he has imposed on China and the retaliatory tariffs they have imposed on us.
And when European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker came to the White House, Trump and Juncker announced an airy, vague agreement on trade — mostly an agreement to talk about having more talks, though Juncker made an assurance that Europe will buy more soybeans. And Trump, crucially, said there will be no new tariffs, for now, while the US and Europe talk.
We will even try to ""resolve"" our disputes over metals, though that is just a specific form of agreement to talk about talking.
With these vague public announcements, Trump is sending a message: I understand my tariffs are hurting some Americans, I have a plan to offset some of that pain, and I'm trying to find a way forward to a future with fewer trade barriers instead of more.
I don't think any of this signals a change of heart. But it may signal a favorable change of political judgment that spares us maximum trade war escalation.
As many Republican members of Congress have pointed out, creating an economic problem and then handing out subsidies to offset it is a much worse approach than not creating the problem in the first place.
And while damaging tariffs on automobile imports — which would both raise consumer prices and disrupt employment in the automotive industry, because of likely retaliatory tariffs — are being avoided for now, ill-considered tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products are still very much in place.
And residents of farm states have good reason to doubt the added subsidies will last as long as the trade war does.
And, of course, Trump could change his mind next week. A few months ago, Trump seemed to be at a trade detente with China, too. The auto tariffs he is reportedly itching to impose might still come, later, when he gets frustrated that Europe isn't actually buying enough soybeans — or whatever.
Still, it is good that the president has shown that he understands his tariffs have economic and political costs — and that he decided a good way to deal with that was at least a gesture toward ceasefire on tariff escalation.
Trump's remarks last week criticizing the Federal Reserve reflect a fact about trade that may be dawning on him.
Trump criticized the Fed for raising interest rates, nothing that doing so tends to raise the trade deficit. This is true.
What's unspoken is that Trump cannot reduce the trade deficit by raising tariffs, because tariffs (which reduce imports) lead to retaliatory tariffs (which reduce exports) and a stronger dollar (which increases imports and reduces exports).
Since Trump seems to view ""winning and losing"" in trade as a matter of the size of the trade deficit — if you sell me more than I sell you, I'm losing — maybe he has realized he should be worried less about tariffs and more about exchange rates and monetary policy.
Unfortunately for Trump, he has much less direct control over monetary policy than he does over tariff policy. If the lessons Trump learned in the last two weeks stick, we might see fewer unilateral tariffs from him and more whining about Fed policy.
I'd consider that a fair trade."
484,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 09:52AM ET</span>","Money managers see past Trump talk, expect trade war to blow over","By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Global money managers believe U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs will not descend into a full-blown trade war, and even those particularly worried have done little to protect their portfolios.
Some of them might have felt vindicated on Wednesday when Trump agreed with the European Union not to impose car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations. But if the threat of a transatlantic trade war has eased at least temporarily, the battle with China may only just be starting. 
Trump has vowed to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese imports until Beijing ends its ""unfair trade war""; he reiterated his threats on Wednesday, calling China ""vicious"".
The stakes are high: a sustained trade conflict could cost the global economy nearly $500 billion, knocking growth by half a percentage point by 2020, the International Monetary Fund has said.
Yet most money managers reckon the dispute will blow over. 
""The more we talk about the trade wars, the bigger we perceive the risks to be without anything fundamental necessarily changing,"" said John Roe, Head of Multi-Asset Funds at Legal and General Investment Management, which manages $983 billion in assets. 
""A bigger concern for us in the second half would be a pick-up in U.S. inflation. That has global ramifications that can't be defused by a quick phone call.""
The prospect of a trade war does worry investors, who see it as the biggest risk to markets since the 2012 euro zone debt crisis, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's poll showed this month. But few are preparing for all of Trump's rhetoric to translate into action, or cause much damage.
One reason for that is belief that Trump's rhetoric is aimed at voters ahead of November mid-term elections. 
Second, measures so far have been small - Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on less than $50 billion worth of each other's goods, essentially a rounding error for economies jointly worth $32 trillion. 
(For a graphic on 'U.S. trade with China' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2LdzJv4)
And Trump's attempts to upend the international order come at a time of relatively robust world growth. Past instances of protectionism have tended to coincide with downturns that saw governments scrambling to save jobs.
LGIM's Roe said if the biggest worry was a 0.5 percent growth hit, ""we are in a pretty benign environment.""
Also, recent trade-linked selloffs have been relatively contained - even before the U.S.-EU deal, world stocks stood less than four percent below record highs (MIWD00000PUS). 
""No one really takes 100 percent of what Trump says [seriously]. He changes his mind a lot and China has been relaxed and quiet in its response,"" said Roberto Coronado, a credit portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.
""Am I going to sell everything because of this? It doesn't make sense. I would miss out and I would have made the wrong investment."" 
NO OPTION
Nor do options markets indicate investors are bracing for volatility to rise when tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods take effect from as early as September.
Three-month out-of-the-money equity volatility in European equities (STOXX50E), which measures volatility expectations, has been lower than current levels less than one percent of the time over the past 13 years, two bank derivatives traders said. 
Chinese equity volatility also remains low, suggesting few are preparing for a further share slump (SSEC), said Anshul Gupta, head of European equity derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Chinese shares have fallen 15 percent in 2018. 
U.S. markets do show some signs of nervousness. 
Options pricing for the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (O:QQQ), a passive fund which includes big-ticket tech names such as Apple (O:AAPL), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and chip suppliers selling to China, show a higher preference for puts by mid-September, according to market analytics firm Trade Alert.
Puts are options that offer protection against price falls.
Investors have been more skittish about European automotive stocks (SXAP), the derivatives traders said, but following Wednesday's U.S.-EU announcement, volatility expectations look set to ease.
(For a graphic on 'Mutual dependence: U.S. and EU trade' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2tQOBIO)
The bigger risk remains an escalation with China, all the more so because growth momentum may be faltering. A Reuters poll of 150 economists worldwide reflected an overwhelming conviction that global growth had peaked. 
""$200 billion [of tariffs] would be an acceleration, something quite significant. That's not fully discounted,"" said Tim Graf, State Street Global Markets' EMEA Head of Macro Strategy.
Investor reluctance to prepare for crisis mirrors a broader trend in recent years, in which big political or geopolitical shocks like Britain's Brexit referendum or Italy's political crisis are too hard or costly to hedge against, and therefore remain underpriced until they explode.
BAML's Gupta said investors were not being complacent and understood potential trade-related risks but added: ""it is very hard to pinpoint which way it goes from here and who blinks first, and when.""
There are also competing concerns, such as the end of central banks' stimulus, rising interest rates, and desperation not to miss out on what could be the bull market's last hurrah.
POPULIST TALK
Protectionism plays well among Trump's core blue-collar voter base, and trade noise could well boost his polling ahead of mid-term elections in November. 
Others say Trump's tough talk masks a desire to secure new bilateral trading deals that he can can present as a win for American workers.
Investors wanting a sound strategy should not preclude ""the idea of a rational outcome to the whole affair,"" said investment firm Carmignac's Didier Saint-Georges.
Rhetoric may not descend into a growth-sapping war because many expect Trump to tone down the bellicosity on any sign the U.S. economy is suffering. 

""He thinks the strong economy is the key to winning elections,"" said Kim Forrest, a fund manager at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group. ""And he's not going to jeopardize that.""

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Moelis & Co (N:MC) is preparing to apply for an advisory license in Saudi Arabia to enable it to secure more deals, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The New York-based boutique investment bank is expected to apply for a license from the country's Capital Market Authority (CMA) to carry out advisory work enabling it to do more local equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions work, two of the sources said.
Moelis declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The CMA did not initially respond to a request for comment.
Moelis was chosen last year as an adviser by Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] on its plans for what could be the world's largest initial public share offering.
The IPO has since been delayed as Aramco works on a possible purchase of a ""strategic stake"" in local petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE:2010).
But a flurry of other deals are expected in the country as a result of planned privatizations of state-owned assets and financing activity by private companies to help Saudi Arabia to diversify its economy away from a dependence on oil revenues.
Moelis has expanded from its United States base to locations across North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Its expansion in the Middle East has accelerated since opening an office in Dubai in 2010.
Saudi authorities require foreign financial services firms to obtain licenses for certain activities within the country's capital markets such as advisory roles on IPOs and merger and acquisition deals.
Several other international banks are seeking to beef up their presence in Saudi Arabia.  Citigroup  (N:C) is considering applying for a full banking license, a senior executive at the bank said in May, while Goldman Sachs (N:GS) plans to expand its services in the kingdom after being cleared to trade equities there.

The comments came after the ECB left interest rates on hold at the conclusion of its latest policy setting meeting, in what was a widely anticipated decision.
Draghi said the euro area economy still needs ""significant monetary policy stimulus,"" despite announcing plans last month to wind up the bank’s quantitative easing program at the end of the year.
""Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term,"" Draghi said at the banks post policy meeting press conference in Frankfurt.
Draghi said it is ""too early"" to assess the impact of the agreement between Europe and the U.S. to cooperate on trade, but said it was a good sign.
""It is a good sign, because in a sense it shows that there is a willingness to discuss trade issues in a multilateral framework again,"" he said.
Draghi also noted that uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook is receding and said risks to the growth outlook remain broadly balanced."
487,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>","ECB keeps policy unchanged, sees QE ending this year","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on track to end lavish bond buys by the close of the year and to keep rates record low at least through next summer. 
With inflation rebounding, the ECB decided last month to end a 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme by the end of December but also promised protracted stimulus for years to come as the euro zone is economy is still far from full health. 
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term,"" the ECB said in a policy statement. 
The ECB has already spent around 2.5 trillion euros ($2.93 trillion) buying bonds since 2015 and has kept its deposit rate below zero, effectively charging banks for their idle cash, for four years in a bid to revive inflation.
Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT news conference, at which he is likely to discuss the economic soft patch and growing concerns that protectionism could morph into a trade war and hold back growth. 
With Thursday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at -0.40 percent.
The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00 percent while the rate on the marginal lending facility -- the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks -- remains at 0.25 percent.

489,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",EU Counts Its Trade Blessings as Juncker Returns With Trump Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union appears to have won a big trade-war ceasefire with the U.S. for a small price -- at least in the short term.
In return for a pledge by U.S. President Donald Trump to suspend the threat of an extra tariff on European cars, the EU reheated proposals to bolster transatlantic economic ties and threw in a vow to buy more American beans.
The main question mark is the feasibility for the EU of the remaining part of the package: a goal to import more liquefied-natural gas from the U.S. This has strategic consequences for the bloc in general and for Germany in particular as Europe seeks to reduce reliance on Russian natural gas.
“We do not believe this will materialize in any significant way,” said Johana Typoltova, European gas analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London. “There is no need to build more LNG terminals in Europe. Europe’s LNG import facilities are underused as it is, especially in northwest Europe.”
In offering short-term relief and a longer-term challenge for the EU, the deal struck between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday puts the spotlight on Germany, the 28-nation bloc’s biggest economy, and may introduce strains with other nations.
French Conditions
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Thursday sought to circumscribe the European offering and signaled he expects further concessions from the U.S.
“Agriculture must remain outside the field of these discussions,” Le Maire said in a statement. “Non-tariff agricultural barriers are not negotiable. We have stringent health, food and environmental norms as well as rules of production that we are attached to.”
As Europe’s top car exporter, Germany stood to be hit hardest by any new levy imposed by Trump on imported autos based on the same national-security argument he has used to apply U.S. tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.
“It has been possible to avert the outbreak of a trade war,” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Thursday. “The federal government feels reinforced in its attitude that tariffs must be reduced not increased.”
Germany is at the center of transatlantic tensions and internal EU differences over energy because of Berlin’s support for the Nord Stream 2 project designed to carry more Russian gas to Europe. At a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit earlier this month, Trump said the pipeline risks making Germany “a captive of Russia.”
Gas Supplies
Standing alongside Juncker at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said the EU would become a “massive buyer” of U.S. LNG under their agreement.
Since the U.S. started exporting shale gas from the Gulf Coast in 2016, just 29 cargoes have landed in the EU. That compares with 373 tankers that have left Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana alone, most of which went to higher-paying markets in Asia.
There’s nothing to indicate that will change anytime soon. Russia’s Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) PJSC, which provides more than a third of Europe’s natural gas through pipelines from vast and cheap-to-operate Siberian fields, has repeatedly said U.S. supplies will just be ""drops.""
Even the soybeans part of the package may involve few adjustments for the EU and minimal benefits for the U.S.
“There are no subsidies, trade taxes or quotas on soybeans in the EU,” Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management in London, said in a note. “Private farmers decide whether to buy more soybeans or not.”
Chinese Buyers
Changes in global soybean trade prompted by China’s retaliation against Trump’s tariffs may be playing the most significant role. Beijing’s recent decision to slap a 25 percent duty on U.S. soy was reshaping the global market even before the meeting between Trump and Juncker, a Luxembourger who heads the EU’s executive arm.
Facing tougher access to the Chinese market, U.S. soybean exporters have few options other than to target the EU. With Brazilian shippers set to send more cargoes to China, competition in Europe will diminish. Rabobank International Ltd. predicted in June that the U.S. may overtake Brazil as the biggest soybean exporter to the EU.
Nonetheless, European purchases aren’t likely to make up for reduced Chinese demand. China is the world’s No. 1 soybean importer and is forecast to buy more than six times the bloc’s 15.3 million metric tons in 2018-19. Last year, China bought about 33 million tons from the U.S.
Ultimately, Trump settled for a deal with the EU whose main elements he had rejected over the previous four months and whose new component featured soybeans.
With U.S. congressional elections due later this year and the American agricultural industry agitated by harm to their exports resulting from the White House’s own trade policies, some officials in Europe say they believe Trump was desperate to grab a deal he could sell to domestic farmers.
“Soybeans is a big deal,” Trump said on Wednesday.

""As far as I know, the two sides don’t have contact to renew talks,"" Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular press conference on Thursday in Beijing. ""We have said many times that the premise for negotiations is to be faithful and honor one’s own words.""
While both sides have hinted at restarting talks, the last official talks were in early June, and since then both sides have imposed tariffs on each other. While the two nations seemed close to a deal in May, the collapse of that left Chinese officials embarrassed and they’re worried that they might get played again, according to three Chinese officials who asked not to be identified discussing strategy.
The U.S. has started and escalated trade tensions to meet its domestic political agenda, and the extreme pressure and blackmail from the U.S. won’t work on China, Gao said, commenting on President Donald Trump’s threat that he is ""ready to go"" to impose tariffs on all $500 billion in U.S. imports from China.
Gao declined to confirm if the bid by U.S. company Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. to acquire  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) was vetoed by the Chinese government, but stressed that any decision would be about market monopoly and wasn’t related to the trade tensions. NXP announced earlier Thursday that Qualcomm had ended the pact to purchase it.
Gao also said it is a good thing that the U.S. and the European Union could reach a truce on trade, but ""China will closely watch to see if the bilateral statement can really be realized.""

491,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 05:43AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Thursday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, July 26:
1. Facebook Set For Worst Day Ever After Grim Forecast
Facebook shares looked set to suffer their worst day on record after the social media giant warned that profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in the biggest advertising markets.
Investors were spooked following commentary from the company that its revenue growth rates could slow by “high-single digits” in the third and fourth quarter. It also cautioned that expense growth was likely to outpace revenue growth next year.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which closed at a record high on Wednesday ahead of the results, plunged roughly 18% to around $180.00 in pre-market trade, wiping out almost $120 billion in market value. It declined as much as 24% earlier, slumping below $170.
If the share drop holds, it would be Facebook's largest single-day decline ever, topping a 12% drop in July 2012.
2. Amazon Earnings In The Spotlight
Investors will be inundated with corporate earnings as 74 members of the S&P 500 are scheduled to report results today, with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA) all releasing earnings before the market open.
But the main event of the day is set to be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which will report earnings after the closing bell.
According to estimates, Amazon’s earnings per share should total $2.47 while revenues are expected to total $53.37 billion.
Investor focus will be on the company’s performance in its Web Services business, which analysts said will be a major boost to the company’s profitability going forward.
Alongside Amazon’s results after the close will be earnings from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA),  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC),  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).



3. U.S.-EU Trade War Averted… For Now
President Donald Trump proclaimed the United States and the European Union had launched a ""new phase"" in their relationship following a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday.
The leaders pledged to expand European imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas and soybeans and both vowed to lower industrial tariffs.



They also agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers, as well as re-examine U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory duties imposed by the EU “in due course.”
Trump, in a late-night post on twitter Wednesday, touted the deal, saying it was ""a big day for free and fair trade.""



The upbeat remarks helped ease some of the fears of a transatlantic trade war.
4. Nasdaq Futures Take A Tumble
The tech-heavy Nasdaq was set for a big down day, as investors fled the sector following alarmingly grim guidance from Facebook.
At 5:40AM ET, the Nasdaq futures were down 62 points, or 0.8%.
The big-name FANG technology stocks fell in sympathy with Facebook. Amazon lost 1.5% in pre-market hours, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shed about 2%, while Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) slumped 1.5%.
Facebook competitors Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) were also lower, both losing around 3%.
However, the broader market looked to be on sounder footing heading into Thursday.
The blue-chip Dow futures were up 35 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures dipped 4 points, or 0.1%, as concerns over rising trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe showed signs of easing.
Elsewhere, European markets rallied, with almost every sector in positive territory. The German DAX was the best performing market, up by 1.3%, while autos and basic resources - which are most sensitive to trade headlines - were the top leading sectors.
Earlier, Asian markets inched up, but weakness in China markets underscored persistent worries about the outlook for global growth.
5. Dollar Inches Up Ahead Of Durable Goods Data
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar was a shade higher, as investors looked ahead to the latest batch of U.S. economic data for further clues on when and how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% at 94.10.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices ticked lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to around 2.97%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near 2.67%.
Economic data set for release on Thursday include the June report on durable goods orders, which are expected to rise 3.0% from the prior month.
The weekly report on initial jobless claims is also due, as well as wholesale inventories for June, and the Kansas City Fed’s manufacturing activity index for July.
In addition to the U.S. data, the immediate currency market focus was on the European Central Bank's policy decision due at 7:45AM ET.
With the ECB widely expected to keep policy on hold, investors will study comments by President Mario Draghi for any references to the pace of policy normalization.
The euro was slightly lower against the dollar at 1.1710 (EUR/USD).

492,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:49AM ET</span>","Bond investors shun India, citing lack of reassurance from RBI","By Suvashree Choudhury and Manoj Kumar
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amid all the noise about an increasingly hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve, a trade war and higher oil prices, the Reserve Bank of India's silence is deafening, say investors piling out of the country's bonds.
India has seen the largest bond outflows in Asia this year, and investors say the RBI's laconic communication has added uncertainty in an already challenging environment for emerging markets, especially those countries running current account deficits.
The Indian rupee  hit a record low of $69.13 on Friday and has fallen 7 percent so far in 2018, the most in Asia. Bond outflows totaled around $6 billion this year, the heaviest in the region, although foreign investment in the debt market is capped at 5.5 percent of India's roughly $760 billion of issued debt in the fiscal year ending March 2019.
During emerging market weakness in the last three months, RBI Governor Urjit Patel made only one passing reference to the rupee. Prompted by a question in a 15-minute news conference following the bank's decision to raise rates in June, he said the bank was watching the currency's impact on inflation.
By contrast, many central banks in Asia, from China to the Philippines, have publicly reassured investors that foreign exchange stability was an important policy objective.
The Reserve Bank of India did not respond to a request for comment. 
But Subhash Chandra Garg, chief economic affairs secretary of the government, praised the RBI's efforts to control foreign exchange volatility in comments last month.
""The central bank has enough firepower in the form of forex reserves to deal with the rupee volatility,"" Garg said. ""The role of RBI is to ensure that there was no disorder.""
Investors say a central bank's signals give them a sense of how uncomfortable they are with market pressure and offer valuable context about policymakers' thinking and decisions.
When there are few explanations and guidance is scarce, investors price in an uncertainty premium, investors said.
""If you have confusing communication, that only results in increased volatility,"" said Rohit Garg, an emerging markets fixed-income and foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore. ""It could result in the currency underperforming and weakening much more than expected.""
More than a half-dozen Indian investors, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters a tight-lipped RBI was a key reason for ditching bonds in recent months.
Total returns on Indian bonds this year are negative 4 percent, one of the worst in Asia after outperforming last year. 
""We have sold off most Indian assets and will prefer not to enter into India in the short term until the macro-picture on pressure on the rupee, fiscal slippage and current account deficit becomes clear,"" said Johnny Chen, a portfolio manager at NN Investment Partners in Singapore, who said he preferred Indonesia to India because of a stable rupiah.
Chen, however, said he did not take issue with the Indian central bank's communication strategy, noting that its primary focus was the inflation target.
NO GUIDANCE
To be sure, the RBI is not sitting idly. It increased rates by 0.25 percentage point in June, while forex reserves have dropped by $20 billion, or 5 percent, from April peaks after the central bank sold dollars to support the rupee. That seems to signal RBI's discomfort with the pace of the rupee's weakening.
But critics say simply saying so could have saved the RBI some money.
""RBI could issue statements, offer guidance more clearly to the markets on India's stance on rupee and factors behind volatility in the currency markets,"" a finance ministry official said.
The central bank's opaque communications have been a long-running source of frustration for market participants.
For instance, although the RBI sounded dovish in its April policy statement, the minutes released two weeks later included hawkish comments by deputy governor Viral Acharya, pushing bond yields sharply up and sending the rupee to one-year lows.
Open and consistent communication ""gives investors comfort when they understand how the authorities are thinking about risks,"" said Cristiana de Alessi, senior emerging markets fixed income portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in London. De Alessi said she had stopped buying Indian bonds after high oil prices exposed India to balance of payment risks in addition to fiscal concerns.
Patel, who has given six public speeches since taking office in September 2016 and who typically takes seven to eight questions in his 15-minute news conferences, also came under severe criticism for not addressing the controversial high-value banknote ban in late 2016. 
The move by the government had severely disrupted the supply of notes, hurting employment and growth, and pulled the rupee down to a record low in November 2016.
Patel's silence on the exchange rate stands in sharp contrast to Bank Indonesia's governor, Perry Warjiyo, who has been speaking in public multiple times a week and, after heavy intervention and a full percentage point rate increase, has managed to arrest the sell-off in bond markets.

Rohit Garg said his in-house tracker of real money investors, who tend to hold assets for the long term, showed them buying more bonds in Indonesia, ""purely because they have more confidence"" in the central bank there after its aggressive moves to defend the rupiah.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",China central bank plans to ease some capital requirements for commercial banks: sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank plans to ease some of its capital requirements for commercial banks, in line with previous moves to spur lending, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has preliminarily decided to lower the ""structural"" and ""pro-cyclical contribution"" parameters in its Macro-Prudential Assessments for banks, with the extent of the adjustments determined by the province, the sources told Reuters.
MPAs are conducted by the PBOC quarterly to assess the level of risk in China's financial system. The tweaks in the MPA parameters mean banks will be able to lend more without compromising their performance in the PBOC's risk assessments.
The structural parameter is currently set at 1.0. Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that the structural parameter will be lowered by 0.5 points, citing people familiar with the matter.
The PBOC has been taking steps to encourage commercial banks to boost lending to businesses, especially to small and medium-sized firms, as the world's second-biggest economy slows. The measures this year have included three cuts in banks' required reserve ratios. 
""At present (the central bank's local branches) have received second-quarter MPA materials from commercial banks in their respective jurisdiction, but MPA adjustments have not yet been officially implemented,"" one of the sources said. 
""The adjustments will be different in different provinces and different cities, and the 'alpha' (structural parameter) will not all be set at 0.5,"" the source said. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not immediately comment.

Small and medium-sized firms, which account for 80 percent of all jobs in China, are particularly exposed as they have smaller capital buffers against tighter credit conditions and are traditionally regarded by bigger banks as risky clients.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","Facing low inflation, BOJ to mull steps to make stimulus sustainable","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will next week consider changes to its massive stimulus program to make it more sustainable, such as allowing greater swings in interest rates and widening its stock-buying selection, people familiar with its thinking said.
The changes, although small, would be the first since 2016 and the latest sign Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is gradually walking away from his radical stimulus program deployed five years ago to shock the public out of a sticky deflationary mindset.
They would also come as a recent slew of soft data is seen forcing the central bank to trim its price forecasts at the July 30-31 rate review, and concede that inflation will fall short of its 2 percent target up to three years from now.
After half a decade of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation, BOJ policymakers are caught in a bind.
While the BOJ would struggle to justify whittling down stimulus with inflation still distant from its target, it is nonetheless under pressure to address the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as the hit to bank profits from near-zero rates, which would require raising rates.
The nine-member board will thus discuss ways to make its policy more sustainable, mainly via tweaks to its asset-buying techniques and guidance on its yield targets, the sources said.
""If achievement of the price target takes time, the BOJ's policy will last longer. That means the cost of easing will keep accumulating,"" one of the sources said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
SEVERAL OPTIONS EYED
Sources have told Reuters the BOJ, facing stubbornly low inflation, is in unusually active discussions on making tweaks to its rate policy and stock-buying techniques.
Under its yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ pledges to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and 10-year bond yields around zero percent. It also buys government bonds and risky assets, such as exchange-traded funds (ETF) and corporate bonds, to flood markets with cash.
Several options are on the table with a final decision on which steps to take dependent on how big the downgrade in the board's price projections could be, the sources said.
Among them would be to tweak the language of the BOJ's policy statement to allow yields to rise more naturally, they said.
Markets now consider 0.11 percent as the BOJ's line in the sand as the bank has repeatedly intervened to prevent 10-year yields from rising above that level, despite insisting it has no set range in mind in guiding long-term rates around zero.
The BOJ will keep its yield targets intact but could signal that it would allow long-term rates to move more flexibly, either by tweaking its policy statement or through Kuroda's comments at his post-meeting briefing, the sources said.
The central bank could also make operational changes to the way it buys bonds and ETFs, a nod to critics who say the bank's huge purchases are drying up market liquidity and distorting price action, they say. For details on options, please see FACTBOX.
While allowing long-term rates to rise more could help ease the pain on banks, the BOJ could struggle to justify such a move when inflation remains distant from its target, analysts say.

At the July rate review, the BOJ will also issue a quarterly report with new growth and inflation projections. The report will also look into structural factors weighing on inflation.

Xinhua said about 200 property tightening rules - a record high - were introduced across the country in the first half of the year, but demand was still high in cities with relatively low property prices. 
Some people also took advantage of new talent policies to qualify as 'local' buyers, skirting existing curbs targeted at out-of-towners. 
""Local governments, as the primary party tasked to tame the market, must shoulder their responsibility as such,"" the commentary said. It urged regional policymakers to improve the regulations and put an end to introducing simple ""stop-gap measures"".
It said that local governments should change their economic development model and curb their thirst for land revenue.
China's new home prices accelerated to their fastest pace in almost two years in June. The surprising resilience has highlighted market loopholes and the still-strong buyer demand after 38 straight months of price gains, even as regulators have introduced waves of tightening measures to cool the market since 2016.
It also presents a challenge for Chinese leaders seeking to contain risks in a relatively strong part of the economy as the worsening U.S.-China trade war clouds the outlook for other sectors.

Xinhua said China is moving fast to roll out a property tax, as well as complementary reforms in fiscal, land and financial areas, but gave no details.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's next Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Wednesday that foreign companies in the country will have to meet the same human, environmental and labor rights standards as in their own countries under the incoming administration.
Speaking after a meeting between President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, Ebrard said the next government would seek to promote investment but that regulations would move into line with elsewhere.
""All companies in Mexico, from Canada, Europe or other countries, will have to meet the same environmental, labor and other rules as in their home countries,"" Ebrard said.
""Because sometimes they do one thing here, and there they do another.""
He did not provide further details.
Labor rights in Mexico have been an important issue in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Most complaints center on low wages, but workers have historically struggled to organize unions that are genuinely independent.
A constitutional reform under the current government changed that, but Lopez Obrador's team will be tasked with implementing the changes.
Canadian and Mexican officials on Wednesday insisted that NAFTA remain a trilateral pact.

Ebrard also told reporters that Canadian companies and skills could be of interest to the government to help in its plans to build a railway and other infrastructure projects in the economically poorer south of the country.

497,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",China Said to Ease Bank Capital Rule to Free Up More Lending,"(Bloomberg) -- China took another step to ease the pressure from its deleveraging campaign, as authorities try to mitigate increasing risks to the economy from the trade war with the U.S.
The People’s Bank of China told some banks on Wednesday that a specific capital requirement will be eased to support lending, according to people familiar with the matter. The change is being made to support local financial institutions in meeting credit demand effectively, said the people, who asked not to be named because the instructions haven’t been made public.
Easing capital requirements is another move by policy makers in Beijing to shore up growth amid the escalating trade war with the U.S. While China is trying to cut leverage across its system and rein in risk, the threat posed by America’s actions has seen it scale back some of its previous efforts to slow the expansion of credit. The central bank specified that the capital-buffer reduction is a counter-cyclical adjustment in reaction to rising uncertainty over trade, the people said.
“This is an important gesture of easing and will boost broad credit growth,” said Ma Kunpeng, Shanghai-based chief financial analyst at Shenwan Hongyuan Group. “It’s hard to put a definitive number on the impact as banks are facing other constraints such as deposit growth, loan quota and so on.”
Banking shares gained in Shanghai and Hong Kong trading, with Bank of Ningbo Co. up 2.4 percent and Bank of Shanghai up 1.7 percent as of 9:36 a.m. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent.
Policy makers have been busy rolling out initiatives to aid growth amid fears that the trade war, coinciding with the efforts to cut leverage and shrink China’s shadow-banking industry, will stall the economy. The PBOC has cut reserve-requirement ratios three times this year, while tax cuts and infrastructure projects were announced on Monday. The changes are seen as an easing of policy rather than a U-turn by the government, analysts have said.
The PBOC said in the notice sent to some banks on Wednesday that the so-called “structural parameter” in the Macro-Prudential Assessment of balance sheets will be lowered by around 0.5 points, reducing required capital buffers, the people familiar with the matter said. The central bank didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.
China’s $10 trillion shadow-banking sector, seen by the government as a serious risk to economy stability, saw the biggest net monthly drop on record in June, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the central bank’s data. While the sector has been a target of the deleveraging effort, such a pullback has weighed on the supply of new credit to the real economy.
Investment Headwind
A major headwind facing the economy on the back of tighter credit would be the ensuing slump in private-sector investment, a pillar of the economy this year. Private companies have found it difficult to borrow anywhere, with shadow banking credit contracting, bond defaults rising to a record pace, smaller lenders downgraded and dollar debt repayment pressure mounting.
The PBOC’s reduction could “significantly relieve the regulatory pressure and encourage bank lending,” said Nie Wen, an economist at Huabao Trust Co. in Shanghai. He said that city commercial banks and joint-stock banks are the main funding source for small firms. More easing policies can be expected in the future if existing measures don’t yield the desired effects, Nie said.
While a formal change of direction on the anti-leverage campaign or an official shift to monetary easing could potentially come at meetings of the top political leadership, from the end of this month, officials are unlikely to abandon goals to cut debt or cut borrowing costs more broadly.

498,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>","Trump, Juncker Tout Deal Pulling Back From U.S.-EU Trade War","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to suspend new tariffs while negotiating over trade, pulling the U.S. and Europe back from the edge of a transatlantic trade war.
The leaders pledged to expand European imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas and soybeans and both vowed to lower industrial tariffs, excluding autos. The U.S. and European Union will “hold off on other tariffs”’ while negotiations proceed, as well as re-examine U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory duties imposed by the EU “in due course,” Juncker said.
“We had a big day, very big,” Trump said during a press conference with Juncker at the White House on Wednesday. “We are starting the negotiation right now, but we know where it is going.” Trump hailed “a new phase” of trade relations.
The deal eases tensions stoked by Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on car imports. U.S. stocks and bond yields rose on signs of optimism that a U.S.-EU trade war could be avoided.
Trump added they would try to “resolve” steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed earlier this year and retaliatory duties the EU levied in response. The U.S. and EU will work together to reform the World Trade Organization, Trump said.
Trump and Juncker took no questions after their brief remarks in the Rose Garden, an impromptu appearance scheduled after about three hours of talks.
Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said he applauded the move to de-escalate tensions over tariffs.
“I’m glad. I think it’s going to help defuse some of the concern out there, not only in farm country but in our economy generally,” Portman said. “It’s a first step. We’ve still got to work out the details. But it’s been hard these last few weeks to see any light at the end of the tunnel,” with no signs of progress with the EU, Mexico, Canada or China.
The truce may prove to be short lived if the two sides can’t resolve their differences over trade in vehicles and car parts. In May, Trump abandoned a framework for trade negotiations with China within days of it being announced, before ratcheting up tariffs.
‘Semi-Truce’
‘‘They sold it as something very positive, but for me the announcement is not as big for now, because it’s kind of a semi-truce,” Marie Kasperek, associate director of the global business and economics program at the Atlantic Council, said by phone. “As long as the steel and aluminum tariffs are ongoing, the EU will not negotiate on a high-level basis.”
Trump says a 10 percent tax on imports of cars to the EU is too high compared to the 2.5 percent rate charged by the U.S, and he’s also been critical of the EU over its $150 billion trade surplus with the U.S.
Still, the deal announced Wednesday with the EU is an encouraging sign that America’s trade partners may be able to placate the Trump administration with offers to buy more U.S. goods, averting a trade war that the International Monetary Fund has warned may undermine the strongest global upswing in years.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group of major automakers that includes General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Toyota Motor Corp., welcomed the effort to negotiate a solution that will lower trading barriers, rather than increase them.
“Today’s announcement demonstrates that bilateral negotiations are a more effective approach to resolving trade barriers, not increasing tariffs,” the alliance said in a statement.
Final Effort
Juncker came to Washington for a last-ditch bid to avoid U.S. tariffs on cars. He told reporters he entered Wednesday’s meeting with the intention of reaching an agreement with Trump.
“We agreed that no other tariffs would be introduced as long as we are in the negotiations,” Juncker said during a speech in Washington after his press conference with Trump. “I’m happy that we agreed to this agreement today.”
Trump warned at a cabinet meeting last week that he would move forward with 25 percent auto tariffs if the meeting with Juncker didn’t go well. Trump could impose car tariffs on national security grounds once Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross completes a required investigation, which could come anytime before a deadline by early next year.
Auto tariffs at the level Trump has threatened would add about 10,000 euros ($11,700) to the sticker price of a European-built car sold in the U.S., according a European Commission assessment obtained by Bloomberg News last month. That would cut U.S. imports of European cars and car parts in half, the commission forecast.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global economic activity remains solid but has already passed its peak, according to economists in Reuters polls who expect protectionist policies on trade, which show no signs of abating, to tap the brakes significantly.
While trade conflict between the United States and other major trading partners, in particular China, has had only a modest impact on global trade and the world economy so far, the turmoil in financial markets clearly suggests confidence has taken a hit.
World stocks have been whipsawed by several sell-offs in recent weeks. The dollar has risen 5 percent since April on those concerns and on still-solid expectations for several more Federal Reserve interest rate hikes this year and next.
Reuters polls of economists, foreign exchange analysts, bond market and equity market strategists in recent months have raised alarm bells and the U.S. government bond market is also close to flashing a recessionary signal. [US/INT]
In the latest Reuters polls taken this month, nearly three-quarters of the 150 economists who answered an additional question said trade protectionism would have a significant downward impact on global growth next year.
That conclusion is based on trade barriers already raised and U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose further tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China will likely make sentiment worse.
""The protectionist measures announced so far are unlikely in themselves to have a strong negative impact on growth, but we are deeply concerned about a possible escalation of the trade conflict,"" noted Marco Valli, head of macro research at UniCredit. 
""The balance of risks for the global economy is therefore now shifting significantly to the downside.""
Analysis of the latest Reuters polls based on more than 500 economists covering around 40 countries shows, based on their estimates, that growth in most major economies has already peaked.
Average global economic growth for this year and 2019 was forecast at 3.8 percent and 3.7 percent respectively, based on contributions from more than 70 economists.
While that is unchanged from a poll published three months ago, it is lower than the International Monetary Fund's projections.
""The direct effects of higher tariffs should not have a meaningful impact on global growth,"" wrote Neville Hill, co-head of global economics at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
""But we remain concerned that uncertainty could have a chilling effect on business investment, which remains a key driver of global growth. That's important given a global economy with differences in growth momentum and policy risks.""
U.S. economic growth, which likely surged to an annualized 4.1 percent in the quarter just gone, is expected to lose momentum in the current and subsequent quarters and through to the end of next year to about half that rate. [ECILT/US]
Economic growth in the euro zone, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Japan and China was also expected to slow this year and next. [ECILT/EU] [ECILT/GB] [ECILT/JP] [ECILT/CN] 
Even India, which is forecast to remain the fastest-growing major economy this year, is not expected to match or surpass the 7.7 percent rate reported for the latest quarter. [ECILT/IN]
CENTRAL BANKS 
While policymakers remain cautious on uncertainty caused by the trade war and slowing growth, policy tightening was still expected to be on the agenda before the next downturn.
Despite the recent rise in oil prices, inflation was still forecast to remain tame and the outlook for interest rates across most major economies was largely unchanged compared with three months ago.
The Fed is expected to plow ahead as planned with two more rate hikes this year and two next year. The European Central Bank is still on course to end its crisis-era stimulus by end-2018 and raise rates in a year from now or a bit longer. The Bank of England is expected to raise rates in August.
The dilemma for major central banks is the need to move away from almost a decade of stimulus without curbing economic growth and so bringing the next recession closer.
The median probability of a U.S. recession in the next two years was 35 percent, higher than the 30 percent chance of that in Britain and 25 percent probability of one in the euro zone.
But much depends on there being no further major escalation in global trade tensions. That is far from clear.

""I am kind of assuming that trade tensions won't keep escalating,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""I think it's the biggest source of downside risk in the year ahead. But in the end I am assuming that the trade war doesn't drag us into a recession.""

500,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>","Trump says China is 'vicious,' using U.S. farmers as trade pawns","By Daphne Psaledakis and Julie Ingwersen
WASHINGTON/BISMARCK, North Dakota (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused China on Wednesday of targeting American farmers in a ""vicious"" way and using them as leverage to get concessions on trade a day after the administration announced a $12 billion farm aid package.
Some farmers and farm-state lawmakers, including Trump's fellow Republicans, ripped the move, saying they would rather trade with no tariffs than receive government help.
China and other top U.S. trade partners zeroed in on American farmers with retaliatory tariffs after the administration imposed duties on Chinese goods as well as steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Farmers are being targeted since they rely on export markets for agricultural produce and have broadly supported Trump. As the dispute escalates, China and other importers have slapped tariffs on incoming shipments of U.S. soybeans, dairy, meat, produce and liquor.
""China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
The administration on Tuesday unveiled the largest emergency farm aid package since 1998, dipping into a Great Depression-era program that will pay up to $12 billion starting in September to help U.S. farmers weather losses.
Rural and agricultural states supported Trump by wide margins in the 2016 election, and the aid package comes ahead of U.S. mid-term elections in November.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Trump critic, likened it to ""golden crutches"" to make up for a trade war that will cost farmers far more.
China is trying to undermine support for Trump's policies among farmers. Last week it launched a short video in English featuring a talking cartoon soybean vouching for the importance of trade.
The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture products in 2017, including $21.5 billion of soybeans which were the most valuable U.S. export. China alone imported $12.3 billion in soybeans last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Republican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on Wednesday that farmers in his state have lost millions of dollars in orders.
""It's going to get down to a point where they're not going to be able to survive if this continues down the same path,"" Rounds told CNN on Wednesday. 
'CHINA PLAYS HARDBALL'
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the impact of lower soy prices and the loss of Chinese buyers would likely cost farmers some $11 billion - an amount that will be covered via direct payments to farmers, government purchases of some products for food assistance programs and trade promotion. 
""We believe this is a temporary stop in order to get our producers to a point of profitability again by a normal trading relationship,"" Perdue told reporters on Wednesday, adding that he hoped the impact would ease next year.
Trump on Wednesday met with members of Congress from agricultural states to discuss trade issues. He earned praise from House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway of Texas for the aid package and for announcing an agreement with the European Union's chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, to work toward eliminating trade barriers.
“I thank the president and Sec. Perdue for having our farmers’ and ranchers’ backs,"" Conaway said in a statement.
But Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska urged Trump on Twitter to ""recognize that trade assistance is no substitute for trade itself.""
Meanwhile, farmers inspecting crops in North Dakota said they preferred not to rely on the aid but were optimistic that Trump would find a long-term solution.
""Ultimately we want to get our revenue from the markets,"" said Tom Bernhardt, who farms wheat, corn, sunflowers and soybeans in Linton. ""But if we have to dig our heels in for a little while to come up with fair trade, rather than free trade, I’m sure most producers in this area are willing to go through a little hardship to eventually have a stronger end game.""
Dining with the Wheat Quality Council's crop tour at a steak picnic near the state capital of Bismarck, farmer Phil Volk said he was concerned about the longer-term damage from the trade war.

""This (the aid package) took a little weight off my shoulders,"" he said. ""But is that the real solution? I don't want to lose these markets that we've built.""

The draft law calls for holding the online platforms liable for the sales tax of dealers, unless they can prove that those parties have registered with the proper tax authorities, according to the newspaper.
It said the finance ministry expected the measure to generate several hundred million euros in additional tax revenues each year.
The draft law cited what it called an ""urgent need to act"" given evidence that online trading was resulting in increasing amounts of tax evasion.
The law also calls for holding online platforms responsible if online dealers fail to pay their German taxes, despite registering in Germany.
""The goal is to protect honest tax-paying companies from competitive distortions,"" the paper quoted a ministry official as saying.

Germany is Amazon's second largest national market after the United States. Net sales grew by 20 percent last year to $17 billion, accounting for 9.5 percent of the total, according to the company's annual report.

The City of London, home to the ""Square (NYSE:SQ) Mile"" financial district, published research looking at which places stand to lose most if banking and insurance fail to obtain sufficient access to the EU market after Britain leaves next March.
Financial services make up a larger share of overall exports for Cardiff, Northampton, Leeds and Edinburgh than for London, the research conducted by Centre for Cities found.
Apart from Northampton, those cities voted to remain in the EU in the 2106 referendum. But the research found that more than half of the cities that voted to leave are more reliant on financial services exports than London.
Some commentators portrayed the overall 52-48 percent vote to leave as provincial voters seeking to knock ""metropolitan elites"" in London, which voted strongly in favor of staying in the bloc.
The research showed that while a change in Britain's trading relationship with the EU would in aggregate affect London the most given its size, there would be substantial consequences for many other British cities.
""This data makes clear that some of the UK's major cities rely heavily on financial services, and that a detrimental Brexit deal for the UK's financial sector will be felt nationwide – not just in the capital,"" said City of London policy chairman Catherine McGuinness.
Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities said that London is well-placed to bounce back from any post-Brexit downturn.
""However, the worry is that many other cities – especially those outside the Greater South East – will struggle to adapt to the potential shocks that might lie ahead,"" Carter said.

Two thirds of the 1.1 million financial services jobs in Britain are based outside London. A third of all Britain's financial services exports go to the EU.

While finance represents a 29 percent share of London’s total exports, it makes up 56 percent of those for Edinburgh and 54 percent for Cardiff, according to the study, carried out by the Centre for Cities think tank and sponsored by the City of London Corporation.
Northampton, Leeds, York and Norwich are also heavily reliant on financial-services jobs, it said.
“The government has outlined its plans to take services out of the EU single market,” Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said in a statement. “It should not underestimate the damaging impact that this could have on jobs and wages in cities across the U.K.”
A third of Britain’s financial services exports go to the European Union, according to the corporation, compared with 21 percent to the U.S., six percent to Japan and one percent to Canada.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will consider at next week's rate review changing the composition of exchange-traded funds (ETF) it buys as part of is massive stimulus program, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday.
The move will be part of an overhaul the central bank is planning to make to its ultra-loose monetary policy more sustainable, as inflation remains distant from its 2 percent target despite five years of heavy money printing.
Sources have told Reuters the BOJ, facing stubbornly low inflation, is in unusually active discussions before its rate review on July 30-31, with tweaks to its stock-buying techniques on the table.
The central bank currently buys 6 trillion yen ($54.08 billion) worth of ETFs per year, of which around 1.5 trillion yen is spent on ETFs linked to the Nikkei stock average and roughly 4 trillion yen on those linked to the Topix index.
While maintaining the total amount, the BOJ will change that composition and increase the amount of purchases for Topix-linked ETFs, and decrease buying of Nikkei-linked ETFs, the Nikkei reported without citing sources.
With Topix-linked ETFs, the BOJ can buy a wider range of stocks than for Nikkei-linked ETFs because the Topix index consists of more types of corporate shares.
Concerns have grown over the BOJ's ETF buying as it has reduced floating shares in the market and has put the bank on track to become a top shareholder of some big Japanese companies.
Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, staying distant from the BOJ's 2 percent target.

At next week's meeting, the BOJ will cut its price forecasts and may concede that inflation could fall short of its target for as long as three more years, sources say, in what would the strongest sign yet of acceptance that its goal cannot be reached quickly.

After a meeting in Mexico City, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said they remained optimistic about negotiations to revamp the 24-year-old trade pact.
Talks began last August but stalled in the run-up to the Mexican presidential election. That was due, at least in part, to U.S. demands for sweeping changes in the auto sector and for a sunset clause, which would put the deal forming one of the world's largest trading blocs up for renewal every five years.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the pact if he cannot renegotiate it to better serve his country's interests.
Freeland and Guajardo struck an upbeat tone, with Guajardo saying about two-thirds of the agreement has been ironed out.
In Washington on Wednesday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue raised the prospect that NAFTA could be negotiated separately with Canada and Mexico, in order to reach an agreement first with Mexico by September.
Although Mexican officials are heading to Washington this week to meet with their U.S. counterparts, Guajardo stressed that a deal between all three countries remained the goal.
""The fact that we are going to Washington to participate in bilateral talks is to reinforce the concept of the trilateralism of this agreement,"" he said. ""The essence of this agreement is trilateral, and it will continue being trilateral.""
Freeland also expressed support for a three-way deal, as did Mexico's incoming foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard.
""It should and can be modernized but we're not thinking about it having a different nature to that of today,"" Ebrard said, speaking after a meeting between Freeland and President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Freeland said the sunset clause could harm the auto industry, adding that Ottawa opposed a U.S. investigation of auto imports.
Lopez Obrador, who won the nation's July 1 election, has said he wants to accelerate the negotiations. His lead NAFTA negotiator, Jesus Seade, will join the Mexican delegation in Washington this week.
Freeland, who held what she described as a good meeting with the president-elect, said she came away with a clear understanding of where he stood on NAFTA but declined to give details.

""Canada's very clear desire is to move the NAFTA negotiations back into higher gear now that we are past the Mexican election,"" she told reporters.

May's plan for Britain's future ties with the EU has come under fire not only from competing factions in her Conservative Party but also across the country. Some say it will leave Britain too close to the bloc while others argue her proposal offers a relationship that is not close enough.
At an agriculture show in Wales, May will tell farmers that leaving the EU will mean replacing the bloc's common agricultural policy, which provides subsidies, with a new system of public money for public goods.
""Leaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future, and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it,"" she will say.
""I want to make the most of the freedoms provided by Brexit to design a new scheme that is less bureaucratic, and does away with the overly prescriptive information farmers currently have to provide to apply for grants.""
With her plan for a ""business-friendly"" Brexit criticized from all sides, May is keen to tour the country to set out not only what she sees as the benefits of leaving the EU but also her vision for Britain's future outside the bloc.

The government has also increased its warnings over what a so-called no deal Brexit could look like, including preparations to stockpile food and medicines, in what Brexit campaigners say is an attempt to scare people into backing May's plan.

""This was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed,"" Trump told reporters at the White House after meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
""We are starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it's going,"" Trump said.
Speaking with Juncker at his side, Trump said they had agreed in talks to ""work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.""
""We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans; soybeans is a big deal,"" he said, adding that Europe would also step up purchases of liquefied natural gas from the United States.
""They are going to be a massive buyer of LNG,"" Trump said.
Trump said the talks would ""resolve"" both the hefty tariffs the United States had placed on imports of steel and aluminum from the EU and the tariffs Europe had slapped on U.S. goods in response.
It was not clear whether the two sides made any progress on the contentious issue of possible U.S. tariffs on imports of automobiles from Europe.
But Juncker said they had agreed not to impose any new tariffs while talks were taking place.
""This was a good and constructive meeting,"" Juncker said.

Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on auto imports, a move that would hit European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) hard, as well as Japanese and South Korean car companies.

The two sides agreed to expand European imports of U.S. liquified natural gas and soybeans and lower industrial tariffs on both sides, Trump said.
“We had a big day, very big,” Trump said at a joint statement with Juncker at the White House Wednesday. He hailed “a new phase” of trade relations.
The two sides agreed to work toward “zero” tariffs, trade barriers and subsidies, Trump said.
Juncker came to Washington for a last-ditch bid to avoid U.S. tariffs on cars. Trump warned at a cabinet meeting last week that he would move forward with 25 percent auto tariffs if the meeting with Juncker didn’t go well.
Trump could impose car tariffs on national security grounds once Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross completes a required investigation.
Auto tariffs at the level Trump has threatened would add about 10,000 euros ($11,700) to the sticker price of a European-built car sold in the U.S., according a European Commission assessment obtained by Bloomberg News last month. That would cut U.S. imports of European cars and car parts in half, the commission forecast."

Loblaw Cos., the country’s largest grocer, said it expects prices to rise in the second half of the year as retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports come into effect. While the company couldn’t quantify the impact, it said the measure adds to higher transportation costs and wages, as well as a weaker currency.
“I think transportation in addition to tariffs is impacting us in an increasingly meaningful way and we see that continuing for some period of time,” Chief Executive Officer Galen G. Weston said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday. “We’re committed to delivering value to our customers as often as possible with our pricing strategies, but there are limits.”
About C$16.6 billion ($12.7 billion) of levies ranging from steel and aluminum to soya sauce and hair lacquer came into effect on July 1 as Canada’s response to President Donald Trump’s metals tariffs. While fierce competition with rivals including Metro Inc. and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. has so far kept inflation muted as companies cut costs, Weston predicted stronger pricing pressure across the industry.
“We don’t think it’s going to be meaningful, super significant, but it certainly will be higher than what it is today,” he said.
Toronto-based Loblaw fell 0.7 percent to C$68.31 at 12:44 p.m. The shares are little changed on the year.
Companies in other fields are also bracing for a ripple effect of tariffs. That includes Toromont Industries Ltd., which operates  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). dealerships in Manitoba, Ontario and Eastern Canada.
“When you look at the environment with steel and aluminum, the results of tariff change could impact our pricing,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Medhurst said on an earnings call Wednesday. “So we’re monitoring that closely and working with our supply chain on that to ensure we understand it fully.”"

GENEVA (Reuters) - The nascent global trade war will have to be ended by a political agreement between world leaders, because continuing down the current path will only damage the global economy, the head of the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday. 
WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said that world leaders needed to listen to each other and try to fix the problem, rather than resorting to tit-for-tat retaliation, or launching legal disputes. 
""On the trade war and how to stop it... it is not something a technical measure here or there is going to solve. This is a political situation,"" he told reporters in Geneva.
""A solution can only be found through high-level discussions and engagement.""
U.S. President Donald Trump accused China on Wednesday of targeting American farmers in a ""vicious"" way and using them as leverage to get concessions on trade a day after the administration announced a $12 billion farm aid package.
Many leaders already realized that they needed to resolve the situation, but there were different views about the best policies to boost growth and create jobs, and the discussion of those views was going on in the United States, Azevedo said. 
""Clearly the administration has its own views about how to achieve that, and I suppose there will be a domestic debate over this and at some point in time they will figure it out.""
The WTO itself has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, triggered by an unprecedented barrage of tariffs erected by Trump and fueled by retaliatory moves by China and threats and counter-threats between Beijing and Washington.
Trump has blocked new appointments to the WTO's supreme court and has cited national security concerns to justify tariffs on steel and aluminum, outraging foes and allies alike.
But Azevedo said the WTO system was ""not paralyzed yet"" and he was confident it would survive, because otherwise there would be a worst case scenario with no rules, only ""the law of the jungle"".
""Because then, I guarantee you, investors are going to pull back, the economy is going to lose steam and over time jobs will be lost, millions of jobs will be lost.""
Conversations to resolve the problems of the WTO continued, but were not yet advanced enough to see light at the end of the tunnel, he said.
Azevedo said he was talking to leaders of WTO member states to try to find solutions. He had not met Trump, who is widely seen to have started global turbulence single-handed since he took office, but he said he had very good and frequent communications with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. 

""I don't think that there is anything missing in my dialogue with the United States.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - While the typical retirement message usually focuses on how much people should stash away from every paycheck, new research shows that working longer is the key to dramatically increasing retirement money — even if you go just a month longer than you had planned. 
Just those 30 days could increase a retiree's standard of living every year during retirement by as much as if he or she had saved an extra 1 percent of pay each year for 10 years before quitting, according to a study from Stanford University economics professor John Shoven. 
Add on a little more time and the effect compounds. Retiring at 66 instead of 62 increases a person’s standard of living by a third, according to the study. 
Shoven tested the impact of working longer on a wide range of incomes and investment returns; assuming investment gains would match inflation. Regardless of variations, all people benefited from postponing retirement. 
This surprising finding should entice people to try to work a few more months, no matter how fed up they are with the rat race.     
When a person works longer it helps in multiple ways. Most important, said Shoven, is to delay taking Social Security, which grows about 8 percent a year with each year of delay up to age 70. 
Financial adviser Leon LaBrecque, who is based in Troy, Michigan, had to figure this out recently for one of his clients, a 64-year-old salesman who was eager to retire. Staying on the job resulted in: adding two years of $24,000 contributions to his 401(k); letting his existing savings sit untouched so they could grow; delaying Social Security so the benefit would be 16 percent larger; and reducing needed savings in retirement to 28 years instead of 30. 
""If you stick it out another two years you will have $200,000 more and have less chance of running out of savings in retirement,” LaBrecque said.
To endure working longer, financial planners suggest the following:
    
- Refashion the job
Just because you keep working does not mean you have to keep at the same task. Financial planner Mark Rylance gave this advice to a 64-year-old business owner who was tired of dealing with bad customers: Skip them. 
Rylance, who is based in California, suggested the client simply not take on stress he did not want, which allowed him to keep working at the rest of his job for a little while longer.
- Work with your boss
If you are not the one in charge, you can still negotiate a better deal for yourself to stay on the job a bit longer. 
Sometimes asking for a less-demanding position at the same workplace can help. Tampa, Florida, financial planner Ruth Delaney advised a woman in a highly stressful government job to seek a transfer, and she is now enjoying work and saving intensely.  
Still, people must think carefully about their workplace before seeking relief. Telling an employer retirement is near could also provide license for a cut if layoffs are needed.
    
- Find a hobby-job or encore career
Seek a fun, completely different job – perhaps part-time – with pay large enough to cover the bills for a couple of years. 
Financial planner Anitha Rao of Woodstock, Georgia, had a client “test drive” alternative work. He took a vacation from his existing job to get a feel for the new part-time position and decided it was do-able.
    
- Make a deal with yourself
Tell yourself you will last another six months because you can always quit. After that, add another six.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said on Wednesday the North American Free Trade Agreement may be negotiated separately with Canada and Mexico to bring the deal to a close by September. 
""Mexico has been more amenable to some of the concerns that we've had. We hope that the Mexican deal can be done very quickly, possibly by the end of August or before September,"" Perdue told reporters.
""Then Canada will hopefully follow suit quickly and we can reassemble that trifecta then,"" Perdue said at the Agriculture Transportation Summit in Arlington, Virginia.
The United States, Canada and Mexico have been negotiating a revamp of their 24-year-old trade pact since August, after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the deal and blamed it for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. He argues it caused jobs to move south of the border.
Talks have stalled over U.S. demands on autos and other issues, but Mexican trade negotiators are to travel to Washington this week to revive them.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a left-leaning nationalist, said after his July 1 election that he would be willing to renegotiate the deal, though he has been critical of it in the past. Lopez Obrador takes office on December 1. 
The negotiations to modernize NAFTA were originally scheduled to finish by the end of 2017, but the deadline has been extended several times. 
Perdue said he was confident that when the NAFTA deal is finalized, Congress would ratify it.

""Based on what Congress' comments are, I would think they would be overwhelmingly gratified with a renewed NAFTA 2.0,"" Perdue said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping said there would be no winner in a global trade war, urging fellow developing powers on Wednesday to reject unilateralism in the wake of tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump's warnings have given Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa fresh impetus to enhance trade cooperation, and their leaders found a collective voice championing global trade as they began a three-day BRICS summit in Johannesburg.
The meeting of presidents from the trade bloc is the first since Trump's administration launched a push to rebalance trade multilateralism that Trump has deemed unfair -- relationships that the United States once championed. 
""We should be resolute in rejecting unilateralism,"" Xi said at the opening ceremony.
""A global trade war should be rejected because there will be no winner,"" said Xi, who oversees the world's second-largest economy, and whose nation is dominant in the BRICS bloc. 
""Unilateralism and protectionism are mounting, dealing a severe blow to multilateralism,"" he said. ""China will continue to develop itself with its door wide open.""
Xi also said the collective rise of emerging markets and developing countries ""is unstoppable and will make global development more balanced"". He urged the BRICS governments to observe international rules, regardless of their size.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called for thorough discussions at the summit on the role of trade in promoting sustainable development and inclusive growth.
""We are meeting here at a time when the multilateral trading system is facing unprecedented challenges,"" he said in a speech.
WORRIED BY UNILATERALISM
""We are concerned by the rise in unilateral measures that are incompatible with World Trade Organization rules and are worried about the impact of these measures, especially on developing countries.""
Last week, Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China. But even South Africa - the continent's most industrialized economy but a tiny exporter of steel, aluminum and automobiles to the United States - is facing barriers.
South African Trade Minister Rob Davies said it was suffering collateral damage.
He said 7,000 South Africans work in jobs affected by the metals tariffs; an effort to secure an exemption from the U.S. government was unsuccessful.
South Africa has invited the leaders of 22 additional countries to participate in this week's summit, including 19 from Africa.

As the member hardest-hit by Trump's trade moves, China is looking to diversify its trade ties to mitigate fallout.

If he follows through, the shock waves will reverberate around the world.
The stakes will be clear on Wednesday, when Trump meets with the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. Europe is trying to pull the U.S. back from the brink of a full-blown auto trade war that could hurt the bottom lines of automakers, disrupt supply chains and raise prices for consumers.
In recent weeks, investors have been focused on the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. But potential duties on vehicles could do even more economic damage -- more than double the amount of all other U.S. tariffs already implemented or proposed, according the International Monetary Fund.
The Commerce Department is probing whether foreign cars represent a threat to America’s national security. The investigation covers imports of automobiles, including SUVs, vans and light trucks, as well as auto parts. Commerce has until February to reports its findings to the president, who has the final say on whether to impose penalties, including tariffs and quotas.
Which country would take the biggest hit if the president imposes duties? A breakdown of the numbers shows that Canada and Japan exported the most vehicles by value to the U.S. last year, followed by Mexico, Germany, South Korea and the U.K.
But other countries will also likely retaliate if the U.S. imposes tariffs, causing even more economic damage. Canada, China and Germany imported the most American cars last year.
An auto trade war would deal a body blow to car makers from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). to Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), which have fine-tuned their supply chains to take advantage of countries with low duties, such as the U.S. The graphic below shows which nations lead in producing various components of American passenger cars, from bumpers to steering wheels.
Auto groups, industry workers and foreign governments condemned the idea of raising duties on cars at a public hearing last week in Washington. Speaker after speaker urged the administration to avoid sideswiping the very industry it wants to help.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it’s too early to say if the administration will decide to impose tariffs, though he noted that the president recognizes the indispensable nature of the U.S. auto industry."

LONDON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has given its backing to Ukraine's plans for an anti-corruption court, removing one of the key hurdles needed for the government to get its next $2 billion tranche of aid.
The court is being set up as part of Ukraine's $17.5 billion bailout and has become a symbol of its efforts to stamp out high-level corruption that has blighted the country for decades.
""The legislative framework for the High Anti-Corruption Court, once the recently adopted amendments are signed into law, will be consistent with the authorities’ commitments under Ukraine’s IMF-supported program,"" an IMF spokeswoman told Reuters.
There are still a number of other issues that still need to be resolved, however, before Kiev finally receives the IMF money.
There remains a standoff over plans to raise the country's gas prices as well as additional spending cuts or money raising measures needed to plug some shortfalls in revenues earlier in the year.
Kiev has only received half the $17.5 billion aid earmarked for its aid program which is due to run out next year. It has not had any fresh money since April last year.

518,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>","Kudlow Says Farm Subsidies Temporary, Needed to Fix Broken Trade","(Bloomberg) -- White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a plan by the Trump administration to pay as much as $12 billion in relief to U.S. farmers hurt by a burgeoning trade dispute is a stop-gap proposal and doesn’t signal a willingness to make a habit of aid programs.
“What we’ve put on the board is what I think is a temporary assistance measure, I don’t think it’s going to get near to $12 billion,” Kudlow said during an interview on “CBS This Morning” on Wednesday. “Nobody’s really thrilled about this. We’re just trying to protect American agriculture from some of the unfair trading practices.”
The proposal was panned even by some Republicans in Congress who said it failed to address the underlying problem of the White House’s own trade policies. Extra farm aid would be a balm to producers who are seeing prices drop and inventories rise because of disputes with China, Canada and other trade partners who are significant purchasers of U.S. pork, soybeans and other products.
While the overall economic impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum and Chinese imports already implemented by President Donald Trump is expected to be muted, American industry has warned it could hurt their earnings and lead to higher prices for consumers. On Wednesday, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). cut its profit forecast this year on surging metals prices.
Automakers like GM are also warning Trump to drop plans to possibly impose 20 percent tariffs on vehicle imports on the grounds of protecting national security.
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump tore into his critics on trade, saying that “people snipping at your heels during a negotiation” undercut his administration’s ability to negotiate an agreement that is more fair to the American economy.
Kudlow said the attempt to shore up markets is a reaction to a “broken” system of world trade that has worked against the U.S. in the past. He called for patience in allowing the U.S. to achieve reciprocity in trade.
“No one is thrilled with subsidies, I get that,” Kudlow said. “On the other hand, we need a backstop for our patriotic farmers who have been hurt.”

519,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 09:37AM ET</span>",Trump says China is being 'vicious' by hitting US farmers with tariffs,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at China over the latest escalation in the trade spat between the world's two largest economies.
""China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S.,"" Trump tweeted. ""They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year.""
It's unclear what number Trump was referring to. The US trade deficit with China in 2017 came in at $375.6 billion, according to Census Bureau data, though adding that figure to this year's data through May comes out to about $528 billion.
Trump's tweet comes less than 24 hours after the US Department of Agriculture  authorized $12 billion of support for farmers and ranchers hurt by tariffs imposed by China.
The Trump administration imposed tariffs of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese goods earlier this month and has another $16 billion pending. Beijing retaliated with tariffs of its own on $34 billion worth of American goods, including soybeans. Trump has threatened to  place tariffs on all $505 billion worth of Chinese goods imported by the US.
China is the largest buyer of US soybeans,  importing about $14 billion worth of the legume in 2016, according to the US Department of Agriculture. But the country has been pursuing other avenues as trade tensions with the US have flared. Kevin McNew, an economist at Farmers Business Network, told Business Insider that China had bought at least 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans on forward contracts he expected to be canceled following the tariff implementation.
Soybeans are down 10.22% this year through Tuesday.

""When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!""
Trump’s latest shot comes as some fellow Republicans slammed his plan to offer as much as $12 billion in aid to U.S. farmers hit by a burgeoning trade war. Extra farm aid would benefit producers seeing prices drop and inventories rise because of disputes with China, Canada and other trade partners who are significant purchasers of U.S. pork, soybeans and other crops.
But that failed to sway skeptics on Capitol Hill, including Republicans from politically important agricultural states.
""My thoughts are the thoughts of farmers. They want trade, not aid. It’s really just that simple,"" said Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin.
Trump lashed out at those he termed weak politicians asking to end tariffs that the president has sought to use to reduce a trade deficit he said was $817 billion last year. It was unclear where Trump got that figure. Data from the Commerce Department put the 2017 U.S. trade deficit at $552.3 billion.
Trump is scheduled to meet later in the day with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker after saying the U.S. and European Union should eliminate all tariffs, barriers and subsidies. While talks with European leaders likely will focus on averting car levies, China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by targeting U.S. agricultural exports.
“China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S.,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now!”
While Trump said “China made $517 Billion on us last year,” the U.S. trade gap with China was $376 billion in 2017, according to Census Bureau data. That was up almost $30 billion from the previous year.
Earlier this month, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with similar penalties on an additional $16 billion worth of products expected to go into effect shortly. The administration has also identified an additional $200 billion of Chinese products that it is considering imposing a 10 percent tariff on, with the additional levy coming live as early as next month. Beijing has threatened to retaliate against any further U.S. tariffs, and responded to Trump’s first wave by matching duties on a similar amount of U.S. imports.
The administration has also looked to protect specific industries with new tariffs, including a round of levies on imported metals. The 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum impact not only China, but traditional U.S. allies like the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 06:34AM ET</span>",EU prepares retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion of U.S. goods,"By Johan Ahlander and Paul Carrel
STOCKHOLM/BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Commission is drawing up a list of $20 billion of U.S. goods to hit with duties if Washington imposes tariffs on imported cars, European Union trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on the eve of her boss's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Malmstrom is in Washington for talks on trade, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker due on Wednesday to meet Trump in a bid to stop the United States from extending its import tariffs on EU steel and aluminum to cars and car parts.
""We hope that it doesn't come to that and that we can find a solution. If not, the EU Commission is preparing a rather long list of many American goods. It would be around $20 billion,"" Malmstrom told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Wednesday.
In response to the U.S. metals tariffs, the EU has already imposed its own import duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion) worth of U.S. goods, including products like bourbon and motorcycles that are made in some of the electoral districts that supported Trump.
Malmstrom said the next potential round of EU tariffs would not target specific U.S. states.
""No, now it's more general goods such as agricultural products, machinery, high-tech products and other things,"" she said.
The Commission briefed EU countries last week on the bloc's possible response, saying in theory it could hit 9 billion euros of U.S. goods, according to EU sources. 
However, some EU diplomats said the Commission was also looking at going for double that amount - to the level Malmstrom is suggesting - at half the duty rate.
A formal proposal would only come after the U.S. Commerce Department completed its investigation into whether car imports threaten national security. The report's deadline is February 2019, but it is now expected by late August/early September.
MODERATED OPTIMISM
The European Commission, which handles trade policy on behalf of the EU's 28 members, has insisted that Juncker is seeking to open a dialogue with Trump, rather than to negotiate.
EU officials have also downplayed the idea that Juncker is arriving with a novel trade offer.
EU budget commissioner Guenther Oettinger suggested the EU would be ready to discuss mutual tariff cuts provided the Washington lifts punitive metals tariffs first.
He told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that the two could try to forge a lighter version of the planned U.S.-European trade deal known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). TTIP negotiations were stalled after Trump's 2016 election victory.
Business confidence in Oettinger's homeland, Germany, the largest EU exporter of cars to the United States, weakened in July, with the threat of a trade war increasing uncertainty. 
Trump on Tuesday tweeted that the EU was coming to negotiate a trade deal.
""I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won’t!"" Trump wrote.
Malmstrom indicated she was not expecting a breakthrough.
""Basically, I'm an optimistic person, but heading in to this I'm moderately optimistic. But one must always try,"" she told the Swedish newspaper.
She added that she did not think the U.S. proposal to drop tariffs, barriers and subsidies was serious, pointing out that the U.S. has laws, such as the Buy American Act, protecting its industries and agricultural policies supporting its farmers.
""We tried earlier in TTIP negotiations to make the United States loosen those laws,"" Malmstrom said. ""It was completely impossible. They did not move a millimeter.""

522,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Banks told to spell out long-term plans for new Brexit bases,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks from Britain must draw up plans showing how they will staff and operate their new bases in the European Union after Brexit to avoid ending up with ""empty shells"".
It is the clearest sign yet that the shift in banking jobs from Britain may rise significantly from the modest 3,500 to 12,000 forecast in the short term by the City of London financial district.
About 20 banks have applied so far for licenses to open bases or expand existing ones in the eurozone by March 2019.
Banks are seeking to staff the new hubs with the minimum number of people possible initially by conducting some of the operations from existing London bases. They would then make more strategic decisions later on, but EU regulators are challenging this approach.
""Each of the banks have to agree a glide path with regulators that sets out how, over the next two or three years, the bank will have a bigger substance, with more risk management capability, central functions beefed up and so on,"" said Vishal Vedi, Deloitte's financial services Brexit leader who is advising banks on making the move.
The European Central Bank, which supervises the main lenders in the eurozone and is a central player in setting conditions for the new bases, said it will prevent banks from creating token offices.
""To this end, the ECB will focus on five key areas when assessing license applications,"" an ECB spokeswoman said.
These are adequate local management capabilities; access to market infrastructure such as clearing; some hedging and trading capabilities; no full reliance on booking and hedging strategies based outside the EU; and provision of accurate data on local activities.
Initial eurozone licenses allow some management of risks and ""back-to-back"" or booking of trades to continue in London, New York or elsewhere outside the EU beyond next March, Vedi said.
""The glide path refers to how the reduction of that will be achieved and what it will look like,"" Vedi said.
An EU regulatory source said there were intensive talks with banks wanting to set up subsidiaries in the eurozone.
""We are asking them for early assurance by outlining proposals on how exactly they plan to structure their businesses in the next few years,"" the source said.
""This may include outlining structures and processes for their risk management, how they will spread their operational capacities, and where their traders will sit.""
The pressure on banks in London to shift enough staff to EU hubs has not gone unnoticed by regulators in Britain, worried that too many top staff will relocate.
""If you are expanding your presence in Europe, the structures you put in place must enable us to supervise your UK business effectively, and ensure that you continue to meet our threshold (minimum) conditions,"" Nausicaa Delfas, head of international strategy at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said last week.

""If you are relocating senior management, are you ensuring that appropriate senior oversight remains in the UK?""

523,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 05:22AM ET</span>",Japan's tiny sharing economy still in its infancy,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's sharing economy made up less than a 10th of a percent of nominal gross domestic product in 2016, research showed on Wednesday, in a sign the sector remains very much in its infancy.
The sharing economy - using technology to allow consumers and businesses to directly trade goods and services - has threatened to upend business models for industries including taxis, hotels, and consumer finance. 
Policymakers in many countries are starting to question how to measure the economic impact of this technological change, but research published by the Japanese government and Mitsubishi Research Institute showed this impact is small in the world's third-largest economy.
Some of the country's business leaders have criticized Japan's slow adoption of innovative technology and warned the country was lagging overseas rivals in areas such as artificial intelligence.
""Ride-sharing is prohibited by law in Japan. I can't believe there is still such a stupid country,"" SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) chief executive Masayoshi Son, said an annual company event last week. 
Japan's sharing economy was around 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in 2016, the research showed. Of this figure, some 120 billion yen was reflected in the country's GDP calculations, but around 135 billion yen was not captured in GDP.
In comparison, nominal GDP stood at 538 trillion yen in 2016.
The government will consider changes to existing data and calculation methods to reflect more of the sharing economy in GDP, but it may take time to reach a conclusion, an official told reporters at a news briefing.
Japanese regulators have so far taken a cautious approach to companies that typify the sharing economy, so there are doubts about how much this sector can grow in Japan.
Japan outlaws non-professional drivers from transporting paying customers due to safety concerns and the country's taxi industry lobby has vigorously opposed deregulation.
Its strict rules have confined ride-sharing firms such as Uber [UBER.UL] to providing only very limited services.
New rules on home-sharing came into force last month that have radically reduced the number of lettings on sites such as Airbnb Inc, which allows people to rent out rooms or entire apartments.
Japan's  Mercari  Inc (T:4385) made a splash last month when the flea market operator raised $1.2 billion in the country's largest initial public offering this year.
Mercari's popular mobile phone application allows individuals to buy and sell used goods from each other, which is commonly considered part of the sharing economy.
However, this is not measured in GDP because no new goods are being created, the government official told reporters.

The report divided the sharing economy into companies that focus on lodging and space, transportation, exchange of newly-created goods, exchange of services, and fundraising.

524,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 25:
1. U.S.-EU Trade Talks 
Investor sentiment is somewhat cautious ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House this afternoon.
The meeting comes amid strained trade relations between the European Union and the United States.
Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU and has threatened to extend those measures to the European auto sector, which would prompt retaliatory action from Brussels.
Ahead of the talks Trump tweeted that tariffs are “great”, and claimed the U.S. is being treated as a “piggy bank” by countries who run a trade surplus with it.
He also called for both sides to completely abolish tariffs, subsidies and other trade barriers.



2. Facebook, Boeing Earnings To Grab Attention
Facebook earnings after the bell will be the day’s most anticipated report, as the busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season continues.
The consensus at the Street shows another blowout quarter, with revenue rising to $13.35 billion, up from $9.32 billion in the year-ago period, and adjusted earnings per share rising to $1.71 from $1.59.
The stock (NASDAQ:FB) is trading near an all-time high after a tumultuous start to the year.
Besides Facebook, Wednesday will be a very busy day for corporate results with Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO),  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), and Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) the notable reporters before the market open.



And after the market close, Facebook earnings will also be accompanied by results from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Ford (NYSE:F), Visa (NYSE:V), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT).
AT&T (NYSE:T) will also be in focus after the telecom giant missed analysts' revenue expectations, generating $38.99 billion versus the $39.39 billion that was expected.
3. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Subdued Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a subdued open, with the topic of trade resurfacing as the head of the European Commission meets with President Trump.
At 5:20AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were down 12 points, or less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were both set to open little changed from the previous session.
Elsewhere, European markets hovered around the flatline, with the different sectors taking opposite directions. Basic resources and autos were the worst-performers in early deals given their link to trade.
Earlier, Asian markets closed mixed, with benchmarks in Japan and Hong Kong tracking higher. Mainland China stocks finished the session near breakeven.
4. Dollar Ticks Lower Ahead Of Housing Data
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar was a shade lower, as investors looked ahead to U.S. housing data for further clues on when and how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down almost 0.2% at 94.23.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices ticked higher, pushing yields lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield dipping to around 2.94%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near 2.64%.
Economic data set for release on Wednesday include the June report on new home sales, which are expected to fall 2.8% from the prior month.
5. Weekly EIA Oil Supply Report In Focus
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended July 20 at 10:30AM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 2.3 million barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 3.16 million barrels last week. The API data also showed supplies of gasoline fell by 4.87 barrels, while distillate stockpiles slid 1.32 million barrels.
Oil prices were higher for the second day in a row.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $68.64 a barrel, having settled the previous session up 63 cents, or nearly 1%.
Brent crude gained 60 cents, or 0.8%, to $74.04.

525,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Nafta Talks to Pick Up Again as Threat of Auto Tariffs Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- High-level talks for a new Nafta are picking up again this week following two months of limited negotiations that were instead marred by tit-for-tat tariff battles and diplomatic fallout.
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland will discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday when she meets in Mexico City with officials from the incoming and outgoing Mexican administrations. On Thursday, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo is traveling to Washington to discuss the status of Nafta talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The bilateral gatherings mark the most activity on Nafta negotiations since May.
The talks, which have been under way since last August, stalled in the lead-up to Mexico’s July 1 presidential election. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won and takes office in December. The challenge for negotiators is picking up from where they left off, with gaping differences remaining over key issues including rules for auto content and a sunset clause that would kill the deal after five years unless the parties agreed to extend it.
Hanging over the talks are President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect on June 1 for Canada and Mexico, which triggered immediate retaliation from both neighbors, and the administration’s threat to impose duties on foreign vehicles and auto parts. Mexico and Canada are the largest source of auto imports to the U.S.
Trump has also threatened to scrap Nafta or pursue individual deals, saying last week he may seek separate talks with Mexico as a priority before Canada. On Monday, Trump said he was talking with Lopez Obrador about doing something “very dramatic, very positive” on trade, though the Mexican president-elect later said he didn’t know what Trump was referring to.
August Goal
Mexico’s outgoing administration is now looking for a quick solution to Nafta. The Mexican government is redoubling its efforts to reach a swift agreement with the Trump administration, people familiar with the matter said. Jesus Seade, named by Lopez Obrador as his chief Nafta negotiator, will join the team on Guajardo’s trip to Washington this week.
The current Mexican administration, Canada as well as the U.S. Congress have said they support the final agreement having a trilateral structure. Lopez Obrador in a letter sent to Trump last week also urged for Nafta to remain a three-way deal.
The White House’s strategy to divide and conquer in its negotiations on Nafta is not a new one, said Eric Miller, a former Canadian diplomat who is now a Washington-based trade consultant with Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.
“The Nafta negotiations appear to be repeating the same pattern that they have followed since the beginning: The United States sets unrealistic deadlines and tries to pressure their counterparts into a deal,’’ Miller said. “At present, the objective is to push Mexico to embrace an auto deal all while threatening to pursue bilateral negotiations with each country.”
Guajardo last week alluded to the possibility of an August deal. In an interview with Radio Formula, he said that in closed-door meetings with the current and incoming governments earlier this month, U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated a desire to have a deal in 45 days.
While the stakes are high, expectations are low that this week will yield sufficient progress to finish the deal next month. And even if talks were concluded this year, key Republicans in Congress have signaled that time has run out for lawmakers to consider the new agreement for a vote before a new Congress takes over in 2019.
‘Hard to See’
“It’s hard to see an agreement in August without the U.S. falling off some of its positions,’’ Bill Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.
A quick resolution also faces an uphill battle in Canada, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has little political incentive to bow to U.S. demands. Trudeau’s popularity among voters has surged since the Trump administration slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, according to a poll by Ipsos Public Affairs.
Canadian support for revising Nafta had been edging up until Trump imposed the metal tariffs and insulted Trudeau at a Group of Seven meeting in Quebec last month, according to Sean Simpson, vice president at Ipsos. Following the G-7, 70 percent of Canadians backed boycotting American products, according to Ipsos polling.
“It’s been a rallying cry for Canadians. Being against Trump is the only thing we can agree on,” Simpson said.
Trudeau insisted early in the negotiations that his government would be willing to consider revisions to the trade pact. But his position has hardened, with the prime minister saying at the end of May that Canada would rather have no Nafta than a bad deal.
One potential outcome for this week’s meeting could be progress on an autos deal that would include the Trump administration’s demand for rules requiring a substantial amount of work at a higher wage to shift production from low-cost Mexico.
Yet, even if the countries succeed in getting an autos deal, Nafta still has a long way to the finish line, Miller said.
“Imagine that one is transiting the Rocky Mountains,’’ Miller said. “It is a momentous occasion, but there are a lot of mountains left before you hit the Pacific.’’

526,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Bank of England downplays financial job moves ahead of Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Fewer than 5,000 financial jobs might move out of Britain by ""Day One"" of Brexit and future relocations will depend on new trading terms with the European Union, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Wednesday.
""We have had an estimate for some time now of 5,000 to 10,000 jobs, which you can think of as half to one percent of jobs there are in this country in the relevant sector,"" Woods told Bloomberg in an interview.
""So a relatively small move on Day One. I think it will be at the bottom end of that range. If anything, it might be slightly below that.""
His estimate chimes with the City of London financial district, whose leader Catherine McGuinness told parliament on Tuesday she expects between 3,500 and 12,000 financial jobs to go in the short term because of Brexit.
Britain leaves the bloc next March and many banks have applied for license to open or expand hubs in the EU to avoid ruptures in customer links.
Woods, in charge of supervising Britain's banks and insurers, said further job moves will depend on how the EU responds to the British government's proposals for trading relations in financial services, Woods said.
He reiterated a call for the EU authorities to reciprocate action being taken by Britain to ensure legal continuity in trillions of pounds in cross border derivatives and insurance contracts.
Brussels has said it was up to the private sector to sort out uncertainty over contract continuity.
""I am obviously hoping the sides are going to come together,"" Woods said.
Banks in Britain are worried that a ""standstill"" transition period from next March to the end of 2020 agreed by the EU and Britain won't get ratified, leaving them facing a cliff edge British departure from the bloc.
""We doing a lot of work mitigating cliff-edge risk. That work is going OK,"" Woods said.

""Even if things go badly, they will be robust enough to continue supplying services to UK households and businesses.""

527,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 04:43AM ET</span>",Reuters watchlist: predicting the next downturn,"By Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Economists and investors are watching for signs they hope can predict when the wheels will come off a near-record U.S. economic expansion and equities bull market. 
Some are already worried about a flattening Treasuries yield curve and slowing housing market, even as other economic vital signs remain healthy. 
U.S. economic growth will probably slow gradually over the next two years and the threat of a trade war has made a recession more likely, a recent Reuters poll predicted. 
A majority of bond market experts in a separate poll now predict a yield curve inversion in the next one to two years, a red flag for those who believe short-term yields rising above longer-term yields means an imminent recession.
""Almost every client meeting includes questions about where the economy and markets sit in the cycle,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) head of cross-asset fundamental strategy John Normand wrote in a recent research note.
(Graphic: The business cycle is currently the second longest: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Juh2B7)
The U.S. economy is a year away from surpassing the record 120-month 1991-2001 expansion, according to data from the National Bureau of Economic Research. 
The stock market bull run is also nearing a record. Bull markets are typically measured retroactively, but U.S. equities could hit their longest bull run in history on Aug. 22, according to S&P. 
The U.S. economy is ""late cycle"" but a recession is not imminent, a number of economists and strategists say. 
""We believe that the U.S. economic expansion is entering the final third of its cycle,"" wrote analysts at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, although they said various indicators do not suggest a recession this year. 
1. THE YIELD CURVE 
The U.S. yield curve plots Treasury securities with maturities ranging from 4 weeks to 30 years. The spread between two-year and 10-year notes is typically used when discussing yield curve inversion. The gap between long- and short-dated yields turning negative has been a reliable predictor of recessions. The yield curve has been flattening in recent months. 
(Graphic: Economy watchlist - yield curve: https://reut.rs/2MYeG0i) 
2. SHORT-TERM BILLS 
An alternative yield curve measures the difference in the current interest rate on 3-month Treasury bills and expectations for the yields 18 months from now. Federal Reserve officials have found this measure is a stronger predictor of recession in the coming year. The measure currently suggests little recession risk.
(Graphic: Recession risks: https://reut.rs/2Nny0nf)
3. UNEMPLOYMENT 
The unemployment rate and initial jobless claims ticked higher just ahead or in the early days of the last two recessions before rising sharply. Unemployment hit an 18-year low in May of 3.8 percent but nudged up to 4 percent in June. 
(Graphic: Unemployment: https://reut.rs/2L0Asza)
4. OUTPUT GAP 
The output gap between the economy's actual and potential gross domestic product has fallen ahead of the last two recessions. 
""Currently we estimate that the output gap is nearly closed, but not yet in the 'overheating' territory,"" wrote Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. investor services at Oxford Economics, in May.
(Graphic: GDP output gap: https://reut.rs/2NB4Wcw)
5. STOCK MARKETS 
Falling equity markets can signal a recession is looming or has already started to take hold. Markets turned down before the 2001 recession and tumbled at the start of the 2008 recession. 
On a 12-month rolling basis, the market has turned down ahead of the last two recessions. The 12-month rolling average percent move is now below its 2018 peak but higher than recent lows.

6. BOOM-BUST BAROMETER
The Boom-Bust Barometer devised by Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research measures spot prices of industrials inputs like copper, steel and lead scrap, and divides that by initial unemployment claims. The measure fell before or during the last two recessions and is below its 2018 peak. 
(Graphic: Boom bust: https://reut.rs/2JQbVvn)
7. HOUSING MARKET 
Housing starts and building permits have fallen ahead of some recent recessions. Housing starts and permits fell to the lowest level since September 2017 in June.

8. EARNINGS GROWTH 
S&P 500 earnings growth dipped ahead of the last recession. Earnings growth is expected to slow slightly this year and more next year, but remain in the high single digits or low double digits in 2019. 
(Graphic: Earnings fell: https://reut.rs/2J9xyGv)
9. SOUTH KOREA EXPORTS 
South Korean exports fell during the last recession and before the previous recession. 
Those exports, which include cars, phones, steel and other products, tend to be a leading indicator, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett. Exports from China are also increasingly important as weak Asian exports tend to coincide with weak global and U.S. growth. 
South Korea's export growth came to a halt in June. China, the world's largest exporter, reported exports accelerated in June.
The United States and China have fired the first shots in what could become a protracted trade war. The United States and South Korea agreed in March to revise a trade pact.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Euro zone business lending growth hit post-crisis high,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lending growth to euro zone companies surged to a post-crisis high last month, while a broader indicator of money circulating in the euro area, which often foreshadows future activity, surged unexpectedly, the European Central Bank said.
Lending growth to non-financial corporations accelerated to 4.1 in June from 3.7 percent in May, its fastest rate since mid-2009. Household lending growth meanwhile held steady at 2.9 percent, the ECB said in a regular monthly statement on Wednesday.
By purchasing 2.6 trillion euros ($3.04 trillion) worth of debt over nearly four years, the ECB has tried to hold down borrowing costs and stimulate lending, to rekindle growth and inflation.
While its efforts have mostly paid off, economic growth has softened in recent months and the expansion in lending has also appeared to ease, suggesting that the bloc's growth cycle has peaked.
Still, unemployment is dropping and the threat of deflation has been warded off. That led the ECB to announce last month it would end the bond purchases this year, although interest rates will stay steady at least through the summer of 2019.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, which in part reflects the amount of cash pumped in by the ECB itself, surged to 4.4 percent, blowing past expectations for 4 percent and the previous month's 4 percent reading.

529,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Europe Preparing New Tariffs on $20bn of U.S. Goods,"Investing.com - The European Union is preparing to impose tariffs on $20 billion of U.S. imports if Washington follows through on threats to impost tariffs on auto imports from the bloc, EU trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said Wednesday.
Malmstrom said the tariffs would be introduced if U.S. President Donald Trump decided to impose tariffs on $50 billion of car imports from Europe.
Trump is to host an EU delegation, including Malmstrom and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the White House for trade talks later Wednesday.
The talks come amid heightened trade tensions between the EU and Washington after the U.S. slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the bloc, which led to Europe putting 25% tariffs on bourbon whiskey, peanut butter, motorcycles and jeans.
Ahead of the talks, Trump tweeted that tariffs are “great”, and claimed the U.S. is being treated as a “piggy bank” by countries who run a trade surplus with it.
He also called for both sides to completely abolish tariffs, subsidies and other trade barriers.

Speaking before an EU delegation travels to Washington for talks on Wednesday on a long-term trade deal, Guenther Oettinger said the EU wanted the United States to first drop its new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports.
""Firstly, our common line is that we expect the existing punitive tariffs to be lifted,"" Oettinger, a German, said of the EU's position. ""Then we are ready to discuss a reduction and restructuring of all tariffs in all sectors.""
""In this way, we want to avoid a further escalation of the trade conflict, and to avoid a trade war,"" he told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. ""One could try to untangle the existing tariffs and then ... reduce tariffs for various goods and services.""
""That would be a negotiation that would be possible in half a year, and which we could start with the U.S. in the autumn.""
Oettinger suggested the EU and the United States could try to negotiate a lighter version of a stalled comprehensive U.S.-European trade deal known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).
""One could try for a TTIP light,"" he said.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker travels to Washington on Wednesday for talks focused on trade tensions after the U.S. imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to extend those measures to European cars.
On Monday, the Commission said Juncker would not arrive in the United States for the talks with Trump with a specific trade offer.
""Anything would be better than a trade war,"" said Oettinger.
Trump has repeatedly complained about the European Union, pointing to the higher duties it applies for car imports and describing the bloc as a ""foe"" in trade.
EU officials have said that, while EU import duties for cars are heavier than those of the United States, for other products, such as trucks, U.S. rates are higher.
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who will accompany Juncker, said last week that the EU was preparing a list of U.S. products to hit if the United States imposed tariffs on EU cars.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 04:02AM ET</span>",UK watchdog proposes basic interest rate on older cash accounts,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said it was proposing a minimum interest rate for older cash savings accounts because the market was not working well for longstanding customers.
The plan would cost banks an extra 300 million pounds ($395 million) a year in net interest payments, the Financial Conduct Authority estimated. There was no immediate comment from the industry.
It is the first time the FCA has proposed a fixed interest rate on cash accounts, the ""preferred policy option"" after previous package of measures failed to have much impact.
Nearly 90 percent of British adults have a cash savings with banks and building societies, totaling 702 billion pounds in 2013, the watchdog said.
""The Financial Conduct Authority is concerned that the interest rates that longstanding customers receive on easy access cash savings products are generally lower than those received by customers who shop around,"" the watchdog said in a statement on Wednesday.
It said this is unlikely to change without further intervention, but stopped short for now on an outright ban on price discrimination.
Instead it set out the option for a basic savings rate (BSR) that would apply to all easy access cash savings accounts after they have been open for a set period of time, such as a year.
Banks and building societies would be able to set the BSR freely and the only restriction is that they cannot discriminate by account age.
The FCA's board noted in March that the watchdog's 2015 study and actions to improve how customers can open, manage and switch their cash accounts did not fully address problems uncovered at the time, and that more ""remedies"" were needed.
It set a December 2016 deadline for halving the target time for switching cash Individual Savings Accounts or ISAs to 7 days from 15 days.
Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition said on Wednesday that providers of savings products can take advantage of high levels of customer inaction to pay lower interest rates to longstanding customers.
""While many customers have valid reasons for not shopping around, providers must still treat them fairly, while maintaining competitive rates for those who do,"" Woolard said.

The FCA is now seeking feedback on the options set out in its discussion paper, which closes on the 25 October 2018.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Barclays boss says UK finance sector will dodge Brexit bullet,"By Sinead Cruise and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banking industry will emerge largely unscathed from Brexit and retain its position as one of the world's top two financial centers for the foreseeable future, Barclays' (L:BARC) Chairman John McFarlane told Reuters.
Home to the world's highest number of banks and largest commercial insurance market, the City of London and its sister district in east London's Canary Wharf are scrambling to prepare for Britain's departure from the European Union, the biggest challenge the UK financial sector has faced since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
McFarlane shrugged off fears expressed by some bankers and politicians that a blueprint for Britain's future trading relationship with the European Union, proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May, would cripple job creation and trigger London's rapid decline as a global financial services center.
""I don't think in the long run that there will be terminal damage [to London],"" McFarlane said in an interview in his capacity as chair of lobby group The CityUK.
Brexit will cost Britain up to 12,000 financial services jobs in the short term, the City of London financial district's leader, Catherine McGuinness said on Tuesday, and many more jobs might disappear in the longer term.
But McFarlane said London would remain Europe's primary hub for financial services because the city has the continent's deepest markets and broadest pool of talent, scotching doomsayers who claim the sector could end up the biggest loser from the end of unfettered access to EU markets.
Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain's $2.9 trillion economy, but that long term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.
A sharp spike in Italy's cost of borrowing in late May also handed EU stakeholders a sobering reminder that the EU needs London's markets as much as London needs the EU, McFarlane said.
Short-term Italian bond yields suffered the biggest one-day jump since 1992 (IT2YT=RR) on May 29 after a fresh phase of political turmoil forced the government to pay the highest yield in more than five years at an auction of six-month debt. 
And when prices tumbled, London-based traders and market makers with age-old relationships with the world's biggest investors executed the largest volume of Italian government bond trading, McFarlane pointed out.
""The only reason that was dealt with is because London existed. Given that we have a competitive advantage in those areas that is not easily replicated, that is a fair argument for why people need to use this system going forward. Because it is better than the alternative,"" he said.
The financial sector accounts for 12 percent of Britain's economic output, but McFarlane said the government's dismissal of the sector's preferred plans for access to the EU single market post-Brexit will not be as destructive as some commentators have predicted.
Many had pinned hopes on a bid for ""mutual recognition"" - whereby Britain and the EU would accept each other's rules in exchange for broad two-way market access - as the best way to protect financial contracts and activity worth trillions of euros once Britain exits the EU on March 29.
Prime Minister May has instead chosen to build trading ties on a legal mechanism known as ""equivalence"", whereby the EU deems a country's rules to be as robust as its own.
McFarlane said the government now needed to act fast to negotiate ""expanded equivalence"" for Britain after critics said the regime exposed firms to sudden loss of EU market access.
""You need to get on with it. Aggressively. Because radical change in this space is difficult,"" he said.
The EU has so far opposed any attempts to modify equivalence and said it has no plans to reform the regime.
POLITICS
McFarlane, who has chaired the British lender and TheCityUK since 2015, said he was confident May would avert a potentially chaotic 'no deal' scenario, despite recent ructions in Westminster that have put further strain on Britain's relationship with EU negotiators. 
""I am always optimistic until I am pessimistic, and that line has not been crossed. While it is all to play for, we should play for it and secure it ... Economic logic must win through somewhere and therefore we have a very good chance of securing something,"" he said.
Concerns about the future prosperity of Britain's financial services sector have surged since some of its biggest employers scrapped 'wait and see' policies on relocation, and began executing plans to shift people and resources from the UK to multiple EU outposts.
 Barclays  has announced plans to shift up to 200 roles to the continent as part of its Brexit planning.
McFarlane, however, said he felt reassured that May and her cabinet were striving to protect the interests of the private sector, despite statements to the contrary made by ex-ministers.
Recalling a recent dinner attended by May, UK Finance Minister Philip Hammond and around 20 senior banking executives from all over Europe, McFarlane said both politicians impressed with their grasp of the biggest problems the industry faced.
""She came, she had no notes but she was fully prepared and she was impressive. It was highly symbolic to that group that she cared,"" he said. 
""I don't think the official part of government is dismissive of business ... if anything, they are fighting our corner.""

XIAMEN, China/BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Xiaodao, a 26-year-old civil servant in the Chinese city of Xiamen, says taking out a 30-year-mortgage on a two-bedroom apartment with her husband was the most regrettable decision of her life.
Although their parents covered the 1.5 million yuan (£172,285) down payment on the 2.9 million yuan flat, mortgage payments eat up more than 70 percent of the couple's combined income of about 10,000 yuan a month - average for the city.
""Our spending power has plummeted,"" Yang said. ""We do not dare to have a kid. We do not dare to buy a car. We do not dare to travel.""
Throughout China, home prices that are among the highest in the world relative to incomes have pushed millions of households to debt levels similar to those seen in the United States just before its housing crisis, according to a new study by the Institute for Advanced Research at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
Economists are sounding the alarm that such debt has started to crimp consumption, undermining Bejing's plan to lean on domestic demand to drive growth amid a heated trade dispute with the United States.
Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing, says slowing income growth and high household borrowing levels will limit how much consumers can boost economic growth in the short term. 
""Pressure from mortgages is impacting the amount of disposable income available to spend elsewhere,"" he said.
(For graphic on Ratio of China household debt to household savings, by province, click https://reut.rs/2JTdFDR)
Xiamen, a prosperous coastal city in Fujian province, stands out: its 4 million residents are the most indebted of any large city in China, according to a Reuters analysis of central bank data. 
Known for warm weather, seafood, and a laid-back lifestyle, Xiamen is the fourth-most-expensive real estate market in the country, despite incomes significantly lower than in cities with comparable home prices.
""An influx of property speculators from other cities in the province attracted to Xiamen's lifestyle drove property prices to record highs, causing panic buying among locals,"" said Wang Yanwu, an assistant professor at Xiamen University's School of Economics.
RAPID CHANGES
Xiamen is now crowded with recently built high-rises, and the local government is promoting development in surrounding districts off the main island.
The city's new home prices increased 53 percent from 2015 through June, or about 19 percent annually, the most among 70 cities tracked by China's National Bureau of Statistics. Disposable income growth in Xiamen averaged 8.4 percent in the same period.
Nationwide, new home prices have risen 20.7 percent since 2015, according to Reuters calculations based on official data. 
But in an alarming sign for homeowners like Yang, home sales in Xiamen slumped after new rules restricted purchases and prices of existing homes fell 4.8 percent in the year to June, compared with a 3.9 percent average increase for 70 large cities in the same period, according to Reuters calculations. 
The affordability gap is wide in Xiamen: a 90-square-metre home costs on average 3 million yuan, or $450,000, while per capita income in the city is about $7,500 per year. 
Even if buyers can afford a mortgage payment, at least 30 percent of the value of a home is often required up front. At the average price, that equals 60 years' worth of disposable income.
A 28-year-old father of two, who wanted to be identified only by his surname, Huang, said his parents and in-laws provided his down payment of 2 million yuan last year. But, he added, an 8,000 yuan monthly mortgage leaves little to spend on anything else.
""I feel frustrated, exhausted and annoyed,"" Huang said. 
The ratio of household debt in Xiamen hit 98 percent of GDP at the end of 2017, much higher than the national level of 55 percent, and higher than the U.S. household debt ratio of 79 percent of GDP, according to the Bank of International Settlements.
And the ratio of household debt to household savings in Xiamen is a staggering 182 percent.
""I am definitely worried"" about economic growth in the second half of the year, said Zhongyuan's Wang. ""There is a very good chance that consumption will continue to weaken.""
TROUBLING NUMBERS
Retail sales in Xiamen through the first five months of the year increased 9.2 percent versus a year ago, below the national rate of 9.5 percent and significantly slower than the 12.1 percent registered in the same period a year ago.
More than half of large department stores and supermarkets in Xiamen saw a decline in revenue in the first quarter, data from the Xiamen statistics bureau showed.
And data for April showed spending in Xiamen on discretionary items, including cosmetics and jewelry, fell compared with the same period last year.
Throughout the country, per capita disposable income growth slowed to 6.6 percent in the first half of the year compared with 7 percent in the same period a year ago, according to statistics released on July 16.
Debt is piling up in other cities too; in Shenzhen, household borrowing is 79 percent of GDP, and in Hangzhou it is 77 percent. 
A Reuters analysis based on central bank data shows residents in the coastal powerhouse cities that drive China's economy borrow the most, with the highest ratio of outstanding household debt to savings in the province of Fujian, where it hit 110 percent at the end of April, followed by Zhejiang and Guangdong.
The Shanghai University of Finance and Economics report estimated the ratio of household debt to disposable income in China was 78 percent at the end of 2017.
Based on current trends, that will top 100 percent by 2020 - on par with levels in the United States before the global financial crisis, according to the report.
The ratio is already higher than the U.S. pre-crisis levels in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces, three of the richest in the country, according to the report. 

""We do not even dare to spend money,"" said Yang, the civil servant in Xiamen. ""The mortgage has impacted the quality of life for two generations of our family.""

“I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies!” Trump said in a Tuesday night tweet. “That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won’t!”
July 25, 2018
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom are due to meet with Trump in Washington on Wednesday. They plan to signal the bloc’s willingness to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement on manufactured goods, or a so-called plurilateral sectoral agreement between all major car exporters which would cut or eliminate tariffs on automobiles globally.
The overtures are a last-ditch attempt to persuade him from imposing tariffs on European car exports to the U.S., in what could deal a serious blow to the 28-nation bloc’s economy.
“We are here to explain and find out how to prevent a trade war,” Juncker said in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF before the meeting, adding that he’s not overly optimistic. The EU is prepared to retaliate “immediately” if talks fail, he warned.
July 24, 2018
The commission, which manages trade relations on behalf of all 28 nations in the EU, is preparing a list of retaliatory measures on American goods worth $20 billion should the U.S. impose car tariffs, Malmstrom said. “It would be more general, like farming goods, machines, high-technology products and others,” she said in an interview with Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
Highlighting the complexity of Wednesday’s talks, hours before Trump called for the elimination of all tariffs, he had tweeted that “tariffs are the greatest.” He has also singled out the EU as a “foe” of the U.S. because of its trade surplus, and hinted that America’s commitment to the continent’s security is contingent on resolving the spat over tariffs.
The euro and shares in European auto exporters could drop if the Washington talks result in “further escalation of the U.S.-EU trade tensions, with President Trump sticking to his threat of additional tariffs on EU car exports and the EC President Junker threatening to retaliate,”  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) analysts led by Valentin Marinov said in a note.
Analysts caution that worse may be yet to come. Trump’s announcement of plans to provide $12 billion in aid for U.S. farmers suffering from tariffs suggest that “Trump is preparing for the long haul,” said Martin van Vliet and Benjamin Schroeder of ING Bank in Amsterdam.
“With Trump having called the EU a ‘foe’ recently and his assertion that he was ‘playing with the bank’s money,’ any quick resolution in this high stakes stand-off would come as a surprise,” they said.

MANILA/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tight checks by Chinese customs officials to halt the smuggling of scrap steel to Southeast Asia have forced some exporters to cancel or delay shipments, benefiting rivals like Russia that are prowling for market share amid a raging Sino-U.S. trade war. 
Among those that have canceled or delayed cargoes are Chinese exporters that have been taking advantage of Beijing's generous tax rebate system on value-added steel, according to two Chinese exporters and a major importer in the Philippines, China's third-biggest market. 
China has for decades given tax rebates to exporters selling value-added steel, allowing them to undercut competitors. China gave up to $2.8 billion in such rebates in 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on its alloy steel export volumes. 
But the system has been abused by exporters who have claimed rebates of 5 percent to 13 percent even for tiny additions of elements such as chromium, while some are alleged to have mislabeled shipments to pass them off as alloy steel. https://reut.rs/2mvvYpn
One of the steel exporters in China's top steelmaking city Tangshan said his company ditched a third of its shipments last month, adding that other shippers had also called off cargoes fearing their tactics to game the tax system may now be exposed. 
""People take advantage of tax rebates or forge export documents to avoid taxes, so the tighter checks are raising the risk to those traders,"" said the Tangshan exporter, who declined to say why his company had canceled its shipments. 
Smuggled scrap metal from China mostly flows to Southeast Asia, the same destination of the biggest portion of its legal steel product exports, according to the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
The volume of canceled or delayed deals was relatively small and has so far not knocked back China's exports, which have been driven higher by a wide arbitrage and the nation's increasing output. 
""Exports of products such as strips, square bar and wire rods were affected the most during the recent tightened checks from customs,"" said Linda Lin, steel editor at CRU in Shanghai. 
These products account for most of the Chinese steel heading overseas. While total export volumes continued to fall last year, shipments of strips went up by as much as 85 percent, according to customs data. 
But the pace of cancellations may quicken when customs authorities introduce new rules on Aug. 1 that require shippers to answer more than 100 questions on a shipment's declaration form, up from 40 questions now. 
Customs did not give a reason for the new rules announced in June, but traders expect them to make it harder to evade taxes. 
The extra paperwork sparked ""panic"" among traders, said a Hebei-based steel exporter: ""The new regulations will affect a lot of people, especially small trading firms who used the exports loophole to avoid tax and foreign exchange controls.""
China's customs office did not respond to requests for comment sent by fax. 
(Graphic: China's steel exports - https://reut.rs/2LuhjZQ)
TAX LOOPHOLES
The crackdown may reduce Chinese steel exporters' foothold in Southeast Asia, the destination for about a quarter of its steel products shipments last year. 
The canceled cargoes include several bound for the Philippines, where some major buyers have turned to Russia and the Middle East for supplies. 
Two to three Chinese suppliers canceled shipments of Manila-bound flat steel products in May, and up to four buyers of billet and wire rods were told in June that delivery of their cargoes would be delayed to August, according to a source with a major Chinese steel importer in the Philippines. 
""(Chinese steel exporters) told their buyers here that the shipments will be delayed to next month,"" said the source. 
Top Philippine steel producer Steel Asia - which yearly takes about 1.6 million tonnes of billet to make rebar for the local market - said China now accounts for less than 8 percent of its imports, compared with almost 90 percent in 2016. It now gets most of its supplies from Russia and the Middle East. 
""Availability and cost of billets are the main consideration for shift in supply,"" Steel Asia said. 
Also, in Vietnam, China's second-biggest market after South Korea, most steel firms will likely stop importing from China to avoid heavy U.S. import duties that Washington imposed on steel products from Vietnam it says originated in China.
Other major markets, including Indonesia and Thailand, have not seen any recent cancellations, according to an Indonesian trade official and the head of a Thai steel industry group. 
Still, combined with Beijing's escalating trade dispute with Washington, the extra customs scrutiny will make it harder to sell Chinese steel products abroad, traders and analysts said. That could help ease tensions with the United States, which has called for China to reduce its big trade surplus. 

China will likely ""further lift the threshold of tax rebate for steel exports considering the escalated global trade spat and Beijing's intensifying environmental push,"" said CRU's Lin.

Market uncertainty over when the ECB will lift its deposit rate rests on the translation of the statement wording from its June gathering, which suggested the first hike since 2011 would not come until at least the end of summer next year. Yet in other languages such as French and German, it hinted it could come in June or July.
With money-market pricing suggesting traders don’t expect a deposit rate increase from minus 0.4 percent until at least December next year, any hint of sooner from Draghi at Thursday’s ECB meeting could boost the euro and depress government bonds. Investors will also focus on any comments surrounding a potential shift in reinvestments after the bank’s asset-purchase program ends this year.
“The translation issue is really the only significant issue this time around,” said Ned Rumpeltin, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “All else being equal, any comments or clarifications we get this week from Draghi that have the net effect of pulling the timing of the ECB’s first rate hike forward should be a near-term positive for the euro.”

However, it noted that near-term risks from rising inflation and a changing external environment had increased, and has revised its forecast for the country's current account deficit, which has weighed on the Philippine peso.
""Downside risks stem mainly from rising inflation, continued rapid credit growth, higher U.S. interest rates and U.S. dollar, volatile capital flows and trade tensions,"" the IMF said in a statement issued following its regular ""Article 4"" review of the Philippine economy.
It now expects the current account deficit to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP by end-2018, from a previous forecast of 0.3 percent, mainly due to increased imports of capital goods and raw materials.
The IMF, however, said the deficit is likely to remain manageable as it would be financed largely by foreign direct investment.
The peso has weakened by more than 6 percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year, making it one of Asia's worst-performing currencies.
""To strike the right balance between growth and macroeconomic stability, policies need to be adjusted to reduce inflationary pressures, while structural reforms should continue to support inclusive growth,"" it said.
The IMF supports tightening monetary policy further to anchor inflation expectations. It also endorsed keeping the fiscal deficit in 2018 and 2019 broadly unchanged at around 2.4 percent of GDP to support efforts to contain inflationary pressures.

540,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Economists See China Growth Holding Up in Face of Trump Standoff,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic expansion will maintain its expected course this year, even in the face of an escalating trade war with the U.S., according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The world’s second-largest economy will grow by 6.6 percent this year, according to the median of 62 estimates in a poll conducted July 16-24. That’s even a slight improvement from the outlook the previous month, which saw 6.5 percent growth. That level is also the government’s official target.
As the U.S. and China have now begun imposing tariffs on some of each other’s goods, officials in Beijing have taken action to defend the expansion, from a softening of monetary policy to a package of fiscal policies announced on July 23. Those measures range from tax breaks to special bonds for infrastructure investment.
The ratio of deposits that banks are required to lock away at the People’s Bank of China will be reduced to 15 percent by the end of this quarter, 14.5 percent by the end of 2018 and head lower through 2020, according to the survey. The ratio currently stands at 15.5 percent for major banks, after three cuts so far this year.
Growth is still seen as coming in slower than in 2017, when the economy posted a 6.9 percent expansion. After a robust start to this year, that means a moderation in pace to 6.5 percent in both the third and fourth quarters, according to the survey.
The measures announced this week may help to stabilize growth in fixed-asset investment, which registered the slowest pace on record in the first half. That pace will stand at 6.5 percent in the third quarter and 6.8 percent in the fourth, according to the survey.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 09:36PM ET</span>",Trump calls for quick NAFTA deal in letter to Mexico president-elect,"By Christine Murray
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Mexico's president-elect in a letter that a quick renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would bring more jobs for both countries, but warned of a very different route otherwise.
In a letter replying to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election on July 1, Trump said that he was looking forward to working closely together to build a great relationship, mentioning trade, security and migration.
""A strong relationship will lead to a much stronger and more prosperous Mexico, which frankly would make me very happy!"" Trump wrote in the letter.
The missive was the latest step in a thawing between the two countries since Lopez Obrador's landslide victory, after a tense 18 months between Trump with outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto. 
Known as ""AMLO"", the president-elect wrote Trump a seven-page letter earlier this month, signing off that both men had managed to ""displace the establishment."" 
They have spoken by phone and Trump sent a senior delegation to Mexico, led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, shortly after Lopez Obrador's win.
Mexico and Canada have clashed with the United States over an update of the trilateral trade accord since Trump's team demanded tougher regional content rules for the auto industry and proposed a clause that would kill the agreement if it was not renegotiated after five years.
After weeks with little movement, Mexican trade negotiators travel to Washington this week to revive the talks. On Monday, Trump said he expected to get something worked out on NAFTA.
In the letter published Tuesday, Trump said he thought a NAFTA deal would lead to more jobs and higher wages on both sides of the border, ""but only if it can go quickly, because otherwise I must go a much different route,"" he wrote.
Negotiations to reshape the 1994 pact were launched last August at the behest of Trump, who blames NAFTA for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and argues the deal has cost jobs at home.

Trump also said in the letter that he was prepared to address economic development and security issues that drive migration to the United States.

In a tweet on Tuesday night, Trump said both the United States and the European Union should drop all tariffs, barriers and subsidies. 
""That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade!"" Trump said. ""Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won't!"" he said.
Trump has accused the EU of unfair trade practices and has threatened to raise tariffs on cars imported from the bloc.
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who will accompany Juncker, said last week that the EU was preparing a list of U.S. products to hit if the United States imposed the tariffs.
Juncker will not arrive in Washington with a specific trade offer, the commission said on Monday.
""I do not wish to enter into a discussion about mandates, offers because there are no offers,"" Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news conference in Brussels.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has said he expected Juncker to come with a ""significant"" trade offer.

The Lloyd's of London commercial insurance market is setting up an EU subsidiary in Brussels to start writing business from January 2019.
A number of other large insurers such as AIG (N:AIG) and  Aviva  (L:AV) are also setting up EU hubs in centers such as Luxembourg and Dublin, in the event that Britain loses access to the European Union's single market after Brexit.
But brokers have generally been slower to set up such units, industry sources say.
""At this advanced stage of the game, it would be foolish to ignore the very real possibility of no deal for the UK,"" Christopher Croft, chief executive of the London Insurance and International Brokers Association (LIIBA), said in a statement accompanying the trade group's mid-year report. 
""That’s why we’re encouraging our members to address this scenario now.""
LIIBA has been in talks with the Belgian government and regulators to help brokers considering Brussels as an EU hub, Croft said.
""LIIBA will be pursuing a more in-depth exploration of whether Athens or Piraeus could prove a viable alternative location,"" he added.

On Tuesday Brexit minister Dominic Raab said Britain had put forward a ""real offer"" to a win a deal on leaving the European Union by October, suggesting the government would not shift much from its agreed negotiating stance.
But Maas told the Funke group of newspapers: ""In order for the departure to be carried out in as orderly a way as possible, the British government will need to move.""
""On the one hand on the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Irish Republic and secondly on the undivided internal market, where Britain cannot cherrypick,"" he added.
The status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is one of the main stumbling blocks in the Brexit negotiations.
British Prime Minister in December agreed in principle to a binding ""backstop"" to ensure a soft border irrespective of future EU-UK ties, but later balked at an EU proposal to achieve this by treating Northern Ireland as a separate customs area to the rest of the United Kingdom.

Maas said the time pressure was strong, adding: ""But we won't let ourselves be put under pressure. We won't enter any deals that would be to the detriment of Europe.""

545,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Ivanka Trump closes fashion line to focus on helping her father,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump on Tuesday said she was shutting her fashion line to focus on her role as an informal White House adviser, where she is working on advancing working women.
Since Trump's surprise November 2016 election, his family has faced criticism that its portfolio of real estate and consumer goods businesses, which lean heavily on the Trump name as a marker of luxury, conflict with their roles as Washington officials.
Critics of the president called the shutting of the brand a victory for a boycott of Trump-tied businesses that began late in the 2016 campaign.
""After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington,"" Ivanka Trump, 36, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Amid criticism of potential conflicts of interest, Ivanka Trump in 2017 gave up day-to-day management of her clothing company and put its assets in a trust managed by family members.
Her company said licensing contracts would not be renewed and those in place will be allowed to run their course. Mid-priced women's clothing, shoes and accessories were sold under the label. The 18 people who work for the 11-year-old company will be laid off as it shuts down.
Since Trump's election, retailers including  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) and Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) have dropped or sharply scaled back their assortment of Trump-branded products, though they typically attributed those decisions to poor sales rather than political messages.
Ivanka Trump's brand said in a statement that retailers including Bloomingdale's, owned by Macy's Inc (N:M), Dillard's Inc (N:DDS) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), continued to carry her wares. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, online sales of Ivanka Trump's brand fell nearly 55 percent in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, citing Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.
Trump's combative style on the campaign trail and as president have drawn the family's brands into political fights, with some supporters hosting events at the luxury Trump International Hotel blocks from the White House even as opponents stage boycotts.
The president has been a loud advocate for domestic manufacturing, prompting criticism that much of the Ivanka Trump line was made overseas, as is the vast majority of clothing and footwear sold in the United States. According to media reports, much of her product line has been sourced from China, which is the target of tariffs imposed by the president in a trade conflict.
The most organized boycott of Trump-related businesses, ""Grab Your Wallet,"" called the news about Ivanka's business a victory.

""This is the biggest possible win for Grab Your Wallet,"" the group's co-founder, Shannon Coulter, a San Francisco marketing executive, said in a phone interview.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>","Mexico, Latam allies commit to free trade amid Trump threats","By Adriana Barrera and Anthony Esposito
PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico (Reuters) - Led by Mexico, major Latin American nations pledged to deepen commercial and economic ties on Tuesday as they sought to counter the risk of a deepening trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy.
Leaders of the Pacific Alliance and Mercosur trading blocs met in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta, seeking to present a united front against potential disruptions stemming from Trump's threats to slap new tariffs on major markets.
""The aim was to strengthen the links between the two most important trade blocs in Latin America,"" said outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has spent much of the past two years mired in trade negotiations with Trump.
""Today we're sending the world a clear signal we're moving onward with regional integration and free trade,"" he added.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said that the four countries making up the Pacific Alliance trade bloc - Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru - would work to eliminate remaining tariffs on about 8 percent of products traded in the group.
Later this week, top Mexican officials will renew talks with the Trump administration in Washington aimed at renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Mexico is heavily dependent on the United States as an export market and Trump's threats to pull out of NAFTA have rattled investors and put pressure on the peso currency.
Pena Nieto said the Pacific Alliance agreed with Mercosur - made up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay - to explore new ways of cooperation to boost trade in areas of common interest.
Trump has slapped billions of dollars worth of duties on Chinese goods and is weighing fresh steps against auto imports.
The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would pay up to $12 billion to help U.S. farmers weather the growing trade battle with China, the European Union and others, a clear signal the president is determined to stick with tariffs.
Still, Jesus Seade, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's incoming NAFTA negotiator, said on Tuesday he believed a new NAFTA deal could be reached in the next few months.
Chile's Pinera said he met with aides to Lopez Obrador, and said he was confident the next Mexican president would remain committed to free trade. 

""Mexico has always been a country committed to openness and integration and I believe that this will be maintained,"" he said.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Move to help U.S. farmers shows Trump's commitment to tariffs,"By David Shepardson and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON/KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would pay up to $12 billion to help U.S. farmers weather a growing trade battle with China, the European Union and others, a clear signal the president is determined to stick with tariffs as his weapon of choice in the conflict.
The move to cushion the blow for a politically important constituency - rural and agricultural states that supported U.S. President Donald Trump by wide margins in the election but have been targeted by China's retaliation to his trade tactics - was met with broad criticism by many farmers and farm-belt lawmakers.
Trump's trade policies have become central in several rural-state U.S. Senate races ahead of congressional elections in November, as Democrats there try to keep hold of several seats that Republicans have targeted. 
The president, speaking at an event in Kansas City on Tuesday, aggressively reaffirmed his support for tariffs and pledged that ultimately, ""farmers will be the biggest beneficiary.""
""Just be a little patient,"" Trump said.
To that end, the relief package is intended to serve as only a temporary boost to farmers as the United States and China negotiate over trade issues, officials said. 
""This obviously is a short-term solution that will give President Trump time to work on a long-term trade policy,"" said Sonny Perdue, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The aid will be financed through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation and thus will not require congressional approval, Perdue said. 
The CCC has broad authority to make loans and direct payments to U.S. growers when prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and other agricultural goods are low. 
The administration's action appeared to divide Republicans.
Kevin Cramer, a U.S. representative trying to unseat Democrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, praised the move.
""Great to see [Trump] providing aid to farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs,"" Cramer wrote on Twitter. 
But other Republicans were troubled by what they view as the kind of widespread government-assistance program their party has traditionally opposed. 
""This trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and the White House's 'plan' is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches,"" said Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who frequently criticizes the president, a fellow Republican. 
""Tariffs are taxes that punish American consumers and producers,"" Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul wrote on Twitter. ""If tariffs punish farmers, the answer is not welfare for farmers — the answer is remove the tariffs.""
Democratic Representative Jackie Speier of California, a major agricultural state, on Twitter accused Trump of trying to ""placate the farmers that voted for you"" with a $12 billion payment. 
Later this week, Trump will visit Iowa and Illinois, two other farm-belt states, as he seeks to shore up support for Republican candidates in those regions. 
SHORT-TERM BOOST?
Farmers have been a particular target in the current clash over trade policy as other countries seek to retaliate for Trump's duties on Chinese goods as well as on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Those affected economies have in turn targeted U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans, dairy, meat, produce and liquor. 
The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture products in 2017, including $21.5 billion of soybeans, the most valuable export. China alone imported $12.3 billion of U.S. soybeans last year, according to the USDA.
The size of the direct payments to farmers as a result of trade shortfalls would be unprecedented, said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. 
""We have never compensated farmers directly on such a large scale for retaliatory tariffs,"" Irwin said.
The news lifted shares of farm equipment companies on the prospect that farmers will have more money to spend on tractors and other farm gear. Deere & Co jumped 3.1 percent, while  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) gained more than 1 percent and AGCO Corp rose 0.6 percent. Soybean futures <0#S:>, hit hard by China's retaliatory tariffs, rose 1.2 percent and hit their highest in two weeks as traders bet farm aid would improve demand, reducing a current surplus supply. 
Still, Blake Hurst, a corn and soybean farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, said that unless the White House's policies change, the U.S. agriculture industry will continue to suffer. 

“The payments will be helpful to farmers facing overdue loans and angry bankers, but are completely insufficient if they mean that tariffs and the trade war will last for the foreseeable future,"" Hurst said. ""They are a very temporary bandage to a self-inflicted wound.”

548,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Canada's new export minister to push beyond U.S. market,"By Andrea Hopkins
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada has created a new Cabinet position to help exporters look beyond the United States and there will be resources for small businesses that want to take advantage of new trade deals, the new minister for export promotion said on Tuesday.
Mary Ng, who vaulted to Cabinet-level last week to take on an existing small business portfolio as well as a new one on export promotion, said she wants to help companies take advantage of new trade deals with the European Union and Pacific nations that have specific provisions to welcome small business trade.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Cabinet shuffle put trade diversification front and center amid rising tensions with the United States, Canada's largest trading partner, with Ng and new Trade Minister Jim Carr tasked with finding new markets for Canadian goods.
Threats by the Trump administration to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have shaken Canadian exporters. Canada sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States, which imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum at the end of May and is now mulling punitive measures against autos. 
Ng says Canada has other options.
""Right now Canada has preferential market access to 14 trade agreements and 51 countries. This is a real opportunity for us. The U.S. continues to be an important export market to us, but I also think there is a great opportunity to enable our small business to access these other markets as well,"" Ng said in an interview with Reuters.
Ng said both the new 11-nation Trans-Pacific trade deal and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement have chapters devoted to increasing access for small business. 
She said the new Cabinet ministry can ""provide them with resources"" to access the new markets beyond the United States, but gave no specifics on funding or programs that will drive the export diversification.
Carr said last week that ""an awful lot of affection for Canada"" will help the government's push to diversify exports away from the United States.
Still, Sean Speer, a senior fellow for fiscal policy at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a non-partisan think tank, said the integration of U.S-Canadian supply chains as well as the shared language and culture between the two countries make it hard to change the reliance on the American market.

""It's not that I'm opposed to trade diversification or the idea we should engage new markets ... I'm just skeptical of the idea it's going to lead to a fundamental re-organization of trade patterns,"" Speer said.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 03:52PM ET</span>",Scooter companies ride high on hope and hype,"By Heather Somerville and Jane Lanhee Lee
SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Segway-Ninebot Group, a Beijing-based manufacturer of electric scooters, rolled into Los Angeles this week hoping to bolster its position as the main supplier for a new wave of well-funded scooter-rental startups and offer a peek at new battery-powered transit products.
Gao Lufeng, chairman and chief executive of the firm, said the company expects to double its revenue every year for the next three to five years. Formed by the 2015 combination of China's Ninebot and U.S. transportation pioneer Segway, the company was most recently valued by private market investors at $1.5 billion and is now looking to raise $200 million from financiers, Gao told Reuters in an interview.
Gao was in Southern California for a press event trumpeting his company's new electric transportation gadgets, as Segway-Ninebot scooters become an increasingly common sight around urban areas like Los Angeles and Oakland.
But Segway-Ninebot, along with the rest of the instant industry that has popped up around scooter rentals, may have a bumpy road ahead. A host of companies are piling into the business - many spurred by euphoria around Southern California-based Bird, an app-based service for on-demand scooter rentals that is valued at $2 billion by venture capitalists less than a year after it was launched - and industry watchers wonder if it is a fad.
Investors poured $3.5 billion into scooter- and bike-rental startups globally for the first half of 2018, according to data firm CB Insights, even though basic issues such as how cities will regulate the motorized two-wheelers remain unresolved. 
U.S. city regulators are capping the number of scooter companies and scooters allowed and requiring permit fees. Regulators are also grappling with scooter infrastructure - both sidewalks and bike lanes seem inadequate - and helmet laws.
""There is an enormous amount of hype around the industry and we are still seeing how sustainable the market is and how the fundamentals will play out over time,"" said Dan Hoffer, managing director with Autotech Ventures, which invests in mobility startups, but has not yet put money in electric scooters.
BETTER THAN BIKES
The fixation with electric scooters grew out of dockless bike-sharing, where companies offer bike rentals that can be picked up and left anywhere convenient to the rider. The once-lowly scooter, now equipped with better batteries, lighter-weight materials and tracking sensors, suddenly looked like an even better urban transport option, especially for professionals in business attire.
San Francisco-based Spin, which started with bikes, says its scooters have gotten 20-times more usage, and it recoups the cost of a scooter in two to three weeks. Its hometown in June issued a temporary ban on e-scooters until companies were properly permitted, a response to complaints about the growing clutter of scooters blocking doorways, walkways and driveways. 
New competitors are still lining up. Razor, a longtime scooter-maker, is launching an app-based service this summer. Uscooter, a Los Angeles-based firm that calls itself ""the Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) of scooters,"" is rolling out an app of its own. 
Segway-Ninebot has been way out ahead in supplying Bird and Lime, another well-funded bike-and-scooter outfit. But that is breeding manufacturing rivals as the company struggles to keep up.
A spokeswoman for Lime said it can ""take longer than we expected"" to get scooters from Segway-Ninebot and Lime is ""always looking to find new suppliers."" Bird's CEO, Travis VanderZanden, has publicly lamented a scooter supply shortage.
Spin has an agreement with Segway-Ninebot for scooters that will meet demand through the end of the year, but Spin said it is looking to design and build its own scooters. Battery maker CLEVR Mobility is designing e-bikes and e-scooters to have batteries that can be swapped out, giving scooter-rental services an alternative to a workforce of contractors that collects and charges scooters nightly.
DURABILITY QUESTIONS
Complaints about Segway-Ninebot's scooter quality have also encouraged competition. Dave Kammeyer, a Silicon Valley software developer, said he bought a Segway-Ninebot scooter similar to what Bird offers after trying out a rental. 
""It's definitely not built to the standard of what I'd consider a durable vehicle,"" he said. He estimates his scooter will last for up to 300 miles (480 km) ""if I'm lucky. That said, I love riding it, and it was only $300.""  
Gao denies there is any manufacturing bottleneck and rejects criticisms about the durability of his products. But he added the company is working with Bird and Lime to improve the lifespan and quality of the scooters.
Even as new companies join the scooter business, others are retreating. Chinese bike-rental company Ofo blamed what it called heavy-handed city regulations when it announced this month it would dramatically scale back its North American business, before it had even put any electric scooters on the ground. 
""We are seeing several of these players contracting and pulling back from markets,"" said Paul Asel, managing partner at NGP Capital, which invested in Lime.
Even Segway-Ninebot is hedging its bets. The company told Reuters it is in talks with a handful of major automakers about a new design that would enable scooters to charge in the trunk of cars, encouraging more individuals to buy scooters.

It also plans to acquire artificial intelligence, battery technology and other robotics companies in an effort to build delivery robots, and on Tuesday was set to unveil a new line of e-toys - electric roller skates and go-karts.

The government released a draft proposal on Tuesday that would give firms from the European Economic Area -- the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway -- as well as non-U.K. central counterparties the temporary recognition they’d require to continue operations.
While the Bank of England has said that such firms can plan on the assumption that there will be a transition period to arrange authorizations, this instrument would provide protection in the event of a hard Brexit.
Britain’s banks and regulators have warned that trillions of dollars of contracts are at risk if the U.K. crashes out of the EU in March without a deal, leaving firms without the authorizations they need to service them. The temporary permissions outlined by the U.K. aim to “provide confidence that a back-stop will be available,” the BOE said in an emailed statement."
552,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",It's Getting Real: World Economy Feels the Bite From Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- Protectionism is slowly starting to weigh on the global economy.
From demand at factories to company profits and prices consumers are paying, the tit-for-tat trade battle U.S. President Donald Trump started with China and the European Union is starting to show up in numbers. And it’s still early days, with Trump saying Tuesday that “tariffs are the greatest,” a warning that he may not let up until he gets what he wants.
The latest signs of the fallout came in activity reports from Japan, Europe and the U.S., as well as anxious words from companies facing an additional uncertainty and having to decide between taking a hit to their profit margins or jacking up prices. Many manufacturers are also facing higher raw-material costs, another squeeze on earnings.
Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). on Tuesday cut its profit margin forecast, citing tariffs. The iconic motorcycle maker was caught in the crossfire of the trade war last month when it announced plans to shift some U.S. production overseas, prompting attacks from Trump.
Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV Chief Executive Frans van Houten says an escalation of tariffs may mean it has to pass on costs to customers, and Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR). said rising raw material costs hurt results in some of its markets in the second quarter.
For the global economy, which was enjoying its best spell in years, there’s a sense that the period of synchronized global growth is at an end. The U.S. has got a temporary shot in the arm from tax cuts, but growth is cooling in China, a number of emerging markets are dealing with a currency sell-off, and Europe has been slow to recover from a winter-battered start to the year.
According to Abby Joseph Cohen, advisory director at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), global growth will continue into 2019, but it’s moving into a slower phase. A trade war on top of that would be a further weight.
‘Very Uncomfortable’
“What is so hard to quantify is the impact not just on demand but on costs and on supply-chain disruption,” she said on Bloomberg Television. “What we have now are anecdotes more than anything but this is what we need to be watching. Clearly if there were an all-out trade war, it would be very difficult for investors to focus very directly just on the fundamentals, the geopolitical environment would be very uncomfortable.”
In the 19-nation euro area, IHS Markit’s monthly survey showed growth softened in July on weaker new orders and deteriorating confidence. Factory activity in Japan grew at the weakest pace since 2016 and, in the U.K., where Brexit is another complication, manufacturing output expectations weakened, as have investment intentions.
The Markit reports come just days after central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies said that trade tensions are threatening global growth, echoing multiple warnings from around the world.
In China, concern has reached such a level that authorities on Monday unveiled a package of policies to boost domestic demand to cushion the economy from the fallout from the trade dispute.
The euro-area composite Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing and services fell to 54.3 from 54.9 in June, a sharper drop than economists had forecast. A measure of expectations fell to a 20-month low.
“Given the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit. For manufacturers, the survey saw trade worries “intensify markedly,” he said.
The pressure on the economy may only be beginning, and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is traveling to Washington this week in an effort to ease tensions. He won’t come unarmed. The EU has vowed to retaliate against any import duties, and China has also said it will match American sanctions on its exports.
In the U.S., the PMI report showed continued growth in private-sector activity, but a second straight drop in goods export orders. There was also a record surge in prices charged and more supply-chain delays.
“Trade frictions have clearly become a major cause of concern, especially among manufacturers,” Williamson said. “Firms have become increasingly worried about the impact of tariff and trade wars on demand, prices and supply chains.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union formally filed for divorce at the World Trade Organization on Tuesday, following many months of diplomatic preparations to smooth the way for the historic move.
The WTO circulated two confidential draft membership agreements among the Geneva trade club's 164 members, separating Britain's rights and obligations in merchandise trade from the EU's for the first time in the WTO's 23-year history. A separate split of services trade is expected to follow.
""It seeks to replicate the concessions and commitments applicable to the UK as part of the EU today. An important milestone as we prepare for our departure from the EU,"" British Ambassador Julian Braithwaite wrote in a tweet.
Britain's draft document, officially known as its ""schedule"", is 719 pages long.
""WTO members will have three months to review the schedule, which will be considered to be approved if there are no objections from other members,"" the WTO said in a statement. 
Until now the EU has represented Britain at the WTO, and Britain's membership rights were not set out distinctly, even though Britain was always a WTO member in its own right. Its June 2016 decision to leave the EU meant disentangling their trade rules to allow Britain to act independently.
Britain's government says that only minimal changes will be needed in the text and it does not expect any difficulties, apart from potentially in agriculture.
Seven agricultural suppliers - including the United States, Canada and Australia - have already said they disapprove of the terms of the divorce, since they will lose flexibility to switch exports between Britain and the rest of the EU.
Their objections are likely to force Britain into a wider negotiation, said David Henig, a former British trade official who now leads the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE).
""As the UK's first serious trade negotiation in years, many will be watching to see how the UK government performs in negotiating at the WTO, and how they handle the debate domestically,"" he wrote in a report.
""At this stage we see a stuttering start, but this could ironically be the opportunity needed to get on the right track and set a positive path for our future trade policy."" 

Britain has been laying the groundwork for this step for more than a year, and it sent an informal proposal in October, followed by a proposal for services trade in February.

Trump's goal to achieve better trade deals and a better deal for Americans was a good one, but ""I think tariffs are taxes and I think there are better tools that we can use,"" Ryan told reporters.
Trump said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that ""Tariffs are the greatest!"" because they force countries to negotiate fair trade deals or pay.

In a speech to a veterans group in Kansas City, Missouri, later on Tuesday, Trump urged those concerned about his tariff policies to ""just be a little patient.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada ought to be concluded in the next few months, a top adviser in the incoming Mexican administration said on Tuesday.
Jesus Seade, the designated NAFTA negotiator of president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said while some contentious issues still had to be resolved, he believed it was almost ""inevitable"" a deal would be reached.
""What I see ... to be a very feasible expectation is that we'll be concluding the negotiation in the next two months if possible, or in the next few months a bit further down the road,"" Seade told Mexican radio.
Seade and Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo will later this week travel to Washington to revive NAFTA talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
Negotiations to reshape the 1994 trade accord were launched last August at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump, who blames NAFTA for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, and argues the deal has caused jobs to move south of the border.
The talks had moved slowly and stalled in the run-up to the July 1 presidential election in Mexico, which yielded a landslide victory for veteran leftist Lopez Obrador.
The three countries have been at odds over U.S. demands to impose tougher content rules for the auto industry, as well as other contentious U.S. proposals, including one that would kill NAFTA after five years if it is not renegotiated.
Seade, a former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, said he had a ""very good relationship"" with Lighthizer, referring to him as a ""friend"" he had known for years, which should help them find common ground.
The positive comments come after Trump spoke warmly of Lopez Obrador on Monday, saying he expected to get ""something worked out"" on NAFTA.
Seade said Mexico was paying close attention to Trump.
""President Trump has a very personal style. He likes to appear chaotic. But the last thing he is is chaotic,"" he said. ""I think he's a very intelligent man.""
Trump has also talked about pursuing a bilateral trade deal with Mexico, but Seade said he believed this was a negotiating tactic and would not come to pass.

""It would cause a lot of legislative commotion, a horrific debate for a year, which would cost him a lot politically,"" Seade said. ""I don't think it's going to happen.""

PRETORIA (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping promised $14.7 billion of investment on Tuesday during a state visit to South Africa, where President Cyril Ramaphosa is on a mission to kick-start economic growth after a decade of stagnation.
The rand  firmed more than one percent after Ramaphosa announced China's investment pledge, which takes the amount overseas economies have committed to invest in South Africa to $35 billion since the start of the month.
Those commitments will help ease worries about the health of the South African economy, which has performed poorly despite investor optimism when Ramaphosa replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma in February.
""We have agreed that we must work as partners to improve the lives of our peoples by elevating our business, commercial and trade ties,"" Ramaphosa told a joint news conference with Xi.
Xi said China would take ""active measures"" to expand imports from Africa's most industrialized economy.
Ramaphosa will host Xi and the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India at a summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies in Johannesburg later this week, where he will be looking to secure further investment pledges.
Among agreements signed on Tuesday, Chinese banks lent a combined $2.8 billion to struggling South African state power utility Eskom and logistics company Transnet.
Ramaphosa has focused on revitalizing Eskom, which received an injection of $2.5 billion from China Development Bank and reported a $171 million full-year loss on Monday.
Transnet, one of a handful of state firms accused of irregularities in the awarding of state contracts under former President Jacob Zuma, received $300 million from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398). Zuma denies wrongdoing.
South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said other investments planned by China included an expansion of electronics firm Hisense's local operations (SS:600060) and a metallurgical complex in Limpopo province.
""We are looking to promote investment-led trade,"" Davies said. ""The same is what we are looking for from our BRICS partners. More investment and less outright pushing of products into a market.""

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Threat from Trump trade wars gives fresh purpose to BRICS bloc,"By Joe Bavier
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - As Donald Trump's tariff salvos threaten global trade wars, leaders from the BRICS bloc - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are expected to band together in defense of the multilateralism the United States once championed.
The heads of the major emerging nations meet in Johannesburg from Wednesday for their first summit since Trump's administration launched a push to rebalance trade relationships that the U.S. President has deemed unfair. 
From threatening to tear up existing trade deals to hiking steel and aluminum tariffs, the U.S. move toward unilateral action has rattled traditional allies and rivals alike. And BRICS nations have been on the frontline of the global tensions. 
Last week Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from rival economic superpower China. But even South Africa - a tiny exporter of steel, aluminum and automobiles to the United States - is facing barriers.
""If you don't have an agreed rules-based trade system then it's a matter of power. And unilateralism is not something you want to contemplate,"" Rob Davies, trade minister of the bloc's current chair, South Africa, told Reuters.
BRICS' dominant member China has stressed the need to fight protectionism and promote multilateral global trade.
""We are against unilateralism - we are in favor of free trade,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this month in response to Trump's trade moves.
From its origin as an acronym coined in 2001 by then-Goldman Sachs chairman Jim O'Neill, BRICS has struggled to take shape as a body voicing cohesive positions on politics and forging deeper trade ties.
Its collective gross domestic product grew more than six-fold from $2.7 trillion in 2000 to over $17 trillion last year, eclipsing that of the European Union. 
However, the value of trade between its members has actually fallen nearly 9 percent to $312 billion over the past five years, according to Johannesburg-based Standard Bank. 
Analysts say global trade turmoil could give the group a shot in the arm.
""BRICS knew what they weren't - i.e. Western - without quite knowing what they were,"" said Martyn Davies, Deloitte Managing Director for emerging markets and Africa. ""Now with the Trump administration, suddenly there's an emerging common interest, ironically around trade."" 
""SPECIAL TIMES""
Though they will not condemn the United States, BRICS leaders will staunchly defend multilateralism and organizations including the World Trade Organisation, according to a diplomat involved in drafting the summit's final statement.
""The language of the statement will not be standard language because we live in special times,"" the diplomat said.
A push to foster trade flows between BRICS member states is also expected, officials and analysts said.
Those efforts include bolstering the New Development Bank (NDB), the grouping's financial institution. 
Russia said this month it was in talks with the bank about borrowing more than $1 billion. On Monday, it approved loans totaling $600 million for energy and transportation projects in South Africa and China.
The NDB is expected to lend $4 billion to BRICS members this year. And South African deputy foreign minister Luwellyn Landers said this week the bank would begin lending to non-members, giving BRICS more clout as representative of the ""global South"".
South Africa has invited the leaders of 22 additional countries to participate in this week's summit, including 19 from Africa.
""There is a pretty big space for the BRICS nations to work together ... to create economic heft and ease the negative impacts of unilateralism and trade protectionism,"" said Mei Guanqun of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a state-backed think-tank.
As the member hardest-hit by Trump's trade moves, China is looking to diversify its trade ties to mitigate fallout. 
Some analysts say agreeing preferential trade policies between BRICS members is a logical next step. But that may prove to be a bridge too far, at least for now. 
Beijing already dominates BRICS and is involved in 80 percent of trade within the bloc. Opening the door to more and cheaper Chinese imports could be seen as too great a risk for the group's smaller, less industrialized members.

""All those who are affected by lesser access into the U.S. market are likely to want to diversify their exports and just push everything into everybody else's backyard,"" said South Africa's Davies. ""I don't think that would be desirable.""

559,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 10:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: North Korean fuel prices drop, suggesting U.N. sanctions being undermined","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Gasoline prices in North Korea have nearly halved since late March, market data analyzed by Reuters shows, adding weight to suspicions that fuel is finding its way into the isolated economy from China and elsewhere despite U.N. sanctions.
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in December to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. 
But as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has moved to improve relations with the United States, China and South Korea, concerns have grown that the policy of ""maximum pressure"" through sanctions and isolation, is losing steam.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to work toward denuclearization at their summit in Singapore on June 12. Experts say any fuel aid in breach of sanctions could erode the diplomatic progress.
China said on Tuesday it strictly abided by U.N. sanctions, but indicated it may have resumed some fuel shipments to North Korea in the second quarter of this year.
Gasoline was sold by private dealers in the North Korean capital Pyongyang at about $1.24 per kg as of Tuesday, down 33 percent from $1.86 per kg on June 5 and 44 percent from this year's peak of $2.22 per kg on March 27, according to Reuters analysis of data compiled by the Daily NK website. Diesel prices are at $0.85 per kg, down about 17 percent from March.
The website is run by North Korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with multiple traders in the North after cross-checks to corroborate their information, offering a rare glimpse into the livelihoods of ordinary North Koreans.
In North Korea, gas is sold via informal channels such as street stalls and informal markets and by weight rather than by volume, as it is in South Korea, the United States and elsewhere, so North Koreans prefer to quote ""per kg"" rates, said Kang Mi-jin, who works at Daily NK. A 200 liter barrel of petrol holds around 180 kg.
U.S. prices stand at around 75 cents per liter or $2.839 per gallon.
""My assessment is that there was a greater inflow (of fuel supplies) from abroad, especially China since Kim's trips there,"" said Kang, who speaks regularly to sources inside North Korea.
Kim first visited China to meet President Xi Jinping in March, and they held two more summits, in May and June.
SANCTIONS
The latest fuel data comes amid mounting suspicion in Washington that North Korea may be using the recent diplomatic thaw to get a lifeline from China. 
North Korea gets most of its fuel from China, its biggest trading partner, and some from Russia. Washington and Seoul officials have said the North imports some 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products and 2 million barrels of crude oil each year. 
Last year's U.N. resolution capped refined imports at 500,000 barrels a year.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Tuesday that China has consistently and strictly abided by U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea. 
China had exported 7,432 tonnes of refined oil products to North Korea in the first six months of this year, out of a total of 60,000 tonnes a year stipulated by the U.N. sanctions.
China had reported its exports to the Security Council's sanctions committee in a timely manner, Geng added.
""The relevant situation is totally open and transparent,"" he said, without elaborating.
Since official Chinese customs data showed no gasoline and diesel exports to North Korea from January to March, Geng's comments suggested China resumed some shipments some time after Kim and Xi's first meeting.
Overall, China's trade with North Korea in the first half of this year tumbled 56 percent on the back of the tightening sanctions, customs data showed on Monday.
Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused North Korea of ""illegally smuggling petroleum products into the country at a level that far exceeds quotas"" established by the UN.
""Illegal ship-to-ship transfers are the most prominent means by which this is happening. Every UN member state must step up enforcement,"" he wrote on Twitter, without naming any country.
China and Russia delayed a U.S. push last week for a UN Security Council panel to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a U.S. accusation that Pyongyang breached sanctions, diplomats said.
The United States provided a list to the committee earlier this month of 89 illicit North Korean transactions and a few select photos, seen by Reuters.
Seoul's foreign ministry said last week that the authorities were investigating two ships with Panama and Sierra Leone flags suspected to have illegally transferred North Korean coal into South Korea via Russia. 
NO MAJOR SUFFERING
North Korean rice prices have also been stable since a spike last September, when the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions. Rice has hovered around $0.62 per kg throughout this year. 
Stable fuel and rice prices suggest no immediate signs of major suffering in North Korea despite South Korea's recent estimates the impoverished state's economy contracted at its sharpest rate in two decades last year. 
South Korea's central bank said North Korea's gross domestic product shrank 3.5 percent last year, marking the biggest decline since 1997, citing international sanctions and drought.
While other defectors reported some suffering in remote rural regions, Daily NK's Kang said fuel demand has been steady in North Korea, and overall living conditions have improved in line with a booming unofficial market economy. 
The unofficial markets, known as jangmadang, have grown to account for about 60 percent of the economy, according to the Institute for Korean Integration of Society.
""I've seen signs the economy was slowly improving over the past five years, and in last year things are still developing but perhaps not as fast as before,"" a Western consultant who makes regular trips to North Korea told Reuters. 
Kim, who vowed not to let the people ""tighten their belt again"" in his first-ever public speech in 2012, announced in April a shift in focus from nuclear programs to the economy. Analysts say that will be difficult while sanctions remain in place.

""I don't think there is an outcry in the markets now, but there could be one toward the end of this year,"" said Kim Byeong-yeon, a North Korea economy specialist at the Seoul National University.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government agreed on Tuesday to delay a reform of small banks, slowing an overhaul planned by the former center-left government and backed by the European Central Bank.
The reform of cooperative (BCC) and mutual banks is aimed at forcing mergers among small lenders in a bid to strengthen Italy's financial stability.
But the overhaul will take longer than initially planned and will give more powers to small banks within merged entities under the measures adopted by Italy's anti-establishment executive. 
""We reformed the reform,"" Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a news conference. He said banks were given more time to adapt to the new rules. 
The delay is the result of a compromise within the government coalition. The far-right League wanted to freeze the reform indefinitely, while other members of the executive, led by Italy's Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, argued for a two-month delay. 
Eventually, cooperative banks (BCCs) will get three additional months to meet a deadline to agree on merging with other banks. The deadline would be doubled to 180 days from the 90 days initially foreseen in the overhaul proposed by the previous government.
The extended period to comply with the new rules will kick off after supervisors authorize the new holdings under which nearly 300 BCCs will merge. 
Two Italian mutual banks will also have to turn into joint stocks companies by October 31 to become more solid, a government official said, in a measure that postpones a deadline that has already expired in May. 

The government also gave back some powers to smaller banks within the larger merged entities in an attempt to protect their local operations and purpose, Tria told reporters.

The IMF, in its annual External Sector Report, which assesses exchange rates and current account surpluses and deficits, also said current account surpluses and deficits are becoming increasingly concentrated in advanced economies.
The report was based on data and IMF staff projections as of June 22.
However, China's yuan has dropped significantly in recent weeks as trade tensions with the United States have intensified.
China's yuan hit a fresh 13-month low on Tuesday of 6.8295 to the dollar as authorities in Beijing signaled further monetary loosening to support the economy amid an escalating tariff war with the United States.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters exclusively on Friday that he was concerned about the yuan's fall and the Treasury is ""going to very carefully review whether they have manipulated the currency."".
The IMF said its staff estimated China's current account surplus grew slightly last year to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product and listed China among countries with excessive balances. Other excessive surplus countries cited by the IMF included Germany, South Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore.
Countries that it cited as having excessive current account deficits -- those that borrow too much -- included the United States, Britain, Turkey and Argentina.
The report said IMF staff assessed the U.S. dollar again to be over-valued compared to levels implied by medium-term fundamentals, by about 8 percent to 16 percent last year.

U.S. President Donald Trump has broken with protocol in recent days and complained that Federal Reserve interest rate hikes were causing the dollar's value to rise and to erode the U.S. ""competitive edge"" in exports.

Trump’s tweet Tuesday comes as he’s scheduled to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington for talks aimed at heading off a trade war, and as he continues to deal with domestic fallout from his deference to Vladimir Putin last week over Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
""Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs,” Trump said in a Twitter posting. “It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember, we are the ‘piggy bank’ that’s being robbed. All will be Great!""
July 24, 2018
Trump has been critical of the EU over its $150 billion trade surplus with the U.S. But Europe is only one front in Trump’s attacks on trading partners. Earlier this month, the president imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with similar penalties on an additional $16 billion worth of products expected to go into effect shortly and he’s threatened levies on an additional $200 billion of Chinese products in the next month.
Beijing responded to Trump’s first wave by matching duties on a similar amount of U.S. imports and has threatened to retaliate against any further U.S. tariffs.
The Trump administration has also looked to protect specific industries with new tariffs, including a round of levies on imported metals. The 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum impact not only China, but traditional U.S. allies like the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. The president is also weighing additional tariffs on domestic autos and automobile parts, a topic expected to be discussed at length when he meets Juncker on Wednesday.
U.S. companies and industry groups are finding it increasingly difficult to escape the impact of Trump’s tariffs. More than 80 witnesses are scheduled to testify during a two-day trade hearing starting in Washington Tuesday focused on products from resins and chemicals to large freight containers, electric bicycles and vaping devices. Most of the companies and business groups that have filed comments are seeking to have goods spared from duties on grounds the tariffs are ultimately a tax on consumers and hamstrings them with their global supply chains.
On a separate trade issue, Trump on Monday said he’s heading toward a “dramatic” deal with Mexico, without giving more details. Mexico is redoubling its efforts to reach a Nafta agreement with the U.S. and Canada by the end of August, according to three people familiar with the negotiations.
Trump has been seething over criticism of his Helsinki summit last week with Russia’s Putin and public doubts Trump expressed about U.S. intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election. He has been lashing out at a variety of foes, whether political or economic, and his press secretary said Monday he is considering revoking the security clearances of former FBI Director James Comey, ex-CIA Director John Brennan and other Obama-era national security officials who have criticized him.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit will cost Britain up to 12,000 financial services jobs in the short-term, the City of London financial district's leader said on Tuesday, and many more jobs might disappear in the longer term.
At the lower end of the scale, 3,500 jobs could be lost to EU states, Catherine McGuinness told parliament's Exiting the European Union Committee. More than 2 million people work in financial services across Britain, with 396,000 in London.
""We are not expecting a big Brexodus in the first instance. But depending on how things pan out ... in the longer term, we may see many more go,"" McGuinness told lawmakers.
Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain are opening hubs in the EU before Britain's departure from the EU in March to ensure continuity in services to customers there.
So far, there have been 1,600 confirmed job moves, a City of London spokeswoman said separately.
The City was disappointed that Britain's government ditched its preferred option of future EU trade based on mutual recognition, whereby Britain and the EU accept each other's rules under two-way regulatory cooperation.
""We had expected continued support for mutual recognition,"" McGuinness said.
Instead, Britain has asked for financial-services access based on a more accommodative version of the EU's equivalence system, used by Japan and the United States, whereby Brussels alone decides who gets access.
The EU had already dismissed mutual recognition and has said it won't adapt its equivalence system in the way Britain wants.
""We can all see it's going to be an uphill task to persuade the EU27,"" McGuinness said.
Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said that opting for some form of equivalence posed a risk that Britain would end up becoming a ""rule taker"" - having to continue copying EU rules in return for access after Brexit.
""You are asking the EU to partner with you in a way to make equivalence work in future. Equivalence... is something the EU considers proprietary,"" Evans said. ""It's quite a big psychological ask.""
There was plenty of opportunity for ""mischief making"" by EU states topping up equivalence with national rules, Evans said.
THROWN UNDER A BUS
The lawmakers also quizzed the broadcasting and tech sectors about Britain's ""White Paper"" proposals for future EU trade, which calls for full access for goods, but less access for services in return for flexibility to diverge from EU rules.
Sammy Wilson, a committee member, accused the industry officials of giving ""alarmist evidence"", adding that foreign direct investment in financial services was around a 10-year high.
""You are now trying to do an Airbus on us with the kind of evidence you have been giving,"" Wilson said, referring to Brexit warnings from the European aircraft manufacturer that angered some government ministers.
""There is no getting away that Brexit is deeply suboptimal,"" Evans replied.
""This isn't a scare story,"" added McGuinness.
The government also ditched mutual recognition for broadcasters from its White Paper but, unlike with banks, proposed no alternative, Adam Minns, executive director of Commercial Broadcasters Association, told lawmakers.
""The White Paper for us was a backward step. We are not certain if we are being thrown under a bus or just hitting a temporary roadblock. This could not have come at a worst time,"" Minns said.
Britain is home to 1,200 international TV channels that beam programmes to viewers in the European Union, but without an EU licence they would have to relocate, Minns said.
Giles Derrington, head of Brexit policy at techUK, said the sector wanted the same trade-off as proposed for goods, meaning EU rules in return for EU access, but without flexibility to diverge.
The tech sector struggles to see where the benefits of diverging from EU rules would come from, Derrington said.
Lawmakers asked whether the industry officials if they would like Britain to join Norway in the European Economic Area, whose members must follow EU rules but without any say over them.

""I look at the EEA longingly. We don't desire more flexibility at the moment,"" Minns said.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Israeli rate outlook clouded by uncertainty over next central bank chief,"By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli central bank governor Karnit Flug's decision to step down in November has added to doubts in local financial markets over whether the bank's heavily dovish policy committee will raise interest rates by the end of 2018.
Even before Flug said she would not serve a second term, after numerous public battles with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, markets had been unsure about the bank's forecast for a 15 basis-point rate rise in the fourth quarter, given low inflation.
Her departure makes the picture murkier still, as markets have no idea who will replace her - and they have already expressed a preference against a couple of mooted candidates.
""There is uncertainty and worry in the market. We don't know who the next governor will be and whether there will be a carryover of (Flug's) stable and dovish approach or will there be someone with different ideas,"" Bank Leumi Chief Economist Gil Bufman said.
""The closer we get to the date and there is no name out there and no clarity, we will see market jitters.""
Flug took the reins in November 2013 after Stanley Fischer stepped down, and she largely stuck to his policies.
The MPC has left the benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent since early 2015, opting not to venture into negative rates, with economic growth moderate and the annual inflation rate below the government's 1-3 percent target for much of that period.
The 6-member MPC meets again on Aug. 29, Oct. 8 and Nov. 26 - its last gathering of the year. The early October meeting will likely be Flug's last.
INFLATION CONUNDRUM 
While the Bank of Israel's own staff this month reiterated a projection for a small hike by year-end and another quarter-point move in 2019, market players are less certain since the bank says it wants to see inflation ""entrenched"" in the target range.
Although the annual inflation rate reached 1.3 percent in June, that was the first time it has topped 1 percent since 2014.
Minutes of the July 9 meeting showed the MPC remained cautious over the pace of inflation gains, saying a premature hike could delay the entrenchment and slow the path of hikes.
Underscoring the market's doubts, the one-year bond yield stands at 0.2 percent, while the two-year is at 0.4 percent.
Some in the market believe inflation is on the rise and the bank will raise its main rate to 1 percent by the end of 2019.
Others expect a slower rate process that will not start until next year, partly to give the shekel time to weaken. A rate hike soon, they believe, would boost the currency and harm exports.
Some are also wondering whether Flug would opt to start the rate-hike process at her last meeting or leave it to her successor or to deputy governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg if she becomes interim chief.
""Will Nadine be willing to raise rates?"" said Jonathan Katz, chief economist at Leader Capital Markets.
NEW GOVERNOR
Flug said on July 6 she would not seek a second term, although the writing had been on the wall since March, when finance minister Kahlon -- unhappy with central bank criticism over his housing and tax policies -- said he planned to start looking for a new governor.
While it is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who appoints the central bank chief, Kahlon's spokesman said: ""They are pretty coordinated on this, but they still have not decided on a name.""
One market wish is that the position goes to a professional economist - and not to Accountant General Rony Hizkiyahu or his predecessor Michal Abadi-Boiangiu, who are also said to be candidates. 
""I hope it won't be a public officer or a political nomination,"" said Rami Dror, chief executive of investment house Halman Aldubui. He said the right person must be an independent thinker who is able to confront politicians.

Other names have been rumored, although two of them -- Eugene Kandel and Zvi Eckstein -- have said they are not interested, while former governor Jacob Frenkel, a Netanyahu favorite who was forced out of the running in 2013, said he likes his current job as chairman of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) International.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - To gain an investment edge in China, BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, will map the country's economic landscape using satellites, parse social media to take the market's pulse and track reports in the ruling Communist Party's newspaper, the People's Daily.
The innovative measures, described in internal training materials seen by Reuters, take tailor-made investment analysis to a new level in China, where the firm is raising money for its China A-Share Opportunities Private Fund 1 amid growing competition.
Since Fidelity International in early 2017 became the first global asset manager to launch onshore funds in China, an increasing number of foreign money managers have won approval to launch products locally.
Earlier this month, global hedge fund managers Bridgewater Associates LP and Winton Group got the regulatory green light to launch private fund products in China, a market crowded with nearly 9,000 local competitors.
BlackRock's China fund will use 'big data' and machine learning - a type of computer artificial intelligence - to analyse fundamentals, market sentiment and macroeconomic policies, according to materials distributed to salespeople.
The firm said it had registered its first China equity fund last month, but declined to provide details of its investment strategy when asked by Reuters.
While the data-scraping techniques BlackRock will deploy are increasingly prevalent in more mature markets, use of such technology to drive investment decisions is less popular in China.
Some Chinese hedge fund managers questioned the likely effectiveness of such a strategy.
""Weather it's People's Daily articles, or satellite images, or social media postings, I don't think the data is big enough to generate profitable trading,"" said Huang Can, a Shenzhen-based hedge fund manager who uses machine learning in high-frequency trading.
Xu Xiaoqing, managing director of Shanghai-based hedge fund house Preston Asset Management Co, said foreign investors needed to adapt to succeed.
""Foreign asset managers are not necessarily stronger than local players in terms of research and trading capabilities,"" Xu said.
In a bid to capture opportunities driven by fundamentals, BlackRock said it would use satellite imagery to monitor industrial activity to better predict stock performance.
It would analyze Internet and blog postings to gauge the mood in a market where retail investors account for 80 percent of trading volume, it said.

And to try to sense policy shifts, which can affect markets, BlackRock said it would pore over the People's Daily, the main newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.

567,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 05:41AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Tuesday: Google, Harley, AT&T","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, July 24:
1. Alphabet On Track To Open At Record High After Blowout Earnings
Alphabet shares are on track to open at a record high this morning, after second-quarter earnings smashed expectations, allaying fears about an immediate impact from Europe’s new privacy rules.
The Google parent company reported $3.2 billion in net income for the quarter after Monday's closing bell, which works out to $4.54 a share, after accounting for a record antitrust fine out of Europe related to its Android phone software.
Without the fine, Alphabet would have reported earnings of $11.75 a share, the company said, well higher than analysts’ average estimate of $9.66 a share.
Alphabet reported revenue of $26.24 billion after accounting for traffic-acquisition costs, higher than the average analyst estimate of $25.58 billion.
Meanwhile, its ""other revenues"" category, which includes its cloud business and hardware sales and is especially important to investors looking for Google's future beyond ads, hit $4.4 billion, or a 36.5% increase year-over-year.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock jumped 3.7% in premarket trade to an all-time high of $1,249.80.
2. Harley, Verizon, AT&T Highlight Busy Day Of Earnings 
The busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season continues today, when 24 members of the S&P 500 report results.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), Verizon (NYSE:VZ),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) are set to report ahead of the opening bell.
Harley's earnings will be closely watched for any additional commentary on the company’s decision last month to move some of its motorcycle manufacturing overseas as a result of tariffs imposed by the EU.
After the close, AT&T (NYSE:T), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) are the big names on the docket.
AT&T’s earnings will pique the interest of those looking for updates on its merger with Time Warner, which was approved by regulators in June but quickly appealed by the Justice Department.
3. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Higher Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open, as investors looked ahead to another wave of corporate earnings.
At 5:40AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 95 points, or roughly 0.4%, the S&P 500 futures tacked on 6 points, or about 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 13 points, or around 0.2%.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses were higher, as gains for UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) and other banks helped push the market toward its first advance in four sessions.
Earlier, Shanghai shares led Asia higher, after China's cabinet said it would pursue a more vigorous fiscal policy and as traders bet on further easing in monetary conditions.
Shanghai blue chips rose 1.6% to a one-month high, government bond yields jumped, and the offshore yuan hit a one-year low.
4. Dollar Holds Steady, 10-Year Yield Slips To 2.95%
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar was little changed, amid expectations the Federal Reserve would persist with its rate hikes this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was steady at 94.39.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield dipping to around 2.95%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near 2.63%.
Demand for the greenback remained underpinned despite criticism from President Donald Trump about the impact of the strength of the dollar and Federal Reserve rate hikes on the economy.
On the data front, reports on home prices from the FHFA, manufacturing activity in July from Markit Economics, and the Richmond Fed’s latest manufacturing index will be released.
5. Bitcoin Hits $8,000 Again 
Bitcoin prices continued higher, climbing back above the $8,000-level for the first time since mid-May, amid a raft of positive regulatory news around the world.
Prices of the world's biggest digital currency were last up around 3.6%, or $286, at $8,000.30 on the Bitfinex exchange, a level last seen on May 22.
Meanwhile, Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was up 1.7% at $471.32.
Elsewhere, Ripple's XRP token was trading at $0.45393, little changed for the day.

PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke warmly of Mexico's incoming leftist president on Monday, saying he expected to get ""something worked out"" on NAFTA, while a top Mexican official said there was scope to revive the trade talks this week. 
""We're talking to Mexico on NAFTA, and I think we're going to have something worked out. The new president, terrific person,"" Trump said in a speech at the White House about American manufacturing. 
""We're talking to them about doing something very dramatic, very positive for both countries, he said, without giving more details.
Talks to reshape the 1994 trade accord have been underway since last August. But they stalled in the run-up to the July 1 presidential election in Mexico, which produced a landslide victory for veteran leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
The United States, Mexico and Canada have been at odds over U.S. demands to impose tougher content rules for the auto industry, as well as several other proposals, including one that would kill NAFTA after five years if it is not renegotiated.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, who last week expressed hope an agreement in principle on NAFTA could be reached by the end of August, is due to hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer at the end of the week in Washington. 
He will be accompanied by Jesus Seade, the designated chief NAFTA negotiator of the incoming Mexican administration.
""There's clearly a window of opportunity to be able to bed down a series of open issues which are not numerous, but are very complex,"" Guajardo said on the sidelines of a summit of the Pacific Alliance trade bloc in the western coastal city of Puerto Vallarta.
Guajardo is due to meet his Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland on Wednesday, also to discuss NAFTA.
After the election, top officials from both the outgoing and new Mexican governments met in Mexico City with senior Trump administration officials led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Seade said the visit had sent out ""excellent"" signals.
""We hope these signals translate into a willingness to move forward,"" Seade told reporters in Puerto Vallarta.
The talks have been clouded by tit-for-tat measures over trade after the Trump administration slapped tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports.
The United States is also exploring the possibility of imposing tariffs on auto imports, though Guajardo said it was too early to speculate on how that would play out.
Mexico's foreign ministry said on Monday that South Korea had initiated the process of seeking associate membership in the Pacific Alliance, which comprises Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru and is seeking to deepen free trade.
Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Canada were last year admitted as associate members by the alliance. For Mexico, the expansion is part of a push to diversify its trading partners in the wake of Trump's previous threats to pull out of NAFTA.
Guajardo indicated that despite his optimism about reaching a deal, risks still exist. 

""The biggest risk is that instead of moving forward with an agenda of opening and integration, we move backwards, closing our economy and really undoing what we've built in the last two and a half decades,"" Guajardo said.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 04:42AM ET</span>","Global airfares, hotel rates to rise in 2019: industry forecast","By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A strong global economy and rising oil prices are expected to push up the cost of air travel in 2019, with fares seen rising 2.6 percent and hotel rates up 3.7 percent, although there are downside risks from a trade war, according to an industry forecast.
In some countries, including India, New Zealand, Norway, Germany and Chile, airfares are expected to rise by more than 7 percent, said the annual business travel forecast from Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT) and the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) released on Tuesday.
""Speaking for the Asia-Pacific region, we are coming off a period three to four years ago where there was a lot of capacity in the system (and) fares were down pretty significantly, potentially lower than was sustainable,"" said Michael Valkevich, CWT's vice president for global sales & program management, Asia Pacific.
""So I think we are getting to a bit more of a renormalization of sustainable fares.""
The International Air Transport Association in June forecast passenger yields, a proxy for airfares, would rise by 3.2 percent this year in the first increase since 2011 as a stronger global economy drives growth in demand. CWT/GBTA predicted a 3.5 percent rise in airfares in 2018 in a forecast released last year.
Airline costs, including for fuel and labor, have been rising, leading carriers to attempt to push up fares or add fuel surcharges to maintain margins.
The CWT/GBTA 2019 forecast said the rise in hotel rates would be driven by an increased demand for air travel, which would fuel demand for rooms. Room rates are expected to rise by more than 5 percent in Asia and Europe, by 2.1 percent in North America and to fall by 1.3 percent in Latin America.
Hotel groups including France's  Accor  SA (PA:ACCP) and U.S.-based Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) have reported strong growth in revenue per available room in Asia and Europe this year.
The CWT/GBTA forecast said despite its positive outlook, risks remained for the global economy in 2019 from the rise of protectionist policies, the stoking of trade wars and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union.

Valkevich said the U.S.-China trade war had not yet led to any noticeable drop in demand for business travel, but it was a ""downside risk factor"" for the corporate travel industry.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Rising oil revenues lift outlook for Gulf finances but not growth,"By Andrew Torchia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Rising oil revenues are greatly improving the outlook for budget and trade balances among Gulf Arab countries but will do very little to boost economic growth, a quarterly Reuters poll of economists showed.
The benchmark Brent oil price (LCOc1) has averaged about $71.60 a barrel so far this year, up from $55 last year. Also, Gulf states are set to export more oil this year after global producers agreed last month to boost output, partly to compensate for anticipated losses in production by Iran, which faces U.S. sanctions.
That is a boon for state finances and external surpluses across the region, especially in Saudi Arabia, the top exporter. Saudi investment bank Jadwa forecasts Riyadh's oil revenues at $154 billion this year, instead of the $131 billion which the government budgeted last December.
In the poll of 24 economists, the median prediction for Riyadh's state budget deficit this year was 4.8 percent of gross domestic product, instead of the 7.8 percent they forecast in the last poll.
A 4.8 percent deficit, while still unsustainable for Saudi Arabia in the long run, would be the smallest since 2014, when an oil price plunge began to pressure Riyadh's finances. The latest poll predicts next year's deficit at 4.5 percent of GDP, instead of 6.7 percent previously forecast.
Fiscal forecasts for the other five Gulf Cooperation Council states have also improved. The United Arab Emirates is now seen enjoying a state budget surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP this year instead of a 2.9 percent deficit; the forecast for 2019 has switched to a 1.4 percent surplus from a 2.2 percent deficit.
Similarly, current account surpluses for the four strongest GCC economies - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar - are expected to swell.
Saudi Arabia is now seen running a surplus of 8.7 percent of GDP this year, up from the previous poll's 3.3 percent - although it would remain smaller than the double-digit figures recorded before the oil price plunge. 
However, the improvements look likely to have little impact in raising modest economic growth in the Gulf, the latest poll showed.
Private sectors are still struggling with government austerity steps such as tax rises and spending curbs, and because governments are expected to use much of their windfall oil revenues to cut deficits rather than stimulate growth.
""Higher-than-budgeted oil revenue will not result in higher government expenditure, but rather, it will contribute to lowering the fiscal deficit,"" Jadwa said about Saudi Arabia.
The latest poll raises the median forecast for Saudi GDP growth this year to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent, and to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent for next year. Jadwa expects Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector to expand just 1.1 percent this year.
Growth forecasts for the UAE are unchanged from the previous poll at 2.6 percent this year and 3.2 percent next.
The latest poll continues to predict sizeable budget and current account deficits for the two weakest GCC economies, Bahrain and Oman, suggesting financial markets may remain concerned about their long-term outlooks unless governments make further reforms.
Bahrain is now expected to run a budget deficit of 8.8 percent of GDP this year instead of the 9.8 percent previously forecast, and 7.6 percent next year. Its current account is expected to stay in deficit through 2020.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>","Euro zone banks see rising loan demand, easing credit standards: ECB","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone banks expect demand for corporate and household loans to increase further in the third quarter with credit standards also easing, the European Central Bank said in a quarterly survey of the bloc's top banks.
Buying 2.5 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) worth of public and private bonds over the past three years, the ECB has pushed borrowing costs to record low levels, hoping to stimulate borrowing and spending, all with the ultimate aim of boosting inflation.
Although the scheme worked more slowly than expected, household and corporate lending are both near post-crisis highs, so the ECB agreed last month to wind down the bond purchases, satisfied that inflation is finally moving back towards its target of just under 2 percent.
In the second quarter, banks saw increased demand for corporate, housing and consumer loans and said credit standards -- internal guidelines or loan approval criteria -- also eased for all three categories, the ECB said.
Its comments were based on a survey of 149 lenders.
""Banks’ overall terms and conditions on new loans continued to ease across all loan categories in the second quarter of 2018, driven mainly by a narrowing of margins on average loans,"" the ECB said. 
It added that competitive pressures and risk perceptions contributed to an easing of credit standards in the second quarter, while banks' risk tolerance, their cost of funding and balance sheet constraints had a broadly neutral impact.

Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss the imposition of U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and his threats to expand those measures to European cars. 
""It is good that Jean-Claude Juncker will be in Washington tomorrow to talk and to seek a solution but we are not heading to negotiations with a pistol at our chest. I don't think threats bring us closer to a solution,"" Maas said.
""We in Europe must stick together...I hope that we succeed in resolving this via consensus but we will not be threatened and climb down so easily,"" he told German public television. 
Trump has complained about higher duties applied by the European Union on car imports and has described the bloc as a trade ""foe"".
EU officials say that while EU import duties for cars are heavier than those applied by the United States, the U.S. rates for other products, including trucks, are higher. They say cutting duties for cars can only be part of a broader trade deal. 
Maas, about to visit Japan and South Korea, who are also threatened by U.S. tariffs, said no one had an interest in new and higher tariffs. 

""In the end, all sides would lose, also the Americans,"" he said, adding he hoped that U.S. officials would realize this.

Trump on Monday said that he’s in discussions with incoming Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador about doing something “very dramatic, very positive for both countries,” without giving more details. Mexico’s peso extended gains after Trump’s remarks, rising 0.7 percent to 18.8951 per dollar at 4:48 p.m. in New York.
Lopez Obrador is “a terrific person,” Trump said at a Made in America event at the White House, adding he spoke to the Mexican president-elect “at length on a call.”
Minutes later, Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico City he’s not aware of the deal that Trump was referring to, but that he’s open to talking to the administration about one.
A quick agreement would allow Lopez Obrador to focus on domestic priorities when he takes office Dec. 1, while shielding him from any potential criticism involving the outcome of the negotiations, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing private talks. Republicans in November’s midterms could also tout the agreement as U.S. President Donald Trump accomplishing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge to fix or abandon Nafta.
Stalled Talks
High-level Nafta negotiations are set to resume this week after a two-month hiatus for Mexico’s July 1 presidential elections. While the nations had said progress was made earlier this year, the pact’s future hangs in doubt. Trump last week repeated his threat to pursue individual deals with Mexico and Canada, and the three nations still remain far apart on major points almost a year after the negotiations first began.
An agreement depends on U.S. willingness to back off proposals that are opposed by Mexico, Canada and American business groups, such as an automatic expiration of the deal after five years and the end of dispute resolution panels, according to the people. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer hasn’t shown an openness to do that, the people said.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is scheduled to travel to Mexico City on Wednesday to meet with officials from the current and incoming Mexican administrations, including Lopez Obrador. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said last week that he and his team plan to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet with Lighthizer.
The Canadian foreign ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Lighthizer’s office and Mexico’s economy ministry declined to comment. The White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Mexican foreign ministry on Saturday said that Jesus Seade, named by Lopez Obrador as his chief Nafta negotiator, will join the team on its trip to Washington. Seade said in an interview last month that he sees a deal as possible before the U.S. congressional election, and that the incoming president’s team fundamentally agrees with the nation’s current negotiating positions.
Guajardo last week alluded to the possibility of an August deal. In an interview with Radio Formula, he said that in closed-door meetings with the current and incoming governments earlier this month, U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated a desire to have a deal in 45 days.
Mexico is moving ahead in its efforts to integrate with the economies of South America and make itself less dependent on the U.S., which bought 72 percent of the nation’s exports last year, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.
Mexico’s current leader, President Enrique Pena Nieto, on Monday and Tuesday is hosting leaders including Brazil’s Michel Temer and Argentina officials for a summit focused on bridging the gaps between Latin America’s two major trade blocs: Mercosur, spearheaded by Brazil and Argentina, and the Pacific Alliance, which includes Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile.
While Trump said last week he may prioritize a bilateral trade talks with Mexico over Canada, both the current and incoming Mexican administrations have expressed a preference to preserve a three-nation free-trade agreement.

The South American nation's economy has been steadily collapsing since the crash of oil prices in 2014 left it unable to maintain a socialist system of subsidies and price controls.
""We are projecting a surge in inflation to 1,000,000 percent by end-2018 to signal that the situation in Venezuela is similar to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000's,"" Alejandro Werner, director of the IMF Western Hemisphere department, wrote in a post on the agency's blog.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Consumer prices have risen 46,305 percent this year, according to the opposition-run legislature, which began publishing its own inflation data in 2017 because the nation's central bank had halted the release of basic economic data. 
President Nicolas Maduro says the country is victim of an ""economic war"" waged by opposition businesses with the support of Washington.
His government routinely dismisses the IMF as a pawn of Washington that puts the interests of wealthy financiers before those of developing nations.

Opposition critics have said Venezuela's problems are the result of bad policy decisions, including unchecked expansion of the money supply and currency controls that leave businesses unable to import raw materials and machine parts.

576,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",U.S. Economy Set to Benefit From China Slowdown as World Suffers,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. would probably benefit from a sharp slowdown in China’s economy even as the rest of the world suffers, according to calculations by Germany’s Bundesbank.
What may seem like a counter-intuitive scenario has its roots in trade relations. The U.S., the world’s largest economy, imported goods worth more than $500 billion from China last year, over three times as much as it exported to the country.
The Bundesbank says lower prices in the Asian nation because of weaker growth would be a stimulus for U.S. private consumption and investment, bolstering American output by as much as 0.2 percent over two years. The estimate also assumes the Federal Reserve would react more strongly to a Chinese slowdown than the European Central Bank when setting monetary policy.
While prospects for the Chinese economy remain favorable overall, a steep increase in company debt and opaque financial linkages pose non-negligible risks, the Bundesbank said in its monthly report. Standard economic models based on expectations of a general demand shock may understate those risks, it said.
That’s a concern for much of the world economy. History shows that the financial crises that follow extraordinary credit growth have a more pronounced impact on domestic investment than on private consumption. Since Chinese investment tends to draw on imports such as machinery, countries providing those goods -- including Germany -- may be more exposed than widely assumed.
Using an adjusted model, the Bundesbank calculates that global gross domestic product without China would be damped by 1 percent over two years, instead of the 0.7 percent estimate in a standard model.
The central bank cautioned that even those predictions might turn out to be too optimistic. The models assume a stable Chinese currency and don’t take into account a potential deterioration in global economic confidence.

Offshore private and government accounts bought $2.471 billion of the $22 billion in 10-year Treasury notes offered on July 11, down from $4.506 billion at the previous 10-year auction the month before, data from the U.S. Treasury Department released on Monday showed.
This was the lowest amount of 10-year notes they bought since September 2017.
Overseas investors bought $1.146 billion of $14 billion of 30-year bonds sold on July 12, lower than the $1.357 billion the prior month, according to the Treasury's latest auction allotment data.
They purchased $3.973 billion of the $33 billion three-year note supply offered on July 10, which was the smallest amount since January. This was below the $5.649 billion they purchased in June.
As offshore demand for Treasury supply retreated, investment managers raised their purchases of U.S. government securities.
They bought $13.353 billion of the 10-year notes sold earlier this month, which was the most since the Treasury made this data available going back to 2000.
Fund managers purchased $8.584 billion in 30-year bonds, up slightly from $8.490 billion the prior month.

All 44 respondents to a Bloomberg survey said the central bank will stick with the current settings for yield-curve control and asset purchases at the end of its two-day policy gathering on July 31.
The poll was conducted July 17-20. Of the eight economists who were contacted again on July 23, following news reports of possible policy changes, none said their views had shifted about the meeting next week.
Click here to read the full survey.
""I don’t think I will change anything, because fundamentally there’s no inflation and the economy is slowing,"" said Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore. ""There’s no reason for tighter monetary policy,"" she said.
Given weak inflation economists have grown more convinced that the BOJ’s first step to normalize monetary policy won’t happen this year. Only one said it would in the July 17-20 survey, compared with five who expressed that view in June.
Nearly a quarter of economists polled, though, forecast a move in January, and more than half said they expect it sometime in 2019.
Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at Sony Financial Holdings, said the recent news reports prompted a rethink at his office, which is now forecasting a first rate hike in January, compared with ""by 2020"" previously.
""The BOJ started to communicate with markets earlier than we expected,"" Kanno said. ""The weekend news was apparently leaked by the BOJ to reporters intentionally to send a message to the markets. It means that BOJ quite strongly intends to raise the yield target on 10-years bond within a year. But if yen rises over 105, they will not able to do that.""
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda insists that momentum toward the BOJ’s 2 percent inflation target has been sustained, but three-fourths of economists said they don’t expect that target to be reached until after the 2022 calendar year.
With inflation still low, the BOJ board is set to take a closer look at the structural reasons price gains haven’t reached 2 percent. About a third of economists surveyed by Bloomberg said a lack of wage gains was the biggest reason, followed by a ""deflationary mindset"" among companies.
With policy side effects piling up, further easing has all but been ruled out -- only 7 percent of economists said it would be the BOJ’s next move. Nearly all of those who said tightening will be the BOJ’s next step said it would come in the form of a higher target for 10-year government bond yields.
In the event of a rate hike in the near future, the yen would strengthen by 5 percent, according to the median response of economists.
Thirty-nine percent of analysts surveyed said they didn’t think the existing policy framework would be sustainable at the current settings for more than two more years, and 28 percent said they thought it could continue three more years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ecuador's recent turn toward a more market friendly economic policies has lifted investor sentiment toward the Andean country, but follow-through beyond fiscal discipline will be key in order for the positive market reaction to continue, investors and analysts said.
Ecuador's stock market, with a near 10 percent gain https://tmsnrt.rs/2LhUCcd (BVQA), has outperformed most of its larger South American neighbors so far in 2018. Its benchmark 2026 sovereign bond yield <EC153507198=>, recently above 11.5 percent, has fallen by more than 160 basis points over the last month to 9.8 percent.
Part of the upbeat market sentiment can be traced to May, when social democrat President Lenin Moreno named an economy minister from within the business community.
Richard Martinez arrived with a plan to reduce external debt and the fiscal deficit. He has reached out to multilateral financing organizations and has driven negotiations over legislation that would allow 8-to-12 years of income tax exemption for new private investment over the next two years.
""This incentive would allow to accelerate both local and foreign private investment and foster growth,"" said the Ecuadorian economy and finance ministry in an emailed reply to Reuters.
With Ecuador's currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, the country has effectively sacrificed an independent monetary policy, putting an even sharper focus on fiscal policy.
The fiscal consolidation plan has pleased investors according to Giulia Pellegrini, deputy head of emerging markets economic research for BlackRock in London.
Preliminary data for the first six months of 2018 show a ""significant fiscal tightening,"" both from a reduction in new spending and from lower costs in recurring spending, she said.
""The government has shown that it means business in the first half of the year,"" Pellegrini said. ""We have good signs but we really want to see them complete this process.""
A reform of the mining code would also be important, analysts said, if the government expects the private sector investment to fill the void left by the government's belt tightening.
""It’s a two-fold issue. It’s not only trying to correct the fiscal imbalance that they have but also trying to incentivize investment so that the economy becomes less reliant on government spending for growth, which had been the case over the past decade,"" said Renzo Merino, an analyst of sovereign risk at Moody’s Investors Service in New York.
Ecuador's U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bond yield spread stands at 637 basis points over benchmark U.S. Treasuries, as measured by the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Emerging Markets Bond Index Global . That is down from a 1-1/2 year high of 806 basis points hit a month ago, but still roughly 300 basis points wider than the benchmark index.
""When markets realize that Ecuador is reducing fiscal expenditure and that the macroeconomic environment is better than 2017, we anticipate that the pricing of Ecuadorian bonds will recover,"" the economy ministry said.
""When conditions guarantee a sizable amount (of debt issuance) at single digits (yield), Ecuador would consider tapping the world markets.""
CHALLENGES AND GREEN SHOOTS
Ecuador pays a confidence premium after recent defaults on its debt. Traders in credit default swaps are pricing in a probability that Ecuador will default in the next year at 6.4 percent, compared to between 1.0 percent and 1.4 percent for Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. Argentina's probability stands just above 3.0 percent while Venezuela, with a crumbling economy, is near 73 percent.
""I don't think an Ecuadorian default is a realistic discussion right now. They are cutting back spending and they have piecemeal sources of financing,"" said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Nomura Securities International in New York.
""But there's a distrust given their track record of defaults,"" she said. ""When a country is running a huge deficit and has no access to external capital markets, investors start to debate how it is going to pay.""
The OPEC member is particularly vulnerable to globally tightening financial conditions as its shallow market makes it heavily dependent on external financing, according to Richard Francis, a director at ratings agency Fitch.
""Ecuador is still adjusting to external shocks that have exposed underlying structural imbalances in the country's economy,"" wrote International Monetary Fund staffers after a recent visit. The shocks have been felt across emerging market economies as the U.S. dollar strengthened in recent months and, combined with rising interest rates, served to drive financing costs higher.
But the IMF also highlighted increased transparency as well as steps to ""strengthen fiscal institutions and re-establish a competitive private-sector driven economy.""
The government said it is in ""very close and active dialogue"" with the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral financing institutions, ""mainly in the context of technical assistance missions.""

581,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>","Venezuela's Inflation to Reach 1 Million Percent, IMF Forecasts","(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela’s inflation will skyrocket to 1 million percent by the end of the year as the government continues to print money to cover a growing budget hole, the International Monetary Fund predicted on Monday.
The crisis is comparable to that of Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s, said Alejandro Werner, head of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere department. He forecast the economy to shrink 18 percent in 2018 -- the third consecutive year of double-digit contractions -- as oil production falls significantly.
“The collapse in economic activity, hyperinflation, and increasing deterioration in the provision of public goods as well as shortages of food at subsidized prices have resulted in large migration flows, which will lead to intensifying spillover effects on neighboring countries,” Werner wrote in a blog post.
Venezuela has been suffering a dramatic economic collapse since crude prices nosedived nearly four years ago and authorities have refused to enact economic adjustments. A number of price and exchange controls only added to the distortions.
While hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans flee hunger and surging prices, President Nicolas Maduro has maintained that the crisis is a result of an “economic war” waged by his political opponents at home and abroad. As the economy unraveled, authorities stopped regularly publishing economic indicators. Economists now rely on independent estimates provided by international organizations, banks and even Venezuela’s congress to track the country’s economic meltdown.
Bloomberg’s Cafe Con Leche Index estimates inflation topped 60,000 percent over the past year and is picking up speed now, posting an annualized rate of almost 300,000 percent in the past three months.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","Reversing quantitative easing would not be hawkish signal, says BoE's Broadbent","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will tread carefully and keep a close eye on the effect on inflation when the time comes for it to start to sell its 435 billion pounds of quantitative easing (QE) assets, BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Monday.
Interest rates will remain the central bank's main tool for the BoE steering policy - and BoE policymakers will keep in mind that the effect of QE and its reversal can depend not just on market conditions but on central bank communication around it.
Broadbent stuck close to the central bank's recently updated guidance on the relationship between QE and interest rates in a speech to London's Society of Professional Economists.
""The framework is designed to ensure that, should inflationary pressures weaken after that date, the first response would be to cut interest rates,"" Broadbent said. 
As a result, investors should not assume that the BoE was adopting a more hawkish approach when it started the process of reversing QE.
""The unwind process is not in itself a hawkish signal,"" he said.
Last month the BoE said it might start to sell some of the 435 billion pounds ($570 billion) of government bonds it bought to provide quantitative easing stimulus once it raises its interest rate to about 1.5 percent, compared with a previous 2 percent threshold.
The BoE's main interest rate currently stands at 0.5 percent - its level for most of the period since 2009. Most economists polled by Reuters expect the BoE to raise rates to 0.75 percent next week, but then to keep rates on hold until 2020.
Broadbent said he did not know exactly when the 1.5 percent threshold for starting to reverse QE was likely to be met.
UNDECIDED
Based on the experience of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the impact of QE and its reversal depended on central bank communication as well as financial market conditions.
Broadbent stressed the BoE would look closely at any disinflationary impact from reversing QE.
""To that extent, Bank Rate would be lower than it otherwise would have been,"" he said.
""That's why we took care to add another sentence to last month's monetary policy statement: 'Decisions on Bank Rate will take into account any impact of changes in the stock of purchased assets on overall monetary conditions, in order to achieve the inflation target'."" 
The BoE says it intends to raise interest rates in a limited and gradual way, and its most recent set of economic forecasts in May assumed rates of 1.2 percent by late 2020.
Broadbent said in May that it had been a ""straightforward"" decision for him to vote to keep interest rates on hold that month, after several pieces of weak first-quarter data.
Since then, other BoE policymakers have said the first-quarter slowdown looks to have been mostly weather-related.
In response to a question from the audience, Broadbent said he had not decided how he would vote at next week's policy decision, and would not say if he had.

585,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>","Trump Wants to Blame the Fed, Not Control It","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There is a common narrative that President Donald Trump attacked the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank on Twitter last week. It's wrong on several points.
First, Trump’s attack was on the Fed itself rather than on its independence per se. He did report that he was “not happy” with forthcoming interest rate increases, and at first I too thought he was seeking to forestall them. But upon reflection, I decided that Trump is playing a subtler game: laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed if anything goes wrong with the U.S. economy.
In essence, Trump wants a fall guy. He may be secretly afraid that his “trade war” and general political volatility – or just plain bad luck – will damage the U.S. economy. If that happens, Trump will need a political target to absorb the criticism. With midterm elections around the corner, he doesn’t want to point the finger at Congress. Hillary Clinton can no longer serve as a plausible target. So the Fed is the convenient scapegoat. The last thing he wants is for the Fed to do exactly as he says, because then he would have no one to blame but himself. He did stress, “I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”
If Trump really wanted lower interest rates, he could have nominated extreme doves to the Fed board. But in fact he has selected a mix of moderates and sometimes even (mild) inflation hawks. That’s another sign Trump is playing a blame-shifting game, rather than trying to undermine the Fed’s independence or to achieve eternal low interest rates.
You might even argue that Trump is trying to increase the Fed’s independence, though at the cost of its credibility. “Don’t associate these losers with me” is the message.
The other problem with interpreting Trump’s tweets as weakening the Fed’s independence is that the Fed never has been fully independent in the first place. For one, the president appoints Fed governors, subject to Senate approval. For another, Congress can revoke or alter the charter of the Fed at any time.
Within these constraints, the Fed does make its own decisions. But that is not the same as saying it is free to make any decision it wants. During a downturn, for instance, the Fed could aim for 4 percent inflation, to boost aggregate demand. Its clear reluctance to do so can be explained not by macroeconomic theory but by public opinion and, ultimately, congressional pressure. In an age of relative wage stagnation, higher inflation rates would mean real wage cuts for many voters.
The result? A Fed that does not respond strongly enough to crises.
To better see the role of politics here, compare the U.S. Fed to the New Zealand Reserve Bank, perhaps the least independent central bank among developed nations. Since 1990, New Zealand has had a system where the Reserve Bank and the minister of finance agree on a range for the rate of price inflation. In other words, the government takes basic responsibility for what the Reserve Bank will do. If the Reserve Bank fails in this regard, there is an obligation to explain what went wrong and why.
On paper, this is very different from the procedures of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Yet the Reserve Bank and the minister of finance, acting together, have chosen inflation rates between 0 and 3 percent, with 2 percent as a desired midpoint. U.S. rates of price inflation have been in the 0 to 2 percent range over the same period. And both the U.S. and New Zealand have been falling somewhat short of a 2 percent target as of late. In other words, broadly similar results end up being channeled through some very different institutional procedures.
All this said, Trump’s Twitter outburst is likely to be harmful to monetary policy looking forward. Ideally, the Fed would have more latitude to defy public opinion and opt for higher inflation rates when the next economic crisis so dictates. Attacking the Fed won’t help in that regard. What would, in contrast, is a president – and a Congress – that indicate in advance that they will have the Fed’s back in an economic or financial emergency.
Trump’s tweets didn’t have a major impact on the market this time. The real danger is more long-term, during the next crisis, when the concept of Fed independence is taken to mean that the Fed is truly standing alone."
586,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",The BOJ’s Bond Yield Weapon Is Going Nowhere,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the answer is a bond tantrum, then we’re probably not going to get asked the question twice.
Several press reports over the weekend suggested the Bank of Japan might, at its next policy meeting, debate lifting the yield curve control cap it has imposed on 10-year bond yields. Currently, officials aim to keep yields “around zero” — which as a practical matter means it only takes action if they rise above 0.1 percent. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he knew of no basis for these reports.
This policy has been around since September 2016, and has been hugely successful. So why change it?
The answer lies in concerns about transmission of monetary policy. Perhaps some officials on the BOJ’s seven-member policy committee believe that raising the cap would steepen the yield curve, thereby boosting bank profitability and spurring loan growth. Surely this is a desirable goal, given that inflation has utterly failed to embed itself into the Japanese economy.
But this approach is a massive risk. It would take a long time for a change to feed through to inflation, and meanwhile the near-term impact would only be to drive bond yields higher just as inflation is cooling. A nasty side effect would be that it would encourage domestic investors to buy more Japanese securities. This would drive the yen higher, which would destroy the impact of the last 10 years of stimulus. 
Bloomberg Economics’ Yuki Masujima said these reports seem to be a trial balloon. If they were, investors gave a clear answer. The yield curve steepened by about than 10 basis points, which is a huge move — Japanese government bonds rarely move more than a basis point during a day’s trading. Hedging by primary dealers ahead of a 400 billion yen ($3.6 billion) 40-year JGB auction on Tuesday probably exacerbated the reaction.
The Bank of Japan stepped in on Monday by offering to buy all 10-year bonds tendered by the market at 0.11 percent. This had the desired result of capping yields, and in fact the central bank didn’t wind up having to buy anything. This illustrates the power of the policy — it’s a big stick, and since it was introduced the BOJ has only had to buy bonds once (it’s issued threats on four separate occasions). Officials have kept a lid on yields for so long that other central banks can only look on with envy.
So the BOJ is not going to sway from this policy anytime soon. The brutal fact is that it is nowhere near achieving its goal of inflation above 2 percent, and in fact, economists’ forecasts for price gains are far below what the BOJ is currently expecting. 
It’s a fair point that something more needs to be done. And it makes some sense that this idea is getting kicked around. But the answer to Japan’s economic problems should not involve the one policy that’s really working. 
A better solution would be for officials to pin down yields on shorter maturities, most likely five years, just as they have 10-year yields. Only then should officials risk allowing longer yields to rise. There will surely be a comprehensive review, and there could be other measures that merit scrutiny, but whatever officials decide upon, they shouldn’t do anything that would weaken the power of the current yield curve control program.
Investors have endured a number of these little scares about the policy’s force, and the result has always been that the BOJ has the final word. It’s just like the hiccups with the bond buying program — any market panic about a reduction in purchases soon dissipates once everyone remembers that the central bank won’t let yields rise. 
Traders are always going to try to smoke out the next move by central bank officials. They should bear in mind that Kuroda and his colleagues aren’t going to be rushed.

587,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Broadbent Defends QE in Final Comments Before BOE Rate Decision,"(Bloomberg) -- As the Bank of England prepares to increase interest rates for just the second time in a decade, Ben Broadbent launched a fresh defense of the bond-buying program the bank used when rates got close to zero.
The BOE’s deputy governor for monetary policy used a speech in London on Monday to clarify the central bank’s guidance on when it intends to begin unwinding its quantitative easing program, and he also outlined its achievements. The asset-purchase program has drawn criticism from the start that it increased inequality and punished pensioners and savers.
“QE has often been described as a ‘new-fangled’ policy, something that involves ‘printing money’ and has served only to engineer large rises in the prices of financial and other assets, benefiting only the better off,” said Broadbent, who has been seen as a possible contender to replace BOE Governor Mark Carney next year. “Broadly speaking I don’t think any of these things is true.”
While he acknowledged that early rounds of purchases had a greater effect than those that followed, Broadbent said the program “provided significant support to aggregate demand, even if it wasn’t enough to offset fully the extended contractionary effects of the crisis.”
The BOE is looking to the experience of their peers in the U.S. as they consider the best way to exit its almost decade-old stimulus, he said. Policy makers surprised watchers at their last policy meeting in June by voting to change the guidance on when they will consider reducing the stock of debt purchased in the bank’s quantitative easing program.
First Response
Having previously said they wouldn’t consider selling the bonds until the key rate reached 2 percent, they cut that to 1.5 percent, although they reiterated that any reduction in the stock would be at a “gradual and predictable pace.”
“We don’t know exactly when” rates will reach that level, Broadbent said. “But the framework is designed to ensure that, should inflationary pressures weaken after that date, the first response would be to cut interest rates.”
Broadbent’s comments are the last by any Monetary Policy Committee member before they go into their pre-decision quiet period on Wednesday. Officials voted 6-3 to keep the benchmark unchanged at 0.5 percent at their June meeting and are widely expected to raise it on Aug. 2 as they seek to normalize policy after the financial crisis."
588,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","Ukraine sizes up bond sales, new finance minister says","By Emma Rumney and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine is preparing to ramp up its borrowing, its new acting finance minister told Reuters on Monday, with plans to restart bond issuance in euros and look at issuing debt in currencies such as China's yuan for the first time.
Oksana Markarova said the country would borrow in dollars but also step up issuance in its domestic currency as it looks to manage hefty debts and reduce its sensitivity to exchange rates, which arises from much of its borrowing being dollar-denominated.
""We will be trying to intensify ... the issues internally, especially in Ukrainian currency,"" she said in an interview. ""It's been a while since we issued in euros ... but we might even explore other markets as well.""
Asked whether this could include the Chinese yuan, she said it was something the country was looking at. ""It might,"" she said, adding that it wouldn't happen this year.
Bond issues would help Ukraine to manage $15 billion in foreign currency debt that needs to be repaid or refinanced by 2020 - $8 billion of which is due by next year - with its program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) well off track.
A euro issuance could come this year, depending on market conditions, Markarova said, but issues in other currencies like the yuan are further into the future.
Ukraine's plan for servicing its debt would be made public in its upcoming mid-term debt strategy she said.
The 2018 budget envisages total borrowing of between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, with Markarova expecting about $1.5 billion of that to come from the market. The rest is expected to come from sources such as the IMF and the European Union.
Ukraine is still at odds with the IMF over a number of outstanding measures in its $17.5 billion aid program, of which it has received about $8.7 billion so far.
Recent tweaks to plans to establish a court to target corruption are believed to have received IMF approval but there is still a stalemate over demands for another rise in gas prices and measures to plug some other recent budget shortfalls.
There is no firm date yet for the IMF's team to visit Ukraine again, though the two sides are in regular contact, Markarova said.
""A 2.5 percent (budget deficit) is a target and we will definitely stay within that target,"" she said.
""I'm sure in discussions with our international colleague we will show them how we plan to do it. We will find a solution that is good for the budget.""

589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Mexico Pushes for Nafta Deal With Trump by End of August,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico is redoubling its efforts to reach a Nafta agreement with the U.S. and Canada by the end of August to increase certainty for investors and take the heat off incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, according to three people familiar with the negotiations.
A deal next month would allow Lopez Obrador to focus on his priority of domestic development, while shielding him from any potential criticism involving the outcome of the negotiations, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing private talks. The timeline would also allow U.S. President Donald Trump to make good on his 2016 presidential campaign pledge to fix or abandon Nafta before mid-term elections in November.
The people cautioned that while technical talks are advanced, an agreement depends on the U.S. willingness to back off proposals that are opposed by Mexico, Canada and American business groups, such as an automatic expiration of the deal after five years and the end of dispute resolution panels. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer hasn’t shown an openness to do that, the people said.
Lighthizer’s office and the Canadian foreign ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Mexico’s economy ministry declined to immediately comment.
After a two-month break, the highest-level Nafta negotiators are set to meet this week. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is scheduled to travel to Mexico City on Wednesday to meet with officials from the current and incoming Mexican administrations, including Lopez Obrador. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said last week that he and his team plan to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet with Lighthizer.
The Mexican foreign ministry on Saturday said that Jesus Seade, named by Lopez Obrador as his chief Nafta negotiator, will join the team on its trip to Washington. Seade said in an interview last month that he sees a deal as possible before the U.S. congressional election, and that the incoming president’s team fundamentally agrees with the nation’s current negotiating positions.
Guajardo last week alluded to the possibility of an August deal. In an interview with Radio Formula, he said that in closed-door meetings with the current and incoming governments earlier this month, U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated a desire to have a deal in 45 days.
Mexico is moving ahead in its efforts to integrate with the economies of South America and make itself less dependent on the U.S., which bought 72 percent of the nation’s exports last year, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.
Pena Nieto on Monday and Tuesday is hosting leaders including Brazil’s Michel Temer and Argentina officials for a summit focused on bridging the gaps between Latin America’s two major trade blocs: Mercosur, spearheaded by Brazil and Argentina, and the Pacific Alliance, which includes Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile.
While Trump said last week he may prioritize a bilateral trade talks with Mexico over Canada, both the current and incoming Mexican administrations have expressed a preference to preserve a three-nation free-trade agreement.

591,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 10:16AM ET</span>",Trump's looming auto trade battle is staggeringly pointless — but there's a good chance he'll win it,"A few months after Donald Trump was elected President in 2016, I was at the Detroit Auto Show, and I gauged the car business' reaction to the man.
The big three – Ford, GM, and FCA – were delighted; the foreign brands were confused.
In short order, the Detroit automakers launched an effort to have fuel-economy standards, locked in by the late-Obama-era EPA, revisited with an eye toward keeping sales of big pickup trucks and SUV elevated.  Detroit scored a quick victory on that one.
On to the corporate tax cut, which the industry figured would offset any sort of border tax on Mexico-made vehicles and parts that General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles needed to import. Detroit got that one, too.
Trump was basically in the bag. And then came the trade war.
The President obviously wanted a trade war all along, not because it served any valid economic purpose but because there hadn't been a major trade conflict between the US and a partner since Japan in the 1980s, back when Trump was headed into what can now charitably be called his business prime. Don't underestimate Trump's enthusiasm for nostalgia.
The auto industry was a major combatant back then, and ironically the dispute led to Japanese car companies setting up shop in the US South, employing huge numbers of non-union Americans and giving Republicans in Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina economic prosperity that would have eluded them if US automakers had expanded instead and American car buyers had been denied the choice of locally manufactured Hondas and Nissans.
Detroit laid relatively low with Trump in 2017 and accepted that the President would periodically attack, but also praise the industry, especially if it announced hiring and investment in the US and put the brakes on expanding operations in Mexico. 
The Commerce Department has now opened a Section 232 action, allegedly to determine if vehicles imported by the US represent a national-security threat (""Beware of Germans bearing BMWs!""), but actually to stoke drama and to put Detroit in the awkward position of having to build more factories or at least hire more US workers. Or more accurately, get them to say that they'll do these things so that Trump can get votes in the battleground Midwestern states where the big three are concentrated. 
As a whole, the auto industry has blasted the move, insisting correctly that it will be bad for business and bad for consumers. 
The UAW, sensing that Detroit may end up throwing money at the problem by doing some marginal hiring, has made positive statements about the probe.
There is a slight case for replaying the trade war of the early 1980s, if German, Japanese, and perhaps Chinese automakers decide to move more production to the US, as they have done in the past. BMW, for example, builds SUVs in South Carolina. Americans like BMW's SUVs, so this makes sense. 
The problem is that although some foreign brands, China-owned Volvo most recently, have followed the ""transplant"" script and constructed a US plant, few others want to do this because the American auto market has been at peak sales levels for three years in a row. Investing in new US manufacturing capacity would be throwing money into an impending sales downturn.
What about exporting vehicles? Clearly, it's illogical for, say, Toyota to make cars in the US and send them someplace else. And as far as Detroit goes, the big three want to establish local-market manufacturing, and the market they all have their eyes on is China, where all the meaningful future growth should be.
The tricky thing about this dispute is that, unlike Trump's prior attacks on the auto industry, the situation isn't black-and-white. When Trump was demanding investment and hiring from the big three, you could look at the moves and call them clueless, given the reality of the market in the US (Trump didn't get to have peak auto and full-employment at the same time). 
The autos aspect of the trade war fits into Trump's raw-deal theatrics because a voter who doesn't know anything about the car business or the European Union or Japanese or Chinese markets might believe that hefty tariffs on imported vehicles might somehow lead to better US access to new customers. The EU could, for example, drop its 10% tariff on US-made cars. America wins!
Except that US automakers have been struggling with a challenging European market for over a decade; GM just sold off its Opel division to Peugeot after years of losses. The vehicle mix in Europe — small cars and diesels — is also completely different from what Detroit builds in the US. Production in the US is also moving away from passenger cars to pickups and SUVs. The cars that Europeans favor tend to have narrow or nonexistent profit margins.
The only possible argument in favor of protecting US cars from foreign competition is that a 25% tariff that applied to German luxury cars might get Americans to buy Cadillacs instead. Except that those German luxury brands are so popular with affluent customers that they'd likely just pay up the difference. 
Detroit is in a fairly bad position here. It can't do anything to support a Trump trade war because given the global nature of industry supply chains, US tariffs will always be bad for business. Hiring and capacity expansion is not going to happen. But Trump wants a win, and he doesn't care if it hurts the industry, across the board. He can always say that they got their tax cut and this is the real price. 
The more I've thought about this, the more I think Trump is going to do whatever he needs to do to win his trade war, now that he's started it. So let's assess what would happen if the EU relents and drops its 10% tariff (I don't want to get into China and its 25% duty because Western automakers are already deeply invested there in local production).
What would happen is pretty much nothing. The American auto-export floodgates to Europe would not suddenly open. Ford isn't going to build a new factory in Michigan to make diesel hatchback subcompacts so it can sell them at a 2% margin. 
The best outcome might actually be if Trump gets the win he wants, with tariffs falling outside the US, and proposed US counter-tariffs never going up. He could then celebrate victory, and the auto industry itself wouldn't be exposed to its cost structured being messed up. Trump could say that he alone did this for Detroit and hope that holds the line in the Midwest — but the carmakers aren't going to undertake a hiring surge.
A reasonable person might ask why, then, we're being subjected to all this. I think that if you have to ask, you just don't know Trump.

592,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 10:14AM ET</span>",Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's taking a bite out of China's economy," Real gross-domestic-product growth in the country slipped 0.1 percentage points to 6.7% in the second quarter, the statistics bureau reported Monday, a pace not seen since 2016. That is still over the government's target of around 6.5%, and year-over-year growth remained at 6.8%. 
The fall was widely expected after Chinese policymakers began a campaign to  curb financial leverage last year, which analysts say has weighed heavily on growth. 
""Credit and money growth were disappointing in June, highlighting the persistent and negative impact of the financial deleveraging reform on credit conditions in the real economy,"" Societe General analysts led by Brigitte Richard-Hidden wrote in a note. 
Investment spending has been growing at a record-low pace this year, falling to 2.1% of gross domestic product in the second quarter from 2.4% a year ago. Property investment has been particularly sluggish, posting its weakest growth in six months in June. 
At the same time, tariffs have also loomed over China's economy. Beijing and Washington have been in  a trade spat since March, when the Trump administration announced plans to penalize Beijing over accusations of intellectual-property theft and what officials saw as unfair trade practices.
Trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on almost all Chinese imports to the US. He followed through with tariffs on  $34 billion worth of Chinese goods last month, prompting an in-kind response. UBS expects the first round of tariffs to slow China's economic growth by 0.1% in the first year. 
If Trump carries through with recent threats to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to the US, analysts say it could slow further — by between 0.3% to 0.5%. But they caution those escalations would also hurt the US and other major economies.
""As the third quarter gets under way, markets will be closely watching how the global trade developments play out and what impacts it may have on the Chinese, US and global economy,"" Lukman said. 
The mix of trade tensions and a deleveraging campaign puts policymakers in a tight spot, according to Richard-Hidden.
""The economy is under strong pressure from the well-intentioned deleveraging reform,"" Richard-Hidden said. ""Now that the risk of trade tensions affecting the real economy is also on the rise, we think that policymakers will have no choice but to opt for more policy easing."""
593,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",OECD urges Canada to improve corporate competitiveness,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economic growth is strong and some housing market vulnerabilities have improved, but trade policy is a big risk to the outlook and the government should reform taxes to boost corporate competitiveness, the OECD said on Monday.
The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said while GDP growth is projected to remain robust, with exports underpinned by strong global demand, rising rates will sap some consumer strength.
On the whole, the OECD sees Canada’s economy growing 2.1 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2019, down from 3.0 percent in 2017, while exports and employment continue to improve and CPI inflation rises to 2.3 percent in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2019.
The greatest risk in the outlook is trade protectionism, the OECD said, noting that uncertainty around the future of U.S. trade policy may be dampening investment.
It said the termination of the North American Free Trade Agreement would have ""a small but material effect"" on gross domestic product, with potential losses around 0.5 percent of GDP in the short term and 0.2 percent of GDP in the long term. 
The OECD said U.S. corporate tax cuts have hurt Canadian competitiveness, reinforcing the negative hit from NAFTA uncertainty.
""The government should review the tax system to ensure that it remains efficient - raising sufficient revenues to fund public spending without imposing excessive costs on the economy - equitable and supports the competitiveness of the Canadian economy,"" the OECD said.
It also said that while income inequality is close to the OECD mean, working-age poverty is well above the OECD average, immigrant labor market integration lags, and there remains a sizeable gender earnings gap.
Still, a series of changes to mortgage rules and other macro-prudential measures have mitigated the risks around a long housing boom, the OECD said.

Slowing economic growth has sparked a heated debate among government researchers on whether fiscal policy should play a bigger role in softening the impact of a trade war with the United States.
""The proactive fiscal policy will become more active,"" state radio cited a statement issued after a cabinet meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, as saying.
The fiscal policy will focus on cutting taxes for companies while the pace of local governments' special bond issuance will be quickened, it quoted the cabinet as saying.
The government will deliver a tax cut of 65 billion yuan ($9.6 billion) by expanding a preferential policy for small tech firms to all firms, on top of an initial goal of cutting taxes and fees by 1.1 trillion yuan this year, the cabinet said.
China will keep liquidity ample and maintain appropriate total social financing under its prudent monetary policy, which will be neither too tight nor too loose, it added.
Economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter as Beijing's efforts to contain debt hurt activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low, in a worrying sign for investment and exporters as a trade war with the United States intensified.
China's regulatory tightening has driven up corporate borrowing costs, prompting the central bank to cut banks' reserve requirements three times this year, with further cuts widely expected.
In March, Premier Li Keqiang announced a cut in the annual budget deficit target from 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, the first since 2012, but the finance ministry said fiscal policy remained supportive for growth, given a jump in planned special bond issuance this year.

Juncker will travel to Washington on Wednesday for talks focused on trade tensions after the U.S. imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and Trump's threats to extend those measures to European cars.
Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has said he expected Juncker to come with a ""significant"" trade offer, but the Commission on Monday that would not happen. 
""I do not wish to enter into a discussion about mandates, offers because there are no offers. This is a discussion, it is a dialogue and it is an opportunity to talk and to stay engaged in dialogue,"" Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news conference. 
Trump has repeatedly complained about the European Union, pointing to the higher duties it applies for car imports and describing the bloc as a ""foe"" in trade.
EU officials have said that, while EU import duties for cars are heavier than those of the United States, for other products, such as trucks, U.S. rates are higher. They also say cutting duties for cars could only be part of a broader trade deal.
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who will accompany Juncker, said last week that the European Union was preparing a list of U.S. products to hit if the United States imposed tariffs on EU cars.
Schinas said Juncker was ""very prepared"" to set out European arguments. 

""This is an occasion to de-dramatize any potential tensions around trade and to engage in an open and constructive dialogue with our American partners,"" he said.

Economic growth unexpectedly halved to a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the first three months of the year and economists are still debating whether the slowdown was just a hiccup or signaled the end of a boom in Europe's largest economy.
Fears that escalating trade tensions could also weigh on growth has also been impacting investor sentiment and the International Monetary Fund recently warned that the euro zone was facing 'particularly serious' risks that could lead to a hand landing for the economy after a five-year boom.
""The economy has likely showed better momentum in the spring than at the start of the year,"" the Bundesbank said. ""Although it is unlikely that the high growth rates of the past year will be repeated, manufacturing was once again the key economic driving force.""
Pharmaceutical output was particularly strong but car production also increased sharply, even as the output of intermediate goods remained weak, the bank added.
Part of the improvement in growth momentum was due to the expiration of one-off factors that held back growth, including an exceptionally disruptive flu season, the Bundesbank added.
Household consumption remained a cornerstone of growth while government consumption, which dipped in the early part of the year, also rebounded. 

""Last but not least, activity in the booming construction sector likely increased significantly, despite capacity constraints,"" the Bundesbank added.

599,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 05:33AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Monday: Trump, Iran, Google","Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday, July 23:
1. Trump Warns Iran To Never Threaten U.S.
Concerns surrounding geopolitics returned to the forefront after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a late Sunday evening post on Twitter to “never ever threaten” the U.S. again or else “suffer consequences”.



The tweet came hours after Rouhani told Trump that hostile policies toward Tehran could lead to ""the mother of all wars.""
The Trump administration has been harshly critical of Iran, pulling out of the nuclear deal reached between Iran and the West, and is set to reimpose sanctions starting in November.
Trump has also threatened to halt Iranian oil exports, which could cripple Iran’s economy.
2. Escalating U.S.-Iran Rhetoric Boosts Oil 
Oil prices got a boost from the escalation in rhetoric between Washington and Tehran.
The global oil benchmark, September Brent crude, was up 65 cents, or around 0.9%, to $73.75. U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI futures tacked on 38 cents, or 0.6%, to $68.64 a barrel.
Iran is a major Middle East oil producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Any disruption to supplies from Tehran could raise the potential for tighter global crude stockpiles.
3. Alphabet Kick Off Busy Week Of Earnings 
There are about 170 S&P 500 companies and 11 Dow members reporting earnings in what will be the busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Most of the focus will be on the FANG group of stocks.
After the bell on Monday, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is expected by analysts on average to report earnings per share EPS of $9.66 on revenue of $25.58 billion.
Some of other high-profile tech names reporting this week are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Among non-tech names, Boeing (NYSE:BA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), UPS (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Ford (NYSE:F), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are also on the docket for this week.



So far, 87 S&P 500 companies have released their latest quarterly results, of which 83% have beat consensus estimates, according to FactSet.
4. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Lower Open 
U.S. stock futures looked set to kick off the week on a downbeat note, with the major indices on track to open with modest losses, as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings.
At 5:30AM ET, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 20 points, or about 0.3%, at the open. The blue-chip Dow futures and S&P 500 futures also indicated a slightly lower start to their respective trading sessions.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses traded lower, with almost every sector trading in red. Auto stocks were the worst performers, as trade concerns weighed on sentiment.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed mixed, with Japan's Nikkei faring the worst, pressured by strength in the yen.
5. Trump's Fed Comments Hold Down Dollar
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar struggled against its major peers, as investors continued to digest President Trump's comments on the greenback's strength.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 94.31. It slid to its lowest since July 11 at 93.98 in overnight trade.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield dipping to around 2.88%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near 2.59%.
Sentiment remained fragile after Trump launched a rare attack on the Federal Reserve late last week, claiming that their plans to raise interest rates risked undermining his efforts at strengthening the economy.
He also lamented the strength of the greenback in posts on Twitter and accused China and the European Union of currency and interest-rate manipulation that he claims has put the U.S. at a disadvantage.
On the data front, Monday's economic calendar brings investors the June report on existing home sales at 10:00AM ET.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 05:13AM ET</span>",China says it won't devalue currency to bolster exports,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday the value of its currency is driven by market forces and that it has no intention to devalue the yuan to help exports, after Washington said it was monitoring the currency's weakness amid the escalating bilateral trade row.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry also said that threats and intimidation on trade would never work on China, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of goods imported from the country. 
At a daily news briefing, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang was asked about comments on Friday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told Reuters the yuan's weakness would be reviewed as part of the Treasury's semi-annual report on currency manipulation, which is due on Oct. 15.
Mnuchin's comments were the first since the early days of the Trump administration in 2017 that raised the prospect of designating China as a manipulator. 
Geng said the value of the yuan was subject to the forces of demand and supply, and that healthy economic performance offered support for its level. 
""China has no intention to use means like the competitive devaluation of its currency to stimulate exports,"" he said. 
While the ministry has no say in currency policy, it is the only government department which holds a daily news briefing that foreign reporters can attend.
Neither the People's Bank of China nor the State Administration of Foreign Exchange responded to requests for comment on Mnuchin's remarks.
China's yuan , battered by the trade brawl and strong dollar, has lost more than 7 percent against the greenback since the end of the first quarter.
Around $505 billion of Chinese goods were imported to the United States in 2017, leading to a trade deficit of nearly $376 billion, U.S. government data shows. Chinese imports from the United States totaled $205 billion in the first five months of 2018, with the deficit reaching $152 billion.
Earlier this month, the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. China promptly levied taxes on the same value of U.S. products.

""We advise the U.S side to remain calm and maintain a rational attitude,"" Geng said.

601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Goldman Says American Factories Are More Competitive Than You Think,"(Bloomberg) -- American manufacturers remain competitive and lower goods exports aren’t solely to blame for a widening U.S. trade deficit and fewer manufacturing jobs, according to analysis by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
It sees three key factors explaining the burgeoning trade gap and fall in production jobs:
“Rising budget deficits have increased the trade deficit by lowering national net savings,” Goldman economists led by Chief Economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note. “The rise in foreign demand for U.S. safe assets has likely also boosted the trade deficit through lower U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar.""
For now, Goldman is tipping the boost to U.S. second-quarter GDP from this year’s export surge will start to fade.
""We expect the trade deficit to rise further with strong U.S. demand and fiscal easing while the effects of tariffs are ambiguous, but likely smaller,” it said. “Overall, we expect a trade drag on GDP growth of one-quarter percentage point in 2018H2-2020."""
602,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",The Fed Was ‘America First’ Long Before Trump,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Donald Trump has to decide what he wants.
Rising interest rates, which he says he doesn't like, are a reflection of a strong economy. He loves to take credit for the latter and frequently boasts about how great things are since he came to office. One begets the other.
America isn’t being penalized for doing well, as Trump complained in a tweet Friday aimed at the Federal Reserve.That plays to his core supporters’ sense of grievance, but it ignores economic reality.

Same with the dollar, another strain of imagined wrong emanating from the Oval Office these days. If the American economy outperforms those overseas and the Fed raises rates more often and further than the others, then that tends to strengthen the dollar. Central bankers don’t plot against presidents; their enemy is policy that leads to a poorer U.S. economy. Is Trump really asking for that?
There's more than the Fed at work here. Trump inherited an economic expansion that was already among the longest on record and may well become the longest. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress gave the economy a late-cycle caffeine hit with tax cuts. Tariffs, everything else being equal, tend to be inflationary. Again, interest rates go up.
To disavow higher interest rates and a stronger dollar is to disavow himself and the people he appointed.
It’s a pity he’s taken on the Fed. No matter its flaws, it’s an institution staffed by adults who believe deeply in public service. Trump's nominees to the Fed board have all been sound and wouldn’t look out of place as Hillary Clinton nominees. Until this week, he’s left the Fed alone. That was the right approach. It still is.
Let’s look at what the Fed has done. Nobody can credibly claim to be surprised or disappointed. It’s been raising rates gently since 2015, recently in quarter-point steps every three months, each of them very well telegraphed. Even so, at the present setting of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, the benchmark federal funds rate is low by historical standards.
Most other central banks are pulling back on the stimulus, but not as much as the Fed. But it’s mostly a difference of degree, rather than kind. America’s economy is stronger than most and is further along the path of recovery from 2008 and its aftermath.
Interest rates are going up in the U.K. and Canada. The European Central Bank, which manages the euro zone, is wrapping up the bond buying that’s kept interest rates near zero. The ECB is still a long way from raising its benchmark rate. Japan is continuing with its quantitative easing because its struggle to generate enough inflation is the most challenging.
Is the European Union manipulating the euro, as Trump claims? If he is referring to quantitative easing by the ECB, he may have a point. Then again, the Fed did it first. The ECB hasn’t directly intervened in the foreign-exchange market for years and has only done so in times of emergency — and often in conjunction with the U.S.
China is a different game. Despite strides toward greater flexibility, the currency is heavily managed by the People’s Bank of China. As I wrote July 3, little happens with the yuan that authorities don’t tolerate or directly authorize. Trump is on firmer ground here.
Still, Trump needs to accept a bit of blame. China’s economy is softening, exacerbated by trade conflict, so the PBOC is comfortable letting the yuan drop. There may be more to come. Bloomberg Economics estimates the yuan may still be about 6 percent overvalued. It has lost 4 percent in the past month.
There is more going on in China than its clashes with Trump. The government has been trying to wean state enterprises and big banks off debt, which is slowing growth. Economic reports for June demonstrated a succinct weakening of activity. Soft landings are hard and it’s not inconceivable China stops trying to thread the needle and goes for an open-slather easing. In theory, that would mean the yuan weakens against the dollar.
Trump has to decide what he wants: Low interest rates or a strong economy. His first step? Recognizing there is a choice to be made."
603,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:21AM ET</span>","Mortgage, Groupon and card debt: how the bottom half bolsters U.S. economy","By Jonathan Spicer
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - By almost every measure, the U.S. economy is booming. But a look behind the headlines of roaring job growth and consumer spending reveals how the boom continues in large part by the poorer half of Americans fleecing their savings and piling up debt.
A Reuters analysis of U.S. household data shows that the bottom 60 percent of income-earners have accounted for most of the rise in spending over the past two years even as the their finances worsened - a break with a decades-old trend where the top 40 percent had primarily fueled consumption growth.
With borrowing costs on the rise, inflation picking up and the effects of President Donald Trump's tax cuts set to wear off, a negative shock - a further rise in gasoline prices or a jump in the cost of goods due to tariffs - could push those most vulnerable over the edge, some economists warn.
That in turn could threaten the second-longest U.S. expansion given consumption makes up 70 percent of the U.S. economy's output.
To be sure, the housing market is far from the dangerous leverage reached in 2007 before the crash. With unemployment near its lowest since 2000 and job openings at record highs, people may also choose to work even more hours or take extra jobs rather than cut back on spending if the money gets tight.
In fact, a growing majority of Americans says they are comfortable financially, according to the Federal Reserve's report on the economic well-being of U.S. households published in May and based on a 2017 survey.
Yet by filtering data on household finances and wages by income brackets, the Reuters analysis reveals growing financial stress among lower-income households even as their contribution to consumption and the broad economy grows. 
The data shows the rise in median expenditures has outpaced before-tax income for the lower 40 percent of earners in the five years to mid-2017 while the upper half has increased its financial cushion, deepening income disparities. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LdUMBa )
It is this recovery's paradox.
A hot job market and other signs of economic health encourage rich and poor alike to spend more, but tepid wage growth for many middle-class and lower-income Americans means they need to dip into their savings and borrow more to do that.
As a result, over the past year signs of financial fragility have been multiplying, with credit card and auto loan delinquencies on the rise and savings plumbing their lowest since 2005.
Myna Whitney, 27, a certified medical assistant at Drexel University's gastroenterology unit in Philadelphia, experienced that firsthand.
Three years ago, confident that a steady full-time job offered enough financial security, she took out loans to buy a Honda Odyssey and a $119,000 house, where she lives with her mother and aunt.
Since then she has learned that making $16.47 an hour - more than about 40 percent of U.S. workers - was not enough.
""I was dipping into my savings account every month to just make all of the payments."" Whitney says. With her savings now down to $900 from $10,000 she budgets down to toilet paper and electricity. Cable TV and the occasional $5 Groupon movie outings are her indulgences, she says, but laughs off a question whether she dines out. 
""God forbid I get a ticket, or something breaks on the car. Then it's just more to recover from."" 
DRAINING SAVINGS
Stephen Gallagher, economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), says stretched finances of those in the middle dimmed the economy's otherwise positive outlook. 
""They are taking on debt that they can't repay. A drop in savings and rise in delinquencies means you can't support the (overall) spending,"" he said. An oil or trade shock could lead to ""a rather dramatic scaling back of consumption,"" he added.
Some economists say that without the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts enacted in January spending, which has grown by around 3 percent a year over the past few years, could already be stalling now.
In the past, rising incomes of the upper 40 percent of earners have driven most of the consumption growth, but since 2016 consumer spending has been primarily fueled by a run-down in savings, mainly by the bottom 60 percent of earners, according to Oxford Economics.
This reflects in part better access to credit for low-income borrowers late in the economic cycle.
Yet it is the first time in two decades that lower earners made a greater contribution to spending growth for two years in a row. 
""It's generally really hard for people to cut back on expenses, or on a certain lifestyle, especially when the context of the economy is actually really positive,"" said Gregory Daco, Oxford's chief U.S. economist. ""It's essentially a weak core that makes the back of the economy a bit more susceptible to strains and potentially to breaking.""
JOBS NOT RAISES
While the Fed expects the labor market to get even hotter this year and next, policymakers have been perplexed that wages do not reflect that.
With inflation factored in, average hourly earnings dropped by a penny in May from a year ago for 80 percent of the country's private sector workers, including those in the vast healthcare, fast food and manufacturing industries, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. 
""It stinks,"" says Jennifer Delauder, 44, who runs a medical lab at Huttonsville Correctional Center in West Virginia. In seven years her hourly wage has risen by about $2 to $14. 
She took on two part-time jobs to help pay rent, utilities and a student loan. But she still sometimes trims her weekly $15 grocery budget to make ends meet, or even gathers broken fans, car parts, and lanterns to sell as scrap metal. A $2,000 hospital bill early this year wiped out her savings. 
Even so, Delauder, a grandmother, recently signed papers for a mortgage of up to $150,000 on a house. ""I'm paying rent for a house. I might as well pay for a house that I own,"" she said.
Hourly wages for lower- and middle-income workers rose just over 2 percent in the year to March 2017, compared with about 4 percent for those near the top and bottom, while spending jumped by roughly 8 percent. 
That reflects both higher costs of essentials such as rent, prescription drugs and college tuition but also some increased discretionary spending, for example at restaurants.
Economists say one symptom of financial strain was last year's spike in serious delinquencies on U.S. credit card debt, which many poorer households use as a stop-gap measure. The $815-billion market is not big enough to rattle Wall Street, but could be an early sign of stress that might spread to other debt as the Fed continues its gradual policy tightening.
More borrowers have also been falling behind on auto loans, which helped bring leverage on non-mortgage household debt to a record high in the first quarter of this year. 
While painting a broadly positive picture, the Fed's well-being survey also noted that one in four adults feared they could not cover an emergency $400 expense and one in five struggled with monthly bills. This month the central bank reported to Congress that rising delinquencies among riskier borrowers represented ""pockets of stress.""
That many Americans lack any financial safety net remains a concern, New York Fed President John Williams told Reuters in an interview last month. ""Even though the overall picture is pretty good, pretty solid, or strong,"" he said, ""this is a problem that continues to hang over half of our country.""

The Commerce Ministry said on Monday the investigation will target imports of stainless steel billet and hot-rolled stainless steel sheet and plate from the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, which nearly tripled last year.
The move follows a complaint by Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel (SZ:000825), with backing from four other state-owned mills including Baosteel's stainless steel division, which blamed cheap imports on falling prices, it said.
China makes and consumes around half of the world's stainless steel, which is used to protect against corrosion in buildings, transportation and packaging. 
While the complaint targets eight foreign producers, it also lists a number Chinese companies, including the Indonesian unit of one of the world's top producers, Tsingshan Stainless Steel, and 19 traders who import product.
Some private Chinese companies have opened or started building plants in Indonesia in recent years, drawing on its plentiful nickel resources and lower-cost of production. 
A significant portion of the new production has been sold in China, analysts say. 
The rapid increase in imports damaged the Chinese market, according to the complaint filed by Shanxi Taigang and released with the commerce ministry document.
Almost two-thirds of China's stainless imports came from Indonesia last year, up from 5 percent in 2016 and zero in 2015, the complaint said. That rose to as high as 86 percent in the first quarter, it said.
Imported prices of the stainless steel products fell 23 percent to $1,867 a ton in 2017 from $2,436 a year earlier.
""If we allow these products to continue to enter the Chinese market with low prices and take more market share, sales of China's domestic products will continue to decrease,"" the complaint said.
Peter Peng, senior consultant at CRU in Beijing, said the investigation was ""totally driven by an industrial dispute between SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and the fast-growing private mills.""
""Due to their cheap production costs, it's more competitive than Chinese products,"" he said.
Tsingshan opened a mill there last year with annual capacity of 3 million tonnes while Delong Holdings (SI:DELO) plans to start production there next year.
Anti-dumping duties would force mills to find new markets for their product, adding to a global glut, Peng said.
The European companies targeted by the probe include Spain's  Acerinox  (MC:ACX), Finland's Outokumpu Oyj (HE:OUT1V) and Luxembourg-based  Aperam  (AS:APAM).
Among the Japanese companies are Nisshin Steel Co Ltd (T:5413), Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401) and JFE Steel Corp [JFEST.UL]. Indonesia's PT Jindal Stainless and South Korean steelmaker Posco (KS:005490) are also listed.
China imported 703,000 tonnes of those products in 2017, up almost 200 percent from a year earlier, with 98 percent coming from the regions targeted by the investigation.

Shanxi Taigang accounts for 25-35 percent of China's stainless production.

The bill, which needs approval by Parliament before becoming law, would also introduce a committee to set monetary policy rather than leave the decision to the central bank's governor.
The proposed changes had been flagged by the Labour-led coalition government that came into power in October.

RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr and Finance Minister Grant Robertson agreed that maximizing sustainable employment would be a consideration alongside inflation targeting in an policy agreement struck in March.

The BOJ offered to buy 10-year securities at a fixed rate of 0.11 percent after the yield had gained as much as six basis points to 0.09 percent, the highest since February. The benchmark pared its advance after the operation was announced to 0.065 percent.
Any change to Bank of Japan’s stimulus would be the first since 2016 when it introduced control of the yield curve in a bid to lower borrowing costs. The policy has crimped profits at banks and depressed the bond market, with recent media reports suggesting that officials are looking for anything from ways to mitigate the side effects to allowing a natural rise in interest rates.
“If the BOJ were really to steer toward a complete change in policy, it would undoubtedly call for bond selling, but I don’t feel like it’s the case now,’’ said Tadashi Matsukawa, head of fixed-income investment at PineBridge Investments Japan Ltd. The initial gain in yields “looks excessive,’’ he said.
The BOJ has a yield target of about zero percent for the 10-year bond, and conducts fixed-rate operations whenever yields surged to levels deemed as excessive.
The yen shrugged off the operations to continue to trade 0.5 percent higher at 110.84 against the dollar at 10:36 a.m. Tokyo.
Speculation of a policy change spurred a similar move in markets in January. While Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his board said later that they would consider discussing exiting the stimulus policy from fiscal 2019, they have also said persistently that there would no change until an inflation target of 2 percent has been reached.
“I know absolutely nothing about the basis for those reports,” Kuroda said when asked about the media reports while he was in Buenos Aires to attend a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors.
Bloomberg’s reporting indicates that officials are focused on coming up with adjustments to mitigate harm without doing anything resembling a move to policy normalization.

“It’s either you strike a deal with all, or you don’t strike a deal,” Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra told Bloomberg in an interview at the Group of 20 nations meeting in Buenos Aires. “One of the things that is very clear from this whole episode is that it is practically and legally impossible to strike a deal with one of the countries of the European Union, rather than with the European Union as a whole.”
His remarks come days before European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker travels to Washington to meet President Donald Trump. The EU will propose exploring the possibility of reducing car tariffs for several key trade partners, people with knowledge of the plans said last week.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has argued that the U.S. must “return to reason” and rescind its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports before European countries discuss overhauling aspects of global trade. His view contrasts with that of German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who said on Sunday that it remains “unchanged” that the U.S. should reverse the steps it has taken, while emphasizing “it’s important that we speak with one another.”
Asked about the apparent differences in the two leaders positions, Scholz stressed there is complete agreement in the region that trade issues must be faced together, and that individual national solutions won’t be able to overcome the challenges.
“One of the consequences, which probably wasn’t the aim of the U.S. president’s policies, could be an incredible speeding up of the European Union’s integration process,” he told reporters. “Everyone is starting to realize that we will only be strong together.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will showcase American-made products ranging from beef jerky and cowboy boots to the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35 fighter jet on Monday, as his administration wages trade battles on a series of fronts.
A White House spokeswoman said on Sunday that Trump would make remarks at the exhibit designed to demonstrate the administration's ""commitment to ensuring more products are made in America."" Vice President Mike Pence, six Cabinet secretaries and some dozen other senior officials will also attend. 
The U.S. Commerce Department held a hearing on Thursday into its investigation over whether imported vehicles and parts pose a national security risk. All major automakers, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which will have an F-150 pickup truck on display at the White House exhibit, oppose imposing vehicle and parts tariffs of up to 25 percent.
Trump told CNBC on Friday he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China, threatening to escalate a clash over trade policy that has unnerved financial markets. Washington has already imposed 25 percent duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports and threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. China has retaliated on $34 billion of U.S. goods.
Citing national security, Washington imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico on June 1.
On Wednesday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will meet with Trump. EU officials have dampened expectations about what Juncker can achieve.
The finance ministers for Mexico and Canada said on Sunday they were optimistic about NAFTA talks with the United States, even as trade tensions spurred by U.S. tariffs dominated the G20 meeting of world economic leaders in Argentina.
Other products to be displayed at the White House on Monday include Wiffle balls and bats from Connecticut, Viking Range LLC stoves from Mississippi and Moon Pies sweets from Tennessee.
The White House will also show off cookie cutters from Vermont, pepperoni rolls from West Virginia, jeans from Oklahoma, gun safes from Utah, snowboards from Colorado and livestock feed from Iowa.
Lockheed Martin, which will display a model of the F-35 on the White House lawn, will also showcase the Orion Spacecraft, ""the cornerstone of NASA’s future missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond,"" the company said.

609,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",U.K. Says EU Must Help on Brexit to Avoid 'No Deal by Accident',"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is heading to Berlin on Monday to warn that the EU needs to do its part to avoid the chaotic scenario of Britain leaving without a divorce deal.
“Our European partners must show much more flexibility and creativity in negotiations if we are to avoid a ’no deal by accident’ scenario,” he said in a statement.
The remarks came a day after Britain’s new chief Brexit negotiator said the government must step up planning for the possibility that talks with the European Union collapse.
“Any responsible government must make sure we have planning in place in case of a no-deal outcome,” said Dominic Raab, who, like Hunt, was appointed to his post this month after his predecessor resigned in protest. Speaking on the “Andrew Marr Show” Sunday on BBC television, he said “we want the best deal possible.”
In comments that will please hardline Brexit supporters, Raab said that Britons needn’t worry about the prospect of no deal emerging, when asked about how that might strand imports at borders, create the need to stockpile food, prevent airplanes from landing, or negate residency rights for Britons abroad or foreigners living in the U.K.
While he expects to reach an accord, planning is underway in “every aspect” to make sure the country can cope if he doesn’t, Raab said. Hardliners are pushing for more no deal preparations so the U.K. can credibly threaten to walk away from talks, a prospect that worries U.K. businesses.
The remarks follow an interview with the Sunday Telegraph in which Raab said that the U.K. would refuse to pay the 39-billion pound ($51 billion) divorce bill with the EU if the bloc fails to agree on a trade deal. Brexit is dividing the country and Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party, which is split between those who want a clean break with the EU and those who want to maintain closer ties.
With Parliament heading into its summer recess this week, May and her cabinet are heading to the northeast of England for meetings. The government will confirm increased investment in the regional rail line and transfer more power to local government in the region, her office said in a statement.
‘Absolutely Catastrophic’
Dominic Grieve, a Conservative member of Parliament, said on Sky News’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday” that some members of his party “actively are seeking” to leave the bloc without a new trade arrangement.
“No deal would be absolutely catastrophic,” Grieve said. “If the government thinks no deal is possible, it might take emergency measures, but let’s be realistic -- we will be in a state of emergency.”
The tension is also affecting the opposition Labour Party. John McDonnell, Labour’s spokesman on the economy, equivocated on whether he would support a second Brexit referendum and argued that the main contribution a Labour government could make would be to “change the whole atmosphere of the negotiations.” Speaking on Sky News, he said he’d like to see a general election soon, though he expects the government to cling to office for a while yet.
A poll published July 21 showed that the number of voters who oppose May’s draft plan for a future trading arrangement vastly exceeds those who support it, 43 percent to 12 percent. Voters are also prepared to back new political parties -- either a right-wing group supporting Brexit or a centrist force opposed to leaving the EU.
Raab became Brexit secretary on July 9 after David Davis resigned the post in protest May’s divorce blueprint. Raab said he’s going back to Brussels for more negotiations on Thursday.
The U.K. shouldn’t make further concessions to the EU, according to Conservative politician Owen Paterson. He said on Sky that the current plan already prevents Britain from leaving in “a clean way” and that concerns about no deal are overblown. “We should be preparing for trade on World Trade Organization terms,” Paterson said. “I just don’t see how it could be such a disaster.”
John Major, the former Conservative prime minister and elder statesman of the party, summed up the predicament.
“There are a considerable number of Conservative MPs who are, on the subject of Europe, irreconcilable,” he said on the BBC. “The danger at the moment is that they will frustrate every move the government makes and that, by accident, we will crash out without a deal.”

610,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 06:57PM ET</span>",G20 calls for stepped-up trade dialogue; no agreement on path forward,"By David Lawder and Daniel Flynn
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Global finance leaders called on Sunday for stepped-up dialogue to prevent trade and geopolitical tensions from hurting growth, but ended a two-day G20 meeting with little consensus on how to resolve multiple disputes over U.S. tariff actions.
The finance ministers and central bank governors from the world's 20 largest economies warned that growth, while still strong, was becoming less synchronized and downside risks over the short- and medium-term had increased.
""These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies,"" the G20 finance officials said in a communique.
""We ... recognize the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence,"" the communique said.
This marked a strengthening of language compared to their previous statement issued in March, in which they simply ""recognize the need for further dialogue.""
""The latest language suggests a great deal of urgency about resolving these issues,"" Australia Treasurer Scott Morrison told Reuters in an interview, adding that the ministers had made it clear in the discussion that they were concerned about ""tit-for-tat measures"" and that open trade was the goal.
""The language previously had been a bit ambiguous about that, a bit sheepish,"" Morrison added.
The weekend talks in Buenos Aires came at a time of escalating rhetoric in the trade conflict between the United States and China, the world's largest economies, which have so far slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods.
U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday with a threat to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese exports to the United States unless Beijing agrees to major structural changes to its technology transfer, industrial subsidy and joint venture policies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a news conference on Sunday that he had had no substantive discussions on trade with China's finance minister, Liu Kun, at the G20 gathering, engaging mainly in ""chit-chat.""
""Any time they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available,"" Mnuchin added.
The Chinese delegation did not speak to media at the G20 meeting.
G7 TRADE OVERTURES
Mnuchin focused instead on other trade relationships at the talks, including those with the European Union, Canada, Mexico and Japan.
He said G7 allies were taking seriously his calls to eliminate tariffs, non-tariff barriers and subsidies among the group, and the Trump administration would pursue such ideas in trade talks next week with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington.
Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau called the dropping of barriers a ""great idea"" and an ""aspirational target,"" but said it would be challenging to execute because of historical economic differences.
Before any trade talks with the EU could begin, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire insisted that Washington first would need to drop its tariffs on steel and aluminum and stand down on a threat to impose auto tariffs.
European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici told reporters that the meeting was not tense, but produced little movement from entrenched positions on trade.
""We were in mutual listening mode and I hope that this is the beginning of something,"" Moscovici said. ""But still the positions are not similar.""
Finance ministers for both Mexico and Canada said they saw optimism from Washington that an agreement to modernize the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could be reached in coming months after talks stalled.
ALLIES ANGERED
Trump has angered allies by imposing import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, sparking retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada on a range of U.S. products.
Trump, who frequently criticizes Europe's 10 percent car tariffs, is also studying adding a 25 percent levy on auto imports, which would hit both Europe and Japan hard.
Mnuchin said he did not feel isolated at the G20, holding numerous bilateral meetings with officials, and arguing that Trump's trade stance was not based on protectionism, but on trying to make trade fairer.
""We very much support the idea that trade is important to the global economy, but it's got to be on fair and reciprocal terms,"" he said.
Hubert Fuchs, European Council representative to the G20, said he welcomed Mnuchin's candid approach, but said the United States ""understands something different under fair and free trade.""

612,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Mexico, Canada optimistic about NAFTA despite G20 trade tensions","By Luc Cohen and David Lawder
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The finance ministers for Mexico and Canada on Sunday said they were optimistic about NAFTA talks with the United States, even as trade tensions spurred by U.S. tariffs dominated the G20 meeting of world economic leaders in Argentina.
Mexico Finance Minister Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya said there were still several chapters of NAFTA that had not yet been closed, but that the renegotiation could be completed before incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office on Dec. 1 after his landslide victory in this month's election.
""There exists a possibility that we can arrive at some type of arrangement,"" Gonzalez Anaya told Reuters in an interview, adding that he discussed the talks to modernize the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement during a bilateral meeting with his Canadian counterpart, Finance Minister Bill Morneau. 
""It has always existed, and we hope that it stays on track."" 
The long-running renegotiation, launched by U.S. President Donald Trump last year, has taken on a renewed sense of urgency since Lopez Obrador's victory. The leftist former mayor of Mexico City has said he plans to maintain NAFTA, and his allies have said the transition team will take part in talks.
Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports were still casting a shadow on NAFTA talks, Morneau said. Ire over the measures from the European Union, Japan and others have isolated U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. 
Morneau said that he sensed ""optimism"" from Mnuchin about moving forward on NAFTA, and that Mnuchin had assured him that the administration was committed to a trilateral deal despite Trump's suggestion that the United States could move forward with separate bilateral deals. 
""That change in Mexico presents us with the opportunity to restart those discussions. We're going to do that in earnest,"" Morneau told reporters. We're going to work towards trying to get to an agreement in the time frame that we've got in the next few months.""
Morneau said he plans to travel to Mexico next week to meet with the incoming administration. Gonzalez Anaya added that he had a ""very good chat"" during an informal meeting last week with Carlos Urzua, who Lopez Obrador has tapped for the finance minister's role.

""I have a very good impression of him,"" Gonzalez Anaya said.

613,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things To Watch This Week: Trade, Earnings, GDP","Investing.com - Market focus in the week ahead will be largely attuned to the next potential steps of the brewing trade war between the United States and its major trading partners, most notably China and the European Union.
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions having an impact on global economic growth.
The coming week also marks the busiest one of the second-quarter earnings season on Wall Street, with many of the big-name U.S. technology stocks, such as Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, set to report in the days ahead.
There is also important second-quarter U.S. growth data this week, which is expected to show the economy expanded at its fastest pace in four years in the April-June period.
Meanwhile, on the central bank front, markets are keeping an eye on the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting for further guidance on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. U.S.-China Trade Tensions
Escalating trade rhetoric will keep investors on their toes as they watch further developments amid an ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
President Donald Trump warned on Friday that he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of goods the U.S. imports from China, remarks that threatened to escalate a trade clash with the Asian giant.
The world's two largest economies appeared increasingly headed toward open trade conflict after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U.S. complaints over Chinese industrial policies, lack of market access in China and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit.
Washington has already imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $200 billion being looked at. In return, Beijing levied taxes on the same value of U.S. products.
Additionally, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that the U.S. is monitoring the recent weakness in China's yuan, and will review whether the currency has been manipulated.
Mnuchin's comments raised the specter of designating China as a currency manipulator for the first time since the early days of the Trump administration in 2017.
The yuan has lost 7.5% of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter, prompting speculation that Chinese policymakers are allowing their currency to weaken in order to offset the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, by making their exports more competitive.
2. Trump-Juncker Meeting
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday to discuss strained trade relations between the European Union and the United States.
The meeting comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and amid Trump's repeated threats to extend those measures to European cars.
Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said last week he expected Juncker to come with a ""significant"" trade offer.
However, EU officials have sought to lower expectations about what Juncker can achieve and downplayed suggestions that he will arrive with a novel plan to restore good relations.
The bloc previously offered to open its markets wider to U.S. imports, including cars, as part of a reciprocal but limited trade deal, but Washington rebuffed the proposal.
3. Google, Facebook, Amazon Highlight Busy Week Of Earnings
There are about 170 S&P 500 companies and 11 Dow members reporting earnings in what will be the busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Most of the focus will be on the FANG group of stocks. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports after Monday's closing bell, followed by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the bell on Wednesday, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which reports Thursday after the markets close.
Some of other high-profile tech names reporting this week are Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Among non-tech names, Boeing (NYSE:BA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), UPS (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Ford (NYSE:F), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are also on the docket for this week.



So far, 87 S&P 500 companies have released their latest quarterly results, of which 83% have beat consensus estimates, according to FactSet.
4. U.S. Advanced Second Quarter GDP
Investors will keep an eye on a preliminary reading of second-quarter U.S. growth due at 8:30AM ET Friday for further clues on when and how fast the Federal reserve will raise interest rates.
The report is expected to show the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.1% in the April-June period, nearly double the first quarter's output. That would be the highest since the third quarter of 2014.
Besides the GDP report, this week's rather light economic calendar also features data on existing home sales and durable goods orders.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy during congressional testimony last week, reaffirming expectations for two additional rate hikes by the central bank this year.
However, Trump launched a rare attack on the U.S. central bank late last week, claiming that their plans to raise interest rates risked undermining his efforts at strengthening the economy.
He also lamented the strength of the U.S. dollar in posts on Twitter and accused China and the EU of currency and interest-rate manipulation that he claims has put the U.S. at a disadvantage.






5. European Central Bank Policy Meeting
The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep interest rates at their current record low levels at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting at 1145GMT (7:45AM ET) on Thursday.
President Mario Draghi will hold a closely-watched press conference 45 minutes after the rate announcement as investors seek further clues on when the central bank plans to start hiking borrowing costs.
At its previous meeting in June, the ECB pledged to keep interest rates at current levels until ""at least through the summer"" of 2019.
Some ECB policymakers apparently still want a June 2019 rate rise, while others see trade tensions as a reason to stay loose for longer.
According to a Reuters poll of economists taken July 10-18, the ECB will raise rates in the third quarter next year, before President Mario Draghi's term ends in October 2019.
This week's calendar also features flash July PMI surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity, which should give some indication of how the region's economy is coping with global trade conflicts, Italian politics and messy Brexit negotiations.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Turkish finance minister sees promising outlook for economic growth: Anadolu,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is continuing its strong economic growth trend and the foundations of its economy are strong, new Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying by state media on Sunday.
Concerns about the central bank's independence intensified after President Tayyip Erdogan appointed his son-in-law Albayrak as treasury and finance minister, boosting expectations that the president - a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"" - will look to exercise greater influence over monetary policy.
The Turkish lira has been hammered this year, losing a fifth of its value against the U.S. dollar, on concerns about the central bank's ability to rein in double-digit inflation, while Erdogan has repeatedly called for lower interest rates. 
Albayrak, who is in Argentina for a G20 meeting, was quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as saying the government's recent policies were aimed at maintaining prudent fiscal policies, seeing healthy credit growth, carrying out structural reforms and strengthening Turkey's monetary policy framework.
""Turkey's economy continues its strong growth momentum. Our economic foundations are going to be strong and our outlook is promising,"" Albayrak said.
With Erdogan having merged the Treasury and the Finance Ministry, Albayrak's appointment effectively saw him replace both Mehmet Simsek and Naci Agbal in a cabinet that now has no obvious investor-friendly ministers.
Albayrak's comments, therefore, are closely watched by investors for clues on whether he will seek to calm financial markets by adopting a more orthodox approach to monetary policy or reiterate Erdogan's views that high interest rates stoke inflation.
Following his appointment, Albayrak said the central bank is independent and will do whatever economic realities and market conditions necessitate.
The central bank's monetary policy committee, which has raised rates by 500 basis points since April in an effort to put a floor under the currency, will meet on July 24.
On the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Albayrak said on Twitter that he had met with his U.S., Chinese, German, Brazilian, South Korean, French and Indonesian counterparts.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>",Dubai recipe for economic success looks stale as markets slump,"By Andrew Torchia
DUBAI (Reuters) - In Dubai's posh Jumeirah Beach Residence district, luxury apartment rents are down about 15 percent from a year ago - a sign, some fear, that the wealthy emirate's recipe for economic success is getting stale.
For over two decades, Dubai prospered as one of the world's most international cities, attracting people and capital from across the globe. 
Nine years ago, it needed a $20 billion bailout from oil-rich Abu Dhabi to escape a debt crisis caused by collapsing property prices. Dubai's economy roared back and has grown by a third since then, buoyed by foreign trade, tourism and its status as the main regional hub for business services. 
Now, however, Dubai is hitting another rough patch. Residential property prices have dropped by more than 15 percent since late 2014 and are still falling. The stock market is down 13 percent this year, the worst performance in the region.
Dubai issued 4,722 new business licenses in the second quarter of 2018, down 26 percent from the same period in 2016, the year when new licenses peaked.
The falls may be temporary, the result of an economic slowdown in the Gulf caused by low oil prices. But other figures suggest some of Dubai's traditional growth engines are losing steam, which could mean a long-term slump. 
Growth in passenger traffic through Dubai's international airport has fallen to near zero this year, after 15 years of strong increases. Increasingly long-range aircraft may loosen Dubai's dominance as a travel hub connecting Asia and Europe.
Official data shows Dubai's population continuing to expand, by 3.5 percent to 3.08 million in the first half of 2018. But most growth in recent years has been in lower-paid construction and services jobs, not in higher-paid white-collar posts. 
""Perhaps the era when one could move to Dubai to make one's wealth is passing,"" said Hasnain Malik, Dubai-based global head of equity research and strategy at Exotix Capital.
He said the city was increasingly attractive as a base for rich people from around the world who wished to enjoy their wealth. 
But it is not clear that Dubai's transport industries and business zones can continue growing fast enough to attract, and retain, the number of foreign white-collar workers needed to support demand in its real estate market, Malik said.

STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES
Economists see little risk of another financial crisis; after restructuring billions of dollars of debt, Dubai's state-linked companies are less leveraged than they were a decade ago. 
Nor has headline economic growth slowed greatly. International Monetary Fund officials have estimated gross domestic product will expand over 3 percent this year.
""The emirate continues to attract businesses and investors as a competitive hub for sustainable business development,"" Dubai's Department of Economic Development said in a statement this week, adding that licensing figures showed ""continued investment in all vital economic sectors in Dubai"".
But much of this year's growth is due to a big rise in state spending as Dubai builds infrastructure to host the Expo 2020 world's fair; its 2018 budget soared 19.5 percent from 2017 to a record 56.6 billion dirhams ($15.4 billion). The government cannot keep boosting spending at that speed indefinitely.
Jim Krane, energy fellow at Rice University in Texas and author of ""City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism"", said the emirate faced structural challenges including an increasingly tough geopolitical environment.
In the past, Dubai thrived by keeping cordial relations with every country in the region, accepting trade and investment from all of them.
That has become impossible. Last year, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, ending Dubai's role as a base for business with the small but super-rich country. 
Goods that were once shipped to Qatar via Dubai now move via other countries, such as Oman or India; multinational firms use their European or U.S. offices, not their Dubai operations, to handle business with Qatar.
Meanwhile, the United States and Gulf allies, including the UAE, are trying to squeeze Iran's economy by reducing its financial and trade ties. The effort is more aggressive than Washington's previous attempt to isolate Iran several years ago, diplomats in the region say.
That matters because the UAE's exports and re-exports to Iran, the vast majority via Dubai, totalled $19.9 billion in 2017.
The chief executive of a foreign financial firm in Dubai said the emirate faced unprecedented competition from neighboring countries for capital, as low oil prices forced those countries to develop their own non-oil industries.
Portfolio funds are already flowing from Dubai's stock market to Saudi Arabia's bourse. In coming years, direct investment may follow; U.S. oilfield services firm McDermott International has said it expects to move business slowly from Dubai's Jebel Ali Port to a new Saudi facility by the mid-2020s.
Dubai is trying to shore up its competitive position. In the last few months the government has said it will reduce municipal fees, scrap some aviation charges, freeze school costs and take other steps to aid foreign firms and residents.
Potentially the most far-reaching reform was announced by the UAE cabinet, chaired by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. It promised to permit 100 percent foreign ownership of some UAE-based businesses, up from the current 49 percent limit, and grant long-term residency visas of up to 10 years to foreign investors and some professionals. 
That could make foreign investment in Dubai more attractive and, by helping foreigners plan on long-term residence in the emirate, encourage them to buy homes. 
But details of the new policy have not been released, and implementing it may be tricky. ""Free zones"" in Dubai already permit 100 percent foreign ownership; they could suffer if they no longer have that right exclusively. And many UAE citizens make money as silent partners with foreign businessmen.

""To some extent, the economy is based on people renting out their passports - disrupting that could cause economic pain among the local population,"" the financial executive said.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",German industry groups warn U.S. on tariffs before Trump-Juncker meeting,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industry groups warned on Sunday, before European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker meets U.S. President Donald Trump this week, that tariffs the United States has imposed or is threatening to introduce risk harming America itself.
Citing national security grounds, Washington imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico on June 1 and Trump is threatening to extend them to EU cars and car parts. Juncker will discuss trade with Trump at a meeting on Wednesday. 
""The tariffs under the guise of national security should be abolished,"" Dieter Kempf, head of Germany's BDI industry association said. Juncker should tell Trump that the United States would harm itself with tariffs on cars and car parts, he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
The German auto industry employed more than 118,000 people in the United States and 60 percent of what they produced was exported. ""Europe should not let itself be blackmailed and should put in a confident appearance in the United States,"" he added.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio on Sunday he hoped it was still possible to find a solution that was attractive to both sides. ""For us, that means we stand by open markets and low tariffs,"" he said
He said the possibility of U.S. tariffs on EU cars was very serious and stressed that reductions in international tariffs in the last 40 years and the opening of markets had resulted in major benefits for citizens.
EU officials have tried to lower expectations about what Juncker can achieve, and played down suggestions that he will arrive in Washington with a novel plan to restore good relations.
Altmaier said it was difficult to estimate the impact of any U.S. car tariffs on the German economy, but added: ""Tariffs on aluminum and steel had a volume of just over six billion euros. In this case we would be talking about almost ten times that.""
He said he hoped job losses could be avoided but noted that trade between Europe and the United States made up around one third of total global trade.
""You can imagine that if we go down with a cold in the German-American or European-American relationship, many others around us will get pneumonia so it's highly risky and that's why we need to end this conflict as quickly as possible."" 

Eric Schweitzer, president of the DIHK Chambers of Commerce, told Welt am Sonntag the German economy had for decades counted on open markets and a reliable global trading system but added: ""Every day German companies feel the transatlantic rift getting wider.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The United States sought to woo Europe and Japan with free trade deals on Saturday to gain leverage in an escalating tariff war with China but its overtures faced stiff resistance from France at a G20 finance ministers meeting dominated by trade tensions.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the gathering of the financial leaders of the world's 20 largest economies in Buenos Aires that he was renewing President Donald Trump's proposal that G7 allies drop trade barriers between them.
""If Europe believes in free trade, we're ready to sign a free trade agreement,"" Mnuchin said, adding that such a deal would require the elimination of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and subsidies. ""It has to be all three issues.""
Trump has angered European allies by imposing import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, causing the European Union to retaliate with similar amounts of tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon and other products.
Trump, who frequently criticizes Europe's 10 percent car tariffs, is also studying adding a 25 percent levy on automotive imports, which would hit both Europe and Japan hard.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the European Union would not consider launching trade talks with the United States unless Trump first withdraws the steel and aluminum tariffs and stands down on a car tariff threat.
""We refuse to negotiate with a gun to our head,"" Le Maire told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. 
Mnuchin's offer to the European Union and Japan - along with a renewed effort to jump-start stalled talks with Mexico and Canada to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement - come as the United States and China are at loggerheads in an escalating trade dispute with no talks in sight.
The world's two largest economies have slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods so far. Trump on Friday threatened to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese exports to the United States unless Beijing agrees to major structural changes to its technology transfer, industrial subsidy and joint venture policies.
Mnuchin is not meeting formally with any Chinese officials at the G20 meeting, but said that was because his normal counterpart, top Chinese economic adviser Liu He, is not attending.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also warned that the recent wave of trade tariffs would significantly harm global growth.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde presented the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Buenos Aires with a report warning that existing trade restrictions would reduce global output by 0.5 percent.
In the briefing note prepared for G20 ministers, the IMF said global economic growth may peak at 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, while downside risks have increased due to the growing trade conflict.
Lagarde's presentation came shortly after Mnuchin said there was no ""macro"" effect yet on the U.S. economy. 
Mnuchin said that, while there were some ""micro"" effects such as retaliation against U.S.-produced soybeans, lobsters and bourbon, he did not believe that tariffs would keep the United States from achieving sustained 3 percent growth this year. 
""I still think from a macro basis we do not see any impact on what's very positive growth,"" Mnuchin said, adding that he is closely monitoring prices of steel, aluminum, timber and soybeans.
G7 ALLIES
The U.S. dollar fell the most in three weeks on Friday against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) after Trump complained again about the greenback's strength and about Federal Reserve interest rate rises, halting a rally that had driven the dollar to its highest in a year.
The last G20 finance meeting in Buenos Aires in late March ended with no firm agreement by ministers on trade policy except for a commitment to ""further dialogue.""
Brazilian Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said participants agreed the risks to the global economy had increased since their last meeting, citing rising trade tensions and higher interest rates by major central banks. 
He said the final communique would reflect the need for members, particularly in emerging markets that have been roiled by currency weakness, to undertake reforms to protect themselves against volatility.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he would use the meeting to advocate for a rules-based trading system, but that expectations were low.
""I don't expect tangible progress to be made at this meeting,"" Scholz told reporters on the plane to Buenos Aires.
The U.S. tariffs will cost Germany up to 20 billion euros ($23.44 billion) in income this year, according to the head of German think-tank IMK.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he hoped the debate at the G20 gathering would lead to an easing of retaliatory trade measures.

""Trade protectionism benefits no one involved,"" he said. ""I think restraint will eventually take hold.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda issued a plea on Saturday 
for leaders of major economies to step back from a tariff war, and said stable currency markets were to everyone's benefit.
Kuroda spoke on arrival at a meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders, in response to questions on assertions from U.S. President Donald Trump that Europe and China were manipulating their currencies in favour of their economies.
""It is most desirable for currencies to move stably and reflect economic fundamentals,"" Kuroda said. ""This is something we have already reached agreement about at Group of 7 and at G20 (level).""
Kuroda also sent hoped debate at the G20 would lead to an easing of retaliatory tariff increases between the United States and China.
""Trade protectionism poses merits to no one involved. I think restraint will eventually take hold,"" he said.
Trump has broken with precedent in his presidential role in recent days with comments criticising the dollar's strength and the monetary policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks in China and Europe, 
He tweeted on Friday that Fed rate hikes were taking away the U.S.' ""competitive edge"" in exports. 
Trump's comments have sparked concern that currencies will become a new battle ground in the simmering trade war.
But, arriving in Buenos Aires, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that Trump was not trying to intervene in currency markets.
The subject is particularly sensitive for Japan because its central bank, under Kuroda's leadership, has pursued a massive quantitative easing program to spur inflation. 
After five years of easing, the BOJ's attempts to push up inflation have produced minimal results. But the yen has steadily weakened, which could lay Japan open to criticism from its trading partners.
The United States this month imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods to lower the U.S. trade deficit, and China quickly retaliated with an increase in tariffs on U.S. goods.
Trump has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a blow to Japanese exporters, and has also criticized Japan for its trade surplus and the small number of American vehicles it imports.
Asked about reports that the BOJ would debate at this month's rate review whether to make its yield curve control (YCC) policy more flexible, Kuroda said: ""It's inappropriate to say anything predictive on the outcome of the meeting.""
Reuters reported that the BOJ, facing stubbornly low inflation, is in unusually active discussions before this month's policy decision, with changes to its interest-rate targets and stock-buying techniques on the table.

Modi is seeking a second term in 2019 amid voter frustration over the abrupt implementation of a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) a year ago that has hit businesses and general public hard.
The GST council, headed by interim finance minister Piyush Goyal, agreed to lower the indirect tax slab on products such as paints, leather goods, bamboo flooring, stoves, televisions and washing machines from the highest rate of 28 percent to mostly 18 percent.
""The exercise was to ensure simplification and rationalization of GST and extend relief to the common man,"" Goyal told a news conference in New Delhi on Saturday evening.
The tax rate on ethanol blended with petrol, footwear costing up to 1,000 rupees and fertilizer grade phosphoric acid has been cut to from 12 to 5 percent, Goyal said.
The council cut taxes on sanitary pads and fortified baby milk to zero, Goyal said.
In a boost to mobile phone manufacturing and electric vehicles, the tax rate on lithium ion batteries was cut from 28 percent to 18 percent.
""The decision taken today will increase compliance and the revenue impact on total tax collections will be marginal,"" said Goyal.
The revised tax rates will be applicable from July 27.
Revenue collections from GST are a crucial pillar of government's plan to cut its fiscal deficit in the current year. India's GST collection for the fiscal 2017/18 was 98 percent of the budgeted target.
""The broad level reductions in rates could lead to lower tax collections,"" said M S Mani, partner at consulting firm Deloitte India.
However, the tax cut will lead to higher sales which could offset revenue losses, Mani added.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 09:34PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Treasury's Mnuchin watching Chinese yuan weakness for manipulation,"By David Lawder
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The United States is monitoring the recent weakness in China's yuan currency and will review whether the currency has been manipulated, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters on Friday.
Mnuchin said in an interview in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that the yuan's weakness would be reviewed as part of the U.S. Treasury's semi-annual report on currency manipulation. The report is due on Oct. 15 and will be based on activity for the first six months of 2018. 
Asked whether he was concerned that China may be using its currency as a weapon in an escalating trade fight with the United States, Mnuchin said: ""I'm not saying whether it's a weapon or not a weapon. There's no question that the weakening of the currency creates an unfair advantage for them.
""We’re going to very carefully review whether they have manipulated the currency,"" he said.
Mnuchin's comments raised the specter of designating China as a currency manipulator for the first time since the early days of the Trump administration in 2017. Treasury has refrained from making that designation despite Trump's campaign promise to do so as soon as he took office, and Trump himself in April 2017 had backed away from that stance and said that China was not a currency manipulator. [D-REUTERSNEWS-T004/I54ec94001fbd11e7a888ecab2216a893]
Mnuchin said the reason for applying the label on China is partly because the yuan had been rising or stable until earlier this year.
Various U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, and manufacturers in years past had long complained that China deliberately undervalued its currency to give its companies an unfair price advantage in international trade.
Mnuchin said he would be discussing China's non-market economy policies with Group of Seven allies Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires this weekend.
Trump, in a tweet, on Friday accused China and the European Union of manipulating their currencies, saying it is ""taking away our big competitive edge.""
He also repeated his complaints that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes were causing the dollar to rise, and said he was ready to impose U.S. tariffs on all $500 billion in goods imported from China. 
China's yuan, battered by the trade brawl, has lost 7.5 percent of its value since the end of the first quarter, hitting a year low of 6.767 to the dollar and marking its biggest 90-day drop since yuan exchange rates were unified in 1994.
Mnuchin said the Trump administration was open to a trade deal to end tariffs on Chinese goods, but only if China was sincere in making meaningful changes to its technology transfer and joint venture policies, as he noted that China frequently voices support for a rules-based trading system.
""We want them to play by the rules. And that means no forced technology transfer, no forced joint ventures and giving our companies the opportunity to compete fairly,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are issues that are completely consistent across the G7. These issues are shared jointly.""
Mnuchin said he would be discussing China's non-market economy policies with Group of Seven allies Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires this weekend.
DEAL ON REVIEWING FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS
Mnuchin also confirmed that the U.S. Congress had reached a deal for final language to modernize and strengthen security reviews of foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies and joint ventures with U.S. companies.
Mnuchin said he was pleased with the final product, but declined to discuss details, saying only that it would not target specific countries.
Mnuchin had persuaded Trump last month to use the legislation to better protect sensitive U.S. technology from Chinese acquisition, rather than ordering China-specific investment restrictions.
""It was our desire to have the proper tools to protect technology wherever it may be needed,” he said.

Mnuchin also said the Treasury was open to the possibility of lifting sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal if the right solution can be reached. He said it was not the Trump administration's objective to put the company out of business over its ties to sanctioned Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. open to lifting sanctions off aluminum giant Rusal - Mnuchin,"By David Lawder
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is open to removing Russian aluminum producer Rusal from a U.S. sanctions list, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday, adding the objective was ""not to put Rusal out of business.""
Mnuchin's comment was the latest indication the Trump administration was trying to aid sanctions-hit Rusal, which has taken a series of steps to try to appease the U.S. government and get the restrictions lifted.
The U.S. Treasury in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and the eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including Rusal, in response to what it called ""malign activities"" by Russia. But the sanctions caused havoc in the global aluminum market, prompting several countries and companies to successfully lobby Treasury for a softening of the terms on Rusal.
""The company has approached us on certain de-listing issues (from the Specially Designated Nationals List),"" Mnuchin said in an interview with Reuters in São Paulo ahead of G20 finance meetings this weekend in Argentina.
""I'm not going to go into the exact specifics of what those proposals are and where we stand on them, but, yes, if we can find an acceptable solution, that is our objective,"" Mnuchin said.
""Our objective is not to put Rusal out of business,"" he added, acknowledging that Rusal was important to the global aluminum market.
Last month Rusal shareholders elected a new board of directors, dominated by independent directors and operational managers.

Deripaska and a team of his top managers stepped down from Rusal's board of directors in May and are currently working on several options to reduce his control over the company.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.
1/CHINESE BURN
The world is increasingly uneasy about Beijing's next moves to support its economy and temper damage from higher U.S. tariffs. The yuan is at a one year-low -- state-run banks finally stepped in to its support but clearly, authorities are prepared to tolerate a weaker currency which helps exporters.
It could prove tricky, however, to keep conditions supportive while preventing big capital outflows that put the skids on the yuan. Sharp yuan depreciation poses problems for Chinese firms with dollar debt and hurt overall confidence in markets. Also, too much currency weakening will draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump who has already complained about the yuan ""dropping like a rock"".
Benchmark rate cuts are therefore unlikely. Instead, policymakers are tinkering with liquidity, including initiatives such as incentivising commercial banks to lend to small business. And after cutting banks' reserve ratios in March and June, they may cut again, potentially in September.
The rest of emerging Asia is also concerned -- a lurch lower by the yuan will mean currencies from the Philippines to India, already at multi-year lows, will have to play catch up.

2/LET'S TWIST AGAIN
The ECB gathers on Thursday and after the excitement generated at its last meeting by its pledge to keep interest rates unchanged ""at least through the summer"" of 2019, this will be of great interest to those looking for further guidance.
Some ECB policymakers apparently still want a June 2019 rate rise, while others see trade tensions as a reason to stay loose for longer. But given that ECB President Mario Draghi made it clear the bank had left language ""intentionally vague"", he is unlikely to be any more forthcoming on the timing.
But there are other issues to quiz him on. One is on how the central bank plans to deploy redemptions from its outstanding bond holdings once its asset purchase scheme expires at the end of 2018. Reports suggest it will use reinvestments to buy long-dated bonds, thus magnifying the stimulus effect.
Yield curves have already flattened in anticipation, giving borrowers the opportunity to issue more long-dated bonds and lock in low borrowing costs for decades to come. Belgium plans to sell 50-year bonds next week and others could follow.
What of the economy? There are signs momentum is stabilising after a sudden slowdown earlier this year. Flash euro zone PMI data due on Tuesday should give some indication of how the economy is coping with global trade conflicts, Italian politics and messy Brexit negotiations.

3/ENEMY AT THE RATES
The central banks of Turkey, Chile, Nigeria, Hungary, Argentina, Colombia and Russia all meet to set interest rates; the leaders of the BRIC nations meet in Johannesburg; and G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Buenos Aires. In short, it's a big week for emerging markets. As it seems to be every week right now, with the strength of the dollar, rising U.S. interest rates and escalating trade war tensions tightening the squeeze. Emerging stocks, bonds and currencies are falling and investors are pulling cash out of EM funds.
EM central banks are in a bind. Do they cut rates to support growth and domestic asset prices, which would fuel inflationary pressures? Or do they raise rates to track the Fed, fight inflation and support their currencies even though that could choke growth? We'll find out next week on which side of that fence many of them sit, while the commentary out of Buenos Aires and Johannesburg could also be market-moving.
*WRAPUP 1-China markets gyrate as yuan hits one-year lows
*Emerging market volatility fuelling currency trading boom
4/SCINTILLATING STUFF
Economists polled by Reuters reckon U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) expanded a scintillating 4 percent in the April-June quarter, or double the first quarter's output. The data is due on Friday. <USGDPA=ECI>.
One of the main drivers of the robust expansion was, possibly, a rush by U.S. exporters to get their products to markets before tariffs and counter-tariffs kicked in and full-fledged trade war broke out.
U.S. farmers probably stuffed the export channel (think soybeans to China) before the tariffs. But while that probably contributed to overall growth, economists warn the spike higher in GDP, either from net exports or increased business spending (see defense, or oil drilling) may not last. So even if Q2 growth turns out to be a barn-burner, it is likely to back off in the second half of the year as tariffs bite harder and both imports and exports ease.
Not a flagging U.S. economy then, but one that might sag from here.

5/POOR DRIVING CONDITIONS
Second quarter results stream in next week from big European carmakers Peugeot, Fiat, Daimler and  Renault  (PA:RENA). Shares in the sector, under immense pressure from the threat of higher U.S. import levies, are down almost 10 percent this year, and the results could give the selloff extra mileage should companies downgrade earnings outlooks.
Autos are likely to be high on the agenda for trade talks between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and U.S. President Donald Trump next Wednesday too, after the industry blasted tariff plans in a U.S. Department of Commerce hearing.
But many investors are simply looking for some clarity. For the sector, 12-month earnings growth forecasts have come down from 13 percent to six percent over the past year. Since January though estimates have stalled as analysts see no end to the fog surrounding tariff threats.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dug in on his criticism of the Federal Reserve's policy on raising interest rates, saying it takes away from the United States' ""big competitive edge.""
Trump, in posts on Twitter, also lamented the strength of the U.S. dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies.
American presidents have rarely criticized the U.S. central bank in recent decades because the independence of the Fed is seen as important for economic stability. 
Trump, however, has made reducing U.S. trade deficits a priority and the combination of rising interest rates and a strengthening dollar pose risks for export growth. 
The president has raised tariffs on a host of imports, triggering retaliatory tariffs from key trade partners like China and the European Union.
""China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""As usual, not a level playing field.""
After his posts, the U.S. dollar extended losses against the European Union's euro, the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. [nL1N1UG0MI] 
The Fed's Board of Governors declined to comment. The Fed has been raising rates since 2015 and has already hiked them five times since Trump took office in January 2017. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who Trump named to lead the U.S. central bank, said earlier this month he was not concerned about pressure from U.S. politicians.
""We don't take political considerations into account,"" he told radio program Marketplace.
The U.S. central bank last raised borrowing costs in June, and in an address to Congress this week Powell repeated his view that rates would keep rising slowly now that the unemployment rate was at the lowest level since the 1960s and inflation was rising.
Most economists believe the current economic climate, with the nation's unemployment at historic lows and inflation at the Fed's 2 percent target, justify recent rate rises and a strong U.S. dollar.
Trump had already criticized the Fed's interest rate policy in an interview on CNBC on Thursday, saying he was concerned higher rates could impact the U.S. economy.
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said Trump's comments would have no bearing on interest rate decisions, which are made by a committee made up of government officials and the presidents of privately owned regional Federal Reserve banks. The committee is mandated by the U.S. Congress to foster a strong job market and stable prices.

""People can comment, including the president and other politicians,"" said Bullard, who does not have a vote on monetary policy this year but participates in committee discussions. ""But it's up to the committee to try to take the best action we can.""

631,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BOJ to debate policy change in July to make its stimulus sustainable: sources,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan, facing stubbornly low inflation, is in unusually active discussions before this month's policy decision, with changes to its interest-rate targets and stock-buying techniques on the table, people familiar with the central bank's thinking told Reuters.
Discussion is preliminary and will depend on fresh inflation forecasts from policy board members, the sources say. However, policymakers are already debating tweaks to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's massive easing, which is aimed at lifting the world's third-biggest economy decisively out of decades of deflation.
The first BOJ tweak to policy since 2016 would come as the central bank's main measure of inflation slowed for a third straight month to just 0.2 percent. This underlined expectations that the BOJ will this month trim its inflation forecasts out to the fiscal year ending March 2021.
Such cuts in its forecasts set up debate about the BOJ's policy, under which it buys massive amounts of Japanese government bonds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) to flood the economy with cash, while pushing short-term rates negative and capping the 10-year bond yield at zero.
While a policy change this month could theoretically include additional easing, debate for now focuses on ways to make the massive stimulus programme more sustainable - given it may take far longer than expected to reach its 2 percent inflation target, said the sources.
""If it turns out it would take too long to hit 2 percent inflation, there could be discussions on a policy change,"" one source said. ""The BOJ could consider steps to make its policy more sustainable if structural factors are behind weak inflation,"" another source said, adding that the cost of prolonged easing is becoming ""hard to ignore"".
The sources declined to be identified as the debate is private.
COMMUNICATION FEAT
Having such a debate at all shows the dramatic shift from Kuroda's promise five years ago of hitting the inflation target by around 2015.
There is no consensus on whether and what kind of steps would be needed, as that would depend on how big the downgrade in the board's price projections could be, the sources said. But there are several ideas on the table, they said.
The BOJ could tweak its yield-curve control (YCC) programme to allow for a more natural rise in long-term interest rates to ease the pain on banks from years of near-zero rates, they say.
Other ideas include operational changes to the way the BOJ buys government bonds and ETFs, a nod to critics who say the bank's huge purchases are drying up market liquidity and distorting price action, they say.
Having used up its ammunition, many BOJ officials are wary of ramping up stimulus and have publicly warned of the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as the strain on bank profits.
Profits at Japan's roughly 100 regional banks are being squeezed by the BOJ's ultra-loose policy. More than half the regional banks lost money on their core lending and fees businesses in the year to March 2017.
Concerns have also grown over the BOJ's commitment to buy 6 trillion yen ($54 billion) worth of ETFs per year, which has reduced floating shares in the market and put the bank on track to become a top shareholder of big Japanese companies.
While allowing long-term rates to rise more could help ease the pain on banks, the BOJ could struggle to justify such a move when inflation remains distant from its target, analysts say.
This would raise a messaging problem for the BOJ, which would seek to portray the rate rise not as a policy tightening but a step to allow more flexible policy, the sources say.
""The BOJ could try to argue that by making its policy framework more sustainable, it is doing more to help achieve the target,"" a third source said. ""It's a pretty challenging communication feat.""

""The (Fed's policy-setting) committee has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it’s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,"" Bullard told reporters following an event in Glasgow, Kentucky.

633,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 09:14AM ET</span>",Mnuchin's Shift to Trade Warrior Makes Him Likely Target at G-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Top U.S. Treasury Department officials have gone from economic diplomats to trade warriors, a shift that leaves Secretary Steven Mnuchin once again exposed to broadsides from global counterparts at a multilateral summit this weekend.
With the U.S. on the cusp of trade wars on multiple fronts -- and no signs of de-escalation -- the Group of 20 finance ministers will try to find common ground where they can, and likely debate tariffs and other trade barriers when they gather in Buenos Aires July 21-22.
This marks Mnuchin’s second trip to the Argentine capital for meetings of G-20 ministers. During his first visit in March, the secretary faced harsh criticism from his counterparts, and was publicly rebuked three months later by peers at a Group of Seven finance ministers summit in Canada. Since then, America’s trade disputes with the world have only escalated.
If those recent trips to global summits are any indication, talks this weekend will likely result in Mnuchin facing a barrage of criticism from world peers, in tense discussions that will ultimately do little to sway U.S. policy. The meetings will make plain America’s retreat from allies and global forums that some critics warn is reducing U.S. influence over world affairs.
“The U.S. is fast losing its ability to drive the global economic agenda and provide leadership in tackling problems and issues that have a global rather than just national scale,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University who previously worked at the International Monetary Fund’s China division.
Retaliatory Tariffs
After imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on most G-20 countries, the U.S. is now considering new duties on imports of automobiles and uranium. Trump has also slapped 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, and said in a CNBC interview that aired Friday he’s “ready to go” with $500 billion in tariffs on imports from the Asian nation.
The duties are designed to pressure trade partners to lower barriers to American goods, though so far they have resulted in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products. White House officials say the long-term benefits of a more open playing field for American firms will make the short-term pain of tariffs worthwhile.
IMF Warning
Yet the IMF warned this week the escalating conflict poses the biggest risk to the global economic recovery, after long arguing that countries should avoid protectionism and turn to multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organization to resolve conflicts. Rather than pay heed to its warnings, Treasury officials have turned up the heat on the IMF and other global forums for critiquing U.S. policy.
“We are working every day to guide multilateral financial organizations toward a limited role that is more consistent with free markets, faster growth and U.S. national interests,” Mnuchin told Congress in a July 12 hearing.
The Treasury Department is also increasingly focused on economic sanctions rather than international affairs and diplomacy. Mnuchin has said repeatedly that he spends more than half his time working on sanctions, which the Trump administration has at times imposed unilaterally. European allies -- now called economic foes by Trump -- chafed against the U.S.’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
The department’s move toward a more combative posture is perhaps most evident in the words of Under Secretary for International Affairs David Malpass, who has eschewed the more diplomatic role that his predecessors played by attacking multilateral forums. He said this week that Europe’s role in international organizations “conflicts with the goal of greater prosperity,” and has touted the use of sanctions as “very useful” with the potential to “move the world toward peace.”
G-20 policy makers will have plenty of opportunities to confront Treasury officials this week. Mnuchin, who travels to Brazil before heading to Argentina, is scheduled to hold about a dozen bilateral meetings and informal talks on top of the official G-20 proceedings.
There is one notable exception: Mnuchin has no plans to meet individually with Chinese officials, which is a missed opportunity to ease trade disputes between the world’s two biggest economies. The conflict intensified Thursday when President Donald Trump complained about the Chinese currency, which slumped to a one-year low as the central bank showed little sign of intervening.
China’s markets ended Friday on a stronger footing though, with the yuan reversing an early decline. The yuan has depreciated more than 4 percent over the past month, the steepest among major currencies. A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more attractive and imports more expensive, which could inflate its trade surplus with the U.S.
The Treasury’s press office didn’t respond to requests for comment on the depreciation.
If past international forums are a guide, Mnuchin will probably deny the U.S. is losing influence and instead seek to emphasize areas where most countries can find common ground, such as cybersecurity and countering terrorist financing.
But Japan expects G-20 participants to discuss trade frictions, especially given the threat that the dispute will hit other economies, according to its finance minister, Taro Aso. Japan has also threatened to act if Trump slaps duties on car imports, after refraining from retaliation against his tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports.
“The case of autos is different,” Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said this week. “Our response would change.”

634,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","Trump Blasts Fed Rate Hikes Again, Says Strong Dollar Hurts U.S.","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump again accused China of devaluing its currency and reiterated his criticism that the Federal Reserve is raising rates. Stocks and the dollar fell.
""China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day -- taking away our big competitive edge,"" Trump tweeted early Friday. “The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due & we are raising rates -- Really?”
His comments that China and the EU are manipulating currencies contradict a Treasury Department semi-annual report released in April that refrained from naming any country a currency manipulator based on specific criteria.
The Bloomberg dollar index fell to its weakest levels of the day after Trump’s remarks. Futures on the S&P 500 Index declined.
Trump on Thursday criticized the Fed’s series of interest-rate increases, breaking with more than two decades of White House tradition of avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the independence of the U.S. central bank.
The Fed has raised interest rates five times since Trump took office in January 2017, with two of those coming this year under Chairman Jerome Powell, the president’s pick to replace Janet Yellen. In the interview, Trump called Powell a “very good man.”

""I'm ready to go to 500,"" the president said in the full interview with CNBC that was released on Friday after previous parts regarding the Federal Reserve and the Chinese yuan had been pre-aired a day earlier.



In the interview, Trump claimed that America is being “taken advantage of” by China, the EU, Mexico, and Japan, because they all run trade surpluses with the US.
Specifically on China, Trump says America is “down a tremendous amount”, referring to a trade deficit of at least $375 billion and promised that he would fix it.
“I’m not doing this for politics, I’m doing this to do the right thing for our country. We have been ripped off by China for a long time,” Trump explained.
The U.S. has already imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $200 billion being looked at. China has already retaliated with $34 billion of its own tariffs.
The strategy behind Trump’s move appeared to be to outstrip any possible retaliation as U.S. Census Bureau data showed that the U.S. only exported $129.9 billion to China in 2017.
“I raised ($50 billion), and they matched us. I said: ‘you don’t match us, you can’t match us because otherwise we’re always gonna be behind the A ball’,” Trump explained.
Trump dismisses negative impact on stocks
Trump also shrugged off worries about the negative impact on stock markets from escalating trade tensions.
CNBC pointed out that the mid-term elections were on the horizon and asked, “What if the stock market were to go down?”
“If it does, it does,” Trump responded, insisting that he was doing what was right for the American economy.
Indeed, U.S. stock futures took a dive in reaction to the news. Nasdaq 100 futures had been trading about 0.4% higher prior to the release as tech shares were supported by positive earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). After briefly turning negative, they were last up 0.13% as of 7:00AM ET (11:00 GMT). Dow futures and S&P 500 futures extended earlier losses and were last trading down 0.36% and 0.22%, respectively."

""Imminent yield curve inversion in the U.S. has become a real possibility,"" Bullard said in prepared remarks to a local chamber of commerce in Glasgow, Kentucky. ""Yield curve inversion is a naturally bearish signal for the economy. This deserves market and policymaker attention.""
Bullard has repeatedly said he believes the U.S. central bank should hold the federal funds rate at its current level of a target range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent to help avoid such a scenario.
An inversion of the yield curve - the spread between short-term and long-term debt securities - is seen by some as a signal of a possible economic recession.
Bullard said that should longer-term yields remain near current levels and the Fed proceeds with its forecast of another two interest rates rises this year, the nominal yield curve would invert in late 2018.
""Given tame U.S. inflation expectations, it is unnecessary to push monetary policy normalization to such an extent that the yield curve inverts,"" he added.
Bullard does not have a vote on monetary policy this year under a rotation system, but participates in deliberations.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","U.S., euro zone growth readings to tell story of divergence","By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. and euro zone economies remain a world apart and growth data due in the coming days will only highlight the widening gap, suggesting that monetary policy will continue to move in opposing directions on the two sides of the Atlantic.
U.S. growth likely surged in the second quarter on healthy foreign trade and consumption, while the euro zone's recovery probably lost a bit more steam, underlining the diverging fortunes of the world's two biggest economic blocs.
Indeed, meeting on Thursday in the middle of the summer lull, the European Central Bank is expected to point to ample and potentially growing risks to the outlook, which could weigh further on sentiment and suggest that any further removal of stimulus would come in the smallest of increments.
While the bank agreed last month to end its landmark bond purchase scheme by the close of the year, the dovish undertone of that decision pushed out rate hike expectations almost to the end of next year.
Supporting the ECB's caution, a key consumer confidence indicator due on Monday is expected to dip further while PMI figures due a day later are also seen pointing to more softening.
""The jury is still out on whether the euro zone only went through a soft patch in the first months of the year or is actually already in the middle of a protracted cooling,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""Increasing trade tensions and growing geopolitical uncertainty could further undermine sentiment in the euro zone,"" Brzeski added.
The IMF, writing in its regular review of the bloc, even warned this week that risks to the outlook were 'particularly serious', increasing the chance of a hard landing as Brexit and reform complacency by euro zone governments were adding to risks.
Still, the ECB is likely to argue that growth indicators point to some stabilization, keeping the bloc on track for an expansion that is well below its peak rate just a few months ago but still above what is considered its potential.
The bank could also harden up its language on ending asset buys this year to signal that there would be no going back on the decision, but the dovish tone of the guidance on the first rate hike is all but certain to remain.

GDP SURGE
U.S. growth is meanwhile seen having surged to a four-year high of 4 percent in the second quarter, twice the first quarter's rate, with analysts seeing an upside risk to the consensus.
Although U.S. GDP figures tends to swing wildly, the data point to healthy growth, even if Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned this week that a developing global trade war could start to weigh on investment and sentiment
""The bottom line is a more protectionist economy, is an economy that is less competitive, less productive,"" Powell told lawmakers.
Still this remains only a theoretical outcome as hard data have yet to show any meaningful deterioration, indicating that political turmoil has yet to do actual damage to the economy, which is running at full employment and full capacity. 
""Private consumption has benefited from strong job growth and the resulting rise in labor income,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note to clients. ""With the exception of residential construction, private investment has also increased considerably.
""In addition, foreign trade has contributed an estimated 1.5 percentage points to growth,"" Commerzbank added, noting that this was likely the peak for the U.S. expansion. 

The growth reading should be strong enough to make a decision to hike rates in September relatively easy, economists said, and would keep the Fed on track for another hike this year in December.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A policy debate in China on how best to address slowing growth deepened on Friday, as analysts urged authorities to boost fiscal stimulus amid rising risks to the world's second-biggest economy from a bitter trade conflict with the United States. 
An article in Financial News, which is run by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), quoted analysts as calling for an adjustment to fiscal policy and some loosening of financial regulations, saying monetary policy would not be able to resolve corporate funding challenges on its own. 
The article cited CITIC Securities fixed income analyst Ming Ming as saying that maximizing effectiveness of monetary policy requires active coordination with fiscal and regulatory policies. 
""There is still a lot of room for fiscal policy"" support, and policymakers should focus on the ""strength and rhythm"" of regulations, ""fully considering the impact on market expectations"", Ming said.
As China's economic growth slows, it has sparked a debate among government researchers on whether fiscal policy should help to soften the impact of a trade war with the United States. Both countries have already slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods and with no signs of easing in tensions Beijing has already started to loosen monetary conditions.
Overall credit growth has slowed in China this year, with off-balance sheet lending, or shadow banking, contracting amid a crackdown on financial risks. 
But Friday's article said the latest data showed bank lending was not making up for the gap in credit due to shrinking off-balance sheet lending. 
""The central bank's targeted policies are difficult to realize in practice... it is not useful to release liquidity alone. The money flows into some parts of the system and does not flow out,"" said a regulatory official, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Bank executives, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that a lack of clarity on new financial market policies is holding up lending to firms. 
POLICY PRIORITIES SHIFT
The economy is starting to feel the pinch from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending and debt, problems which were fueled in part by a massive stimulus program to support the economy during the global financial crisis.
The regulatory tightening has driven up corporate borrowing costs, prompting the PBOC to cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) three times this year.
The central bank overseas monetary policy while the finance ministry supervises fiscal policy. It is unclear whether the current debate reflects the policy stances of the two agencies.
Research firm Capital Economics said that China's Ministry of Finance will loosen policy as pressure mounts due to a slowing economy. 
""If nothing else, the recent debate suggests that officials agree on the need for policy loosening, even if they disagree about the exact form that it should take,"" Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. 
""This highlights how far policy priorities have shifted since the start of the year, when the deleveraging campaign was still at the top of the political agenda."" 
Chen Jianheng, a fixed income analyst at China International Capital Corporation, said the strength of financial regulations can be moderately adjusted, according to the article. 
In the same article, Ming said the crackdown on shadow banking had lowered financial institutions risk appetite and restricted credit from flowing to the real economy.

641,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 06:06AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 20:
1. Trump takes aim at Fed
U.S. President Donald Trump broke a long-held presidential tradition of not weighing in on Federal Reserve’s monetary policy when he criticized the central bank’s plans for gradual interest rate hikes.
The Fed raised has rates twice so far this year and Trump expressed his disappointment in a CNBC interview late Thursday.
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”
Markets are forecasting that the Fed will hike rates again in September and put the probability for an additional increase in December at around 60%.
The dollar, which is has been buoyed by expectations of further rate increase, was trading lower against major rivals after three straight days of gains.
2. Microsoft jumps on earnings with GE and Honeywell on tap
Corporate earnings will continue to weigh heavily on market direction amid a lack of top-tier economic data on the calendar for Friday.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock jumped 3.9% in pre-market trade after reporting better-than-expected quarterly numbers that were boosted by cloud services revenue. The Dow component reported earnings of $1.13 cents per share on $30.09 billion in revenue. That was above Wall Street estimates of $1.08 per share on revenue of $29.21 billion.
Quarterly earnings from both  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON), due before the open on Friday, will likely garner the most attention amid a slew of earnings from several companies including Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, State Street, SunTrust Banks and others.
3. Yuan undergoes volatility after Trump attack, China fixing
Market participants kept a close eye on volatility in USD/CNY on Friday as Trump commented on the Chinese currency but China’s central bank also weakened its daily reference rate.
In the CNBC interview Trump commented that a strong dollar puts the U.S. at a disadvantage and emphasized that the Chinese yuan ""was dropping like a rock"".
However, that didn’t stop the the People's Bank of China from dropping the midpoint for a seventh straight trading day to 6.7671 per dollar on Friday, 605 pips or 0.9% weaker than the previous fix of 6.7066.
Friday's fixing was the lowest since July 14, 2017, and represented the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since June 27, 2016.
The yuan treaded water after tumbling to a one-year low earlier, with some observers suggesting that Chinese banks began buying the yuan and selling dollar in an apparent attempt to prop the currency up.
4. U.S. stock futures point to mixed open despite Microsoft support
U.S. futures pointed to a mixed open on Friday as Microsoft’s positive earnings supported tech stocks but investors generally remained cautious. At 6:01 AM ET (10:01 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures slipped 17 points, or 0.07%, S&P 500 futures dropped less than a point, or 0.01%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 28 points, or 0.38%.
European stocks were mostly higher nearing their midday trade as investors concentrated on earnings news and digested Trump’s comments about the Fed and the strong dollar.
Earlier, Asian shares underwent volatile trade as investors kept their focus on the yuan.
5. Oil prices head higher, despite weekly decline
Oil prices headed higher on Friday, recovering some of its weekly decline, as traders focused on comments that Saudi Arabia would reduce exports in August and waited for the latest weekly data on U.S. drilling activity.
Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor Adeeb Al Aama said that exports in July from the cartel’s top producer would be roughly in line with the 7.2 billion barrels per day that were exported in June, according to a Dow Jones report.
He further noted that the kingdom plans to cut exports by roughly 100,000 barrels per day in August as it works to ensure it does not push oil into the market beyond customers' needs, avoiding worries that oversupply would curtail prices.
Al Aama indicated that concerns that Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer and the cartel’s de facto leader, and its partners would oversupply markets are ""without basis"".
U.S. crude oil futures gained 0.66% to $68.69 at 6:03 AM ET (10:03 GMT), while Brent oil traded up 0.80% to $73.16.
Still, oil is on track for weekly losses of about 3% and has declined nearly 8% this month as supply concerns weighed on crude prices.
U.S. production will also be in focus later on Friday when Baker Hughes releases its weekly report on drilling activity. The U.S. oil rig count remained unchanged at 863 last week, as drillers appeared to hold output steady given the decline in prices."
642,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 05:35AM ET</span>",South Korea says sanctions shrank North Korean economy at sharpest rate in 20 years,"By Cynthia Kim and Hayoung Choi
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s economy contracted at the sharpest rate in two decades in 2017, South Korea’s central bank estimated on Friday, as international sanctions and drought hit growth hard, with signs living conditions were beginning to deteriorate.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in North Korea last year shrank 3.5 percent from the previous year, marking the biggest decline since a 6.5 percent drop in 1997 when the isolated nation was hit by a devastating famine, the Bank of Korea said.
North Korea does not publish economic data, and comprehensive public figures on social conditions are nonexistent.
However, analysts believe wider sanctions last year are likely to make the economic deterioration in 2018 worse than 2017, which could add to humanitarian need in the politically isolated state.
""The sanctions were stronger in 2017 than they were in 2016,"" Shin Seung-cheol, head of the BOK's National Accounts Coordination Team said. 
""External trade volume fell significantly with the exports ban on coal, steel, fisheries and textile products. It's difficult to put exact numbers on those but (export bans) crashed industrial production,"" Shin said.
Both Seoul and Washington argue that increasingly strict international sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile program have been instrumental in leader Kim Jong Un's decision to impose a ban on weapons testing and to negotiate with international leaders.
North Korea has called the sanctions ""vicious"" but rejects suggestions that the pressure led them to pursue diplomatic talks.
The situation also worsened last year with international experts fearing North Korea was facing the worst drought in 16 years, though late summer rains helped avoid acute food shortages.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in April vowed to switch the country's strategic focus from the development of its nuclear arsenal jump starting his economy, but analysts say that will be difficult while sanctions remain in place.
""As long as exports of minerals are part of the sanctions, by far the most profitable item of its exports, Pyongyang will have no choice but to continue with its current negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Kim Byeong-yeon, an economics professor at the Seoul National University who specializes in the North Korean economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said that sanctions won't be lifted until Kim moves to give up his nuclear and missile arsenal.
INDUSTRY TAKES A HIT
North Korea's coal-intensive industries and manufacturing sectors have suffered as the UN Security Council ratcheted up the sanctions in response to years of nuclear tests by Pyongyang.
Industrial production, which accounts for about a third of the nation’s total output, fell 8.5 percent. That marked the steepest decline since 1997 as factory production collapsed on restrictions of flows of oil and other energy resources into the country. Output from agriculture, construction industries fell by 1.3 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively.
China, its biggest trading partner, suspended coal purchases last year which cut North Korea's main export revenue source while its suspended fuel sales into to country sparked a surge in gasoline and diesel prices, data reviewed by Reuters showed earlier.
Since then, however, fuel prices have stabilized and even dropped in recent weeks, according to a report published last week on the North Korean Economy Watch website.
""My best guess is that it’s a combination of increased smuggling, perhaps aided by China’s declining vigilance in enforcing sanctions and restrictions against illicit trade across the border,"" analyst Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein wrote in the report.
North Korea's black market, or Jangmadang, has grown to account for about 60 percent of the economy, according to the Institute for Korean Integration of Society.
""Shrinking trade first hits the Kim regime and top officials, and then later affects unofficial markets,"" said Kim at Seoul National University, noting the squeeze would also be felt in household income and private consumption.
China's total trade with North Korea dropped 59.2 percent in the first half of 2018 from a year earlier, China's customs data showed last week.
The BOK uses figures compiled by the government and spy agencies to make its economic estimates. The bank's survey includes monitoring of the size of rice paddy crops in border areas, traffic surveillance, and interviews with defectors. 
HUMAN TOLL
Prices for food staples like rice and corn have remained stable under changing sanctions, and there are signs that a growing number of North Koreans have access to electronic appliances, often powered by solar panels, according to data gathered by the DailyNK website.
North Korean defectors in the South, however, say they hear reports of increased suffering.
“The economic status in Hamgyong area was very bad, according to my sources within North Korea,"" said Kim Seung-cheol, a defector who heads the NK Reform Radio station in Seoul, referencing an area near the border with China.
""In South Hamgyong, some people died of hunger. Since trade with China fell significantly, foreign traders in the border area are suffering from poverty.”
The United Nations' top aid official visited the country last week and said there was ""clear evidence of humanitarian need.""
Other U.N. officials warn that aid groups face difficulties accessing international banking channels, transporting goods into the North Korea, while rising fuel prices hinder aid delivery.
North Korea's Gross National Income per capita stands at 1.46 million won ($1,283.52), making it about 4.4 percent the size of South Korea's, the BOK said. 
Overall exports from North Korea dropped 37.2 percent in 2017, marking the biggest fall since a 38.5 percent decline in 1998, the BOK said on Friday, citing data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency.

DUBAI (Reuters) - In Dubai's posh Jumeirah Beach Residence district, luxury apartment rents are down about 15 percent from a year ago - a sign, some fear, that the wealthy emirate's recipe for economic success is getting stale.
For over two decades, Dubai prospered as one of the world's most international cities, attracting people and capital from across the globe. 
Nine years ago, it needed a $20 billion bailout from oil-rich Abu Dhabi to escape a debt crisis caused by collapsing property prices. Dubai's economy roared back and has grown by a third since then, buoyed by foreign trade, tourism and its status as the main regional hub for business services. 
Now, however, Dubai is hitting another rough patch. Residential property prices have dropped by more than 15 percent since late 2014 and are still falling. The stock market is down 13 percent this year, the worst performance in the region.
Dubai issued 4,722 new business licenses in the second quarter of 2018, down 26 percent from the same period in 2016, the year when new licenses peaked.
The falls may be temporary, the result of an economic slowdown in the Gulf caused by low oil prices. But other figures suggest some of Dubai's traditional growth engines are losing steam, which could mean a long-term slump. 
Growth in passenger traffic through Dubai's international airport has fallen to near zero this year, after 15 years of strong increases. Increasingly long-range aircraft may loosen Dubai's dominance as a travel hub connecting Asia and Europe.
Official data shows Dubai's population continuing to expand, by 3.5 percent to 3.08 million in the first half of 2018. But most growth in recent years has been in lower-paid construction and services jobs, not in higher-paid white-collar posts. 
""Perhaps the era when one could move to Dubai to make one's wealth is passing,"" said Hasnain Malik, Dubai-based global head of equity research and strategy at Exotix Capital.
He said the city was increasingly attractive as a base for rich people from around the world who wished to enjoy their wealth. 
But it is not clear that Dubai's transport industries and business zones can continue growing fast enough to attract, and retain, the number of foreign white-collar workers needed to support demand in its real estate market, Malik said.
STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES
Economists see little risk of another financial crisis; after restructuring billions of dollars of debt, Dubai's state-linked companies are less leveraged than they were a decade ago. 
Nor has headline economic growth slowed greatly. International Monetary Fund officials have estimated gross domestic product will expand over 3 percent this year.
""The emirate continues to attract businesses and investors as a competitive hub for sustainable business development,"" Dubai's Department of Economic Development said in a statement this week, adding that licensing figures showed ""continued investment in all vital economic sectors in Dubai"".
But much of this year's growth is due to a big rise in state spending as Dubai builds infrastructure to host the Expo 2020 world's fair; its 2018 budget soared 19.5 percent from 2017 to a record 56.6 billion dirhams ($15.4 billion). The government cannot keep boosting spending at that speed indefinitely.
Jim Krane, energy fellow at Rice University in Texas and author of ""City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism"", said the emirate faced structural challenges including an increasingly tough geopolitical environment.
In the past, Dubai thrived by keeping cordial relations with every country in the region, accepting trade and investment from all of them.
That has become impossible. Last year, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, ending Dubai's role as a base for business with the small but super-rich country. 
Goods that were once shipped to Qatar via Dubai now move via other countries, such as Oman or India; multinational firms use their European or U.S. offices, not their Dubai operations, to handle business with Qatar.
Meanwhile, the United States and Gulf allies, including the UAE, are trying to squeeze Iran's economy by reducing its financial and trade ties. The effort is more aggressive than Washington's previous attempt to isolate Iran several years ago, diplomats in the region say.
That matters because the UAE's exports and re-exports to Iran, the vast majority via Dubai, totaled $19.9 billion in 2017.
The chief executive of a foreign financial firm in Dubai said the emirate faced unprecedented competition from neighboring countries for capital, as low oil prices forced those countries to develop their own non-oil industries.
Portfolio funds are already flowing from Dubai's stock market to Saudi Arabia's bourse. In coming years, direct investment may follow; U.S. oilfield services firm McDermott International has said it expects to move business slowly from Dubai's Jebel Ali Port to a new Saudi facility by the mid-2020s.
Dubai is trying to shore up its competitive position. In the last few months the government has said it will reduce municipal fees, scrap some aviation charges, freeze school costs and take other steps to aid foreign firms and residents.
Potentially the most far-reaching reform was announced by the UAE cabinet, chaired by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. It promised to permit 100 percent foreign ownership of some UAE-based businesses, up from the current 49 percent limit, and grant long-term residency visas of up to 10 years to foreign investors and some professionals. 
That could make foreign investment in Dubai more attractive and, by helping foreigners plan on long-term residence in the emirate, encourage them to buy homes. 
But details of the new policy have not been released, and implementing it may be tricky. ""Free zones"" in Dubai already permit 100 percent foreign ownership; they could suffer if they no longer have that right exclusively. And many UAE citizens make money as silent partners with foreign businessmen.

""To some extent, the economy is based on people renting out their passports - disrupting that could cause economic pain among the local population,"" the financial executive said.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 07:54PM ET</span>",Trump criticizes Federal Reserve interest rate policy despite strong economy,"By Susan Heavey and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday criticized Federal Reserve policy even though most economists believe the highest inflation in seven years and lowest unemployment in 40 years justify recent interest rate rises and a strong U.S. dollar. 
Trump said he was concerned about the potential impact on the U.S. economy and American corporate competitiveness from rising rates and a stronger dollar.
""I’m not thrilled,"" he said in an interview on CNBC television. ""Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again ... I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.""
""I don’t like all of this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,"" he said.
Trump said he was concerned that the ""Chinese currency was dropping like a rock"" and the strong U.S. dollar ""puts us at a disadvantage."" 
U.S. Treasury debt yields ended the day lower and the U.S. dollar slipped from the session highs to end little changed after Trump's comments. 
After more than six years of record low interest rates that helped the U.S. economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed began to slowly raise rates again in December 2015 and has raised them five times since Trump took office in January 2017. 
The U.S. central bank last raised borrowing costs in June, and in an address to Congress this week Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated his view that rates would keep rising slowly now that the unemployment rate was at the lowest since the 1960s and consumer price inflation was 2.9 percent annually in June. 
U.S. central bankers project two more interest rate increases this year and another three in 2019.
Steady U.S. economic growth of around 2.0 percent in the first quarter of this year and rising interest rates, at a time when the European Central bank and the Bank of Japan are keeping their rates low, helped the U.S. dollar climb to its highest level in a year in July. 
This was not the first time Trump departed from a long-standing practice by U.S. presidents of respecting the Federal Reserve's independence by refraining from commenting on interest rates or the value of the U.S. dollar, a custom he dismissed on Thursday. 
""Now I’m just saying the same thing that I would have said as a private citizen,"" Trump said. ""So somebody would say, 'Oh, maybe you shouldn’t say that as president.' I couldn’t care less what they say because my views haven’t changed."" 
Later, the White House said in a statement that Trump respects the Fed's independence and was not interfering with its policy decisions.
Trump nominated current Fed Chair Powell, who had served as a governor on the board of the U.S. central bank, to serve at its helm after Janet Yellen's retirement in February. 
In his remarks to CNBC, Trump called Powell ""a very good man.""
Trump has further reshaped the Fed’s leadership by appointing its vice chair for regulation and nominating two more Fed governors, both mainstream economists.
Trump regularly claims that his policies, especially tax cuts enacted by Congress last December, have created jobs and economic growth.
But most economists credit the Fed with engineering the economic recovery that began in 2010, and is now the second longest U.S. economic expansion on record, by keeping interest rates at historically low levels and buying back U.S. Treasury debt to inject liquidity into the market.
""His statement doesn’t make a lot of sense to me,"" said Mike Lorizio, head of Treasuries trading at Manulife Asset Management. ""The economy has been on its strongest footing in some time.""
Most economists believe the Fed's current policy of raising interest rates is sound monetary policy given U.S. consumer price inflation is at an annual rate of 2.9 percent and the unemployment rate was at 4.0 percent in June. 
""The thing fueling the dollar strength is the strength of the U.S. economy,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""We’re looking at 4.0 percent GDP growth for Q2, record low unemployment, the lowest initial jobless claims number in 50 years, and inflation above the official target,"" he said.
""All those things point to the Fed continuing to raise interest rates and the economy being fairly strong, relative to all the global issues going on: trade wars, the fear in Europe of Brexit without a clear path. I’m surprised the dollar is not higher."" 
Economists say the biggest risk to America's economic growth are Trump's own policies, especially his imposition of import tariffs on China and Europe as well as allies like Mexico and Canada.
American companies may find themselves less able to compete globally as import tariffs contribute to rising input costs, forcing them to raise prices or lower their profit margins.
However, many analysts doubt Trump's comments will have much impact on Federal Reserve policy or the markets. 
""I don’t think this is indicative of any pending action from the administration that would limit Fed power,"" said Thomas Simons, money market economist at investment bank Jefferies in New York.

""A good sign of proof there is who he has been naming to the open board spots at the Fed,"" he said. ""They are all people with strong independent views on monetary policy and the economy and economic theory ... they are legitimate, verified, bona fide economists and business leaders who are independent.""

647,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Trump’s Economy Depends on Powell’s Excellence,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump trampling on convention. Nothing new there. It’s his target that’s fresh. 
Upending decades of tradition, Trump questioned the wisdom of the Federal Reserve’s gradual and consistent increases in interest rates. “I don’t like all of this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,” he said Thursday. But Powell does not take orders from the president and is unlikely to be swayed by his appeal. And thank goodness for that: Powell matters more to economic and financial stability — and not just at home — than Trump, and is acting like it.
This week offered a stark contrast in their respective approaches to the job, and a possible explanation to the disconnect between the havoc in the White House and the robust condition of the world economy, led by the U.S.
Testifying to Congress this week, Powell was a study in consistency and professionalism. He conveyed at length over two days that interest rates are still going up gradually, but the Fed is probably getting close to a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Investors responded by pushing the dollar higher and trading in Treasury notes barely skipped a beat. (There was a flutter in the aftermath of Trump’s Fed comments.)
Compare that with the chaos that Trump sowed with his summit with President Vladimir Putin, his dismissal of U.S. intelligence, and the uproar that followed. His efforts to calm nerves were astonishingly unconvincing.
It’s unclear whether the regrettable episode weakened Trump’s political standing. If Jay Powell were caught in a similar mess, his career would be over — and for good reason. Over the past 18 months, many have tried to reconcile political instability with markets and economies that remain above the fray. The answer may be simple: Trump actually isn’t in charge of that; Powell is.
It’s not just about Trump and the Fed. The steady if imperfect hand of central banks smoothed edges from markets’ views of Brexit, Italian populism, and the cracks in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition. The People’s Bank of China is tilting policy toward shoring up growth. The Bank of Japan’s task is focused on trying to get inflation up to 2 percent. (Japan hasn’t had a recent political crackup.)
While global growth has probably peaked, a recession isn’t likely; the International Monetary Fund forecast this week an expansion of 3.9 percent this year and next. The fund wants people to know it’s very worried and investors are way too complacent about risks, including the impact of a trade war.
That’s where Powell, ECB President Mario Draghi, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and BOE Governor Mark Carney come in. (I’m going to set aside the PBOC for a minute as it isn’t independent like the others.) Thanks to them, there’s an awful lot of cash still sloshing around to prop up assets and soften the instability created of elected officials.My Bloomberg News colleagues reported last month that the combined balance sheets of the biggest central banks is $11.8 trillion higher than when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed in September 2008. Interest rates in the developed world won't be above 1.5 percent by the middle of next year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
This is far from saying that Trump’s trade volleys and alliance-damaging broadsides don’t matter, or that Brexit and the re-emergence of the far right in Germany are meaningless. It does mean that the fecklessness of the political class is countered for now by professional economic managers.
There may well come a time when missteps by governments make a material dent in economic and financial life. There’s plenty that central banks can’t — and shouldn’t — do. There’s also merit to the argument that they have let elected officials off the hook.
This much is clear as the Powell era begins in earnest: Trump doesn’t hold the reins of the global economy. He’s merely the elected leader of the free world."
648,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers reach pact to strengthen oversight of foreign investment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have reached an agreement that puts a measure to strengthen oversight of foreign investment from countries such as China into a must-pass defense policy bill, Representative Robert Pittenger's office said on Thursday.
The goal of the measure is to strengthen the inter-agency U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), which reviews mergers and stock purchases to ensure they do not harm national security. 
It also addresses concerns that Chinese companies, many with government links, have tried to buy U.S. high end semiconductor makers and other tech firms. The U.S. Defense Department fears losing America's technological edge in warfare.
Pittenger, a Republican congressman from North Carolina and chief sponsor of the measure in the House, said in a statement that the ""legislation will safeguard America’s proprietary dual-use technologies by drastically improving our foreign investment review process.""
He gave no details on what changes might have been made to the measure.
The Senate and U.S. House of Representatives had passed similar bills to strengthen the inter-agency panel, which is led by the U.S. Treasury. The Senate put its version in the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which authorizes military spending.
Lawmakers hope to have the NDAA on President Donald Trump's desk by the end of the month.

The CFIUS measures are among a series of proposals being considered by the White House and Congress to address what it sees as China's unfair trade and market access practices. Others include tariffs on goods ranging from aluminum to automobiles, and efforts to prevent the growth in the United States of Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co  and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063).

649,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Many Japanese companies see inflation of less than 1 percent as appropriate: Reuters poll,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - More than 40 percent of Japanese businesses believe it will take more than three years to reach the central bank's inflation goal of 2 percent, a Reuters poll shows, and more than a quarter think the goal is an impossible objective.
In fact, almost two-thirds suggest an ""appropriate"" level of inflation in Japan is between zero and 1 percent. A slight majority called for the central bank to lower its target or ditch it altogether, the monthly Reuters Corporate Survey found.
For five years now, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been pumping huge amounts of cash into Japan's financial system to lift the economy out of years of deflation, a state of falling prices that saps growth.
But the 2 percent target has remained elusive. When BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda kicked off the aggressive monetary policy in 2013, he had pledged to reach 2 percent inflation within two years.
The survey results suggest that many companies believe Japan's economy has entered a new normal of muted inflation. Consumer prices have been hovering just under 1 percent for some time.
""As BOJ governor calls it the 'Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) effect,' the growth of Internet retailers is keeping inflation from accelerating. As such, 2 percent inflation is unthinkable,"" said a service company manager.
A machinery maker concurred: ""The 2 percent inflation target is groundless. Public sentiment is such that such a target is not called for.""
Sources told Reuters last week that the BOJ might announce that inflation won't reach 2 percent for three more years, reinforcing views it is in no rush to end its super-easy monetary policy.
The survey showed 42 percent of firms say appropriate inflation in Japan is between 0.5-1.0 percent and 19 percent said it should be between zero and 0.5 percent.
Some 24 percent of respondents said appropriate inflation was 1.0-1.5 percent and only 12 percent put it at 1.5-2.0 percent or higher.
SCRAP TARGET?
Company opinions on the BOJ's inflation target have shifted over the past year. 
In the most recent poll, conducted July 2-13 for Reuters by Nikkei Research, 46 percent said the BOJ should keep its 2 percent inflation target, down from 53 percent in a survey conducted last August.
The latest survey showed 28 percent called for the BOJ to lower its target, up from 20 percent in the earlier poll. In the most recent poll, 24 percent suggested scrapping the inflation target, unchanged from last August.
In separate questions, respondents were asked about the impact of trade friction between the United States and its trading partners, including U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs slapped on Japan and several other countries. 
Roughly a third said they are concerned to a degree, but most said they are not really worried or not worried at all.
Few said they are worried about the immediate impact from trade friction on their profits and overseas investment, but 42 percent said they are concerned about the medium- and long-term affect on orders and sales.
""They could affect procurement at subsidiaries and sales in the United States,"" wrote a transport equipment maker.
""Rather than tariffs themselves, we worry (the trade friction) could cause turmoil in currencies and oil prices,"" said a retailer.

Some 483 big and medium-sized businesses were polled in the survey. Some 240 responded to questions about inflation, answering anonymously so they can express opinions more freely.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 06:58PM ET</span>","EU, Mexico automakers blast Trump auto tariff plan","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday came under withering criticism from automakers, foreign governments and others as officials consider imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts, a levy that could hike vehicle costs, hurting auto sales and industry jobs.
Hundreds of workers employed by foreign automakers rallied on Capitol Hill, urging the administration to drop the plans they said could threaten their jobs. A bipartisan group of 150 lawmakers signed a letter urging the administration to drop the plans amid the opposition of groups representing nearly all major automakers, dealers, parts companies and retailers.
Administration officials and congressional aides say the tariff probe is in part designed to win concessions during ongoing NAFTA renegotiation talks, but note that Trump has told aides he wants to impose tariffs before the congressional elections in November.
The department opened an investigation in May into whether imported autos and parts pose a national security risk and held a hearing on the probe on Thursday, taking testimony from auto trade groups, foreign governments and others.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the hearing it was ""too early"" to say if the administration of President Donald Trump would impose the tariffs, even as many automakers and members of Congress think it is a foregone conclusion.
He said the hearing was aimed at ""whether government action is required to assure the viability of U.S. domestic production.""
Canada's deputy ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, told the hearing that imposing tariffs on Canadian imports would be ""devastating"" to the U.S. auto sector and that Canada would respond in a ""proportional manner"" if auto tariffs were imposed.
""Canada could not conceivably represent any risk to U.S. national security,"" she said.
European Union Ambassador David O'Sullivan said at the hearing that the suggestion that imports of vehicles and parts from the ""closest allies"" of the United States could pose a security risk was ""absurd"" and ""lacks legitimacy."" 
A group representing major automakers told Commerce on Thursday that imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the price of U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
'NO EVIDENCE' 
Automakers say there is ""no evidence"" that auto imports pose a national security risk, and that the tariffs could actually harm U.S. economic security.
They are also facing higher prices after tariffs were imposed on aluminum and steel imports.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), warned on the impact of the tariffs. 
""Higher auto tariffs will harm American families and workers, along with the economy"" and ""would raise the price of an imported car nearly $6,000 and the price of a U.S.-built car $2,000,"" said Jennifer Thomas, a vice president for the group. 
She noted that the U.S. exports more than $100 billion of autos and parts annually to other countries, while ""there is a long list of products that are largely no longer made in the U.S., including TVs, laptops, cellphones, baseballs, and commercial ships.""
No automaker or parts company has endorsed the tariffs, and they have pointed to near-record sales in recent years.
Jennifer Kelly, the United Auto Workers union research director, noted that U.S. auto production has fallen from 12.8 million vehicles in 2000 to 11.2 million in 2017 as the sector has shed about 400,000 jobs over that period, with many jobs moving to Mexico or other low-wage countries.
""We caution that any rash actions could have unforeseen consequences, including mass layoffs for American workers, but that does not mean we should do nothing,"" she said, suggesting ""targeted measures.""
IMPACT TO INDUSTRY
A study released by a U.S. auto dealer group warned that the tariffs could cut U.S. auto sales by 2 million vehicles annually and cost more than 117,000 auto dealer jobs, or about 10 percent of the workforce.
Trump has repeatedly suggested he would move quickly to impose tariffs, even before the government launched its probe. 
""We said if we don't negotiate something fair, then we have tremendous retribution, which we don't want to use, but we have tremendous powers,"" Trump said on Wednesday. ""We have to - including cars. Cars is the big one. And you know what we're talking about with respect to cars and tariffs on cars.""

Nazak Nikakhtar, an assistant Commerce secretary, pledged the agency in the coming weeks will ""conduct a thorough, fair and transparent investigation,"" and will consider the economic arguments made by automakers and others at the hearing before making a final decision.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - There is ""an awful lot of affection for Canada"" around the world that will help the government's push to diversify exports away from the United States, the country's new trade minister said on Thursday, as ties with Washington become more strained.
Jim Carr received the trade portfolio in a Cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said finding new export markets was a priority.
Canada sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States, which imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum at the end of May and is now mulling punitive measures against autos.
""There is goodwill towards Canada, there is a willingness to hear our story, and I think there is an awful lot of affection for Canada, for our values ... for our political leadership,"" Carr said in a phone interview.
""So I think there are all kinds of ways in which we can capture the world's attention at a number of levels and that is what we will do.""
Although Trudeau took office in November 2015 stressing the need to boost trade with major emerging markets like China and India, the government has had little success.
Trudeau visited Beijing last December but the two sides failed to agree on the launch of talks on a free trade treaty.
Officials say negotiations on a potential deal with India have stalled.
Carr, whose title is trade diversification minister, did not give details when asked about his travel plans for the next few months. He said he had not spoken to his U.S. counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
""The reality is that 75 percent of our trade goes to the United States and it continues to be our most important trading partner,"" he said.
A senior Canadian diplomat on Thursday told a U.S. Commerce Department hearing into the auto tariffs that if Washington imposed the measures, Canada would respond with sanctions.
Brian Kingston, vice president of international issues at the Business Council of Canada, said Ottawa should launch trade talks with China and consider boosting ties with other Asian nations.

""We are literally standing at the edge of a cliff now and if we don't start trying to make some headway on diversification, we're even more at risk than we were before,"" he said by phone.

652,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Trump's Economy Depends on Powell's Excellence,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump trampling on convention. Nothing new there. It's his target that's fresh. Upending decades of tradition, Trump questioned the wisdom of the Federal Reserve's gradual and consistent increases in interest rates. “I don’t like all of this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,"" he said Thursday. But Powell does not take orders from the president and is unlikely to be swayed by his appeal. And thank goodness for that: Powell matters more to economic and financial stability -- and not just at home -- than Trump, and is acting like it.This week offered a stark contrast in their respective approaches to the job, and a possible explanation to the disconnect between the havoc in the White House and the robust condition of the world economy, led by the U.S.Testifying to Congress this week, Powell was a study in consistency and professionalism. He conveyed at length over two days that interest rates are still going up gradually, but the Fed is probably getting close to a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Investors responded by pushing the dollar higher and trading in Treasury notes barely skipped a beat. (There was a flutter in the aftermath of Trump’s Fed comments.)
Compare that with the chaos that Trump sowed with his summit with President Vladimir Putin, his dismissal of U.S. intelligence and the uproar that followed. His efforts to calm nerves were astonishingly unconvincing. 
It’s unclear whether the regrettable episode weakened Trump’s political standing. If Jay Powell was caught in a similar mess, his career would be over – and for good reason. Over the past 18 months, many have tried to reconcile political instability with markets and economies that remain above the fray. The answer may be simple: Trump actually isn't in charge of that; Powell is.
It's not just about Trump and the Fed. The steady, if imperfect, hand of central banks smoothed edges from markets' views of Brexit, Italian populism and the cracks in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition. The People's Bank of China is tilting policy toward shoring up growth. The Bank of Japan's task is focused on trying to get inflation up to 2 percent. (Japan hasn't had a recent political crackup.)
While global growth has probably peaked, a recession isn't likely; the International Monetary Fund forecast this week an expansion of 3.9 percent this year and next. The fund wants people to know it's very worried and investors are way too complacent about risks, including the impact of a trade war.
That's where Powell, ECB President Mario Draghi, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and BOE Governor Mark Carney come in. (I'm going to set aside the PBOC for a minute as it isn't independent like the others.) Thanks to them, there's an awful lot of cash still sloshing around to prop up assets and soften the instability created of elected officials.My Bloomberg News colleagues reported last month that the combined balance sheets of the biggest central banks is $11.8 trillion higher than when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed in September 2008. Interest rates in the developed world won't be above 1.5 percent by the middle of next year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
This is far from saying that Trump's trade volleys and alliance-damaging broadsides don't matter or that Brexit and the re-emergence of the far right in Germany are meaningless. It does mean that the fecklessness of the political class is countered for now by professional economic managers.
There may well come a time when missteps by governments make a material dent in economic and financial life. There's plenty that central banks can't -- and shouldn't -- do. There's also merit to the argument that they have let elected officials off the hook.This much is clear as the Powell era begins in earnest: Trump doesn't hold the reins of the global economy. He's merely the elected leader of the free world."
653,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 04:33PM ET</span>",U.S. Medigap plans fall short on protections for pre-existing conditions,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
Thinking of adding a Medigap supplemental policy to your Medicare coverage? Beware: you could be charged higher rates or be turned away completely if you have a pre-existing condition. 
Medigap policies fill gaps in coverage for people enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, such as copays, deductibles and limits on hospitalization benefits. The plans are sold by commercial insurance companies.
Federal law provides limited protection against medical underwriting by insurers - the practice of using health information when evaluating an application for coverage. And some states regulate it further. But these protections vary widely from state to state, according to a new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).
Under U.S. law, there is a six-month Medigap open enrollment period that begins on the first day of the month in which you are age 65 or older and also enrolled in Medicare Part B. During this open enrollment – also referred to as the guaranteed issue period – insurers cannot charge you more for a policy due to any pre-existing conditions.
Just as important, they cannot cite pre-existing conditions as a reason to refuse to sell you a policy. A review by KFF of insurance company policies found that medical underwriting on Medigap plans can include anything from a chronic condition such as diabetes, heart disease hypertension or cancer to being advised by a doctor to have surgery, medical tests, treatments or therapies.
Four states protect Medigap applicants beyond the open enrollment period: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and New York. These states all require either continuous or annual guaranteed issue protections for all beneficiaries in traditional Medicare over age 65, no matter their medical history. And 28 states require insurers to issue policies to eligible Medicare beneficiaries if a former employer changes their retiree health coverage benefits.
The KFF report points to several possible policy changes that could boost consumer protections on pre-existing conditions - for example, requiring an annual Medigap open enrollment, similar to the ones already held for Part D prescription drug and Advantage plans. And some Medicare reform plans floated in recent years have called for streamlining deductibles, reducing cost-sharing requirements for some services and capping overall out-of-pocket expenses, making Medigap protections less essential.
But for now, the wide variation in protections identified in the report underscores the importance of deciding upfront whether you want to be in traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage - unless you are fortunate to live in one of the four Medigap haven states.
“The choices people make when they first go on Medicare can have long-term repercussions down the road,” said Gretchen Jacobson, associate director of KFF and a co-author of the study.
HOW MEDIGAP WORKS
When you sign up for Medicare, the first choice to make is between traditional fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage. 
Medicare Advantage plans are managed-care networks, usually HMOs. They bundle together Part A (hospitalization), Part B (outpatient services) and often include Part D coverage (prescription drugs). Advantage plans also cap annual out-of-pocket expenses, so Medigap supplemental policies are not sold alongside the plans.
Advantage plans can save money for beneficiaries, and enrollment is growing rapidly. However, they come with important restrictions on available healthcare providers. And roughly two-thirds of Medicare enrollees still use traditional Medicare, which remains the gold standard of coverage, since it can be used with any healthcare provider who accepts Medicare. (https://reut.rs/2J6D9l1).
Most traditional Medicare enrollees add a Part D prescription drug plan, and some form of supplemental coverage - either through a Medigap plan, from a former employer or Medicaid - because the coverage gaps are substantial. Traditional Medicare has a deductible for Part A hospitalizations ($1,340), plus deductibles and coinsurance charges for Part B outpatient services ($183) There also are daily copayments for hospital stays exceeding 60 days and for extended stays in skilled nursing facilities.
Medigap policies make these costs more predictable by spreading them throughout the year via premiums. But the cost of these plans is significant, ranging annually from as little as $2,000 to $7,000 for the most comprehensive plans. Policies come in an alphabet soup of lettered plan choices, currently including A, B, C D, F, G, K, L, M, and N.
The most comprehensive Medigap policies – C and F – cover 100 percent of Part A coinsurance charges and hospital costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are exhausted. These plans also cover 100 percent of Part B coinsurance or copayment amounts, hospice care coinsurance, skilled nursing facility coinsurance, and deductibles for Part A and Part B. Other plans provide less generous coverage. For example, K plans cover only 50 percent of Part B copays and various other deductibles. 
Federal legislation passed in 2015 phases out Medigap C and F plans for new buyers beginning in 2020, although current policyholders can keep their plans. The intended idea here is to save money for Medicare by reducing unnecessary utilization of healthcare by giving enrollees more “skin in the game.”
The phase-out of new C and F sales could boost the cost for current policyholders, Jacobson thinks. “If the pool of enrollees ages, that could lead to some sharp premium increases for them,” she said. Starting in 2020, D and G plans will be the new most-comprehensive plans.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","U.S. security threatened by tariffs, not free trade, German carmakers warn","BERLIN (Reuters) - German carmakers are in favor of abolishing tariffs affecting their industry but an escalating trade war might call their future investments in the United States into question, the head of their industry association said on Thursday.
In testimony to a hearing held by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bernhard Mattes, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), said escalating tariffs, not cheap imports were the real risk to U.S. national security.
The U.S. administration of President Donald Trump is threatening German car imports with punitive 20 percent tariffs, arguing that the imports represent a security risk. But Mattes said the potential hit to the U.S. economy was the real danger.
German carmakers are under increasing pressure to diversify production of their sports utility vehicles (SUVs) outside of the United States as a result of Washington's growing trade tensions with China.
""Companies in our industry are so deeply intertwined that our fate is a common fate,"" said Mattes, who once headed Ford's operations in Germany. ""Manufacturers heavily rely on open markets, due to our integrated and interdependent supply chains.""
Tariffs levied by other countries on exports from German-owned manufacturing sites in the United States would undermine competitiveness, force German auto makers to rethink investment decisions, and would trigger countermeasures from further countries.
""This scenario terrifies me,"" he said. ""Such a scenario, rather than free trade between partners, is a risk to national security. U.S. national security relies on its economic performance.""
In order to avert the threat of a tariff war, the United States and the EU should work together to lower and eventually abolish tariffs between them.
""The EU and the U.S. together account for 50 percent of world trade,"" he said. ""In the light of fast growing new actors on the scene it is my first conviction that we should shape the future together.""
Beijing's proposed 25 percent tax on U.S. car exports will hit nearly 270,000 vehicles, with German carmakers accounting for $7 billion of the $11 billion total. Both BMW and  Daimler  have giant manufacturing facilities in the United States.
BMW (DE:BMWG), the largest vehicle exporter from the United States in terms of value, has its biggest factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina and faces a $965 million impact from tariffs, with Daimler (DE:DAIGn) exposed to a $765 million hit, analysts at Evercore ISI said.

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Bond Traders Hold the Fed’s Line Against Trump,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- First President Donald Trump came for the sanctity of U.S. jobs data. Now he’s challenging the Federal Reserve. Bond traders — at least for now — are taking the latest breach of executive tradition in stride.
Treasuries barely budged Thursday from prevailing levels even after Trump said in a CNBC interview that he’s “not thrilled” that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is overseeing gradual interest-rate increases. Yields broadly remained near session lows and edged higher after the seemingly inevitable walk-back from the White House that Trump “respects the independence” of the Fed and that he isn’t interfering with its decisions. Still, he just made his view on interest rates clear.
Here are the relevant parts about interest rates from his interview: 
“I put a very good man in the Fed. I don't necessarily agree with it because he's raising interest rates. I'm not saying I agree with it. I must tell you, I don't. I'm not thrilled because we go up and every time you go up, they want to raise rates again. I am not happy about it, but at the same time I'm letting them do what they feel is best.”
...
“Now I'm just saying the same thing that I would have said as a private citizen. So somebody would say, ‘Oh, maybe you shouldn't say that as a president.’ I couldn't care less what they say, because my views haven’t changed. I don’t like all of this work we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up.”
 
The lack of a move in Treasuries speaks to a few things about the bond market as a whole. For one, as Bloomberg News’s Edward Bolingbroke pointed out, investors are generally content about the current level of yields. In fact, the latest JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). survey revealed that 100 percent of “active clients” reported neutral positions, the first time they’ve all been neutral since January 2011. That tends to reduce the prospect of volatile moves.
It also speaks to the comfort that traders have with Powell, now that he’s settled into his role. He just wrapped up two days of testimony in front of both House and Senate lawmakers, and despite his plain-spokenness, he managed to get through it all without upsetting markets in the slightest. He has confirmed time and again that the economy is strong and that the central bank will continue lifting rates gradually. The only wrinkle was saying they would proceed “for now.”
Trump, for his part, must hope that “for now” is a far shorter period than most traders anticipate. The going assumption has been that Fed officials would continue to raise rates gradually — say, once a quarter — until the data clearly showed they shouldn’t. Now, with Trump’s words ringing in their heads, perhaps they’ll become just a bit more sensitive to any data misses.
It wasn’t so long ago that the Fed seemed to look for any reason not to hike. Lately, policy makers have been marching on even with some imperfect data. And that’s to their credit: normalizing under present conditions is the right course of action.
Just as Trump belatedly inserted the word “not” into his Helsinki comments on Russian election meddling, he may have just tried to add “not” back into the Fed’s rate decisions again. At least for now, the markets are betting the central bank won’t be swayed."

WASHINGTON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The financial leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies meet in Buenos Aires this weekend for the first time since long-simmering trade tensions burst into the open when China and the United States put tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods. 
The United States will seek to convince Japan and the European Union to join it in a more aggressive stance against Chinese trade practices at the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents, according to a senior U.S. Treasury Department official, who spoke on condition on anonymity. 
But those efforts will be complicated by frustration over U.S. steel and aluminum import tariffs on the EU and Canada. Both responded with retaliatory tariffs in an escalating trade conflict that has shaken markets and threatens global growth. 
""U.S. trading partners are unlikely to be in a conciliatory mood,"" said Eswar Prasad, international trade professor at Cornell University and former head of the International Monetary Fund's China Division. 
""(U.S.) hostile actions against long-standing trading partners and allies has weakened its economic and geopolitical influence.""
At the close of the last G20 meeting in Argentina in March, the financial leaders representing 75 percent of world trade and 85 percent of gross domestic product released a joint statement that rejected protectionism and urged ""further dialogue,"" to little concrete effect.
Since then, the United States and China have slapped tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods unless Beijing agrees to change its intellectual property practices and high-technology industrial subsidy plans.
Trump has said the U.S. tariffs aim to close the $335 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with China. 
U.S. Treasury Minister Steven Mnuchin has no plans for a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Buenos Aires, a U.S official said this week.
GROWTH CONCERNS
Rising trade tensions have led to concerns within the Japanese government over currency volatility, said a senior Japanese G20 official, who declined to be named. Such volatility could prompt an appreciation in the safe-haven yen and threaten Japanese exports.
Trump's metals tariffs prompted trade partners to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. goods ranging from whiskey to motorcycles. The United States has said it will challenge those tariffs at the World Trade Organization.
The EU finance ministers signed a joint text last week that will form their mandate for this weekend's meeting, criticizing ""unilateral"" U.S. trade actions, Reuters reported. The ministers will stress that trade restrictions ""hurt everyone,"" a German official said.
In a briefing note prepared for the G20 participants, the International Monetary Fund said if all of Trump's threatened tariffs — and equal retaliation — went into effect, the global economy could lose up to 0.5 percent of GDP, or $430 billion, by 2020. 
Global growth also may have peaked at 3.9 percent for 2018 and 2019, and downside risks have risen due to the tariff spat, the IMF said.
""While all countries will ultimately be worse off in a trade conflict, the U.S. economy is especially vulnerable,"" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde wrote in a blog post. ""Policymakers can use this G20 meeting to move past self-defeating tit-for-tat tariffs.""

Trade is not on host country Argentina's published agenda for the July 21-22 ministerial, which focuses on the ""future of work"" and infrastructure finance. But it will likely be discussed during a slot devoted to risks facing the global economy, much as in March, according to an Argentine official involved in G20 preparations, who asked not be named.

657,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Powell Hints at New Read on Labor Force Justifying Gradual Hikes,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may have dropped a clue this week about why he thinks unemployment can fall lower than many economists believe is advisable without triggering a spike in inflation.
Based on a comment he made to lawmakers on Wednesday, Powell may be exploring whether there is a cyclical nature to the concept of full employment, one which lowers that important level, at least temporarily, during a jobs-rich expansion.
David Altig, research director at the Atlanta Fed, is a believer in that idea. At the moment, he said, the job market is still finding available workers from outside the labor force, people who are not counted as unemployed. As long as that flow continues, it may prevent inflation from accelerating even as unemployment falls further.
“What is sustainable in the near term can be different from what is sustainable in the longer term,” Altig said. “Just because we think you can’t sustain 4.5 percent in the long term, that doesn’t mean 3.5 percent is a problem for a year or two. ”
To be sure, Powell hasn’t endorsed this theory. And even if he’s leaning that way, he’s not backing away from the Fed’s current path of interest-rate hikes. He repeated that view during both appearances before House and Senate committees this week when he said “for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising” rates.
Still, it would help explain some of his remarks, especially his assertion to lawmakers that the U.S. economy is “close to full employment, maybe not quite there.”
That sentence is striking because unemployment, currently at 4 percent, is already below every estimate submitted in June by Fed officials, including Powell, for full employment. The range of estimates ran from 4.1 percent to 4.7 percent, with the median at 4.5 percent.
‘It’s Contradictory’
“It’s a little confusing, because they say that the unemployment rate is a half point below their estimate” of full employment, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). “If you think you have more slack, either lower your estimate or change what you’re saying -- it’s contradictory.”
To be fair, Powell has said before that the Fed ultimately looks to a number of measures of labor utilization, not just the headline unemployment rate, when it gauges the level of full employment.
But it’s also true that when officials submit their estimates of full employment, it’s expressed as the “longer-run” level of the jobless rate that’s consistent with low and stable inflation.
Economists generally agree this longer-run level is linked to deep, structural factors that tend not to shift with the business cycle. That’s why Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, hasn’t moved his estimate of full employment much in recent years and why he’s warning his colleagues against dropping their estimates in an attempt to square the circle of low unemployment and low inflation.
Full employment, Rosengren said in April, “should change as the workforce becomes better educated. It should change as demographics change. Those things are slow moving trends.”
But what if there is also a cyclical nature to full employment? Economists recognize that in a severe shock, like the 2007-09 recession, the level moves up as people who are laid off and remain out of work for an extended time find it hard to get hired. The question is whether this can operate in the other direction.
If Powell is, indeed, open to this idea, his comments on full employment make more sense, as does his serene take on price pressures. While he pronounced the risks around inflation to be “roughly balanced,” he admitted to being “slightly more worried about lower inflation.”
Embracing the idea of a lower, shorter-run level for full employment comes with risks, according to William English, a former director of the Fed’s Division of Monetary Affairs and now a professor at Yale University.
“Potentially, you undo some of the damage from the deep and protracted recession,” English said. But if the Fed moves rates up too slowly, and inflation takes off, “then, you have to raise rates too quickly.”
That would not only end the flow of people back into the work force, but send many back out again."

Soto, 45, is also a former deputy finance minister and has worked as economic adviser to President Juan Manuel Santos since 2015, who announced the appointment in a speech on Thursday. She studied at Bogota’s University of the Andes and at Columbia University in the U.S.
Soto has said the economy can grow as fast as 4 percent without overheating, faster than the 3.3 percent to 3.5 percent estimated by central bank Governor Juan Jose Echavarria. In a June 25 interview at the presidential palace, she predicted that the economy will expand 2.7 percent to 3 percent this year, and about 3.5 percent in 2019, which would indicate limited inflationary pressures.
The bank, with its large, well-funded research department, should be less diffident about weighing in on matters of public policy, especially those such as tariffs and regulated prices which are connected with its core mandate of keeping consumer prices under control, she said.
The bank “can fulfill a role of a authorized, independent, technical voice, given the quality and capacity of the resources at its disposal,” she said.
Meisel left the board at the end of June to become Rector of the University of the North in Barranquilla."

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union countries will suffer long-term damage equivalent to about 1.5 percent of annual economic output if Britain leaves the bloc without a free trade deal next year, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 next year, and Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to reach a consensus within her own Conservative Party on what future ties with the EU should look like, let alone broker a final deal with the EU.
The EU's lost economic output in the case of no deal would cost the bloc around $250 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on the IMF's estimate of the size of the EU economy excluding Britain this year.
Lost employment could total 0.7 percent of the EU workforce, or more than a million jobs.
The timing of the losses would depend on the length of post-Brexit transition arrangements, but would probably take five to 10 years at least to be fully felt, the IMF said.
While Britain and the EU agreed the outlines of a transition plan in March to largely preserve the status quo until the end of 2020, this deal has not been ratified and risks falling apart if there is no agreement on longer-term goals.
""The strength of the euro area-UK integration implies that there would be no Brexit winners,"" the IMF said.
Ireland would be worst hit due to its close trade ties with Britain, followed by the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Germany would also suffer due to industrial supply chains.
Looking at the trade impact alone, Ireland could lose almost 4 percent of its economy in a 'no deal' Brexit, but some big countries like France, Italy and Spain would be far less hurt.
Britain has argued it is in the EU's economic interest to take a flexible approach to Brexit, while the EU is concerned not to set a precedent of allowing a country to leave but retain the aspects of EU membership it finds beneficial.
Some British lawmakers say the country should leave the EU and trade on World Trade Organization terms - the IMF's 'no deal' scenario - if the EU makes too few concessions.
The IMF said its study showed a bigger negative impact on the EU from Brexit than some previous work, because it modeled the disruption to manufacturing supply chains as well as the effect of tariffs and reduced financial services trade.
The Washington-based body also urged the EU to continue to allow London-based 'central counterparties' (CCPs) that clear global financial trades to handle euro transactions - something the European Central Bank has resisted previously.
""The potential forced relocation of a globally systemically important CCP to the EU should be viewed with great hesitation,"" the IMF said.
The economic damage from Brexit would be minimal if Britain were to adopt the 'soft Brexit' Norwegian-style model of being part of the European Economic Area, which May has rejected as it would largely require Britain to stick to EU rules.
A free trade agreement for manufactured goods - which is closer to what May is seeking - would reduce long-term EU losses to 0.8 percent of GDP, or around $130 billion.
The IMF did not estimate the costs of Brexit for Britain in this paper, which accompanies a two-yearly assessment of the EU, though earlier this week it downgraded its forecast for British growth this year to the weakest since 2012.
Before Britain voted to leave the EU, the IMF warned of a possible recession under an 'adverse' scenario, drawing criticism from Brexit supporters.

Earlier this year Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain's economy was around 1.5-2.0 percent smaller than it would have been if the public had voted to stay in the EU - not far from what the IMF forecast for a 'limited' Brexit scenario.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 01:07PM ET</span>",Germany's Weidmann unfit as ECB next president: Italy's League,"ROME (Reuters) - A top official from Italy's ruling League party voiced opposition on Thursday to German central bank chief Jens Weidmann becoming the next governor of the European Central Bank, saying such an appointment could lead Europe to disintegrate.
ECB President Mario Draghi, an Italian, is due to stand down when his eight-year term expires in October 2019.
Germany is seen as eager to claim the presidency for the first time, two decades after the ECB's creation. Bundesbank President Weidmann has not been officially put forward for the post but is widely considered to be the most obvious candidate.
    ""Weidmann would not be a good choice for Italy,"" Claudio Borghi told Reuters over the phone.
""Weidmann's hawkish views, that are restrictive monetary and fiscal policy, could lead Europe to disintegration. On the contrary, the decision of Draghi to purchase EU sovereign bonds with so-called quantitative easing has held the currency bloc together.""
Borghi plays an important policy-making role inside the League, which governs in coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, though he does not hold a government office.
While Italy doesn’t have an outright veto, traditionally the biggest countries have agreed on a candidate, so Italy’s opposition would be a big hurdle. 
    Weidmann has alienated some officials with his opposition to the ECB's ultra-easy monetary policy, which is credited with reviving economic growth. Some regarded this as disloyalty in a time of crisis.
    He has also criticized Rome's performance in cutting its debt and engaged in public exchanges with former centre-left Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi.
    This month, Weidmann told a radio interview that the next ECB chief must be someone who can tighten the money taps after years of crisis-fighting and stimulus.
    Borghi, a eurosceptic economist who wrote a pamphlet called ""STOP EURO"", said it was premature to say which candidate Italy would back for the ECB top job.
    With Draghi stepping down next year, Rome wants to retain Italian influence at the top of the ECB by backing an Italian to replace France's Daniele Nouy as ECB bank supervisory chief. Nouy's term ends on Dec. 31.
    Three senior Italian banking sources said they expected European Banking Authority chairman Andrea Enria, an Italian, to apply to succeed Nouy. One of them said another potential candidate could be ECB supervisor Ignazio Angeloni.
    ""I'm not going to comment on names. Italy will seek people competent and who care about Italian interest to be proposed to all the European top jobs,"" Borghi said.

Looking for extra money for the budget, the government proposed raising the retirement age.
It made the announcement on June 14, the day Russia hosted the first match of the soccer World Cup, leading some critics to suggest the authorities were using the tournament to deflect attention from unpopular news.
The measure passed in the State Duma lower house of parliament on Thursday by a vote of 328 to 104.
Putin, who once promised not to raise the retirement age while he remains president, has so far distanced himself from the plan, which is opposed by around 90 percent of the Russian population.
On Wednesday, hundreds of people rallied in Moscow and St Petersburg against the new pension plan, which envisages increasing the retirement age for men to 65 from 60, and for women to 63 from 55.
An average pension in Russia is now at around 14,400 rubles ($226.94). The changes would be introduced gradually, starting in 2019, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said when presenting the plan on June 14. 
Earlier this month, Russian lawmakers also backed a proposal to raise value-added tax (VAT), which the central bank warned would translate into higher inflation. 

Both the pension age and VAT bills need to be approved in further readings to become law.

Homeowners are expected to spend about $339.0 billion on remodeling in the first quarter of 2019, or a 6.9 percent increase from a year earlier, and $346.8 billion on remodeling in the second quarter of 2019, or a 7.0 percent increase from the year before, according to the center.
This compares with a projected expenditure of $331.0 billion in the third quarter of 2018, or a 7.4 percent rise from a year earlier, and a forecast $336.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, or a 7.3 percent rise.
This year had been expected to be the best year for home remodeling in more than a decade, as an improving job market and rising home values spur homeowners to upgrade or to perform replacement projects, the latest report showed.

“Although the projected growth for remodeling activity remains strong, the low inventory of existing homes for sale is holding back even larger gains, since significant remodeling and repair often occurs around the time of a sale,” says Abbe Will, Associate Project Director in the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's inflation rose to 63.87 percent year-on-year in June, from 60.93 percent in May, the state statistics agency said on Thursday, as the dollar-starved country grapples with an economic crisis.
Sudan has been reeling from an acute shortage of foreign currency and an increasingly expensive black market for dollars that has sapped its ability to import and made prices soar, kindling unrest earlier this year in some parts of the country.
The import-dependent country's price rises have been the third fastest in the world in recent months, behind only war-torn South Sudan and hyperinflation-stricken Venezuela, according to IMF data from April.
The statistics agency said June inflation was driven by rising food and beverage prices.
The severe downturn comes despite the United States lifting 20-year old sanctions last year, a move that was expected to be a boon for the long isolated economy.
But new investment has been slow to emerge and economic fortunes have only soured since the sanctions decision, with the Sudanese pound down about 125 percent on black market trading since relief was announced last October.
The Sudanese pound weakened to 46 pounds to the dollar on the black market on Thursday compared to about 41 pounds earlier in the week, a level traders called a record low.
That compares to an official rate of about 29.3 Sudanese pounds to the dollar traded in banks, but businesses struggling to import say hard currency in the banking system is largely unavailable.
""We expect the dollar price to rise in the coming days as there is a lot of demand on the dollar and a shortage of it being offered in the market,"" one black market dealer told Reuters.
The Sudanese government rejected an IMF suggestion that it float its pound currency late last year. It instead made two steep devaluations and imposed restrictions on dollar deposits in an attempt to curb black market activity. [nL8N1PU0RV]

664,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 09:42AM ET</span>",The EU is already preparing for trade talks with Trump to fail — and is readying a major retaliation,"European Union officials are preparing for the worst ahead of talks with the US about the future of trade.
President Donald Trump and his administration are considering tariffs of as much as 20% on US automobile imports from Europe. EU officials are readying a list of retaliatory tariffs with should the two sides fail to reach an agreement.
Senior EU officials, including the European Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, are set to fly to Washington, DC, next week with the aim of persuading Trump not to levy punitive tariffs on European automobiles. The EU is preparing to hit back, however, if he cannot be persuaded.
""The aim of President Juncker's visit is to try to establish a good relation, try to see how we can de-escalate the situation and avoid it from going further and see if there is a forum where we can discuss these issues,"" Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU's trade chief, said at a press conference on Thursday.
""If the US would impose these car tariffs, that would be very unfortunate, but we are preparing together with our member states a list of rebalancing measures as well,"" she added.
 According to an EU source cited by Bloomberg, any retaliatory tariffs would be ready immediately.
Bloomberg also reported that Juncker would put two separate plans on the negotiating table that would be intended to stop any further escalation in the trade conflict.
The first plan is a so-called plurilateral deal, whereby tariffs on autos and auto parts would be reduced by all major auto-exporting countries. Second, according to Bloomberg, Juncker will propose a ""limited"" free-trade agreement between the EU and the US.
The US Commerce Department is investigating auto imports, and Trump has previously threatened large tariffs on imported cars. Earlier this week,  Trump said he was ready to impose a ""tremendous retribution"" against the EU.
""We said if we don't negotiate something fair, then we have tremendous retribution, which we don't want to use, but we have tremendous powers,"" Trump said in a cabinet meeting.
""Including cars — cars is the big one,"" he added. ""And you know what we're talking about with respect to cars and tariffs on cars.""
Many European automakers already have production plants in the USA. BMW and Mercedes both produce cars on large scale in the USA. Mercedes employs 4,000 people at its production plant in Alabama, while BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina makes close to 2,000 cars per day.
Trump, however, wants more production in the USA, saying in a June tweet that companies should: ""Build them here!""
Almost every major auto manufacturer, from foreign companies like Hyundai to American brands like GM and Ford, has submitted comments to the Commerce Department  warning about the possible effect of tariffs on US auto workers and consumers."

In closely watched congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Fed chair said there were ""several years"" of strong jobs and low inflation still ahead for the U.S. economy.
Powell's bullish comments mostly affirmed expectations for two additional rate hikes by the central bank this year.
The Fed has been ahead of its peers in tightening monetary policy and is expected to have raised rates a total of four times in 2018 to tackle rising inflationary pressures.
The U.S. dollar surged to its highest level in a year after Powell's hawkish testimony.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, rose to a high of 95.44 on Thursday, the strongest level since July 14, 2017.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve.
The benchmark 10-year yield rose to around 2.88%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was at 2.62%.
The narrowing gap between 2-year and 10-year Treasury bond yields has added to investor caution, given the so-called yield curve's record in predicting recessions.
An inverted yield curve, a phenomenon in which the two-year yield becomes higher than the longer-dated Treasury yield, is sometimes seen as a sign of waning confidence towards the economy and a signal for a recession.

""We got two economies that add up to around $30 trillion in annual GDP. The amount of trade we're affecting with the tariffs is a rounding error compared to that,"" he said during an interview at the White House.
""My point is that it's much less disruptive than these headlines would suggest, and it's much more constructive as we see the adjustments made in terms of where investment is going to go and where we're going to build."" 
White House officials are giving CNBC a series of interviews as part of the administration's rollout of a new workforce initiative.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC the new tariffs only affect a small portion of imports and that so far they have not had a widespread negative effect on the economy.
""Anecdotally there are some disruptions and I understand that. And there's some retaliation going on,"" he said, adding that despite price increases in steel he had not seen layoffs in steel-consuming industries. ""The things that we've been looking for that are the key indicators are not showing signs of anything serious yet.""

Hassett said 4 percent of imports are affected by the tariffs.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","China boosts liquidity, set for more policy easing as trade war threatens economy","By Andrew Galbraith and Steven Bian
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese policymakers are pumping more liquidity into the financial system and channeling credit to small and medium-sized firms, and Beijing looks set to further loosen monetary conditions to mitigate threats to growth from a heated Sino-U.S. trade war.
The world's second-biggest economy has already started to lose momentum this year as a government campaign to reduce a dangerous build-up of debt has lifted borrowing costs, hitting factory output, business investment and the property sector.
As an intensifying trade conflict raises risks to exporters and overall growth, many economists expect the central bank to further reduce reserve requirements in the coming months - on top of the three reductions made so far this year.
However, few see a cut in the benchmark policy rate this year, as authorities walk a fine line between keeping liquidity conditions supportive and preventing any destabilizing capital outflows that could put the skids on a fragile yuan currency.
On Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said the People's Bank of China (PBOC) plans to introduce incentives that will boost the liquidity of commercial banks. These are aimed at encouraging banks to expand lending and increase their investment in bonds issued by corporates and other entities, such as local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).
The PBOC has also been ensuring ample liquidity by allowing commercial banks to tap its Medium-Term Loan Facility (MLF), especially lenders that have invested in bonds rated AA+ and below, the source said.
The improved cash conditions have been reflected in reduced short-term borrowing costs for banks, with the country's key seven-day money rate at 2.6409 percent on Thursday, 37 basis points lower than recent highs at the end of June.
The combination of lower interbank rates and the push to boost bank support should help to ease financing pressures for weaker firms, analysts said.
""This should spell good news for lower-grade bond markets which have been suffering from a flight to quality-grade bonds, and some firms have subsequently found access to liquidity difficult,"" analysts at Everbright Sun Hung Kai said in a note.
The PBOC uses the MLF and its standing lending facility as tools to manage short- and medium-term liquidity in the banking system.
""These moves, if confirmed, are a sign that the government is stepping up its loosening measures given the weakness in May and June TSF (total social financing) data, lukewarm June activity data, weak asset market performance, and rising trade tensions,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note Thursday, referring to the new incentives.
""We expect the government to take further measures to ensure growth stability, including further RRR cuts.""
China's economy expanded a slower-than-expected 6.7 percent in the second quarter, and June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low as the trade dispute with the United States intensified.
HELP FOR SMEs
To be sure, markets don't expect aggressive policy loosening, given Beijing's broad deleveraging pledge and fears that doing so could hit the yuan and trigger a spike in capital outflows.
Trade war worries have already weighed on the yuan, which hit a one-year low on Thursday.
A key focus is on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for 80 percent of all jobs in China, and have suffered from rising borrowing costs and a shrinking credit pool amid Beijing's three-year-long crackdown on off-balance sheet financing and a corporate debt build-up.
A trader at a state-run copper smelter in southern China told Reuters his firm has resorted to selling inventory to raise cash in light of the tougher financing conditions.
""Banks give [loans], but the cost has gone up,"" said the trader, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to comment on his firm's finances.
While the PBOC did not respond to faxed questions about its plans, a Shanghai-based trader at an Asian bank said the bond market had seen a notable pick-up in the volume of trade of LGFV debt.
The heavy liabilities of local governments has been an area of concern as Beijing continues its campaign to reduce excessive financial leverage.
Trade in private firms' corporate bonds, where defaults have spiked this year, did not see a similar jump.
But the trader said even if the PBOC had directed commercial banks to invest in such bonds, it would be too early to see an impact.
""This will need some time ... banks need to have credit lines with the companies whose bonds they are buying.""

668,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 07:23AM ET</span>",UK watchdog and EU tell banks to prepare for hard Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks and insurers must plan for a ""hard"" Brexit in case a transition period is not in place next March, a senior British regulator said on Thursday in a warning echoed by Brussels.
""With eight months until we exit the European Union in March 2019, it is important we all -- regulators and industry -- continue to plan for a range of scenarios,"" said Nausicaa Delfas, head of international strategy at the Financial Conduct Authority.
""Across the FCA, together with colleagues from the Bank of England and the government, we have been working to develop a number of safeguards and contingencies, in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that 'day 1' works smoothly,"" Delfas told an event held by TheCityUK.
Britain and the EU have agreed on a transition deal bridging Brexit in March next year and the end of 2020, but it has yet to be ratified, meaning financial firms based in Britain could face an abrupt end to EU market access.
EU banking, insurance and markets watchdogs have already warned their respective sectors to be ready for a hard Brexit. The bloc's executive European Commission told EU states on Thursday to ""intensify preparedness"" for a potentially disruptive Brexit.
Britain has said it and the EU should act to ensure that cross-border financial contracts like derivatives and insurance policies can still be serviced after March, but the EU reiterated on Thursday that it won't legislate for now.
""In relation to contracts, at this juncture, there does not appear to be an issue of a general nature linked to contract continuity as in principle, even after withdrawal, the performance of existing obligations can continue,"" the European Commission said on Thursday.
It is unclear what sort of EU market access financial firms in Britain will have after the transition period ends, prompting many banks and insurers to have new hubs up and running in the bloc by next March to avoid potential disruption.
A group of eight EU states also called for a redoubling of efforts to build a capital markets union in the bloc to provide ""stable and cost-effective"" funding for EU companies, given that Britain, Europe's biggest financial center, is leaving.
DO YOUR OWN THING
Britain's government wants future financial services trade with the EU based on an ""enhanced"" version of the bloc's basic ""equivalence"" regime used by Japan, Switzerland and the United States.
Brussels alone grants access to foreign firms if it deems that their home country rules are equivalent or aligned enough with those in the bloc.
Britain says this is one-sided and wants changes to make it more predictable and transparent. The EU is amending the regime, but its alterations would make it tougher on big foreign trading and clearing firms like those found in the UK's financial sector. 
Hugh Savill, director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers said that even with enhanced equivalence, the EU's ""imperialist"" approach to rule-making would have a chilling effect on how UK regulators can supervise markets and consumers.
""Nobody wants to be in the position of a rule taker,"" Delfas said.
Antony Manchester, head of Brexit at asset manager BlackRock (N:BLK) said enhanced equivalence can be made to work, but Britain and the EU have different ideas on what it means.
""In these debates on equivalence... the UK and EU are quite evenly matched in terms of financial services. That means we will see something more like the negotiations between the EU and U.S., where we give and take on both sides,"" Manchester said.
But the EU and United States took four years to agree equivalence on a rules just for clearing derivatives, raising concerns in Britain over what the City financial district could face after Brexit.

Manchester, a former UK Treasury official, said if Brussels does not deem a UK firm to be equivalent, British regulators could choose to ""do our own thing"", raising concerns about predictability for international financial firms.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's trade commissioner said on Thursday she hopes an EU mission to Washington will ease a transatlantic trade dispute but the bloc is preparing a list of U.S. imports to hit if the United States imposes tariffs on EU cars.
Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom will travel to Washington on July 25 with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, with the latter due to hold talks focused on trade with U.S. President Donald Trump.
The United States imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum on June 1 and Trump is threatening to extend them to EU cars and car parts.
Malmstrom said the U.S. car sector was healthy and that no one involved in the sector had called for tariffs.
""We are preparing together with our member states a list of rebalancing measures there as well. And this we have made that clear to our American partners,"" Malmstrom told a conference hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Brussels. 
The EU has already imposed its own import tariffs on 2.8 billion euros ($3.25 billion) worth of U.S. products ranging from bourbon to motor-bikes.
Corresponding measures for cars would be far higher.
EU steel and aluminum exports to the United States, which are now subject to tariffs, are worth some 6.4 billion euros per year. EU car and car part exports are worth 51 billion euros.
The Commission on Wednesday briefed representatives of EU countries on possible action.
One EU diplomat familiar with Wednesday's talks said the Commission gave no examples of U.S. products that might be hit, but said they could in theory total 9 billion euros, although it could also go for a larger list of products with lower tariffs.
Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Wednesday he expected Juncker to come with a significant trade offer. EU officials have downplayed suggestions Juncker will arrive with a novel plan to restore good relations.
Some reports have said that a multilateral deal to remove car tariffs was one idea put forward. Malmstrom on Thursday questioned the viability of such a plan and also said a bilateral deal with the United States to scrap car tariffs could only be done if part of a broader trade agreement.
""The aim of President Juncker's visit is to try to establish a good relations, try to see how we can de-escalate the situation, avoiding it going further and see if there is a forum where we can discuss these issues,"" Malmstrom said.

""We don't go there to negotiate anything,"" she added.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","Rising interest rates, trade wars erode credit outlook: survey","By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK (LPC) - Corporate credit spreads are seen widening and defaults likely will escalate as interest rates climb and global trade wars loom, according to a quarterly survey by the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers.
The outlook is weakest for North America, where the economic expansion is seen far along and the Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates seven times since late 2015 and is expected to hike twice more this year.
“In the US and the rest of North America, it’s a classic inflationary environment,” Som-lok Leung, IACPM’s executive director, said in a statement. “As interest rates rise, one would expect to see wider spreads and higher defaults and, in fact, this is a trend we’ve seen for the past few months.”
IACPM is an association of more than 100 financial institutions in 21 countries.
Rising interest rates pose a particular threat to highly indebted companies, and those needing to access capital markets as borrowing costs increase.
IACPM’s 3-month credit spread outlook index sank to a reading of minus 66 in the second quarter from minus 56.2 the prior quarter.
The outlook was last this negative a decade ago during the financial crisis, when the reading was similar at minus 69.1 in the second quarter of 2008.
Negative numbers indicate an expectation that credit spreads will widen and defaults will increase.
IACPM’s 12-month credit default outlook index eroded to minus 51.1 in the quarter from minus 47.2, the most negative reading since minus 52.8 in the second quarter of 2016.
The survey found slightly less negative views for Europe.
“While the European Central Bank has announced an end to Quantitative Easing in December, it also says it will keep its key lending rate at zero percent until next summer,” Leung said. “Spreads may widen because they have nowhere else to go, but there’s no rush to see significantly higher default rates.”
A smaller 56% of those surveyed look for higher defaults over the next year in Europe than the 66% of respondents that expect rising defaults in North America.
Hanging over the credit markets globally is also the threat of trade wars, which are inflationary and could drive up defaults, as well as the ripple effects of Brexit, the association said. Those surveyed said it is too soon to predict the ultimate impact of either situation.
The International Monetary Fund on Monday warned in its World Economic Outlook update that growing and sustained trade conflicts are increasingly likely, Reuters reported. The US is particularly vulnerable to a slowing of exports due to retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, according to the IMF.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan downgraded its assessment of business sentiment and warned that global trade tensions could cloud the economy's recovery prospects, a sign that policymakers are increasingly worried about damage the U.S.-China trade dispute could inflict on growth.
In its monthly report for July released on Thursday, the government kept intact its assessment for a seventh straight month that Japan's economy was ""recovering at a moderate pace"".
But it said business sentiment was ""almost flat,"" a bleaker view than in June when it said the mood was improving.
The downgrade came after a Bank of Japan survey showed business confidence worsened for a second straight quarter in April-June, reflecting companies' jitters over U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies.
The government added a warning in the report that it must be ""vigilant"" about the impact that trade frictions between the United States and China could have on the global economy.
Attention must also be paid to the economic fallout from the heavy rain and flooding that struck western Japan earlier this month, the report said.
""The damage from the heavy rain has been broad-based,"" and could affect the economy through disruption in plant operations and supply chains, as well as damage to infrastructure such as expressways and railroads, the report said.
Japan's economy contracted in the first quarter on weak private consumption, ending the longest growth streak since the 1980s bubble economy, as firms remained wary of raising wages.
Analysts expect growth to rebound in the second quarter, though some say escalating trade frictions could weigh on the export-reliant economy and discourage firms from boosting capital expenditure. Second quarter growth data will be announced on Aug. 10.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's strident rebukes of officials during recent trips to industrial sites were aimed at rallying support at home for his economic drive and convincing outsiders about his willingness to denuclearize.
After racing toward his goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, Kim in April shifted his focus to the economy. In June, Kim held an unprecedented summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore, where he lauded the city-state's economic progress and ""world-class"" amenities.
This month, the young leader has toured industrial facilities and special economic zones near North Korea's border with China, often lambasting officials over delayed construction projects or lackluster modernization of production lines, according to state media.
Kim has openly slammed executives on previous economic field trips, unlike his reclusive father. The latest criticisms appear an attempt to spur economic development nationwide - and shift blame to bureaucrats where progress has lagged, experts say.
""Now that economic development is made a main party line, he needs to show results but could have realized things were not so beautiful on the ground,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul.
""To the people inside, he's trying to say it's not the fault of himself or them but that of the party executives, while encouraging ordinary citizens to work hard.""
With nuclear talks with Washington under way, Kim may also want to dispel suspicion about denuclearisation by highlighting his zeal for economic development.
Kim made a broad commitment at the Singapore summit to ""work toward denuclearisation,"" but fell short of details on how or when he would dismantle the nuclear programs.
""While trying to win the people's heart, Kim would want to show that he's making an all-out effort on the economy and he really means it, and defuse suspicions about denuclearisation,"" said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
""SPEECHLESS""
This week, Kim blasted ""shameless"" and ""pathetic"" executives at a power plant site in the northeastern Hamkyong Province, ""speechless"" after realizing that only 70 percent of construction was completed since it started 17 years ago, the official KCNA news agency reported.
Earlier this month, Kim berated managers of a textile mill in the border city of Sinuiju for blaming the lack of raw materials and money despite their poor work at the planned upgrade of the factory, according to KCNA.
After Kim's reported criticism, Pak Pong Ju, premier of North Korea and a top economic official, followed up with visits to a number of sites, including the Sinuiju textile mill factory.
Pak held meetings to discuss ""perfecting the modernization of production processes"" and making factories into ""manpower-saving, technology-intensive"" facilities, according to a state media report on Thursday.
The rebukes appeared part of Kim's efforts to mimic his popular, affable late grandfather, Kim Il Sung, in creating a bond between the leader and the people, said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Center's 38 North website.
""That some senior officials are being lackadaisical in their official duties, he made a point of saying they only come out for the official opening events and aren't being responsible in the daily work,"" Madden said.
""This is similar to speeches and remarks that were made by Kim Il Sung who did the same thing.""
BORDER FOCUS
Kim's recent tour to the northeast was the first full-fledged provincial visit in more than a year and illustrated his changing priorities, said Hong Min, a fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
Kim has made 11 appearances at economic events and three military inspections so far this year, mostly near the capital of Pyongyang, according to a Reuters analysis of data by South Korea's Unification Ministry. Between January and July last year, Kim took 30 military trips and made 15 economic outings.
The North Korean leader did make at least some military related stops on his latest tour, including taking a trial trip on a newly built warship at the Chongjin Shipyard.
Large scale trips to regional areas are usually planned three months in advance after careful deliberations on the location, and the pick of the border region suggests Kim's resolve to boost economic co-operation with China, Hong said.
""Where he goes first matters, especially after a pause, because it gives different messages depending on the region,"" Hong said.
Kim has traveled to China three times since May, and also sent a high-level delegation on a 10-day tour of major economic hubs in China.
Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said Kim's goal may be to encourage Beijing to push back against U.N. sanctions that have squeezed North Korea's economy.

""Rather than eyeing China as an economic model, he will most likely seek to expand trade and find some breathing space, hoping that China would loosen its enforcement of sanctions.""

1. Trade War Fears Return To The Forefront
Trade war jitters returned to the forefront after China said comments made by a senior White House official blaming Chinese President Xi Jinping for blocking progress on a deal to avert a trade war were ""shocking"" and ""bogus"" accusations.
On Wednesday, Larry Kudlow, who heads the White House Economic Council, said that he believed lower-ranking Chinese officials want a deal, including Xi's senior economic adviser Liu He, but that Xi has refused to make changes to China's technology transfer and other trade policies.
Asked about Kudlow's comments, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said earlier: ""That the relevant United States official unexpectedly distorted the facts and made bogus accusations is shocking and beyond imagination.""
The U.S. and China this month slapped tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports in an escalating trade tussle that has roiled financial markets.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs unless Beijing agrees to change its intellectual property practices and high-technology industrial subsidy plans.
At the same time, the European Union is preparing a list of counter-measures to potential U.S. tariffs on European cars, European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said today, adding she hoped an EU visit to Washington could help ease tensions.
2. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Lower Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open, as investors continued to keep a wary eye on recent trade disputes between the U.S. and several of its trading partners.
At 5:30AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were down 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures also indicated a downbeat start to their respective trading sessions.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses traded lower, with the different sectors mostly in negative territory. Basic resources fell 1.5%, among the worst-performers in mid-morning trade.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed mixed, with major markets fading after initially trading higher. China's Shanghai composite shed 0.5%, marking a fifth straight session of declines, while the yuan sank to fresh one-year lows (USD/CNH).
The move lower has prompted speculation that Chinese policymakers are allowing their currency to weaken in order to offset the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, by making their exports more competitive.
3. Microsoft Is Next Up In String Of Tech Results
Following earnings from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the start of the week, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the next big name from the technology sector to report quarterly results after the markets close on Thursday.
Analysts are forecasting earnings per share EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $29.21 billion. In the prior-year quarter, the company earned $0.98 on revenue of $24.7 billion.
Microsoft has beat earnings estimates in each of the past 8 quarters.
The stock is up about 22% year to date, slightly below its recent all-time high of $106.50 on July 17.
Results in the morning are also expected from Dow member Travelers (NYSE:TRV). Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Danaher (NYSE:DHR),  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) and  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) are also on the docket.
After the closing bell, earnings from  Capital One  (NYSE:COF), E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC), Skechers (NYSE:SKX) and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) will all be in the spotlight.
Investors will also be focused on  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shares after the company beat second-quarter earnings expectations laid out by analysts after Wednesday's closing bell.
4. Dollar Rallies To 1-Year High On Fed Rate Hike Bets
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar extended its rally to trade at a one-year high after hawkish comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve underlined expectations for two additional rate hikes by the central bank this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.4% to 95.26, the strongest level since July 14, 2017.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy during congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday, and downplayed the impact of uncertainty over U.S. trade policy on the outlook for additional rate hikes.
Elsewhere, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to around 2.89%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was near 2.63%.
On the data front, the economic calendar brings investors the weekly report on initial jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed’s July reading on manufacturing activity both due at 8:30AM ET.
5. Copper, Gold Prices Crash As Metals Sell Off
Copper and gold prices fell to their lowest levels in a about a year, amid fears that an escalating trade spat between Washington and Beijing could hit demand for metals, particularly if Chinese growth is affected.



Copper futures were down almost 3% to $2.679 a pound, a level not seen since July 14, 2017.
Nickel, zinc and lead also suffered steep selloffs.
Meanwhile, among precious metals, gold tumbled roughly 1% to $1,217.30 an ounce, reaching the weakest in about a year on its fifth consecutive decline.
Silver, platinum and palladium futures were also all down at least 1%.
Metals prices have also been hit by the stronger dollar, which makes commodities priced in the U.S. currency more expensive for overseas buyers.

The United States and China this month slapped tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports in an escalating trade tussle that has roiled financial markets.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs unless Beijing agrees to change its intellectual property practices and high-technology industrial subsidy plans.
On Wednesday, Larry Kudlow, who heads the White House Economic Council, said that he believed lower-ranking Chinese officials want a deal, including Xi's senior economic adviser Liu He, but that Xi has refused to make changes to China's technology transfer and other trade policies. 
Asked about Kudlow's comments, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: ""That the relevant United States official unexpectedly distorted the facts and made bogus accusations is shocking and beyond imagination.""
""The United States' flip-flopping and promise-breaking is recognized globally,"" she told a regular briefing in Beijing.
China has made the utmost efforts to avoid an escalation of trade frictions, Hua said, reiterating that China does not want a trade war but is not afraid of one.
Kudlow said on Wednesday that Xi was ""holding the game up."" 
""I think Liu He and others would like to move but haven't,"" he said at a conference. ""We are waiting for him (Xi). The ball is in his court.""
China could end U.S. tariffs ""this afternoon by providing a more satisfactory approach"" and taking steps that other countries are also calling for, he said.
China's other trading partners, including the European Union, while not supporting tariffs, have also criticized Beijing's trade policies.

China has blamed Washington for the trade conflict, with the foreign ministry calling it the biggest ""confidence killer"" for the global economy, and vowing to fight back if the United States continued to be ""wilful"".

NPB Neue Bank has become the latest Swiss financial company to sign a non prosecution agreement with the DoJ, and agreed to cooperate in criminal or civil proceedings related to undeclared U.S. accounts.
The Zurich-based bank helped clients open and keep undeclared accounts in Switzerland and conceal the assets and income they held in these accounts from the U.S. government, the DoJ said.
It offered a variety of banking services which it knew could help U.S. clients hide assets and income from the tax authorities, the DoJ added.
Between August 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015, NPB held a total of 353 U.S.-related accounts, which included both declared and undeclared accounts, with total value of approximately $400 million.
""The Department of Justice is committed to ending the practice of using foreign bank accounts to evade taxes,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Department’s Tax Division.
""Taxpayers and financial institutions should take notice that the Department is continuing to aggressively pursue these cases.""

679,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 10:32PM ET</span>",Xi's campaign to draw people back to graying rural China faces uphill battle,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
SHUANGFENG COUNTY, China (Reuters) - Liu Deke, 73, puffed away on a roll-up as he threshed stalks of dried rapeseed on a large canvas sheet. Nearby, plumes of billowy smoke from burning stalks drifted across the rice fields. 
It was a normal day's work for Liu and his wife, farmers in Dongfeng village in China's southern Hunan province. And like many others in rural China, their offspring have long ago moved to cities where wages far outstrip farming income.
China's greying rural economies - many composed of small farm holdings and low-end industries - have seen slumping productivity with no alternative engine of economic growth in sight.
The brain drain is so advanced that President Xi Jinping is now calling for the return of talent to the countryside - once unthinkable for a nation that sees urbanization as a ticket to prosperity.
It reflects the ruling Communist Party's desire to elevate the status of rural areas - places that 577 million still live or call home - to fend off risks of social unrest while boosting consumption, as well as controlling growth in big cities.
It's part of an ambitious ""rural rejuvenation"" campaign christened by Xi last October, which will improve rural infrastructure and develop sectors such as modern farming and tourism, attracting investments worth ""trillions of yuan"", said Ma Xiaohe, an advisor at the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, in an interview.
Since then, a number of local governments have pledged incentives to draw entrepreneurs, skilled workers, college graduates and ""modern professional farmers"" back to their rural roots.
The central province of Henan, for example, will offer 6 billion yuan ($890 million) this year to migrants returning to rural areas to launch start-ups. Henan aims to attract 200,000 such ""rural entrepreneurs"" in 2018.
In Hunan's Shuangfeng county - a town surrounded by over 500 villages including Dongfeng - efforts to attract returnees were moving into high gear when Reuters recently visited. 
""No need to go afar for work, the opportunities are right here at home,"" reads one banner hanging between poles at the entrance of Gongxiang village. 
Village chief Chen Deyuan said as much as 500 million yuan has been earmarked for the project in the next five years.
The slogan was created by Wang Xin, a representative of a local rural entrepreneur school, which sells training services to the government.
At her school, people are trained to become e-commerce gurus and tea experts, among other fields deemed important by the local government. Wang said the school hopes to attract people back home, expecting thousands to be trained every year. 
But when the school helped organize a job fair earlier this year and advertised over 200 positions - mostly low-end manufacturing jobs - less than half of that number showed up to apply, she said. 
Still, local officials remain optimistic.
""In three years, I can assure you 80 percent of those who have gone out will come back,"" Chen said.
Yang Yiwen, mayor of Loudi city which oversees villages around Shuangfeng, said major projects, including creating ""specialty towns"" that promote sectors such as tourism, could help.
EXODUS 
Sentiment on the ground is less welcoming. 
""Most of the workers here at our factories are middle-aged or older,"" said He Sha, a clerk at a plant owned by shoe-maker Stella International (HK:1836), where pay averages 2,700 yuan per month.
And the disconnect between millennials who live in cities and their families' rural roots is acute.
For example, 27-year-old Li Jinglong grew up in a small town in Hunan.
Now, a U.S.-educated designer, he has no plans on returning. Li moved to Changsha a year ago to launch his own business, helping start-ups in branding and design.
""If I choose to go back to the countryside one day, that would probably just be out of nostalgia,"" Li said.
The problem largely lies in low rural earnings. 
The median annual disposable income of rural residents was 11,969 yuan in 2017, less than one third of the urban number, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). 
Earnings of the poorest 20 percent of rural households fell 3.8 percent from 2015 to 2017, a separate survey from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics showed, while their worst-off counterparts in the city saw income growth of 12.6 percent in the same period.
To Liu, the rapeseed farmer, there is no future on the land.
""Even those young folks who studied agriculture shouldn't come back,"" he said, and their children should make money in the cities.
It remains unclear how many returnees have been lured back by the latest campaign. Only about 7 million returned to the countryside during 2012-2017, according to CASS.
To be sure, some villages bestowed with rich natural resources may have a better shot at retaining talent. 
In Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, a mountainous area in Hunan known for tea plantations, 25-year-old Xiang Liping was called back by her father from Fujian province to manage the family's organic tea business. 
Business is brisk, but her plantation is understaffed, Xiang said, even after employing all the old people and children in her village. 
""Look at how tall the branches have grown,"" she said. ""We don't have enough people here to pick the leaves.""
AGING CRISIS 
With village populations continuing to gray, rural productivity will only keep falling. 
A 2016 report by China's State Information Centre showed people aged 60 and above made up 15.6 percent of the population in rural China, almost 5 percentage points higher than in the cities. 
In Shuangfeng's Furong village, 68-year-old Zhao Fengling was grateful her children moved her out of her crumbling farmhouse last year and into a new bungalow nearby, with money they earned in faraway cities. 
But for Zhao, loneliness beckons with the recent passing of her husband. 

""When he was alive, we could at least play cards,"" she said, tears welling up her eyes. ""My children are really good to me, but they are busy - making money.""

681,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","ECB to hike rates before next downturn, say confident economists: Reuters poll","By Mumal Rathore and Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will raise rates in the second half of next year, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who were confident that will be before the next economic downturn.
Euro zone growth outpaced that of its major peers last year for the first time since the 2007-08 financial crisis. But the latest poll of more than 100 economists, taken July 10-18, suggests growth momentum has already peaked.
An escalating trade row between the United States and its trading partners remains a real risk to the euro zone and has prompted many economists to trim their growth forecasts.
Gross domestic product growth was forecast to average 2.1 percent this year, 1.8 percent next and 1.6 percent in 2020, slightly lower than the 2.2 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent predicted, respectively, last month.
Still, more than 70 percent of economists - 51 of 69 - who answered an additional question said they were confident the ECB would hike rates before the next economic downturn. Eighteen economists said they were not.
""We are reasonably confident that the ECB will raise rates before the next downturn, but the risk of this not happening has clearly risen with the accelerating trade war, which has come amidst signs of slowing growth momentum,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
The U.S.-led trade spat has also pressured the European Commission and International Monetary Fund to cut their forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year.
Still, when asked about the likelihood of a euro zone recession in the next 12 months, the median response from nearly 60 economists was only 10 percent.
""The big picture is that the economy is doing quite well, the ECB is going to continue painting a pretty positive picture of the economy and continue to highlight the downside risks,"" said Jack Allen, senior economist at Capital Economics.
""It would take a very big increase in protectionism for us really to think that the euro zone economy would grind to a halt,"" he added.
But the probability of a recession in the next two years was 25 percent, with the most pessimistic call at 80 percent.
""Significant risks due to interaction of escalating trade tensions with negative repercussions on sentiment, mounting risk of a U.S. recession and political woes in the European Union may dampen sentiment while domestic activity loses momentum,"" said Martin Wolburg, economist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments.
Economists also lowered growth expectations for the euro zone's top economies.
Germany's economic growth was expected to average 2.0 percent this year and 1.9 percent next, lower than 2.4 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, in the April poll. It was a similar move for France and Italy.
Still, the ECB was forecast to raise the deposit rate by 15 basis points to -0.25 percent in the third quarter next year, before President Mario Draghi's term ends in October 2019. 
The refinancing rate was forecast to rise to 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, despite tepid inflation forecasts for this year and next.
While the latest data showed inflation in the currency bloc rose to the ECB's target, it was mainly driven by volatile energy prices.

Euro zone inflation was forecast to average 1.6 percent this year and next, and 1.7 percent in 2020, similar to last month's poll.

682,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Japan's Trade Minister Suggests Tougher Line on Any Auto Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- If the U.S. imposes tariffs on cars it can expect a stronger response from Japan than when it slapped levies on steel and aluminum shipments.
That’s the message from an interview on Wednesday with Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko.
Japan and the European Union are already working together to address President Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies, and need to cooperate even more closely on threatened auto tariffs, Seko said in Tokyo.
""No real effects have emerged from the steel and aluminum tariffs,"" he said. ""So in part, that’s why we haven’t acted. The case of autos is different. Our response would change."" Seko declined to specify what actions Japan might take.
Japan refrained from striking back at the U.S. over the metals tariffs, which its longtime ally imposed on national security grounds. The EU and China, though, have slapped tit-for-tat levies on some U.S. goods. The U.S. is now challenging those retaliatory tariffs at the World Trade Organization.
Trump has also asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate whether imports of automobiles and parts pose a national security risk.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has tried to cultivate goodwill with Trump, while signing major trade agreements with other countries. On Tuesday in Tokyo, Abe was joined by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk for the signing of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.
Both Japan and the EU have had to react to a protectionist turn in U.S. trade policy under Trump, who pulled the U.S. out of the original Trans-Pacific Partnership in his first week in office. The EU will likely float a plan to Trump to cut tariffs on cars and car parts among all major auto exporters, according to an official with knowledge the plans.

Seko said it is important that the U.S. understand the value of multilateral trade agreements, emphasizing Japan’s leadership in deals such as the 11-member trans-Pacific agreement signed this year and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
""Concluding large free trade deals like RCEP is an important message at a time like this, when protectionist movements are getting extremely strong,"" he said.
Seko allowed that moving forward with RCEP won’t be easy. Japan and India need to discuss market access, and wide gaps remain among Japan, China and India on trade rules, he said.
But Seko said he’s not pessimistic about reaching a basic agreement by the end of the year, noting that everyone, including India and China, share that goal.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 04:57PM ET</span>","Fed walks careful line on trade, but downside risks emerging","By Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's official line on U.S. trade policy is one of careful deference to the Trump administration, acknowledging it is outside the Fed's responsibility and that it might all turn out for the best.
But in two days of congressional testimony and a broadcast interview last week the central banker also hinted the Fed may be more concerned about current trade tensions than it is letting on, as uncertainty reshapes business investment in ways that could alter the course of the economy and thus Fed policy. 
""Lots and lots of individual companies have been harmed by this. We don't see it in the aggregate numbers yet because it is a $20 trillion dollar economy and these things take time to show up,"" Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday, one of a series of cautionary statements that he has made about trade once prompted by questions. ""We hear many many stories of companies that are concerned and are now beginning to make investment decisions, or not make them, because of this.”
That view has become broadly shared at the central bank even if it has yet to hit the Fed's top line policy documents.
The Fed raised rates in June and policymakers indicated they expect two more rate increases this year. Powell said nothing in his testimony this week to undermine that, and in fact said the economy was poised for several more years of growth.
But under steady questioning from House and Senate members, he laid out a jarring view of what might be on the horizon ""in principle"" if trade threats turn into globally higher tariffs: lower wages, less investment, lower productivity, and the sort of stagflation that would leave the Fed struggling against both rising prices and ebbing growth.
""The bottom line is a more protectionist economy, is an economy that is less competitive, less productive. This is a torch we have been carrying around the world for 75 years,"" Powell said. ""If that is where this goes, we don't know where it would lead.""
The Fed's latest Beige Book report of conversations with local business leaders highlighted the gap between the broad economic data the Fed focuses on and the individual business decisions that ultimately make up the macroeconomic landscape. 
Reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks showed businesses buoyed by a strong economy, but almost uniformly worried about trade policies that were raising prices of inputs and clouding an otherwise optimistic horizon.
The words ""tariff"" or ""tariffs"" have appeared dozens of times in the three Beige Books published since April, including 31 references in the July report released on Wednesday, compared to 20 times overall in the prior two decades of reports.
BALANCING ACT
Powell's careful approach to this week's congressional committee hearings - not directly criticizing the administration and framing any negative consequences only as things that could happen in theory - is part of any Fed chair's playbook of sticking to monetary policy and steering clear of elected leaders' domains. 
Among his predecessors, former Chairman Ben Bernanke pointedly told lawmakers in an early 2013 congressional appearance that Congress' forced spending cuts would hurt a still-weak recovery. But in edging toward that critique of fiscal policy he had the benefit of hard data estimating fiscal austerity would cut perhaps half a percentage point from economic growth. 
Absent that, Powell has had to balance the administration's claim it ultimately wants lower tariffs and freer trade against the fact that the higher tariffs it has imposed are already causing prices to rise and, as some farm state senators noted, costing U.S. businesses market share.
""There is a bigger impact on behavior than we are seeing"" in the national economic data yet, said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital and author of a book on Fed politics. ""The line that Powell tried to walk seems at odds with the heightened uncertainty.""
Asked directly by one House member ""are we or are we not in a trade war,"" Powell quietly deferred: ""It's not for me to say.""
Though Fed officials have often said their forecasts won't change based on the risk of a trade conflict, they are sensitive to how threats of bad outcomes can influence the future. In 2015, expected rate hikes were delayed after a crash in China's stock market prompted officials to pause while assessing the possible spillover to the United States. 
Trump's trade actions have been narrow so far, limited to a few goods like washing machines and imported steel and aluminum, and a few tens of billions of dollars of imports from China.
But he has also threatened a much broader net that would tax autos imported from any country and all of the half trillion dollars worth of goods bought from China. 

If those measures roll out in coming months, it may make the Fed's expected September rate increase ""the end of the easy hiking decisions,"" said Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli. ""Should the administration continue pursuing such protectionist policies, the Fed will see higher risks to its outlook and will have additional reasons for pausing.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States may hammer out a trade deal with Mexico, and then do a separate one with Canada later, sowing fresh doubts about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
""We have had very good sessions with Mexico and with the new president of Mexico, who won overwhelmingly, and we're doing very well on our trade agreement,"" Trump said to reporters ahead of a meeting of his cabinet at the White House. 
""So we'll see what happens. We may do a deal separately with Mexico and we'll negotiate with Canada at a later time. But we're having very good discussions with Mexico.""
Trump pledged during his election campaign to revamp the 24-year-old NAFTA trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which he has called a disaster for the United States.
However, the negotiations that started last August have moved slowly. They were initially scheduled to finish by the end of 2017, but the deadline has been extended several times as Canada and Mexico struggle to accommodate U.S. demands.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he wants a good relationship with the United States and that his transition team will participate in future NAFTA talks. He met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Wednesday that he would travel to Washington for bilateral trade talks on July 26 and would later meet with Canadian officials.
Guajardo, Mexico's top trade official, told reporters that the three countries were ""resuming negotiations"" on NAFTA.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, asked whether trilateral talks and separate Canadian talks were off the table, said: ""We're continuing both of those tracks. We see a lot of progress on the conversations with Mexico, and if we could make a bilateral deal with them, we're certainly very happy to do that. But, again, we're continuing both conversations, both tracks.""
At the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Pompeo said he hoped there would be progress on trade talks soon.
""We made clear to them (Mexico) that the migration issue must be resolved and we need to have strong borders,"" he said about last week's visit.
""We talked to them about trade. There will be more, I think, in the coming days to talk about - the progress we're making on trying to resolve the issues on NAFTA. I'm very hopeful there.""
Lopez Obrador has said he wants NAFTA maintained.
Trump is taking a more aggressive, protectionist posture on trade than his recent predecessors, which has sparked retaliatory measures from countries around the world.

The United States launched World Trade Organization dispute actions against its North American neighbors on Monday, as well as China, the European Union and Turkey, to challenge tariffs the countries put in place following U.S. duties on steel and aluminum.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that European leaders were coming to Washington next week to try to hammer out a deal focused largely on car tariffs, while his top economic adviser accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of holding up a U.S.-China trade deal.
Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's visit will discuss car tariffs, which he cited as ""the big one"" among U.S.-EU trade irritants.
Trump considers the EU's 10 percent tariff on cars to be unfair compared to the U.S. 2.5 percent tariff, although the United States maintains a 25 percent tariff on pickup trucks.
""They're going to be coming on July 25th to negotiate with us. We said if we don't negotiate something fair, then we have tremendous retribution. Which we don't want to use, but we have tremendous powers,"" Trump said.
Trump has threatened to levy higher tariffs, as much as 25 percent on imported cars, and his Commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is conducting a study on whether vehicle and parts imports threaten national security.
Larry Kudlow, who heads the White House Economic Council, said separately at an investment forum in New York that he has been told that Juncker would be ""bringing a very important free trade offer"" to Trump on his visit. 
Kudlow said he believed Xi has blocked progress on a deal to end dueling U.S. and Chinese tariffs. He added that lower-ranking officials want a deal, including Xi's top economic adviser Liu He, but Xi has refused to make changes to China's technology transfer and other trade policies.
""So far as we know, President Xi, at the moment, does not want to make a deal,"" Kudlow said at the Delivering Alpha conference sponsored by CNBC and Institutional Investor magazine.
""I think Xi is holding the game up. I think Liu He and others would like to move but haven't,"" Kudlow said. ""We are waiting for him (Xi). The ball is in his court.""
China could end U.S. tariffs ""this afternoon by providing a more satisfactory approach"" and taking steps that other countries are also calling for, he said. 

These included cutting tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports, ending the ""theft"" of intellectual property and allowing full foreign ownership of companies operating in China, Kudlow said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Manufacturers in every one of the Federal Reserve's 12 districts worried about the impact of tariffs, a Federal Reserve report said on Wednesday, even as the U.S. economy continued to expand at a moderate to modest pace.
The latest snapshot of the health of the economy, derived from the central bank's discussions with business contacts around the country, echoed anecdotes from lawmakers in Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday of the impact in their districts of tariffs during a two-day hearing with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
""Manufacturers in all districts expressed concern about tariffs and in many districts reported higher prices and supply disruptions that they attributed to the new trade policies,"" the Fed said in its report.
President Donald Trump so far has imposed or threatened tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and riled key allies by slapping on steel and aluminum tariffs.
Powell has said that the Fed has yet to see material change to the economy showing up in data and he repeated this week that the central bank intends to keep raising interest rates gradually as it seeks to keep pace with a strengthening economy but not raise rates so high or so fast that it weakens growth.
But a number of districts detailed how the uncertainty over escalating trade disputes between the United States and China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere, were already hitting firms to varying degrees.
In Boston for example, contacts expressed concern but none had yet to see it feed through into demand or hiring and capital expenditure plans.
However, in New York trade uncertainty was ""a major concern"" while in Philadelphia a machinery manufacturer said the impact of steel tariffs ""have been chaotic to its supply chain – disrupting planned orders, increasing prices, and prompting some panic buying.""
A number of districts reported higher input costs due to the import tariffs raising prices for fuel, metals and other goods.
Economic growth has accelerated this year and unemployment is lower than policymakers believe is sustainable in the longer-run. However, there are few signs yet of a spike in inflation high enough to force the Fed to up the pace of rate rises.
The Fed's last three rate hikes have come at a pace of every other meeting, and it projects another two rate rises by year- end following moves in March and June.
Elsewhere in the report, the Fed's contacts continued to note tight labor markets and a shortage of skilled workers, but wage increases remained modest to moderate. The price of key inputs rose further and some districts said that they expected pricing pressures to intensify further.
The Beige Book was prepared by the Boston Fed with information collected on or before July 9.

The ""Section 232"" probe was prompted by a petition filed by two U.S. uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy Inc (A:URG) and  Energy Fuels  Inc (A:UUUU), complaining that subsidized foreign competitors have caused them to cut capacity and lay off workers.
Ross said the probe would canvass the entire U.S. uranium sector from mining through enrichment and defense and industrial consumption.
Uranium is used in the U.S. nuclear arsenal and powers the Navy's nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines, along with 99 U.S. commercial nuclear reactors that produce 20 percent of the electricity consumed in the United States.
Ross added that the U.S. production of uranium has fallen to 5 percent of U.S. consumption needs from 49 percent in 1987.
""The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine whether uranium imports threaten to impair national security,"" Ross said.
The new probe is the fourth launched by the Trump administration under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, previously a seldom-invoked Cold War-era law.

Probes on steel and aluminum imports have led to tariffs and quotas on the metals, prompting retaliation from trading partners including Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The Commerce Department is also conducting a ""Section 232"" probe into automotive imports that could lead to a significant hike in U.S. tariffs for the sector.

Juncker is due meet U.S. President Donald Trump on July 25 with a clear focus on trade after the United States imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and Trump's repeated threats to extend those measures to European cars.
Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said he expected Juncker to come with a ""significant"" trade offer.
However, EU officials have sought to lower expectations about what Juncker can achieve and downplayed suggestions that he will arrive with a novel plan to restore good relations.
The bloc previously offered to open its markets wider to U.S. imports, including cars, as part of a reciprocal but limited trade deal, but Washington rebuffed the proposal.
Juncker told a news conference on Wednesday he was ""upbeat and relaxed"" at the prospect of next week's meeting, but said the European Union would not be intimidated.
""We will continue to react tit-for-tat to the provocations that might be thrown at us,"" he said.
Juncker has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump's decision to impose trade tariffs and last month told lawmakers that Trump had called him a ""brutal killer"" at a Group of Seven meeting in Canada.
Junker said he would seek again to explain to Trump that the European Commission coordinates trade policy for the 28-country European Union and that the United States could therefore not forge a trade deal with just one of its members.

""When it comes to trade, the European Union, its internal market, its single market, form an indivisible unity and it's the Commission that is in charge of articulating trade policy. All efforts to divide the European Union are in vain,"" Juncker said.

Villeroy, who is also governor of the Bank of France, said that emergence of protectionism was the biggest threat not only to global growth, but also the U.S. economy.
But other risks abounded in the form of financial volatility in some emerging markets, Britain's complicated exit from the European Union and questions over Italy's budget policies. 
""It should be pointed out that uncertainties weighing on the economic outlook affect relatively less the inflation outlook,"" Villeroy told the finance commission of France's lower house of parliament.
Against that backdrop, the European Central Bank had laid out a strategy last month to return to a more conventional monetary policy after years of crisis as euro zone inflation neared its target of two percent, he said.

Specifically, that meant that the ECB should end its net asset purchases in December and its first interest rate increase could come in the summer of 2019 at the earliest ""depending on inflation data"", Villeroy added.

Denmark and the United States have been concerned about China's interest in Greenland, a self-ruling part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Their most notable area of concern is China's potential involvement in the financing and construction of three airport expansions on the huge island.
""We are planning to have a representative in China in order to continue strengthening trade with the country,"" said minister for foreign affairs Vivian Motzfeldt, according to KNR.
The idea is not new, but it has not been discussed publicly at government level since 2014. 
She did not set a timeline for when the office may be set up. Greenland already has foreign representations in Copenhagen, Brussels and Washington, and will open a fourth in Reykjavik later this year.
Beijing laid out ambitions in January to form a ""Polar Silk Road"" by developing shipping lanes opened up by global warming and encouraging enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic.
Greenland, with a population of only 56,000, is rich in mineral resources but the development of its industry has been slow, leaving its economy reliant on fishing.

A defense treaty between Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military almost unlimited rights in Greenland, where it has an air base at Thule.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Greece prepares to fly solo on bond markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Once the outcast of European bond markets, Greece appears firmly on the road to redemption.
After years of austerity, the expiry of an 86 billion euro ($100 billion) bailout in August will mark the end of an era in which Greece defaulted, 10-year yields topped 40 percent and the country came perilously close to being kicked out of the euro.
Now, as Greece follows fellow financial crisis victims Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus back into the fold, it needs to lure long-term investors into its bond market so the country can fund itself independently once the bailout cash runs out.
That could happen with a new bond issue to tap into positive sentiment around the end of the country's third bailout, inclusion in European Central Bank bond purchases or further credit upgrades for its debt which is still rated junk.
""The sun is shining on Greece. It is in a radically different place and ratings agencies are very likely to continue to upgrade the country,"" said Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which manages $1.7 trillion of assets.
A significant milestone would be for the European Central Bank (ECB) to include Greek bonds in its massive quantitative easing (QE) stimulus scheme once the bailout ends.
As Greece is rated below investment grade, it has only had access to cheap central bank cash because it is part of a bailout program. The ECB has made clear that once Greece leaves the program its waiver will be revoked.
To be included in QE, Greece would need to pass an ECB debt sustainability analysis and that is unlikely to happen until the country has implemented reforms agreed in June with Eurogroup creditors to ease its debt profile.
At almost 180 percent, Greece has the highest ratio of debt to gross domestic product in the euro zone.
To view a graphic on Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio, click: https://reut.rs/2NI1n4m 
SPECIAL CASE
Analysts at HSBC, however, noted that Greece was considered a special case by euro zone authorities, implying there could be some leniency on the conditions it needs to qualify for QE.
If the ECB is satisfied Greece's debt is sustainable, this would pave the way for Greek bonds to be included in the final months of QE, or at least be included next year in the bank's program to reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds.
""We believe that the June Eurogroup agreement has materially increased the chances that Greek bonds are included in ECB bond purchases,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Francois Cabau.
He estimates the ECB could buy about 3 billion euros of Greek debt before hitting the limit on how much of the country's debt it can purchase. 
Having received 260 billion euros in financial aid since 2010, Greece's exit from the bailout program will be momentous for the euro zone too. It will be the last European Union member state to come off life support after Ireland in 2013, Spain and Portugal in 2014 and Cyprus in 2016.
Some long-term investors, such as J.P. Morgan's Gartside say, the positive sentiment means they would ""definitely"" buy a new Greek bond, a departure from the situation now where most private sector bondholders are hedge funds or domestic banks.
The improving picture helped Greek bonds return more than 40 percent last year in dollar terms and they have performed strongly in 2018 too (GR10YT=RR). Two-year yields have fallen 60 bps so far this year to 1.05 percent , well below 2-year U.S. Treasury yields (US2YT=RR).

ON A ROLL? 
Besides its junk credit rating, the market's small size and low traded volumes mean Greek bonds have been shunned by many big investors who prefer more liquid and accessible markets. 
About 83 percent of Greece's outstanding 332 billion euros of debt is held by official lenders, while the rest is with hedge funds, banks and domestic pension funds. 
With only about 40 billion euros worth of bonds actually trading, the market is a fraction of the 2 trillion euros or so that trade in German, French and Italian markets.
Athens is under no immediate pressure to tap the bond markets. It is still due a final 15 billion euro installment under the bailout package and will therefore have a cash buffer in excess of 24 billion euros, according to Swiss bank UBS. 
That suggests Greece has enough funding to last through 2020 but a new bond would add liquidity to the Greek market.
""If you think that lots of corporates price off the government bond yield curve, building a benchmark makes a lot of sense,"" said Gartside at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
Bond strategists reckon a new 10-year Greek issue could yield about 4 percent. That could prove attractive, given it would be 10 times what euro safe haven, Germany, pays for 10-year cash and well above the 2.5 percent paid by Italy. 
There was strong demand for a sale of seven-year Greek bonds in February that was seen as a litmus test of private sector interest.
But investors have tended to be those with a strong stomach for risk - notably hedge funds - who have been buying Greek bonds throughout the crisis.
U.S.-based Japonica Partners, for example, bought Greek debt at the height of the 2012 crisis and continued to buy in subsequent years.
""Our research team had discovered systemic misconceptions with a related massive under-valuation - at the core was a miscalculated and overstated debt number,"" said Japonica's finance director Christopher Magarian. 
(For an interactive graphic on Greek government debt: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JYhBYShttps://tmsnrt.rs/2JYhBYS)
RATINGS WATCH
Another significant boost for Greek bonds would come from better credit ratings.
While Greece's sovereign ratings were upgraded by S&P Global and DBRS after the deal with lenders in June, the country's debt is still rated B+/B3/B by the three main agencies - five to seven notches below investment grade.
Moody's, for example, scores Greece on a par with Angola, Egypt and Ecuador. That leaves it outside major bond indexes that mainstream funds use as benchmarks. 
""Greece is an asset that is not in a developed or an emerging market benchmark, which means it's in a bit of financial no-man's land,"" said Mark Dowding, a senior portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management.
To enter the Markit iBOXX EUR euro zone index, which has a market value of more than 6 trillion euros, Greece needs an average BBB rating at least. That could take a while, given Portugal spent five years climbing back to investment grade. 
But for many investors, inclusion in benchmark bond indexes has become less important than the outright rating, so a higher score could be enough to increase their exposure to Greek bonds. 
Dowding expects Greece will eventually follow Spain and Portugal, where 10-year borrowing costs have fallen 280 basis points and 200 basis points respectively since 2014 when they ended their bailouts. (ES10YT=RR) (PT10YT=RR) 
""It's been one of the stronger investment calls that we've been making and it is a constructive turnaround story,"" he said.

695,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 08:03AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canada housing agency pushes for better income checks to catch fraud,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's housing agency has asked the country's tax authority to take a ""more direct and formal role"" verifying income claimed on mortgage applications, part of a two-year plan to tackle mortgage fraud, documents obtained by Reuters show.
Unlike tax authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) does not verify income for lenders, even with taxpayer's consent.
That may change, as Canada's overheated housing market draws comparisons to the United States in the years before the subprime mortgage crisis, made worse because many borrowers overstated their income.
""The CRA is currently exploring different avenues in which to improve how it delivers taxpayer specific information in a secure manner, including the feasibility of securely sharing tax information with financial institutions upon client consent,"" the tax agency said in an emailed statement.
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) action plan, obtained by Reuters under public records laws, shows the agency is concerned about systemic risk posed by mortgage fraud. The agency has said repeatedly that there is little evidence of widespread fraud in Canada, but it also says data is limited. 
""The industry's current detection tools have not kept pace with the increasing sophistication of threat we face,"" says the plan, adding that paperless transactions, pressure to close deals quickly, rising prices and new regulations ""create strong incentives for individuals or mortgage professionals to engage in opportunistic - or criminal - fraud.""
The documents describe several other initiatives, including the roll out of Citadel, software from Equifax (N:EFX) that flags high-risk mortgage applications.
Isabel Vives, CMHC's Manager, Mortgage Insurance Fraud Risk Management, said the agency has been testing Citadel since January and plans to go live within a few months. 
""EASILY FALSIFIED""
In recent years, two Canadian lenders –  Home Capital Group Inc  (TO:HCG) and Laurentian Bank of Canada (TO:LB) – have reported problems with borrowers misrepresenting their income in limited and specific groups of mortgages, although they did not involve unusual defaults. But as the CMHC plan notes, rising home prices and low unemployment can mask fraud.
In January 2017, Equifax Canada said its data had showed a 52 percent increase in suspected fraud since 2013, but did not say what proportion of applications were affected.
As a government-owned provider of residential mortgage insurance, the CMHC covers lenders' losses when insured homeowners default, including some cases that involve fraud.
One issue flagged in the CMHC plan is the Canada Revenue Agency's website, where taxpayers can print a copy of their notice of assessment, showing reported income. The report says the notice of assessment is ""easily falsified.""
Lenders have other ways of verifying income, for example by calling employers, but the notice of assessment is widely used. Federal underwriting guidelines specifically mention it as one way of verifying self-employment income.
Vives said the original hard copy notice of assessment was printed on special paper, and while the online option is ""wonderful"" for taxpayers, industry will need to adapt. 
""It means we need to make sure that we still have good, robust income verification,"" she said. ""We need to evolve too.""
Vives said the CMHC is also developing data-driven systems to screen for commission fraud, cases where a lender's employee or brokers have encouraged borrowers to exaggerate their income. 
The documents reveal that CMHC will start publishing statistics on mortgage fraud, which are not currently available in Canada. Vives says no date has been set.
The action plan highlighted risks associated with that project.

""Upward trends will generate concern, commentary and finger pointing,"" it says. ""Strong communications strategies will need to be in place.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly held steady last month, denting market confidence about a Bank of England interest rate hike next month and sending sterling to a 10-month low against the dollar.
The pound tumbled towards $1.30 and 10-year British government bond yields (GB10YT=RR) fell to their lowest since the end of May following the data, which also showed weakening in an underlying measure of inflation.
Despite motor fuel prices rising to their highest since 2014, annual consumer price inflation held in June at 2.4 percent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected to see the first increase this year, to 2.6 percent.
Britain's economy appears to be picking up after a slow first three months of the year, when unusually heavy snow hurt demand. 
While the central bank worries that growth is close to the modest pace at which it will start to push up inflation, Wednesday's data brought little sign of this.
Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, fell to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent in May -- below all forecasts and the weakest reading since March 2017.
""The large downside surprise adds more uncertainty around what had until now appeared a near-certain August rate hike,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Allan Monks said.
Comments from BoE officials over the next week could be a ""game changer"", Monks said, drawing parallels with May, when a spate of poor data thwarted a widely expected rate hike.
One measure of financial market pricing after Wednesday's figures showed a roughly 70 percent chance of a move next month compared with nearly 80 percent before .
PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE?
On Tuesday data showed British workers' wages rose at the slowest rate in six months during the three months to May despite a record number of people in jobs, challenging the BoE as it considers raising rates next month.
A Reuters poll of economists published on Tuesday showed 47 out of 75 thought the BoE would raise rates to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent in August. The remainder thought it would stay on hold. [BOE/INT]
Some economists said the weakness in June's inflation data was driven by volatile components such as clothing, computer games and air fares which could soon rebound.
The ONS reported the biggest month-on-month drop in clothing prices for any June since 2012 as shops slashed prices for the summer sales. 
Wednesday's data suggested rising pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices, however.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 3.1 percent in June compared with 3.0 percent in May. While a slightly weaker increase than expected, it marked the strongest rise this year.
The cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 10.2 percent higher than in June 2017, the strongest rise in a year.
""The continued pick-up in producer prices suggests that inflation may rise a little in the short term as the recent oil price increases pass through supply chains,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.

But any period of rising price growth was likely to be temporary, he added.

The EU executive launched the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) in July 2015 with a target of mobilizing 315 billion euros (now $366 billion) of additional investment in three years, countering a fall in spending after the 2007-12 financial crises.
The Commission said the plan was now expected to trigger 335 billion euros in new investments across the 28 EU states.
""We surpassed the original 315 billion euros investment target and the European Fund for Strategic Investments is set to create 1.4 million jobs and increase EU GDP by 1.3 percent by 2020,"" Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said, citing European Union estimates.
The European Court of Auditors, which has a mandate to protect the financial interests of EU citizens, has said the plan may have produced no added value, because private investment made through the plan might have been made anyway.
However, the Commission said EFSI has so far ""supported"" more than 750,000 jobs and increased the bloc's gross domestic product by 0.6 percent. 
The plan is funded with 21 billion euros of EU guarantees and cash, of which 5 billion was provided by the European Investment Bank. Two thirds of the investment that it triggered came from the private sector, the commission said. 
EU states and lawmakers decided last year to extend it until the end of the decade and expand its investment target to 500 billion euros.
The Commission said the biggest impact of the plan so far has been felt in countries that were hit harder by the crisis, citing Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Powell Wants to Create Some Mystery Around Fed Meetings,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Change is in the air at the Federal Reserve. Chairman Jerome Powell’s semiannual monetary policy testimony in the Senate gave a big hint that we can no longer count on the explicit policy of gradual interest-rate hikes to continue too much longer. That doesn’t mean gradual rate increases will end, only that the Fed will rely less on forward guidance. A slower or faster pace of hikes, an extended pause, or even a rate cut are all possibilities at this point.
In his testimony Tuesday, Powell added the qualifier “for now” as he reiterated the Fed’s commitment to the current policy of gradual rate increases. This addition signals that the Fed is preparing for a shift in their policy guidance. Why prepare for a shift? Policy rates will soon approach the central tendency range of what policy makers estimate to be neutral, currently 2.8 percent to 3.0 percent. But that range is just an estimate. The true neutral rate is unobservable.
Hence, as rates approach that range, policy makers need to more carefully assess the current and expected state of the economy before blindly pushing rates higher. They could afford to be on autopilot when rates were far from neutral; they will soon no longer have that luxury.
My view is that the next two rates hikes are looking like a near certainty at this point. The economy exhibits too little inflation to consider accelerating the pace of rate hikes with an August hike and retains too much momentum for the Fed to consider pausing at the September meeting. Moreover, I doubt this calculus will change by fourth quarter, meaning a hike in December but not October.
By 2019, however, the guidance will shift away from an implicit expectation of a 25-basis-point boost each quarter. Officials will increasingly emphasize the role of incoming data when setting policy. In his testimony, Powell provided a clue on what to look for when sifting through the data. 
He noted that recent job growth is “a good deal higher than the average number of people who enter the work force each month on net.” I don’t think the Fed will believe they have reached a neutral rate until this is no longer the case. Consequently, to take an extended pause, central bankers will be looking for job growth closer to 100,000 per month, a figure they expect will stabilize the unemployment rate once the cyclical force of a solid economy supporting labor force participation wanes and becomes dominated by the secular force of older workers leaving the workforce as they retire. 
Simply put, the Fed is not likely to believe they have reached a neutral policy stance as long as the labor market is sufficiently strong to place ongoing downward pressure on unemployment. As such, the Fed would continue pushing policy rates higher while searching for neutral. Do not underestimate the Fed’s determination on this point. 
That said, if the pace of economic activity eases such that they can reasonably forecast slower job growth while inflation remains contained, they will likely shift toward an even more gradual and uneven policy path. For example, if conditions drove job growth toward a range of 125,000 to 150,000 per month, policy makers would be comfortable skipping the March meeting while being very careful to say they did not expect they had concluded the policy normalization process. After all, unemployment would still be below their estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, and they would expect that some additional slowing of activity was still necessary to get to that point.
Alternatively, if they get any signals consistent with an overheated economy, which could come in the form of accelerating wage growth or a whiff of inflation, the Fed will likely step up the pace of hikes, shifting to two meetings in a row for example. If trade wars weigh more heavily on the U.S. economy than expected, the Fed could even cut rates.
My expectation is that the Fed is likely to continue to hike rates at a pace of 25 basis points per quarter until the tenor of the data shifts conclusively in one direction or another. Powell, however, is letting us know markets shouldn’t take this for granted. In other words, the Fed intends to create more smoke around policy meetings. Market participants will have to work harder to see through that smoke. "

CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
Phil Ventura’s plans for a cozy retirement were shot when the company where he worked for 30 years merged with another and left him unemployed at age 58.
Ventura, now 71, discovered what many younger people should know if they are counting on working into their late 60s to make up for a lack of retirement savings: “People are dreaming if they think they’re going to work until they drop,” he said.  
Yet, that is the plan for a lot baby boomers. Worried about deficient retirement savings and unaware that job troubles or poor health end up forcing people to retire early, 79 percent of workers are expecting to work during their retirement years, according to a recent survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. 
But there is a huge disconnect between the plan to work and what happens. Although most people now say they want to work into their retirement years, only 29 percent of current retirees are actually doing it. Half retired before 62, according to the EBRI survey. 
If you are trying to figure out your options, here is what you need to consider: 
* Will there be a job for you?
“People lose jobs through no fault of their own,” said Jack VanDerhei, research director of EBRI. 
His research shows that 55 percent of people who retired earlier than planned were forced to do so because they or their spouse developed health problems. Healthy spouses must sometimes leave jobs to become caregivers.
Further, even people able and willing to work long into retirement may not be welcomed by employers. About 60 percent of those who lose their jobs end up retiring involuntarily because they cannot get replacement jobs, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College research. 
* Are you saving enough?
If you are setting your savings goal based on working until a certain age, get more conservative about your planning. 
About half of people are not going to have enough saved to keep up their lifestyle when they retire, and that assumes they keep working and saving during the years all the way until 65, according the Center for Retirement Research. 
You need to first run a calculation to see if you are on target to retire by 65 by using the “ballpark estimate” at a website like choosetosave.org. Then, do another calculation to see if you will be in the ballpark if you retire early – maybe 60 or 55 - by your own choice or not. 
If not, increase your savings. It might seem like a burden to cut spending now, but losing your job and being short of savings, will be worse.
* Remember healthcare costs
Financial planner Brett Anderson, of Hudson, Wisconsin, has had clients save large sums and plan to retire in their 50s, only to realize healthcare costs would derail them before they became eligible for Medicare at age 65. 
It was a huge strain when Phil Ventura had to pay $15,000 a year for health coverage for himself and his wife between 58 and 65, after he lost his job as an administrator for a machine tool company. 
Ventura had to dip deep into his retirement savings to cover basic living expenses, and also took a minimum wage job with no benefits stocking shelves at a grocery store. When he could go on Medicare, it was such a financial relief, even though Medicare has costs also (https://reut.rs/2JhzrAR). “ I felt like I had died and gone to heaven,” Ventura said.
* Realize the snowball effect
Ventura figures he would have had $500,000 more for retirement if he had been able to work as he planned before the layoff. His wife Anne has calculated they will run out of their savings by age 81. 
The problems built on one another: They dipped into savings instead of letting their assets grow, and they could not add new savings because of the low earnings of Ventura's minimum-wage job. Because he had to take Social Security at 62, instead of his full retirement age of 66 or his maximum benefit at 70, the benefit was much less. 

“People don’t like to think about this when young,” said Ventura. “But cycles happen and people are not immortal.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will impose duties from Thursday on Chinese electric bicycles in a move to curb cheap imports that European producers say are flooding the market.
The duties are the latest in a series of EU measures against Chinese exports ranging from solar panels to steel, which have sparked strong words from Beijing.
The EU shares U.S. concerns about technology transfers and state subsidies but has called on countries to avoid a trade war. Earlier this month, the United States and China slapped tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports.
The European Commission, which is carrying out an investigation on behalf of the 28 EU members, decided that tariffs of between 27.5 and 83.6 percent should apply for all e-bikes coming from China, the EU official journal said.
Taiwan's Giant, one of the world's largest bicycle makers with factories in China as well as the Netherlands, was subject to the lower rate of 27.5 percent.
The investigation itself is set to run until January 2019, when definitive duties typically lasting five years could apply.
The Commission found Chinese exports of e-bikes to the European Union more than tripled from 2014 to the 12 month period until Sept 2017. Their market share rose to 35 percent, while their average prices fell by 11 percent.
The European Bicycle Manufacturers Association, which brought the case, said it applauded the decision, adding the duties would give European e-bike makers the chance to recover lost sales.
EU producers include Dutch groups Accell and Gazelle, Romania's Eurosport DHS and Germany's Derby Cycle Holding.

Imports of Chinese e-bikes were subject to registration from early May, meaning that the duties could be backdated until then. There is also a parallel EU investigation into whether Chinese e-bike exporters have benefited from excessive state subsidies

702,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 18:
1. Powell Back On Capitol Hill
Investors looked ahead to a second appearance from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after comments he made Tuesday reinforced views the central bank is on track to steadily hike interest rates.
He is due to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee at 10:00AM ET.
In his first day of testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Powell stuck with an upbeat assessment on the U.S. economy, while downplaying the impact of global trade risks on the outlook for rate rises.
Those comments underlined expectations in financial markets that two more rate hikes are coming from the Fed this year.
Besides Powell, the economic calendar will bring investors the June data on housing starts and building permits, due at 8:30AM ET. The Fed also releases its beige book on the economy at 2PM ET.
2.  Morgan Stanley  ,  IBM  In The Earnings Spotlight
Among the slew of earnings to be reported on Wednesday, market participants will focus on second-quarter numbers from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) slated to be released at 7:00AM ET. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share (EPS) of $1.11 on revenue of $10.05 billion. The same period of last year had $0.87 in EPS and $9.5 billion in revenue.
Results in the morning are also expected from US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB),  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS), Textron (NYSE:TXT), and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT).
After the closing bell, earnings from IBM (NYSE:IBM) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) will both be in the spotlight, along with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).
Investors will also be focused on Brussels and on Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares. Media reports suggest the U.S. tech giant will be hit with a $5 billion regulatory fine as the European Commission presents the findings of an eight-year probe into the company’s Android operating system for mobile phones.
3. U.S. Stock Futures Point To Slightly Higher Open 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open, as investors looked ahead to the latest batch of corporate results and more remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
At 5:30AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 23 points, or about 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were both set to open little changed from the previous session.
U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite notching a record high thanks to strong gains for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a rebound in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses traded higher in mid-morning trade, with almost every sector in positive territory.
Earlier, Asian shares closed mixed, after firmer gains seen earlier slightly faded.
4. Powell's Optimism Fuels Dollar Rally
Away from equities, the U.S. dollar extended its rally following Powell's bullish comments about the strength of the U.S. economy and the outlook for future interest rate hikes.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was 0.3% higher at 95.00, just below its 12-month high of 95.25 hit in late June.
Against the yen, the dollar climbed to as high as 113.14 (USD/JPY), its strongest since January 9.
The euro dropped to a more than two-week low of 1.1608 (EUR/USD).
The British pound sank to a 10-month low of 1.3011 (GBP/USD), as unexpectedly weak inflation data diminished chances for an August rate hike by the Bank of England.
Meanwhile, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices were little changed, with the benchmark 10-year yield holding steady at 2.86%, while the Fed-sensitive 2-year note was at 2.61%.
The rising U.S. dollar coupled with higher U.S. interest rates spelled trouble for gold, which crashed through major chart support to hit a one-year low.
5. Oil Prices Under Pressure Ahead of U.S. Inventory Data
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended July 13 at 10:30AM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 3.6 million barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 629,000 barrels last week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was down 50 cents, or 0.7%, at a nearly one-month low of $66.67 a barrel.
Brent crude futures were down 60 cents, or 0.8%, at $71.57 a barrel, after earlier touching a three-month low of $71.23.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 04:35AM ET</span>",China says U.S.-led trade war has become biggest 'confidence killer' for world economy,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The U.S.-driven trade war has become the biggest ""confidence killer"" for the global economy, China's foreign ministry warned on Wednesday, saying the whole world would fight back if the United States continued to be ""wilful"". 
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular press briefing that the United States is fabricating all kinds of justifications for its trade actions, including that of national security.
Earlier this month the United States and China slapped tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports in an escalating trade tussle that has roiled financial markets. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs unless Beijing agrees to change its intellectual property practices and high-technology industrial subsidy plans.
Trump has also hit European metal imports with tariffs and has threatened to curb car imports from Europe with a 20 percent duty. 
""The U.S. trade war is not just with China but with the rest of the world. By regarding the rest of the world as adversaries, the U.S. has dragged the entire global economy into a place of danger,"" Hua said. 
The European Commission last week cut its forecasts for the euro zone's economic growth this year, saying the main causes for the revision were trade tensions with the United States as well as higher oil prices.
China's economy grew at a slower pace in the second quarter, data on Monday showed, with Beijing's trade dispute with Washington challenging the growth outlook for the world's second-biggest economy.

""If the U.S. continues to be wilful, countries around the world will only harden their resolve to hit back,"" Hua said.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",China’s cooling economy sparks debate on scope of fiscal policy,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's fiscal policy should help steer structural changes rather than stimulating growth in a forceful way, a senior finance ministry researcher said in remarks published on Wednesday, amid a heated debate on how to steer policy as the economy slows.
The remarks by Liu Shangxi, head of Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences under the finance ministry, come amid a debate among government researchers on whether fiscal policy should help to soften the impact of a trade war with the United States.
""The current proactive fiscal policy, which is different from the traditional expansionary policy, is not direct government effort to expand demand, but indirect effort through stimulating market vitality, optimizing resource allocation and increasing quality supply,"" Liu wrote in the official Economic Information Daily.
China's fiscal policy should focus on adjusting the country's economic structures and controlling risks, instead of stimulating the economy in an indiscriminate way, Liu said.
China's economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter as Beijing's efforts to contain debt hurt activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low in a worrying sign for investment and exporters as a trade war with the United States intensified.
The economy is starting to feel the pinch from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending and debt, problems which were fueled in part by a massive stimulus program to support the economy during the global financial crisis.
The regulatory tightening has driven up corporate borrowing costs, prompting the People's Bank of China to cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) three times this year.
Liu's comments are the latest development in a brewing war of words started by the central bank's research heard Xu Zhong who said fiscal policy is not active enough and the budget deficit ratio this year should be higher.
Xu's remarks prompted an unidentified finance ministry official to write in the financial magazine Caixin that the size of the budget deficit does not simply indicate the finance ministry's push for a proactive fiscal policy.
Xu also wrote last month that China cannot rely on monetary policy easing to resolve its structural problems, and said fiscal policy should play a bigger role.
The central bank overseas monetary policy while the finance ministry supervises fiscal policy. It unclear whether the current debate reflects the policy stances of the two agencies.
In March, Premier Li Keqiang announced a cut in the annual budget deficit target from 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2017 - the first cut since 2012 - but the finance ministry said fiscal policy remained supportive for economic growth given a jump in planned special bond issuance this year.
Policy insiders said the finance ministry, which has been cutting taxes, could quicken fiscal spending in the second half to support investment, but any forceful stimulus looks unlikely.
The central bank is widely expected to deliver more bank reserve ratio (RRR) cuts in the coming months.
China's Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, is likely to discuss economic policies later this month, the policy insiders said.
In April, a Politburo meeting added ""expanding domestic demand"" back to the policy statement issued by state media, after dropping it in December.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 02:39AM ET</span>","Going, going gone for Australia's house price boom. And some investors smell trouble","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - It's a winter weekend in Sydney's bustling northern suburb of Chatswood and a three-bedroom family house sporting an endless garden is up for auction. It's priced to sell at A$1.88 million ($1.4 million) but no buyers bite and the sale is abandoned. 
On the same day, in the heart of the harbor-hugging city a two-bedroom apartment with panoramic views fails to sell as no bidders turn up. 
Auctions are a bellwether of demand in property-obsessed Australia, where attending sales is almost a national pastime. It is therefore telling that only just over half were successful the weekend last month a Reuters reporter visited some of Sydney’s auctions, compared to more than two-thirds for all of last year.
And while that week was the worst since 2012, it wasn’t a one off. Auction clearance rates have averaged in the mid-to-low 50 percent range for each of the past nine weeks. 
The recent weakness in the Australian housing market, which has been one of the drivers of an economy that has now grown for 27 years without a downturn, has some economists warning of heightened risks of a recession and even a financial crisis. 
In anticipation, some hedge funds are shorting the nation's financial assets and some significant investors are heavily underweight Australia compared to regional benchmarks.
The slack has been partly engineered by the authorities. Curbs on lending to foreigners, foreign buyer taxes and a clampdown on capital flows by Beijing have hurt bubbling demand from Chinese investors, who have been important contributors to the housing boom of recent years. 
There are signs of a similar fall in Chinese investment in Vancouver, Canada – which has also been a red hot market in recent years and where the authorities have also intervened by raising taxes on foreign buyers. But a decline in Vancouver’s sales is yet to translate into price declines.
MANY MISDEEDS 
In Australia, a government-mandated inquiry into the nation’s banks has turned up so many misdeeds that the industry has restrained some lending. Annual growth in housing credit has braked to four-year lows while building approvals have come off a peak and nationwide home prices have started to fall for the first time in six years. 
Home values in Sydney, the country's largest city, are down 4.4 percent compared to June last year, the sharpest fall since 2008 and far away from the 19 percent growth enjoyed early in 2017, according to property consultant CoreLogic 
The annual price increases in Melbourne and Brisbane have braked to around 1 percent, down from double-digit growth last year. Investors are taking note. 
""We have shifted a greater proportion of our assets offshore as an intensifying slowdown in housing is likely to increase downward pressure on the Australian dollar,"" said Ben McGarry, Sydney-based portfolio manager at A$185 million hedge fund Totus Capital. 
He said the fund is ""short a selection of Australian retail, construction materials and banking stocks which have benefited from the long bull market in Australian housing,” but declined to identify specific companies. 
And a unit of UK fund management group  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors has taken short bets against Australian assets in the credit and currency markets as the odds of a housing-related downturn have increased, a spokesman for the firm told Reuters on Monday. He also wouldn't detail the bets.
The Australian dollar  has fallen more than 5 percent against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year. 
And there is growing short interest in companies such as building products maker CSR (AX:CSR) and mortgage insurer Genworth (AX:GEN).Some funds whose policy is to refrain from taking short positions have still reduced their exposure to Australia.
London-based Liontrust Asia Income Fund has 7.5 percent in Australia, against a benchmark of more than 17 percent based on the MSCI Asia-Pacific Ex-Japan index, according to fund manager Mark Williams.
""We have a very low weighting in the banks, where if we have any real selloff that's where it would feed through,"" he said. 
And California-based Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), one of the largest actively-managed bond funds in the world, says it ""is cautious on housing-related investments"" in Australia, according to Dan Ivascyn, its group chief investment officer.
STRESS TEST 
A modest cool down would be welcome. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has long worried that the speculative bubble in the property market could burst like it did in the United States, hammering banks and the economy. 
Mortgages amount to A$1.8 trillion, or just over 100 percent of the country's annual economic output (GDP). That compares to around 91 percent in the UK and 80 percent in the U.S. 
A stress test by Australia's banking watchdog conducted in 2017 showed that if home prices fell 35 percent, unemployment doubled to 11 percent and GDP fell 4 percentage points, Australian banks would lose A$40 billion on mortgages alone. 
But regulators have forced them to squirrel away so much capital that the banks would still be solvent, the test showed. Policymakers have also clamped down on banks’ mortgage lending over the past couple of years, including stiff curbs on buying properties for rent. 
This has pushed many speculative buyers out of the market, which is good news for prospective buyers. 
""I have been waiting for this slide to start,"" said Arif Hossain, 37-year old biomedical engineer in Western Sydney, who is looking for a four-bedroom house. 
""The properties that I am looking for were selling around A$1 million just some months back. They have now fallen below A$900,000 but still there is no sale,"" he added. 
He wants prices to drop to A$750,000-A$850,000 before jumping in. 
WHAT CHANCE, RECESSION? 
But such declines could be very painful. 
The government estimates Australia's 10 million homes are worth A$6.9 trillion, close to the annual GDP of France and Italy combined. 
The value of the housing stock has swelled by A$2.3 trillion in the past five years, a windfall to consumer wealth at a time when wages have stagnated. 
With prices now in decline, the wealth effect could easily turn into a headwind. Already, households suffered the largest loss on land and dwellings in six years in the first quarter. 
""The consumer was already the weak link in Australia's growth story,"" says Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan. ""The housing correction represents additional downside risk to the outlook."" 
Australia has dodged threats of a downturn during the good times. Beijing helped bail Australia out during the global financial crisis as Chinese stimulus spending drove demand for Australian resources. 
Yet, that has left China with a debt hangover at a time when a trade war with the U.S. threatens to throttle its exports. In some senses, Australia is as exposed to China's housing price bubble as it is to its own. 
But options for Australia's policymakers are constrained. 
The central bank has slashed interest rates to a record low of 1.5 percent and the government has just committed to a seven-year plan of tax cuts. The latter, though, won’t deliver a cent of stimulus until mid-2019, with most of it not due until 2024/25. 
""With credit conditions set to tighten at a time when household debt is at a record high and house prices are already falling, the risks of recession and financial crisis have risen,"" warns Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics. 
He sees a 20 percent chance of a recession without a financial crisis, and a further 10 percent chance of both happening. 

""Put another way, there's almost a one-in three chance that the surge in household debt ends badly,” he warned.

""The negative interest rate differential (between the U.S. and South Korea) could be in place for a long time or even widen further,"" Bank of Korea board member Koh Seung-beom told reporters at a news conference in Seoul.
Factoring in currency market volatility ""has become more important"" in monetary policy considerations due to the higher risk of capital outflows, Koh said.
With the U.S. federal funds rate at 1.75 percent to 2 percent range, above South Korea's 1.5 percent benchmark policy rate, economists have been warning of capital outflow risks in Asia's fourth largest economy as investors seek higher yields in the U.S.
And the interest rate differential is set to widen further, with the Fed signaling another two rate hikes by year end.

On July 12, the BOK held its base rate steady but one board member voted to raise interest rates, which increased expectations for a rate hike in coming months as major peers tighten monetary policy.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","ECB's bond-buying may have cut income inequality, but only a bit: research","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme may have reduced income inequality, fresh research by ECB economists showed, disputing critics who argue that lavish stimulus mainly benefited the wealthiest of households.
Pushing up economic growth, the stimulus fueled job creation, benefiting households among the poorest 20 percent of people by compressing income distribution and temporarily halting a widening of the gap between rich and poor, the paper, which is not necessarily the ECB's opinion, argued.
Critics of the ECB scheme, devised to generate inflation, argue that it robs the poor and ordinary savers while benefiting the wealthy with ample financial assets and households with big mortgages.
""The reduction in unemployment and in income inequality is particularly marked in those countries, such as Spain, where the initial unemployment rate is higher,"" the paper argued. ""The effect can mostly be ascribed to the disproportionately large drop in the unemployment rate of low-income households.""
Still, the bond purchases have done little to reduce wealth inequality and the researchers argue that even in the case of incomes, the impact is small compared with the historical trend for rising inequality. 
""The overall effects of monetary policy on income inequality are modest, compared to its observed secular trend,"" the paper, published by the ECB as a ""Discussion Paper"", suggested.
Quantitative easing, as the bond-buying program is known, is set to run until the end of the year. But the ECB is expected to hang on to its pile of bonds for years, which should help hold borrowing costs at rock-bottom levels to keep the recovery going.
The paper also argued that while low rates do hurt the value of simple savings products, the owners of such assets were compensated for their loss through a healthier economy that improved household purchasing power by pushing employment to record highs. 
""Monetary policy in recent years benefited most households and did not contribute to an increase in wealth, income or consumption inequality,"" the paper argued.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","Australia economy set to keep growing, even as clouds gather: poll","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy appears to be gathering momentum this year as population growth fuels a boom in public investment, though high debt levels at home and trade tensions abroad loom as ever-greater threats.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast Australia's A$1.8 trillion ($1.33 trillion) of gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.9 percent in 2018, more than the 2.7 percent pace seen in April and last year's 2.3 percent pace.
The upward revision reflects a surprisingly strong first quarter when surging exports and spending by government and business lifted GDP growth to a two-year high of 3.1 percent.
Analysts also saw growth of 2.8 percent in 2019 and 2.7 percent for 2020, an outcome that would take Australia's stretch without a technical recession to 29 years.
That track record owes much to Australia's ability to attract enough skilled migrants to sustain population growth of 1.6 percent a year, more than twice the rich-world average.
Indeed, UBS economist George Tharenou reckons temporary migration is being understated, particularly for student visas.
""This 'people boom' will support GDP via exports, especially education and tourism; underpin the need for infrastructure investment and support housing demand,"" he argues.
""Given migrants are relatively young, skilled, educated and have much higher participation, this positive labor supply shock also caps wage pressure and keeps inflation low.""
Analysts polled see inflation running at a modest 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent right out through 2020, a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to keep interest rates steady for at least another year.
The central bank itself predicts the economy will expand at a 3 percent-plus pace this year and next, but also concedes that dangers are mounting.
One is the potential for a damaging trade war as U.S. President Donald Trump presses on with tariffs against China, the European Union, UK, Canada and Mexico, among others.
China is Australia's single biggest export market and the largest buyer of many of its commodities. Two-way trade accounts for around 45 percent of Australia's GDP.
Another potential pit-fall is home grown - rocketing household debt. Australians' obsession with property has seen mortgage lending reach the sort of perilous heights that preceded the 2008 financial crisis in the United States and UK.
The risk warranted special discussion at the RBA's policy meeting this month and has the potential to upend the economy.
""The Australian miracle is actually mostly based on a rapid accumulation of public and household debt from 2008,"" argues Christopher Dembik, Saxo Bank's head of macro analysis.
With banks tightening lending standards and house prices weakening, that credit pulse had turned into a headwind the country was ""ill-prepared to face"", he warned.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",Bid to revive Indonesia property market highlights central bank's policy dilemma,"By Maikel Jefriando and Gayatri Suroyo
JAKARTA (Reuters) - As Indonesia's central bank drives up interest rates to defend a fragile currency, Governor Perry Warjiyo is banking on a revival of the sluggish property sector to help maintain growth momentum in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 
Five years ago, luxury Indonesian apartment prices skyrocketed amid a commodities boom that saw some wealthy buyers pay cash upfront. The boom's end, slower economic growth and rules to curb property speculation slammed on the brakes.
Now, authorities want to encourage buying. From August, the central bank is scrapping its 15 percent minimum mortgage downpayment for first-time homebuyers and relaxing rules on loan disbursements, in a bid to support listless credit expansion.
""We need to support our economic growth,"" Warjiyo said in a recent interview, asserting that property can have a multiplier effect on other sectors.
This comes as Indonesia is caught in the crosshairs of an emerging market sell-off that caused the central bank to raise interest rates  by 100 basis points in six weeks, to defend the rupiah. 
Filianingsih Hendarta, a senior Bank Indonesia (BI) official, estimates the eased mortgage rules will add 0.04 percentage points to economic growth this year. That sounds small, but Indonesia's higher interest rates will reduce its growth pace, making a net gain from the rule changes welcome.
BI's growth forecast is 5.1-5.2 percent, compared with 2017's 5.07 percent.
But given the absence of a hot commodity market and the rising interest rates, seeking to make property an economic pillar might highlight authorities' lack of credible policy options in the current environment.
A PEDESTRIAN PACE 
Standard & Poor's expects property sales to be flat this year despite BI's new measures.
""We don't think there will be a major recovery, everything will probably move at pedestrian pace until the second half of 2019, after elections at best,"" analyst Kah Ling Chan said, referring to parliamentary and presidential polls next April.
In recent years, Indonesia's biggest online housing broker Rumah123.com, part of Australia's REA Group (AX:REA), has recorded sluggish sales.
""The number of buyers seems to be stagnant now,"" country manager Ignatius Untung of Rumah123.com said.
Bankers have said they will not completely remove downpayments and instead will adjust the interest rates on home loans based on a customer's risk profile.
Roosniati Salihin, deputy president director of  Bank Panin  (JK:PNBN), said tepid demand is a major problem for property. ""The market needs to be reinvigorated. The banking sector is only waiting for customers to walk in,"" she said. 
Soelaeman Soemawinata, chairman of the Real Estate Association of Indonesia, said its ""most optimistic scenario"" is for the number of units sold to increase by 10 percent in the next year.
""But the property industry is hard to predict,"" he said. ""People's psychology affects this.""
PREFERENCE FOR RENTING 
The younger generation prefer to rent than purchase a home, said Handayani, consumer banking director of Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
""Kids nowadays prefer to rent and to travel whenever they have spare money,"" she said.
Even if banks start requiring no downpayment at all, that would mean higher installments for customers, which won't sit well given higher interest rates, said Aldi Garibaldi, senior associate director of Colliers International Indonesia, a property services firm. He said he does not think BI's measures will be enough to spur demand.
While BI's easing is welcome, the central bank should take it up a notch by scrapping rules on the maximum number of credit facilities per person and allow banks to dispense more cash upon signing loan documents, said Adrianto Adhi, president director of developer Summarecon Agung (JK:SMRA).
BI's announcement on mortgages has spurred some young Indonesians to consider home-ownership.
Newly-married Khaerul Estian, a 28-year-old who works in a bank, has stated looking. He hopes not to have to make any downpayment, given small savings. But Estian intends to buy, even if higher interest rates raise the ultimate cost.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Wednesday cut its economic growth forecast for this year, citing a feeble labor market recovery and global trade tensions.
In its bi-annual economic policy report, the nation's finance ministry projected growth of 2.9 percent for this year, in line with the Bank of Korea's projections and down from a 3 percent estimate in December.
""Apart from shipments of semiconductors, exports growth came to a halt and investment is shrinking,"" said Do Kyu-sang, a director general at the ministry, said in a press conference. ""The economy's capacity to create jobs is weakening,"" Do said.
South Korean policymakers are trying to drive a sustained return to growth rates that match the country’s potential after a 3.1 percent expansion last year, the fastest in three years.
The government fears steep minimum wage hikes may choke a labor market recovery, as businesses cap hiring in a blow to consumer spending. The hikes also come as exports, which posted stellar growth in the past year, lose steam amid an escalating trade spat between the United States and China.
On Saturday, the government-mandated Minimum Wage Commission said the minimum wage will increase another 10.9 percent next year to 8,350 won ($7.40) an hour, after a 16 percent increase in 2018.
With businesses slowing hiring, the government now sees the economy adding only 180,000 jobs this year, down from 320,000 estimated earlier.
To shore up domestic demand, the government plans to increase fiscal spending by 4 trillion won ($3.55 billion) within its existing budget by re-allocating money at some of its state-managed funds to infrastructure projects that create jobs.
However, to avoid running up additional government debt, an official at the ministry's budget office said the finance ministry would not sell more treasury bonds.
In its outlook for the second half, the ministry also revised down projections for this year's headline inflation to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent, while cutting private consumption growth outlook to 2.7 percent from 2.8 percent.

""At a time of full employment with price stability, policy should be a neutral influence on economic activity,"" Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said in remarks prepared for delivery to an agricultural symposium. ""Gradual further increases in our policy rate will be necessary to return policy to a neutral stance, although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how far or fast we need to go.""
The Fed has raised rates twice this year and has signaled it will raise rates twice more before the year is out, putting short-term borrowing costs within a couple of rate hikes of 2.9 percent, the Fed's estimate of ""neutral."" 
George, who will resume voting on policy at the Fed's next meeting after a two-and-half-year hiatus, has in the past called for faster rate hikes than many of her colleagues. 
But her tone Tuesday was more measured, signaling that she, like most of her colleagues, is focused on reading signals from economic data and financial markets to gauge the right pace of rate hikes so as not to slow the economy unduly or allow it to grow so fast that inflation takes hold.
George said the economy is in ""excellent"" shape, but said she sees significant risks it could grow too fast because of fiscal stimulus and global accommodation, or slow sharply because of trade policy. 
She said she worries that the Fed may be ""misjudging the manageability of emerging financial imbalances"" that have built up during a long period of accommodative policy. 
And, she said, with unemployment at 4 percent and inflation by the Fed's preferred measure recently ticking up to 2.3 percent, above the Fed's 2-percent goal, ""monetary policy is currently testing the limits of how low unemployment can go without causing an undesirable increase in inflation.""

Still, she did not making any overt case for faster rate hikes than her peers, citing uncertainty over the outlook and even delivering a warning about raising rates too fast. ""If you’re not careful, it’s easy to overshoot, turning a room that is too hot into one that is too cold,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government paid more than $77,000 to President Trump's Scottish golf resort ahead of his stay there last weekend, according to federal spending records, indicating that Trump's official visit to Europe likely generated revenue for his business empire.
Spending records seen by Reuters show that the U.S. State Department, which typically arranges presidential travel overseas, paid $77,345.35 since April to SLC Turnberry Ltd, the Trump company that owns the resort, for ""hotel rooms for VIP visit.""
The payments were first reported by The Scotsman, a Scottish newspaper and website.
Trump stayed at the resort and played golf there last Saturday, between a meeting of the NATO military alliance and a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
It was not clear whether all of the payments were made to cover expenses for Trump's visit. The State Department paid Turnberry $7,670 in April and another $70,000 in the days before Trump's visit last week, federal records showed.
A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment about the charges, and White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Former government ethics officials and watchdog groups say Trump has failed to put safeguards in place to ensure that he does not directly profit from his actions as president.
""This is part of a pattern with this president of really doing everything he can to disgrace the office of the presidency by promoting his own private business interests,"" said Stephen Spaulding, a lawyer with the public interest group Common Cause. 
While other recent presidents have put their assets in a blind trust, Trump has retained ownership of his hotels, golf courses and other businesses. He handed control of the businesses to his sons shortly before he took office in January 2017. 
Unlike other recent presidents, he has refused to release his tax returns.
Trump often plays golf at his resorts in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia, and Republican candidates and conservative groups frequently hold fundraisers and other events at the Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House.
Trump resigned as a director of Turnberry when he took office in January 2017, filings show, but he continues to hold an ownership stake. He earned $20.4 million from the property last year, according to his latest financial disclosure form, released in May.
Eric Trump, who along with his brother Donald Jr. serves as a director for Turnberry, wrote that Trump properties do not profit from U.S. government business.
""While not required, we have decided that for any United States Govt business, we charge our COST and do NOT profit from these stays. Much more would be spent if they stayed elsewhere,"" he wrote on Twitter https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1019298894805655554.

713,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",How Strong Is China’s Economy? GDP Alone Won’t Say,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s the go-to measure of an economy. But sometimes gross domestic product doesn’t tell you much.
A glance at China’s second-quarter GDP, released Monday, might suggest things are holding up pretty well in the world’s second-largest economy. The 6.7 percent increase from a year ago — just barely below the prior period — points to a China that weathered the early skirmishes of a trade war, continued its transition to a consumption-driven economy and isn’t suffering too much from a state campaign to rein in debt.
Fair enough, as far as it goes. But the quarterly data doesn’t convey that activity slowed significantly in June, the last month of the period under review. (This isn’t a comment on whether China’s figures are cooked, though there are skeptics who point to comments WikiLeaks attributed to premier Li Keqiang when he was a provincial leader that GDP is “manmade” and “for reference only.”)
Figures released the same day as GDP showed fixed-asset investment by the government and state-owned enterprises grew at the slowest pace since at least 2004 last month, and industrial production cooled. Two other numbers showed a mixed bag: Retail sales were healthy, while a report Friday showed new loans by the shadow-banking system dropped the most on record.
Similarly, the quarterly headline also gives the impression that Beijing’s campaign to rein in debt isn’t denting the broader economy and that little course correction is warranted. In reality, China is tweaking monetary policy to prevent June’s softness leading to a more pronounced slackening.
The imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump (and China’s retaliation) gives the task more impetus. The People’s Bank of China has trimmed the amount of cash that banks are required to hold as reserves, albeit with very specific conditions. The PBOC demurred on interest rates in June instead of following the Federal Reserve’s hike, as some economists had anticipated. Government spending picked up in June, focused on environmental protection, science and technology. These steps don’t amount to a wholesale opening of the spigot; they do show that President Xi Jinping’s team is attuned to risks and is prepared to take further steps, preferably without compromising debt reduction. Soft landings are tricky.
Too much focus on GDP would miss all this. The same is true of Western economies. Quarterly GDP gives you an idea of what three months, in aggregate, look like compared with a three-month aggregate from a year ago or one quarter ago. It isn’t very illuminating about the real-time direction of the economy or its velocity.
There’s also a faction within economics challenging GDP as a measure of economic well-being. Lorenzo Fioramonti, author of “The World After GDP,” is one economist who argues it’s time for something different. A guest on the Bloomberg Benchmark podcast last year, Fioramonti sees the South Pacific island of Nauru as a case in point. Rapacious mining swelled GDP and attracted lots of banks eager to lend to Nauru. Environmental damage was simultaneously destroying Nauru’s future, but GDP showed everything was hunky-dory.
There’s no easy answer. As long as governments publish GDP, unilaterally doing away with the quarterly gauge would be silly. We should also proceed with caution when basing an economic assessment on those three letters. That’s especially the case with China because what happens there is so critical for the world economy.
China’s picture may look placid on the surface. It’s also easy to think that the country has everything figured out, especially in contrast to the apparent chaos in the West since Brexit and Trump’s election. Underneath China’s bland projection, there is a truly compelling economic dynamic playing out.
Who knows? Maybe China can perfectly thread the needle between deleveraging and growth. Just don’t rely on GDP to show that."
714,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Trump’s Trade War May Spark a Chinese Debt Crisis,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s no chance China will cut its trade surplus with the U.S. in response to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. For starters, Washington has made no specific demand to which Beijing can respond. But its efforts may have an unexpected side effect: a debt crisis in China.
The 25 percent additional tariffs on exports of machinery and electronics looked, at first blush, like a stealth tax on offshoring. The focus on categories like semiconductors and nuclear components, in which U.S.-owned manufacturers in China are strong, recalled Trump’s 2016 promise to tax “any business that leaves our country.”
It seems, though, that offshoring wasn’t the target after all. Now, with the imposition of new tariffs on low-value exports that mostly involve Asian value chains, the simple fact of selling cheap products that the U.S. buys has become the problem.
Either way, the administration appears set on shrinking its current-account deficit (which, at a moderate 2.4 percent of GDP, is far lower than the 6 percent clocked in 2006-7) just as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Distress has already been registered in China. On July 13, the yuan (also known as the renminbi) hit 6.725 to the dollar, the weakest in a year and 5 percent lower than at the end of May.
Such a move is nothing earth-shaking for less controlled currencies. But a stable renminbi is a key plank in the leadership’s promise to its people, and the exchange rate is tightly managed by the central bank.
Chinese investors have been buying official assurances for a year that the renminbi would be a fortress, but now they’re not so sure and are exporting money again: May saw net capital outflows and a decline in the foreign-exchange reserves. The currency is the most visible sign of slippage in the image that China tries to project of an economy so brilliantly managed that the bright sun of GDP expansion is untroubled by even temporary clouds on trade, employment or consumption.
There are many other signs: The Shanghai Composite Index of stocks has declined 7 percent in a month, dropping below the government’s red line of 3,000 for the first time since September 2016. Corporate bonds are about to set a record for the most defaults in a year. Junk bond yields are spiking. The chorus of anxiety about debt is reaching a crescendo, with daily press reports on governments that can’t pay their employees or meet pension obligations. Property prices are tumbling in some cities and frozen in others whose governments have placed a finger in the dyke by halting transactions.
That the massive burden of debt will drag the economy into recession is as obvious as the empty towers that rise on every landscape. Precise estimates are difficult, since the government’s dedication to the optics of invincibility induces financial institutions to push debt into alternate, opaque channels. But on any metric, the amount of new lending each year grows faster than the economy, and the interest newly owed exceeds the incremental rise in GDP. In other words, the whole economy is a Ponzi scheme.
Many analysts point out that the Chinese government owns everything, including the banks, and can just issue renminbi to infinity to keep the economy solvent. The flaw in that argument is China’s role in the global economy: It’s the world’s biggest exporter and second-biggest importer. The currency acts as the interface between the domestic and international economies, and its value is a matter of supply and demand.
The Ponzi economy has been sustained by cheap dollars coming in through legitimate or illegitimate channels, and the problem now is that structural surpluses are disappearing and there is less “hot” money from the U.S. seeking yield. When dollars enter, the central bank buys them and issues renminbi. If it has to issue more than is justified by the amount of inflows, it creates inflation, and inflation, which has toppled or almost toppled governments from the Ming dynasty to Tiananmen, is the third rail of Chinese politics.
That brings us back to Trump and his trade war. The fundamental idea underlying this salad of a trade agenda is an old one from the right wing of the Republican Party, which believes that the U.S. has paid too dearly for its postwar leadership role under the Bretton Woods regime; putting America first means America marching alone.
The dollar standard, and not trade policies, underpins the global system of commerce. The U.S. runs trade deficits as a consequence of its desire to own the currency that dominates global commerce, not as a casualty of predatory policies by China. The rise of the gold standard in the second half of the 19th century was the key foundation for the expansion of global trade. Its collapse, starting in 1913, drove a trade implosion.
After Bretton Woods, the dollar took over as a global standard, and, when former President Richard Nixon made the greenback no longer redeemable for gold, it was freed to become a pure fiat currency. That meant that the U.S. could project any level of currency around the world to support its national economic growth and lifestyle improvements that exceeded productivity gains. No wonder China wishes the renminbi could do the same.
It is tempting to see the recent yuan depreciation as a strategy to blunt the effect of U.S. tariffs, but really, the capital account is of much greater import to China Inc. than the current account. China’s central bank will almost certainly try to pull back the exchange rate in the near term: Authorities care more about the pile of reserve gold, successful stock-exchange debuts for Xiaomi Corp. and Ant Financial, and lucrative bond issues than about the private and largely foreign-owned companies that dominate exports.
The truth is that China has followed a mercantilist trading policy since Mao Zedong. Most significantly, the investment splurge in the reform years helped political elites rake billions off the forced savings of the Chinese people. That was enabled by incoming capital, and there is no indication that will change.
Until now, China has managed to keep its huge raft of nonperforming debt afloat thanks to capital inflows, as successive waves of quantitative easing pushed dollars into the world. A tighter dollar would seem to make the bursting of China’s credit bubble an inevitability. When that happens, the renminbi will have to depreciate sharply. This will have a deflationary impact on the world. It will also lead to a decline in China’s share of global GDP, dramatically reduce the nation’s demand for commodities, and diminish its role on the international political stage.
Much about Chinese trade practices is genuinely unfair. But the inequity flows as much from U.S. policy favoring big corporations at the expense of workers as it does from Chinese structural subsidies. Both are difficult problems to address — much harder than penalizing exports. No one will benefit when China shrinks and turns inward. Trump should be careful what he wishes for."

The official said, however, that there would be ample opportunities for Mnuchin to interact with Chinese officials in G20 group sessions, dinners and informal settings to discuss trade issues dividing the two countries.
Mnuchin told U.S. lawmakers last week the Trump administration was prepared to reopen talks with China to resolve trade issues, but only if Beijing was willing to pursue ""serious efforts to make structural changes"" to its policies.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports, and President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, effectively covering all U.S. imports from China, unless Beijing agrees to changes in its intellectual property practices and high-technology industrial subsidy plans.
The Treasury official said that Mnuchin was ""ready to re-engage with the Chinese,"" but it did not have to be in a formal bilateral meeting at the G20 finance gathering.
""The secretary has had substantial contact with Chinese officials, and so there's not the imperative at this meeting to have formal bilaterals because there'll be substantial contact,"" the official said.
Mnuchin also will discuss with his G7 counterparts China's trade practices in an hour-long session, the official said.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>","Trump, House Republicans discuss further tax cuts at White House","By David Morgan and Roberta Rampton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Republican U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday discussed another possible round of deficit-financed tax cuts, highlighting an initiative seen by some tax experts as an election-year effort with little chance of becoming law.
Trump sat down at the White House with Kevin Brady, chairman of the House of Representatives tax-writing committee, and a handful of other Republicans from the panel to plot a path forward on further tax cuts that would appeal to their conservative political base ahead of the Nov. 6 elections. 
The discussion began only after Trump sought to defuse intense criticism leveled at him by lawmakers in both parties over his summit meeting on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, saying he misspoke about Moscow's meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
Trump then introduced Brady to reporters gathered in the conference room. Facing Trump, Brady said, ""We're here to talk to you about making permanent this tax relief."" After Brady's brief remarks, reporters were removed from the room by shouting Trump aides.
Over the unanimous opposition of Democrats, Republicans in Congress in December passed deep tax cuts for corporations on a permanent basis, and for individuals, families and private businesses on a temporary basis.
Republicans have described the cuts as critical to boosting U.S. economic expansion. Democrats have called the cuts a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy that will run up deficits and burden U.S. taxpayers for years to come.
House Republicans now say they want to make permanent the $1.1 trillion in temporary cuts for individuals, families and private businesses that are set to expire in 2025. Brady's panel calls the legislative package ""tax reform 2.0,""
The Senate, however, is unlikely to take up a new tax bill before the election in which Trump's fellow Republicans are seeking to retain control of Congress. Brady told Trump he expected a House vote on a tax cuts bill in September ""and the Senate setting a timetable, as well.""
After the 45-minute meeting with Trump, Brady told reporters on Capitol Hill, ""We talked about timing and the importance of this. ... We're very well aligned with the White House on 2.0.""
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has already warned that making permanent the temporary cuts would further expand the federal deficit and debt. Both measures of red ink increased with the Republicans' $1.5 trillion December tax cuts package and a $1.3 trillion bipartisan spending bill in March.
Brady has said he does not expect the Republicans' new bill to be ""revenue neutral,"" meaning it would expand the deficit.
Trump has separately said he is considering cutting the U.S. corporate income tax rate again to 20 percent from 21 percent.
In December's tax overhaul, Trump and Republicans in Congress slashed the corporate rate from 35 percent.
Brady said that tax cut set the stage for other countries to respond with new cuts of their own that lawmakers may have to match. Some tax activists have warned of a global corporate tax ""race to the bottom"" among advanced economies.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should not tie its hands too early when it comes to future monetary policy decisions but look instead at how the economy pans out, Finland's new central bank governor Olli Rehn told Reuters on Tuesday.
The ECB said last month it expects to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.0 trillion) bond-buying program at the end of the year and to keep interest rates at their current, record low level ""through the summer of 2019"", leading investors to price in a hike in October of next year.
The 56-year-old Rehn, who succeeded Erkki Liikanen as the Bank of Finland governor last week, backed the current market expectations but said any decision should depend on economic data in the intervening time.
""I think it's indeed important to underline the data-dependent nature of decision-making,"" he said in an interview.
""I recognize the importance of forward guidance, but on the other hand, it is wise in monetary policy not to tie one's hands too early if there's no need.""
Reuters reported last week that ECB policymakers were split over the timing of their first rate hike since 2011 and about the meaning of ""through the summer"".
Some said an increase, which would mark a turning point after years of aggressive monetary stimulus, was possible as early as July 2019, but others ruled out a move until autumn, several sources said.
Rehn, who worked as the EU's top economic official during the euro zone debt crisis, said markets were interpreting the guidance correctly as they price in a rate hike for October next year.
""The ECB has shown by its actions that its communication is correct and credible ... The markets seem to be reading the forward guidance of the ECB correctly.""
PROTECTIONISM
Regarding the European economy, Rehn said that while fundamentals were in pretty good shape, a growing trade war between the United States and China is a cloud over the global outlook.
""In protectionism, we have seen a shift from rhetoric to reality. So far we (in Europe) have experienced negative confidence impact, but not yet the worst scenario,"" he said.
As the EU's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Rehn developed a reputation for advocating strict fiscal discipline and structural reforms for troubled European states.
Having also participated in the early planning of the banking union, he said the euro zone should complete it by creating the missing piece, a joint deposit guarantee scheme, without unnecessary delays.
""We should have this overall constructed - if not fully completed, then well in the process of being completed, before the next recession hits.""
European Union leaders last month failed to reach an agreement on the deposit insurance scheme for the euro area, partly due to German opposition.
The Finnish government also wants first to see progress in risk reduction in the area before backing the scheme, which would make bank depositors equally safe across the single currency area.
Turning to the Nordics, Rehn said the region will see further financial integration in the coming years. He also favored the idea of Sweden and Denmark participating in the banking union.
""It would help to ensure financial stability and a level playing field in supervision and regulation in the Nordic banking sector and financial industry.""

Sweden and Denmark do not use the euro but they are considering joining the banking union.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Fed's Powell: Years of strong jobs, low inflation still ahead","By Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday he sees the United States on track for years more of steady growth, but was challenged in a congressional hearing by senators worried the Trump administration's trade policies were already damaging businesses in their districts.
Powell in written testimony to the Senate Banking Committee and in his response to questions about a possible ""trade war"" largely discounted the risks and said there would be a positive outcome if the administration's bargaining ultimately produced a world of lower tariffs.
But North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp said she was becoming frustrated with the idea of ""short-term pain for long-term gain,"" noting that the energy sector in her state already had been hit by higher steel prices because of import tariffs and farmers were worried about permanently losing market share because of retaliatory levies imposed on their goods.
""We cannot afford to put our head in the sand"" about the impact, Heitkamp said. ""We are going to look back at this time perhaps in a year and say that is the point we turned the corner and the economy started taking a downturn."" 
While Powell steered clear of direct criticism of President Donald Trump's slapping of tariffs on goods, particularly from China but also from U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere, he acknowledged that tariffs were ""absolutely"" the wrong approach and said the United States ""would feel it at the national level"" if levies remained in place for too long.
The Fed's regional bank presidents have increasingly cited local business concerns about the administration's trade tactics, with higher input costs and uncertainty over the future offsetting the recent corporate tax cut and pushing firms to reconsider or delay investment plans.
SEVERAL GOOD YEARS AHEAD 
The back and forth over trade was a chief point of friction in a Fed appearance that also saw Democrats challenge recent Fed decisions that seem to take a lighter hand in the oversight of major banks, while, in contrast, one Republican said the current positive economy and Powell's presence at the Fed had made the central bank ""boring"" to oversee.
For Powell, his testimony marked one of the strongest affirmations yet by a Fed leader that the central bank is within reach of its policy targets after years of struggling to pull the country back from a deep financial crisis and recession. 
""With appropriate monetary policy, the job market will remain strong and inflation will stay near 2 percent over the next several years,"" Powell said in prepared remarks.
The Fed ""believes that - for now - the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate"" in a way that keeps pace with a strengthening economy but does not increase rates so high or so fast that it weakens growth, Powell said.
U.S. stocks rose on Powell's upbeat comments, while bond prices fell and the dollar rose. But analysts said there was little of surprise in the Fed chairman's message.
""His takeaway was the job market is strong, inflation is going to stay near 2 percent. To me that means two more hikes this year,"" said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. 
Powell did not offer his individual views on the appropriate pace of tightening or whether he thinks, as some of his colleagues have argued, that the Fed should pause its rate hike cycle sometime next year if inflation remains under control. But markets expect the central bank to raise rates two more times this year from the current target level of between 1.75 and 2 percent.
Powell will appear before a House committee on Wednesday.
With unemployment at 4 percent, Fed officials broadly feel they have met their mandate for ""maximum employment."" To the extent wages are not growing as fast as might be expected, Powell said continued low unemployment could help, but urged lawmakers to think about longer-term policies such as improved education that will ultimately drive outcomes for workers. 
While he and other Fed officials have declined to declare a full ""victory"" over the Fed's other mandate of 2 percent inflation, Powell said that marker was ""close.""
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation hit 2.3 percent in May, and was right at 2 percent after excluding more volatile food and energy prices.
""The recent data are encouraging,"" Powell said as he laid out the reasons why he felt the United States' near decade-long expansion was set to continue.

Still-low interest rates, a stable financial system, ongoing global growth and the boost from recent tax cuts and increased federal spending ""continue to support the expansion,"" he told the panel.

After Powell’s semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, odds for the next Fed hike in September were virtually unchanged at 89%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Fed fund futures priced in the probability of a second hike in December at nearly 65%, up slightly from the odds earlier in the day.
Powell emphasized that it was appropriate to follow the central bank’s current plan to gradually increase interest rates.
“With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that--for now--the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Powell said.
While once again emphasizing his upbeat outlook for the economy with a strong jobs market and the Fed’s belief that inflation will remain near the 2% target for several years, Powell admitted that trade uncertainty complicated the outlook.
He explained that financial conditions remained favorable to growth, that a stronger financial system was in a good position to meet the credit needs of households and businesses, tax and spending policies would likely continue to support the expansion and the outlook for economic growth abroad remains solid despite greater uncertainties in several parts of the world.
However, he admitted that “it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy as well as the size and timing of the economic effects of the recent changes in fiscal policy.”
With the Fed closely monitoring wage inflation for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation, Powell admitted that increases have not been as rapid as prior to the crisis.
“Wages are growing a little faster than they did a few years ago. That said, they still are not rising as fast as in the years before the crisis,” he stated.
Powell attributed the fact to lack of growth in productivity and said that the only way wage growth can go up is by productivity growth.
The Fed chief stressed the need for the central bank to monitor a wide range of relevant information when deciding what monetary policy will be appropriate.
“As always, our actions will depend on the economic outlook, which may change as we receive new data,” he warned."

EU officials have been trying to lower expectations over what Juncker and Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom can achieve in Washington, noting Trump's rejection of many European arguments at last month's G7 summit in Canada.
However, with Trump threatening to target the politically and economically more sensitive car industry, the Commission, which conducts trade negotiations for all 28 EU states, is hoping to at least give Trump pause for thought.

""If we can instill some second thoughts even, that would be a success,"" an EU official said. ""Is he really comfortable launching a $100-billion trade war over cars?""

721,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: ECB warns of 'systemic' threat if Euribor reform efforts fail,"By Marc Jones, Huw Jones and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is concerned about the risk of systemic problems if efforts to reform Euribor, one of the bank-to-bank lending benchmarks caught up in a global rate-rigging scandal, get torpedoed.
Authorities around the world are overhauling money market rates to prevent manipulation happening again. But their widespread use in financial contracts from mortgages to derivatives is making the switch to alternatives a slow process.
Time is now getting tight, especially in Europe, where the European Commission wants either completely new, or revamped rig-proof versions of Euribor and 'overnight' EONIA rates in place by the start of 2020.
""We are dealing with a problem where we have a regulation that will kick in 2020, which is less than 18 months away,"" said ECB Deputy Director General of Market Operations, Cornelia Holthausen.
""So I really think we have to hope for the best for Euribor reform, so that we don't have a systemic problem in January 2020.""
The euro zone faces an added challenge compared with the United States or Britain as it is also facing a 2020 deadline for overhauling the single currency area's overnight rate EONIA, which regulators say must be scrapped.
The aim of the twin-track reform is to prevent the 131 trillion euros ($153.2 trillion) of derivatives and 5.3 trillion euros of loans that it is estimated will still reference them in 2020 from being thrown into chaos.
The ECB has been forced to come up with its own alternative to EONIA called ESTER, one of three options that a market-based committee will choose.
ESTER would not be ready for use until late 2019, just months before EONIA is killed off, though the market is still hoping for a temporary stay of execution.
""I do feel that many banks are pretty complacent and they think the public sector will solve the issue for them,"" the ECB's Holthausen said.
Finding a replacement for Euribor, which covers the longer 1-week to one-year part of the interbank lending market, looks even more problematic given the fewer number of transactions.
Euribor's administrator, the Brussels-based European Money Markets Institute (EMMI), is testing the use of actual trades rather than the current banker-estimate based system that made such benchmarks vulnerable to being rigged.
There is a hybrid option too where mathematical calculations are used to bolster the sample, but the risk is that the Belgian national regulator which oversees EMMI, judges that it is still to easy to tamper with to win approval for use going forward.
And even if it does get authorized, banks may be too worried about potential future litigation to keep submitting data for compiling Euribor.
MISSION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
Although Britain is undergoing a simpler switch by replacing sterling-denominated Libor with the Bank of England's overnight rate SONIA, change is still too slow for British regulators.
Holthausen said that it would be ""almost impossible"" to find and implement an alternative to Euribor before 2020.
A sudden disappearance without an authorized replacement could cause major market stress.
It is estimated that by the end of 2019, 77 percent of the derivatives linked to EONIA will have expired but only 46 percent of those linked to Euribor would have done so.
According to a report from the Bank of Spain last year, some 85 percent of the balance of mortgages in the country - the euro zone's fourth-largest economy - used Euribor as a key interest rate benchmark.
""In the UK and the U.S. they have started this work two years or so ago, and they haven't agreed on a solution.""
""So we are not likely to have in place an alternative to Euribor for the euro area either in the next 17 months, so that is why I think it is very important that the reform is successful,"" Holthausen said.

CHIEF CONCERNS
It is not just the ECB sounding the alarm. A number of government debt agencies say their chief concern at the moment is just how smooth the transition to any new or revamped money market rates will be.
Cristina Casalinho, head of Portugal's debt management agency, said her focus was on any potential Euribor replacement and the general impact of rate reform on interest rate swaps - used to exchange one form of future interest payment for another.
""We need to see how smooth the transition will be, what implications it will have on pricing and in our systems with respect to valuation,"" she said, referring to the pricing and valuation of existing contracts and new ones.
Limited or sporadic trading volumes are another problem. Derivatives body ISDA last week laid out some possible 'fall-back' rates in case Euribor and Libor ceased to exist before alternatives have bedded down.
One of the big worries is that the ""ibors"" have become so toxic since the rigging scandals that banks no longer want to be associated with them, though they have agreed to keep submitting quotes for Libor in Britain until the end of 2021.
Global authorities have fined banks and brokerages about $9 billion and charged roughly 30 people over rate-rigging allegations so far.

Last week a French former trader with  Barclays  (L:BARC) was the latest to be convicted after being found to have helped mastermind a five-year plot to manipulate Euribor between 2005 and 2009.

723,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Fed’s Powell Says Gradual Rate Hikes Are the Best Path ‘For Now’,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates “for now’’ to keep inflation near target amid a strong U.S. labor market.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets interest rates, “believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Powell said in prepared testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
“We are aware that, on the one hand, raising interest rates too slowly may lead to high inflation or financial market excesses,” Powell said in the text of his remarks Tuesday. “On the other hand, if we raise rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken and inflation could run persistently below our objective.’’
Powell addresses Congress with the underpinnings of the U.S. expansion looking solid. Unemployment stands close to an 18-year low and inflation is around the Fed’s 2 percent target, though some sentiment indicators are starting to flash warning signs over escalating trade disputes. He will appear before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
Gradual Pace
Officials in June signaled they plan to continue to raise rates at a gradual pace, penciling in two more quarter-point hikes for 2018. Powell’s emphasis that gradual increases are the right path “for now’’ may suggest the committee’s debate about pausing those hikes once the rate gets closer to a level they consider neutral -- neither adding stimulus nor hurting growth -- is likely to intensify.
Powell listed four reasons why the job market will remain strong with inflation near the Fed’s 2 percent target “over the next several years.’’
Financial conditions remain favorable to growth, he said, and a stronger financial system is prepared to meet the credit needs of the economy.
“Federal tax and spending policies likely will continue to support the expansion,’’ Powell said, and “the outlook for economic growth abroad remains solid despite greater uncertainties in several parts of the world.’’
Trade Tensions
Powell also warned that it is “difficult to predict’’ how trade tensions as well as “the size and timing of the economic effects of the recent changes in fiscal policy’’ will shape the economic outlook. The risks of a weaker or stronger economy are “roughly balanced,’’ he said.
The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter and that pace is expected to double to 4 percent in the second quarter, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Amid a hot labor market, employers added 1.3 million new jobs in the first six months of the year and gains are starting to expand more broadly. Unemployment for black people in May touched the lowest level on record.
Powell restated his intentions, announced at his June press conference, to explain the central bank’s actions with “clear and open communication.’’
“We owe you, and the public in general, clear explanations of what we are doing and why we are doing it,’’ he told the Senate committee.
Powell, a former private-equity banker, was appointed Fed chairman by President Donald Trump and took office in February. He was initially put on the Board of Governors by Barack Obama in 2012.

“With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Powell said in his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress.
Powell indicated that he and his fellow policymakers at the Fed believed that the job market will remain strong and inflation will stay near its 2% target over the next several years.
He explained that financial conditions remained favorable to growth, that a stronger financial system was in a good position to meet the credit needs of households and businesses, tax and spending policies would likely continue to support the expansion and the outlook for economic growth abroad remains solid despite greater uncertainties in several parts of the world.
However, he admitted that “it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy as well as the size and timing of the economic effects of the recent changes in fiscal policy.”
“Overall, we see the risk of the economy unexpectedly weakening as roughly balanced with the possibility of the economy growing faster than we currently anticipate,” he added.
In his conclusion, Powell remarked that the Fed’s decision to gradually increase rates was based on the idea that a faster or slower pace entailed risks.
“On the one hand, raising interest rates too slowly may lead to high inflation or financial market excesses. On the other hand, if we raise rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken and inflation could run persistently below our objective,” he explained.
Powell concluded that the Fed would continue to evaluate incoming data and respond with action depending on the economic outlook."

The 2016 initiative aims at strengthening these banks, which are often tiny and have low profitability and a higher-than-average bad loan burden.

The spokesman confirmed an article in the Financial Times newspaper which said the bank had flagged a spate of suspected money laundering a couple of months ago to both the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the National Crime Agency (NCA).
He said the report filed with authorities was routine and that Revolut would normally flag this kind of activity to both the NCA and the FCA. He did not disclose the amount of money involved.
Revolut has signed up 2.25 million users since its launch in July 2015, making it the largest and fastest growing of a set of new app-only banks that have sprung up in Britain.
Like other financial technology firms, these upstart banks have faced questions over whether their compliance capabilities and resources can keep pace with rapid user growth, or if they can provide the same safeguards as mainstream banks.
Revolut does not currently have a banking license, which would allow it to offer more services such as loans.
It is now in the process of applying for a European banking license in Lithuania rather than in Britain. Lithuania has been trying to attract fintech firms since 2016, hoping UK-based finance companies might apply for licenses in the country to maintain access to the European Union after Brexit.
Revolut customers can currently open an account, have a debit card and other money management tools via its smartphone app.
It also offers foreign exchange services, as well as allowing customers to spend abroad without charges and hold, buy and sell cryptocurrencies like bitcoin via the app.
Revolut's spokesman said the firm's controls would make large-scale money laundering difficult.
Users' spending habits determine the amount of money they are able to move over the system up to an annual limit of 25,000 pounds ($33,155), after which additional controls are activated, he said.
He also said new users that have no spending history have a spending limit of 200 pounds.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 07:35AM ET</span>","Japan, EU sign free trade pact amid worries about Trump","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and the European Union signed a wide-ranging free trade deal on Tuesday that both sides hope will act as a counterweight to the protectionist forces unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The ambitious trade pact, which creates the world's largest open economic area, comes amid fears that a trade war between the United States and China will diminish the role of free trade in the global economic order.
""There are rising concerns about protectionism, but I want Japan and the EU to lead the world by bearing the flag of free trade,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a news conference after the signing ceremony.
The United States this month imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods to lower the U.S. trade deficit, and China quickly retaliated with an increase in tariffs on U.S. goods.
The Japan-EU trade deal is also a sign of shifting global ties as Trump distances the United States from long-time allies like the EU, NATO and Canada.
""We are sending a clear message that we stand against protectionism. The EU and Japan remain open for cooperation,"" European Council President Donald Tusk, who speaks for the 28 EU national leaders, told reporters.
The deal removes EU tariffs of 10 percent on Japanese cars and 3 percent on most car parts. It would also scrap Japanese duties of some 30 percent or more on EU cheese and 15 percent on wines, and secure access to large public tenders in Japan.
Europe's food sector is one of the biggest winners from the deal, which should allow it to capitalize on Japanese demand for high-quality cheese, chocolates, meats and pasta.
Japanese car and car parts makers are also expected to increase their sales to Europe, where they have lagged behind European rivals.
However, Japan's dairy industry is expected to lose market share to European products once tariffs of up to 40 percent on some cheese imports start falling.
Japan and the EU also agreed on Tuesday to establish a regular dialogue on trade and economic policy, with the first meeting to be held before year's end.
The dialogue will be chaired by Japan's trade and foreign ministers and the European Commission's vice-president for competitiveness, both sides said in a joint statement.
Both Japan and the EU, having seen Trump pull back from free trade relationships, are keen to show they remain committed to removing barriers they say hamper growth, analysts said.
""Trade liberalization and market openness continue to march ahead in Asia-Pacific,"" said Ajay Sharma, the regional head of global trade and receivables finance at banking and financial services provider HSBC.
EU accords with Singapore and with Vietnam were at the ratification stage, while deals with Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand were being negotiated, he added.
A China-EU summit ended on Monday with a communique affirming the commitment of both sides to the multilateral trading system.
Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Japan and 10 other states on his first day in office in January 2017 and has pushed to renegotiate a free trade pact with Canada and Mexico.
Trump says he is taking a hard line on trade to protect U.S. workers and U.S. companies, but critics say his approach is upending the rules of multilateral global trade.

Japan and the EU account for about a third of global GDP and their trade relationship has room to grow, according to EU officials, who expect the deal to boost the EU economy by 0.8 percent and Japan's by 0.3 percent over the long term.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that a no-deal Brexit would have ""big"" economic consequences, prompt a review of interest rates and leave many bankers idle.
Britain and the EU have negotiated a transition deal that would effectively keep Britain as non-voting member of the bloc from Brexit day next March until the end of 2020.
But it has not been ratified yet, meaning the UK could crash out and have to rely on WTO trading terms which, Carney said, would leave the country worse off.
""Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,"" Carney told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England.
Crashing out would prompt the BoE's monetary policy committee to reassess the economic outlook and interest rates.
""It would be a material event. I wouldn't prejudge in which direction, though,"" Carney said.
""Speaking very narrowly about the financial services side, in the event of a no-deal scenario... there would be big economic consequences. We might have a lot of idle bankers as there is not a lot of demand for their services,"" Carney said
Lenders, insurers and asset managers in Britain are playing safe and opening new EU hubs by March to maintain links with customers there irrespective of whether a transition deal of generous future trading terms are secured.
But they worry that without a transition deal, existing cross-border contracts such as derivatives and insurance policies would be disrupted, leaving consumers unable to make claims or companies not covered against adverse moves in currencies or borrowing costs.
Britain has said it will legislate to ensure ""continuity"" in contracts and that the EU must reciprocate, but the bloc says it was up to banks and not public authorities to get ready.
COLD COMFORT
""Yes, we are concerned that the EU has not yet indicated its solution. The private sector cannot solve these issues,"" Carney said.
""This is fundamentally about taking responsibility to protect the financial system... It's cold comfort, but it will be worse in Euorpe than it is here.""
Britain's banks, however, hold enough capital and cash reserves to withstand a disorderly Brexit, Carney said.
Britain last week published its proposals for a future trading agreement with the EU after Brexit, saying it wanted close ties in goods, but with financial services having less access to the bloc than now.
The financial sector attacked the government for not backing the industry's more ambitious proposals that seek to replicate existing market access.
The industry's proposals, which the BoE had also backed, were rejected by EU officials in Brussels who say it would mean Britain getting all the benefits of EU membership without the costs and obligations.
Carney said it was too soon to judge what the government's proposals meant for financial services or for the BoE's ability to take all decisions necessary to keep the financial system and banks stable.
""It's premature for us to make a judgement on the White Paper and the outcome of these negotiations. It's also not clear which activities are going to be in scope,"" Carney said.

The White Paper was a ""first step"" in a hugely important negotiation, he added.

Speaking at the groundbreaking of two bridges in the capital funded by a Chinese grant, Ambassador Zhao Jianhua assured the Philippines his country's financial aid had no strings attached. 
""China's loans to finance infrastructure projects will not make the Philippines fall into a debt trap"", Zhao added.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was present at the event, has promised to usher in the golden age of infrastructure through a six-year, $180 billion spending spree and has sought Chinese investment to modernise and build airports, roads, railways and ports.
Manila and Beijing have a bitter history of disputes over maritime sovereignty, but relations between the two countries have improved markedly under Duterte who has taken a conciliatory approach in exchange for dollars worth of loans, investment and trade deals with China.
""We will do our utmost to prove that President Duterte's independent foreign policy, particularly friendly and cooperative policy towards China, will produce more tangible benefits to the people of the Philippines,"" Zhao said. 
Zhao's comments come weeks after Duterte's economic planning chief said the Philippines would exercise caution in accepting Chinese loans for infrastructure projects amid claims by analysts that China is leveraging debt in exchange for political influence.
China has committed $7.19 billion for projects in the Philippine infrastructure, energy and public safety sectors, the Department of Finance has said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Some billionaires are household names, but others like John Arnold are virtual unknowns.
Arnold, 44, an energy trader at Enron Corp before its collapse in 2002 in an epic financial scandal, founded Houston-based hedge fund Centaurus Advisors but retired in 2012 at the prime of his career to focus with his wife on philanthropy.
The Laura and John Arnold Foundation, named after the couple, aims to fix some of society's most pressing problems. Arnold spoke with Reuters for the latest in our ""Life Lessons"" series.
Q: You made billions as an energy trader, but you actually got your start in sports cards?
A: Looking back, what I was doing was geographic arbitrage. Back then it was a very inefficient market, and communication between cities was limited. So the prices of things like baseball cards were extraordinarily volatile. I would travel around Texas and the Southwest on weekends, taking advantage of geographic price discrepancies – like buying hockey cards in Texas and shipping them to Canada.
Q: What did your parents teach you about money?
A: They were extremely careful with money. My mom actually became an accountant for my firm Centaurus, and as office manager, she was always looking for coupons and deals. She would see in the paper which store had a sale of soft drinks, and would go out and stock up the office fridge.
Q: You first came to prominence with Enron, so what did you learn from that meteoric rise and collapse?
A: It was a definitely a whirlwind. At the time the business was expanding like crazy, and there was a shortage of human capital, so if you came in and were good at your job you could rise really quickly.
What I learned from the collapse was to always think about the downside of things. Enron was growing so quickly, and into so many different business lines, that it didn't have proper controls in place, and that was one of the reasons it went bankrupt.
What I learned about money is that wealth is very fleeting. On paper I might have been doing extraordinarily well, but it was tied up in Enron stock and options. So I saw first-hand how you can lose money just as quickly as you make it.
Q: You emerged from that to start your own firm, so what did you take away from that experience?
A: When I went out on my own I was single, had no kids, and few responsibilities, so I was in a position where I could take a big risk like that. Had I been older and married and with children, I might have made different decisions. So the time to take massive risks in life is early, before those other responsibilities kick in.
Q: After a few years you walked away. Why?
A: After college the only job I had was energy trading, and I lived and breathed it 24 hours a day. I loved the game and I loved the challenge. But my personal life was changing, and I just didn't have the same passion for the business anymore. That business requires 100 percent focus, so giving anything less than 100 percent is a guarantee for failure.
Q: How did you and your wife decide where to devote your charitable money?
A: We started with K-12 education, because that is the root cause of so many problems: unemployment, homelessness, addiction, mental health. We focused on that for a number of years, and then started looking at other areas where flawed policies were leading to bad outcomes – like criminal justice, healthcare and public finance. What does the actual evidence show, about what works and what doesn't?
Q: You and you wife signed the Giving Pledge, promising to donate the majority of your fortune to charity. Why?

A: I have seen a lot of examples about what money can do to future generations. Sometimes it can be beneficial, but often it can be strongly negative. I haven't seen any evidence that leaving kids significant money makes them happier or more productive. People tend to appreciate the money they earn for themselves, and I want them to have that feeling. A large inheritance could overwhelm their mission in life, and dim their own ambitions.

1. Netflix Slammed After Missing Big On Subscriber Growth
Netflix missed its subscriber growth projections for the first time in five quarters, raising fears that the streaming giant's rapid expansion is slowing.
The company, one of the momentum leaders of this bull market, reported second-quarter earnings after the market closed on Monday.
In addition to a slight miss on revenue compared to estimates, Netflix posted a huge miss on subscriber additions. The company added 5.2 million customers from April through June, about one million less than forecast.
Netflix added just 670,000 subscribers in the U.S., well below analysts' estimates of 1.19 million. It signed up 4.47 million subscribers internationally, while analysts were expecting 4.97 million.
In pre-market trading, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares plunged roughly 14% to $343.89, eroding $24.2 billion in market capitalization and down from Monday's close of $400.48.
Along with Netflix’s earnings stumble, fellow FANG members Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all dropped around 1%.
2. Goldman Sachs Continues Busy Week Of Earnings
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) results due out before the opening bell will be today's main event, as a busy week for earnings rolls along.
Goldman’s results will be of particular interest to investors amid reports that David Solomon, currently the firm’s president, would be named CEO, succeeding Lloyd Blankfein who has held the top role at Goldman since 2006.
In addition to Goldman, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) are also scheduled to report on Tuesday morning.
After the closing bell, United Continental (NYSE:UAL), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX), Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) and  Pinnacle Financial  (NASDAQ:PNFP) are set to post results.
3. Fed's Powell To Address Congress
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET.
Text of the testimony will be released 90 minutes before he starts speaking.
Investors are hoping to get a better idea of what the Fed’s thoughts are on current disputes over trade, including whether any alarm on their part could put rate increases on hold until the trade situation calms down.
The Fed, in its accompanying semi-annual Monetary Policy Report sent to Congress late last week, reiterated that it expected ""further gradual increases"" in interest rates due to ""solid"" economic growth.
The U.S. central bank raised interest rates last month for the second time this year and has projected two more rate hikes by year end.
Besides the Fed, the notable data set for release Tuesday includes the June reading on industrial production and the National Association of Homebuilders’ July reading on homebuilder sentiment.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was a shade lower at 94.10.
Meanwhile, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices were little changed, with the benchmark 10-year yield holding steady at 2.86%.
Powell's view on the continued flattening of the Treasury yield curve, which usually signals a recession is near, will also be on investors' minds.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said Monday that the U.S. central bank should take a break from hiking rates, because of how the yield curve is moving.
4. Wall Street Points To Subdued Open
U.S. stock futures pointed to a subdued open, as investors await further corporate results and remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
At 5:40AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 15 points, or less than 0.1%, the S&P 500 futures dipped 2 points, or roughly 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 9 points, or about 0.1%.
Elsewhere, in Europe, most of the region's major bourses hovered around the flatline in quiet mid-morning trade, with the different sectors moving in opposite directions.
Earlier, stocks in Asia closed mostly lower, with Japan the only major market finishing in positive territory, as energy stocks declined.
5. Oil Prices Stabilize After Sharp Falls
Oil prices were relatively flat, pausing for breath after tumbling to a three-month low, as supply disruptions in Libya began to ease and reports of potential exemptions from U.S. sanctions for buyers of Iranian crude began to emerge.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was down 7 cents, or 0.1%, at $67.00 a barrel. It fell 4.2% on Monday.
Brent crude futures were down 22 cents, or 0.3%, at $71.62 a barrel. They sank 4.6% in the prior session.
The American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report for the week ended July 13 at 4:30PM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 3.4 million barrels.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",Italy shock shows sovereign CDS still active - flaws and all,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's recent bond shock showed that the financial derivatives market designed to insure against sovereign defaults hasn't been killed off by doubts about whether those contracts would pay out when the time came.
The market for sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) is half the size it was six years ago at the height of the euro zone debt crisis, following a government clampdown and a patchy record as a hedge for a credit event.
But when the political crisis in Italy began to hammer the country's huge government bond market, one of the biggest trades was to buy an updated version of the credit insurance contracts, signaling an enduring, albeit changing, appetite for the instruments.
The CDS market as a whole still has a notional value of over $10 trillion, data from industry body International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) shows.
""During the financial crisis, in some cases it didn't provide the same protection that was expected,"" said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management.
""It may work for a directional view, but we don't use it as a hedge against default,"" she said.
A euro zone sovereign default has been a concern for investors in developed market government bonds as no country within the bloc can print money on its own if faced with debt repayment difficulties.
Even though the European Central Bank has performed that function when it deemed a country's problems threatened the wider system, the effective Greek default of 2012 underlined the residual risk.
The notional outstanding CDS for euro zone single-name sovereigns has almost halved, but still stands at 510.6 billion, the data shows.
DEVIL IN THE DETAIL
If investors holding a CDS believe a credit event has occurred, they make a submission to ISDA, who then pass it on to a determinations committee for a decision.
This can lead to variable results. In the case of the Greek sovereign debt crisis in 2010, investors eventually received a payout, but there was a long period where they worried Greece would default without triggering the CDS. https://reut.rs/2Ng0BuG
In the case of Portugal's Novo Banco, they did not. https://reut.rs/2Nc3GM1
Those who assess portfolio risk for funds said they still believe in the ability of CDS to hedge debt holdings - up to a point.
""It really depends what they are trying to hedge, what the contract defines as a default event, which specific bond is in default and a multitude of other factors,"" said David Cockburn, chief risk officer and chief operating officer at London-based Alfreton Capital, a hedge fund.
Sameer Saifan, CEO at Cassandra Wealth and previously chief risk officer at fund of hedge funds Tages Capital, said CDS work, but the default has to happen as set out in the contract. ""The devil is in the detail,"" he said.
ISDA tried to repair criticism of CDS by releasing definitions that attempted to clarify what constituted a credit event, placating some.
""(The 2014 ISDA definitions) took care of lots of questions about sovereign CDS... in terms of restructuring and what happens in case of a redenomination,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at financial research firm TS Lombard.
In the Italian sell-off, traders bought CDS contracts written under the 2014 definitions over the old 2003 contracts, said Atritra Banerjee, a credit derivatives strategist at Citi, among the biggest dealers of CDS.
This drove the prices of the two contracts apart.
SHORT-SELLING BAN
Activity in CDS was drained by the European Union's 2012 ban on short-selling of sovereign debt, which prevented investors from taking so-called ""naked"" positions - speculating on CDS prices without owning the underlying bonds.
Governments argued such speculation led to unacceptable moral hazard, equivalent to taking fire insurance out on a house you didn't own. In effect, they argued it encouraged players to build positions that raised debt payment stress on governments while simultaneously profiting from holding the CDS if that stress resulted in non-payment.
""The short-selling ban changed the type of market participants and it also changed the liquidity and size of the market,"" said Matthew Haworth, a rates trader at JP Morgan, one of the biggest dealers of CDS in the world.
Many real money investors are also buying CDS not to hedge against a default - but simply to hedge against a sell-off on the assumption that CDS prices will rise when the underlying debt sells off.
""They are actually hoping that the debt doesn't default,"" said Cicione of TS Lombard.
Financial markets have a history of buying and selling products on certain correlation assumptions, without necessarily examining the veracity of the underlying asset; most notably sub-prime mortgages in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis.
""When it's questionable whether or not these CDS contracts will be honored, it means that they work as a hedge only as long as others believe they work as a hedge,"" said Rabobank rates strategist Richard McGuire.
""There is no intrinsic value beyond the broader sentiment in market - which really is the same rationale behind cryptocurrency.""

738,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 02:36AM ET</span>","China still confident of hitting 2018 growth target despite slowdown, trade risks","BEIJING (Reuters) - China is still confident of hitting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year despite views that it faces a bumpy second half as a trade row with the United States intensifies, the state planning agency said on Tuesday.
The remarks came a day after China reported slightly slower growth for the second quarter and the weakest expansion in factory activity in June in two years, suggesting a further softening in business conditions in coming months as trade pressures build.
Even after Monday's weaker data and the latest U.S. tariffs, most economists predict Beijing is still likely to come in around its official GDP growth target this year, though some China watchers believe activity levels are already much weaker than official data suggest.
Yan Pengcheng, spokesman for the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a news conference that China has ample policy room to deal with any shocks.
""Overall, We have the confidence, conditions, and enough capability to effectively cope with the uncertainties in the world economy and make sure we accomplish the target we set at the beginning of the year,"" said Yan.
Yan said he was responding to ""some views"" that China will have a tough time keeping maintaining stable economic development in the second half this year due to the Sino-U.S. trade frictions and domestic structural problems. 
""China will improve the flexibility of macro-economic policy and ensure the macro-economic fundamentals remain stable,"" said Yan, adding that policymakers also will expand effective investment and look for ways to boost domestic demand. 
He cited a number of supportive factors for the economy, including China’s low budget deficit ratio and government debt levels, commercial banks’ high capital adequacy ratio and provision coverage ratio, declining corporate debt levels and plenty of policy tools that authorities can employ.
Yan also said the NDRC had approved 102 fixed-asset investment projects in the first half of this year, worth a combined 260.3 billion yuan ($39 billion). 
China's economy has already felt the pinch from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending that has driven up corporate borrowing costs. Policymakers have started to step up support for the economy and may be softening their campaign to reduce a rapid build-up in debt.
For firms impacted by the Sino-U.S. trade frictions, China will provide ""targeted"" help after assessment of the impact, Yan said, without giving details.
""If the trade war does hit the economy hard, then the government will substantially increase investment, especially in high-tech sectors. This will help stabilize economic growth and job security to stave off social unrest,"" economists at ING said in a note on Monday.
""In this instance, the central bank will put financial deleveraging aside to focus on growth.""
But ING added: ""Though the government will provide support via fiscal and monetary policies, it is inevitable that industrial production will slow (as the trade war weighs on manufacturing and logistics sectors), which could hurt wage growth and consumption.""

739,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 01:49AM ET</span>","Moonwalking: South Korea's wage, hours policies backfire for jobless, low income workers","By Cynthia Kim and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - President Moon Jae-in wants South Koreans to work less and earn more – and to achieve that his government has hiked the minimum wage and slashed the maximum length of the working week. But Heo Jeong, who serves barley tea samples at a Lotte Mart store in Seoul, says she lost a third of her income as a result.
Heo's store shortened its opening times and cut staff hours. The 48-year-old now makes 1.2 million won ($1,077) a month working 32 hours instead of 40, a third less than before because she now isn’t getting much night work at premium rates or as many chances to earn bonuses.
She is not alone. Many businesses are closing early rather than hiring additional staff after the legal cap on working hours was cut to 52 per week from 68, effective July 1.
It is one of a number of signs that Moon’s reforms are starting to backfire and his pledge to be the “Jobs President” who tackles inequality head on may be at risk, economists warn.
Another problem is that a January hike in the minimum hourly wage - the biggest in 17 years at a whopping 16 percent – may have had the opposite effect on incomes for the lower paid, and also become a deterrent to investment and recruitment.
Household income for the lowest 20 percent fell 8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking the sharpest fall since 2003 when Statistics Korea began compiling data, and almost a quarter of those aged 15-29 remain unemployed.
""I want to work more hours, and take night shifts as much as possible,"" said Heo. ""I don't necessarily see anyone actually making more money around me. I myself have cut down on groceries.""
A Lotte spokesman confirmed that most Lotte stores cut store hours, and some of its sub-contract workers worked fewer hours as a result.
On Saturday, the government-mandated Minimum Wage Commission heightened concerns over the issue by announcing that next year the minimum wage will increase another 10.9 percent to 8,350 won ($7.40) an hour.
That prompted a small business group, the Korea Federation of Micro Enterprise, to threaten to refuse to implement the reform. “Small-business owners are at a crossroads where they cannot help but choose either business shutdowns or staff cuts,” it said in a statement.
Certainly, South Korean companies have slowed down hiring. The monthly average number of jobs added so far this year, 142,000, is the slowest pace seen since the 2008-09 global financial crisis.
On Monday, Moon acknowledged possible negative consequences for small business owners and low-income earners from a higher minimum wage, but said his policies will continue to focus on boosting incomes.
""Steep increases in the minimum wage aim to ensure a dignified life for low-income workers, while raising household income to boost domestic demand, which in turn will lead to job creation,"" Moon told his cabinet members at a policy meeting in Seoul, adding that efforts will be made to provide subsidies for the low-income earners who suffer as a result of the policies.
A Blue House official at the Presidential Committee on Jobs, a body Moon launched last year to fulfill his election promise of creating jobs, declined to elaborate further.
Moon remains popular, with 69 percent backing in polling in July, though that is down from a peak of 83 percent in May after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his rating has fallen for a fourth week in a row, according to Gallup Korea. It is unclear how much the economy is playing into those numbers.
SENT HOME EARLY
Shipbuilder  Hyundai Heavy Industries  (KS:009540) and retailers  Lotte Shopping  (KS:023530) and  Shinsegae  Inc. (KS:004170) are among companies who have begun to power off computers at 5:30 p.m. for office workers to prevent overtime, according to spokespeople for the companies.
A number of Korean retailers have pulled forward closing times to 11 p.m. from 12 p.m. because of the higher wage costs.
""We're trying to make working hours flexible for our workers and have shortened business hours at most of our stores,"" an official at Lotte Shopping told Reuters, asking not to be named as he was not authorized to talk to the media. All three firms declined comment on hiring plans.
Lee Jae-kwang, who owns a Paris Baguette bakery in the posh Gangnam district of Seoul, says he is sending his workers home earlier in the evening and closes the store himself an hour earlier at 10 p.m.
""Adding jobs is the last thing on my mind. The steep increase in wages is a real financial strain for us,"" said Lee.
SILVER LININGS
To be sure, Moon is trying to fix some major structural economic problems. The youth unemployment rate reached 9.8 percent in 2017, almost three times the rate for all workers, yet South Koreans put in the third longest hours among the 36 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, behind only Mexico and Costa Rica. Also South Korea’s labor productivity growth was only 19th among OECD countries in 2017.
And for many white collar workers, the new policies are a relief.
""I didn't even think about leaving earlier than my boss last year. Now I can go watch movies every day and take my accounting classes at night, because they literally shut down my computer,"" said Shin Duk-young, a 29 year-old office worker at a retailer in Seoul. He asked that the company not be named. Also, while the poor got hammered in the first quarter, average household income grew 3.7 percent from a year earlier, the fastest expansion in four years. Income for the top 20 percent surged 9.3 percent, making income inequality the worst on record, according to Statistics Korea.
This has yet to boost domestic demand, though. Consumer sentiment is at its lowest since May 2017, when Moon won the general election.
Labor unions say the policies can only achieve their goal if small companies get subsidies and low-income earners get tax credits. They criticize the government for delaying related reforms of tax policies.
""BAD TIMING""
If Moon is to fulfill his campaign promise on the minimum wage, he will have to keep lifting it to 10,000 won per hour by 2020.
Lee Sang-jae, chief economist at Eugene Investment and Securities, said Moon's policies are ""steps in the right direction"" to tackle low incomes. But in a June report on South Korea, the OECD warned that scale would be unprecedented amongst its members and recommended Moon to assess this year's economic impact before raising wages any further.
Many economists doubt any such assessment would go well.
The labor market shake-up comes as China, the gravitational center for Asian economies, shows signs of a slowdown and South Korean exporters risk being caught in the crossfire of a trade war between Washington and Beijing.
""Wage floor hikes and other pro-labor policies could help reduce inequality long down the road, but it has come at a very bad timing,"" said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) in Seoul.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury moves to protect identities of 'dark money' political donors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Monday that it will no longer require certain tax-exempt organizations including politically active nonprofit groups, such as the National Rifle Association and Planned Parenthood, to identify their financial donors to U.S. tax authorities.
The policy change, heralded by conservatives as an advance for free speech, maintains donor disclosure requirements for traditional charity groups organized to receive tax-exempt donations under a section of the Internal Revenue code known as 501(c)(3), the Treasury said.
But the move frees labor unions, issue advocacy organizations, veterans groups and other nonprofits that do not receive tax-exempt money from meeting confidential disclosure requirements set in place decades ago.
“Americans shouldn’t be required to send the IRS information that it doesn’t need to effectively enforce our tax laws, and the IRS simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The change protects the privacy of wealthy donors of ""dark money"" donations to politically active groups. Conservatives have complained that the disclosures to the IRS, though not public, were susceptible to media leaks.
The issue of the IRS's handling of nonprofit political groups exploded into headlines several years ago when the federal tax agency was found to have targeted tax-exempt political groups aligned with the conservative Tea Party movement for greater scrutiny.

""It is important to emphasize that this change will in no way limit transparency,"" Mnuchin said. ""The same information about tax-exempt organizations that was previously available to the public will continue to be available, while private taxpayer information will be better protected.""

741,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",U.K.'s May in Brexit Turmoil as Furious Pro-EU Tories Rebel,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy is in disarray after she infuriated pro-European Tories by bowing to pressure from their euroskeptic colleagues to re-write her plans.
May’s majority was cut to just three votes after she adopted Brexiteer amendments to a key piece of customs legislation, and the proposals were narrowly voted through the House of Commons late Monday. A tenth member of her government is reported to have quit in order to vote against her and she needed the backing of three rebels from the opposition Labour Party to win.
May’s team is split down the middle over how to handle the biggest issue facing the U.K. -- negotiating the terms of its withdrawal from the European Union. Time is running out with just three months left before a self imposed October deadline to secure an exit deal ahead of the country’s formal departure on March 29 next year.
The rebellions are “a prelude to the big -- and real -- battle coming in the winter when the PM comes back with her deal and we know what the choice is. And whether she can continue,” Tory lawmaker George Freeman, who used to head May’s policy board, said in a posting on Instagram. “Brexit is coming home to roost. And it won’t be easy or pleasant.”
Walking a Fine Line
As rumors of plots against her swirl around Parliament, May is proposing to send its members away on vacation early, an idea that provoked ridicule from critics who said she was afraid of her own colleagues.
At the same time as she plans a strategy to negotiate with the EU, May must weave a path between pro- and anti-Brexit lawmakers in her party to avoid being defeated or even ousted. She spent the past week fighting to contain the fall-out from her decision to stick close to European market regulations for trade in goods and agricultural products.
Two pro-Brexit cabinet ministers -- Boris Johnson and David Davis -- were among the senior figures to quit in protest, claiming that May is failing to deliver the clean break from the EU that the public voted for in the 2016 referendum.
Pendulum Swings Back
On Monday, the Brexit backers stepped up their campaign to force May to take a harder line. Instead of fighting them, she chose to accept their proposals for changes to her blueprint -- in the form of parliamentary amendments -- after claims that she’d face a revolt from as many as 100 pro-Brexit Tories if she refused.
As the pendulum swung, with Brexit campaigners happy again, their pro-EU rivals became furious. According to the BBC, one pro-European minister -- Guto Bebb -- even resigned his post as defense minister to vote against May’s new policy.
Government officials could not immediately confirm Bebb’s decision, but if the reports are correct, he would be the tenth minister to stand down in protest at her Brexit plan since she finalized it at a cabinet meeting July 6. And the first to do so in the cause of a softer split from the EU.
Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan told an event in central London that she is “very, very angry” about the government backing down to Conservative euroskeptics.
Potential Flashpoints
Tory Anna Soubry earlier accused her pro-Brexit colleagues of sacrificing jobs in the interests of Brexit at any cost. “What they have said in those private conversations is that the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs will be worth it to regain our country’s sovereignty,” she said. “You tell that to the people of my constituency.”
A head of steam is building among anti-Brexit Tories and it could take as few as seven rebels to defeat the government if all opposition parties vote against May too. Tuesday will see more votes on her Brexit plans, this time on her Trade Bill.
Among the potential flashpoints are anti-government amendments designed to keep the U.K. inside a formal customs union with the EU.
In another potentially contentious vote Tuesday, members of Parliament will be asked to choose whether to end their summer business early, breaking up for the long vacation on July 19, instead of July 24 as scheduled.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The administration of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has opened a probe into allegations that the real estate firm once led by U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner harassed tenants at one of its largest residential buildings.
New York State Homes and Community Renewal on Monday said its tenant protection unit would investigate alleged abuses by Kushner Companies toward tenants at the 338-unit Austin Nichols House in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
The probe was announced one day after 20 current and former tenants filed a $10 million lawsuit accusing the Kushner firm of using construction crews to create ""intolerable"" conditions at the building, including exposure to toxins and dust, rodent infestation, mold and the loss of hot water.
They said the firm did this to drive out rent-stabilized tenants and transform the building into a luxury condominium.
Cuomo, a Democrat seeking his third term as governor, and other state officials have pursued a wide array of lawsuits and probes into Trump, a Republican, and his family businesses.
""Governor Cuomo has zero tolerance for tenant abuse of any kind,"" RuthAnne Visnauskas, commissioner of the state housing agency, said in a statement.
Emily Wolf, general counsel for Kushner Cos, said the firm ""respects and values its tenants"" and was confident the probe would find no harassment or unsafe conditions.
""We understand the current political environment,"" Wolf said in an email. ""Sadly, we are caught in the middle and continue to have baseless and meritless claims filed against us.""
The firm plans to defend against the lawsuit, saying tenants were never pressured to leave and were kept informed about the construction, which it said was completed properly.
Jared Kushner is now a Trump adviser and is not a defendant.
The Kushner firm was part of a venture that in 2015 paid $275 million for the landmarked Williamsburg building.
Located at 184 Kent Avenue overlooking the East River and Manhattan, the century-old building was once a warehouse for Wild Turkey bourbon before being converted into luxury rentals.
New York limits the amounts by which landlords can raise rents each year for rent-stabilized tenants.
Sunday's lawsuit was supported by the Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants rights group.
It accused the Kushner firm in March of falsifying work permits to conceal rent-regulated units at 34 buildings, and avoid potentially stricter oversight of construction crews during renovations.
New York City's Department of Buildings opened a related probe the same month.

745,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Fed Documents Show Powell's Hand in Richmond President Search,"(Bloomberg) -- Documents released Monday by the Federal Reserve reveal new details about how deeply involved the central bank’s Washington-based officials get in the search and selection of regional Fed presidents.
The records, obtained by Bloomberg News under a Freedom of Information Act request and including dozens of emails, show that in 2017 then-Fed Governor Jerome Powell kept up a running discussion by phone and email with officials at the Richmond Fed over the 10-month period leading up to the appointment of Thomas Barkin, a McKinsey & Co. Inc. executive, to lead the regional bank. Powell, now chairman of the Fed, was then head of the central bank’s committee for overseeing regional Fed banks.
On at least two occasions, Powell sent the Richmond directors names of potential candidates for their consideration. At other times he offered feedback, his own and from others at the Fed, on names compiled by the Richmond board and by the search firm hired to identify candidates. He also urged the directors to consider advice from Fed Governor Lael Brainard. In all cases, the names of candidates and specific feedback on them were redacted from the documents.
The emails also suggest that Richmond officials and their search firm were eager to hear what Powell had to say about their candidate list.
“The emails certainly nail down the details of the ways in which Powell and Brainard were involved -- passing along names, reviewing candidates along the way and interviewing the finalists,” said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a book on the Fed, after reviewing the documents.
Diversity Efforts
None of the documents, Binder notes, show the Fed governors urging the Richmond directors explicitly to broaden their search to include more women or minority candidates. But they do include, she said, a memo from the Richmond board chair, Margaret Lewis, outlining her bank’s efforts to create a diverse pool from which to select a president.
That memo, which was previously released under the same records request in May, stated that the bank’s efforts to consult with organizations “whose missions include a focus on diversity and inclusion” resulted in “minimal direct results.”
Of the internal Fed correspondence included in the release, none were to or from then-Fed Chair Janet Yellen, leaving unclear whether she ever weighed in on the process. Yellen left the Fed in February when her term expired.
In recent years, the Fed’s board of governors has assured critics and lawmakers that the Washington-based leadership gets directly involved in presidential search processes with a particular focus on ensuring the candidate pools are diverse.
Secret Process
The December appointment of Barkin, a non-economist and an unknown in central banking circles, proved controversial. Some critics said the selection failed address the lack of racial and gender diversity among the Fed leadership. Others attacked the lack of transparency in the selection process. Like other regional Fed appointments, Barkin’s identity was kept secret until after his selection was finalized.
Along with Fed governors, the central bank’s 12 regional presidents serve on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the world’s most important benchmark interest rate. They are appointed by their respective boards of directors, subject to the approval of Fed governors in Washington.
Richmond directors decided unanimously to appoint Barkin, whose pick was approved by the Board of Governors on Dec. 1. He took office on Jan. 1.

746,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Kashkari Isn't Buying ‘This Time Is Different’ for Yield Curve,"(Bloomberg) -- Neel Kashkari does not want to invert the yield curve.
Given anchored inflation expectations and few signs of overheating, “there is little reason to raise rates much further, invert the yield curve, put the brakes on the economy and risk that it does, in fact, trigger a recession,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president wrote in a post Monday on the website Medium.
Kashkari, who’s previously expressed discomfort with the flattening curve, joins other Fed officials who’ve voiced concerns about precipitating an inversion -- a phenomenon where short-run rates rise above long-term rates, and a historically reliable recession signal.
“This time is different. I consider those the four most dangerous words in economics,” Kashkari wrote.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said last week that inversion could be a self-fulfilling prophecy if investors believe it will bring recession. St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard says inversions have historically signaled downturns and he doesn’t buy that this time is different, and the Dallas Fed’s Robert Kaplan is also “loath to say” that an inversion now would break from past experience.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker doesn’t “see why we would move in a way that would invert the yield curve just to do it.” John Williams, head of the powerful New York Fed and a permanent voter on monetary policy, has walked a middle line: he said in May that he doesn’t think the yield curve will invert, but wouldn’t ignore the signal if push came to shove.
Not everyone is sounding the alarm bells. Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester has been more relaxed about the flattening. “Just because the yield curve is flat does not necessarily mean lower growth or even a recession,” she said in May.
Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, with his remarks being published when the event kicks off at 10 a.m. Fed officials are regularly discussing the yield curve, he said in June, and flattening makes “all the sense in the world” as rates increase.

While the concept of “willing buyer, willing seller” hasn’t seen the majority of land being transferred to black citizens who were disenfranchised during white-minority rule under apartheid, the African National Congress wants all people to have similar rights to land, he said in an interview broadcast on Johannesburg-based eNCA Monday.
“Land is an asset that people want to have in their hands so that they can work this asset,” he said. We’re going to embark on an agricultural revolution that’s going to empower our people to work land effectively.” Businesses with land “are willing participants” and want to be “cut into the solution,” he said.
Land and the access to it is one of the symbols of inequality in the nation of about 56 million where wealth and poverty are largely divided along racial lines. Today, white people own almost three quarters of South Africa’s agricultural land, according to a land audit by farm lobbying group Agri SA, down from 87 percent during the segregation system known as apartheid.
The ANC is pushing for the right to seize land without compensation for redistribution to black citizens to tackle an issue that divides the nation once infamous for a legislated system of racial segregation. The decision brings the party closer to the populist Economic Freedom Fighters party, which has won support from young voters in impoverished townships by vowing to nationalize everything from land to banks.
‘Love Affair’
The ANC will contest national elections next year in the first ballot since the opposition won control of several key municipalities, including the biggest and richest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria, in 2016.
Voters “are rekindling their love affair with the ANC” after distancing themselves from the party after it “deviated from its values,” Ramaphosa said.
“Our mission is to have a united ANC,” he said. “We’re busy holding conferences around the country, and those are being underpinned by spirit of renewal. I am confident -- confident underlined -- that the ANC is going to forge unity and we’ll go into the elections as a united force.”"

(Reuters) - The narrowing gap between yields on long-term and short-term Treasury bonds to little more than the equivalent of one rate hike from the Federal Reserve has helped sour at least one U.S. central banker on any further interest rates increases.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari, who does not vote this year on Fed policy but takes part in the U.S. central bank's regular discussion of interest-rate policy, said Monday that the flat yield curve means interest rates are close to neutral.
""This suggests that there is little reason to raise rates much further, invert the yield curve, put the brakes on the economy and risk that it does, in fact, trigger a recession,"" he said in a blog post. ""If inflation expectations or real growth prospects pick up, the Fed can always raise rates then.""
The Fed has lifted interest rates twice this year already, and last month signaled it will likely do so twice more before the year is out, in large part because unemployment, at 4 percent, is low by historical standards, inflation has begun to perk up, and stimulus from tax cuts and government spending are forecast to boost growth further.
Still, the gap between yields on the ten- and two-year Treasuries hit a fresh 11-year low earlier Monday and is currently around just 25 basis points.
(Graphic: The Incredible Shrinking Yield Curve - https://reut.rs/2NiIZy4)
A yield curve is said to invert when yields on short-term debt exceed those on long-term debt. Research shows that a recession nearly always follows such inversions - though exactly how long after is unclear.
Still, Kashkari's view is not shared by many of his policymaking colleagues, who have generally downplayed the warning signal he sees in the flattening yield curve.
They instead point to the behavior of yields in shorter-term markets that they say points to no particularly elevated risk of recession, and warn that the bigger risk is in raising rates so slowly that inflation surges out of control.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday before Congress, though it is not known if he will address the topic then.

Among Fed policymakers who do see a flashing yellow light in the flattening yield curve - among them, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan - Kashkari stands nearly alone in calling for a pause in rate hikes. Kaplan told Reuters Friday he would not knowingly do anything to invert the yield curve, yet he also said he continues to support further rate hikes.

The retaliatory tariffs on up to a combined $28.5 billion worth of U.S. exports are illegal under WTO rules, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.
""These tariffs appear to breach each WTO member's commitments under the WTO Agreement,"" he said. ""The United States will take all necessary actions to protect our interests, and we urge our trading partners to work constructively with us on the problems created by massive and persistent excess capacity in the steel and aluminum sectors.""
Lighthizer's office has maintained that the tariffs the United States has imposed on imports of steel and aluminum are acceptable under WTO rules because they were imposed on the grounds of a national security exception.
Mexico said it would defend its retaliatory measures, saying the imposition of U.S. tariffs was ""unjustified.""
""The purchases the United States makes of steel and aluminum from Mexico do not represent a threat to the national security,"" Mexico's Economy Ministry said in a statement.
""On the contrary, the solid trade relationship between Mexico and the U.S. has created an integrated regional market where steel and aluminum products contribute to the competitiveness of the region in various strategic sectors, such as automotive, aerospace, electrical and electronic,"" the ministry added.

Lighthizer said last month that retaliation had no legal basis because the EU and other trading partners were making false assertions that the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs are illegal ""safeguard"" actions intended to protect U.S. producers.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Brazil mid-July inflation likely outpaces target midpoint,"By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate in mid-July likely rose above the midpoint of the central bank's target for the first time in more than a year, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Monday.
Still, that is not expected to spur the central bank to raise interest rates any time soon, as inflation spiked due mostly to the temporary effects of a nationwide trucker strike and higher power rates.
Consumer prices tracked by the benchmark IPCA index likely rose 4.64 percent in the 12 months through mid-July, according to the median of 21 forecasts. The central bank is targeting a year-end rate of 4.5 percent in 2018, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. 
That would be the fastest pace for inflation since the middle of March 2017, underscoring the profound impact of product shortages in the wake of truckers' protests over diesel prices, which blocked major highways in the final weeks of May.
The IPCA index probably rose 0.75 percent from mid-June, based on the median of 21 estimates. 
Yet that is unlikely to foster expectations of wider price pressures. When stripped of volatile items such as energy and food prices, 12-month inflation likely remained near 3 percent, economists at UBS estimated.
""The details will likely show well-behaved underlying inflation, confirming that July price pressures are likely temporary,"" Rabobank economist Mauricio Oreng wrote in a report.
The survey suggested most economists' forecasts have already incorporated the impact of the strike, which had pushed up recent inflation readings.
The spread between the largest and smallest estimates for the annual rate was only 0.30 percentage point, far smaller than the previous two polls, suggesting less room for surprises.
A central bank survey of economists conducted last week also pointed in that direction, as the median forecast for 2018 inflation fell for the first time in nine weeks to 4.15 percent.
That should allow the central bank to hold its benchmark Selic interest rate at an all-time low of 6.50 percent, adding support to a weak economy that has so far kept a lid on underlying price pressures.
The bank has stressed that increased uncertainty due to the strike, along with a sharp depreciation of Brazil's currency, has made it harder to separate short-term shocks from wider changes in the economic outlook.

Still, economists say the weak economy is likely to keep a slumping Brazilian real (BRBY) from adding much to inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Escalating and sustained trade conflicts following U.S. tariff actions threaten to derail economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects, the International Monetary Fund warned on Monday.
Sketching out potential damage from the full brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and subsequent retaliation from trading partners, the IMF said that if realized, these could reduce annual global economic output by 0.5 percent from projections for 2020.
That translates to nearly $500 billion in lost annual output based on IMF projections, the equivalent of subtracting an economy the size of Thailand.
""The risk that current trade tensions escalate further with adverse effects on confidence, asset prices and investment is the greatest near-term risk to global growth,"" IMF Chief Economist Maury Obstfeld told a news conference, noting that U.S. trade deficits are likely to grow due to high demand, possibly inflaming trade tensions further.
The reduction in output takes into account active U.S. global tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as an initial $34 billion in Chinese goods, along with retaliatory measures. Other threatened actions, which include another round of tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods and a 25 percent U.S. global tariff on car imports now under study, are also included.
""As the focus of global retaliation, the United States finds a relatively high share of its exports taxed in global markets in such a broader trade conflict, and it is therefore especially vulnerable,"" Obstfeld added.
The IMF left unchanged its global economic growth forecasts at 3.9 percent for both 2018 and 2019, compared to its previous forecast issued in April. Obstfeld said these projections only take into account tariffs currently in force, so larger actions such as possible automotive tariffs were not included.
Still, he said that growth momentum was slowing. While the IMF in April rounded down growth projections to reach the 3.9 percent forecast, for the July update, the numbers were rounded up slightly to reach that same level. 
Forecasts for the United States and China were both unchanged, with U.S. growth pegged at 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019. China's growth was forecast at 6.6 percent in 2018 and 6.4 percent in 2019.
But the fund cut its 2018 growth forecasts for euro zone countries and for Japan and Britain, citing a softer-than-expected first-quarter performance coupled with tighter financial conditions partly due to political uncertainty.
The euro zone's 2018 growth forecast was cut to 2.2 percent from 2.4 percent, with Britain cut to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent. Japan's growth projection was cut to 1.0 percent from 1.2 percent.
The IMF also trimmed 2018 forecasts for some emerging market countries, notably a half percentage point cut for Brazil to 1.8 percent due to the lingering effects of labor strikes and political uncertainty.
The fund also cut India's growth rate by a tenth of a point to 7.5 percent due to the negative effects of higher oil prices on domestic demand and faster-than-anticipated monetary policy tightening due to higher inflation.

The IMF revised slightly upward 2018 forecasts for Saudi Arabia and several Commonwealth of Independent States countries other than Russia.

Haldane, who shocked markets last month by voting for an immediate interest rate hike, made the comments in a blog detailing a trip to Wales ending on June 26. Two days later, he made a speech in which he said that a steady pick-up in wage growth and cost pressures showed the U.K. economy is ready for higher rates.
“The message from a number of companies across a number of sectors in Wales was that these pressures to pay-up were mounting -- indeed, these pressures had gone up a gear during the course of this year,” Haldane wrote in the post published on the BOE’s website. “This evidence adds to my confidence that the economy is experiencing a gradual, on-going firming of pay pressures, with implications for underlying inflation.”
A report tomorrow is forecast to show that U.K. pay growth slowed to 2.7 percent in the three months through May, down from 2.8 percent in the period through April. Still, the rate has climbed from less than 2 percent in early 2017.
BOE officials announce their next policy decision on Aug. 2. A 25 basis point increase is widely expected by economists, while markets are pricing in a more than 80 percent chance of such a move."

In Nanos Research polling conducted for Bloomberg News as Canada finalized retaliatory tariffs against its biggest trading partner, 41 percent of respondents said Trudeau could best manage the relationship with the U.S. president, while 20 percent said Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer would be best-suited.
Trudeau’s support was higher among women, among those aged 55 and up, and regionally strongest in vote-rich Ontario -- a populous auto manufacturing heartland on the front lines of the tariff fight. The polling results are a vote of confidence for Trudeau, with a key caveat: one third of respondents said no party leader was best suited to deal with Trump, or that they weren’t sure.
“That probably speaks to the level of anxiety and uncertainty there,” pollster Nik Nanos said in an interview. “We don’t know how our relationship is going to pan out, because of a number of issues, ranging from tariff aggravations to personal interactions between the prime minister and the president.”
Nanos added: “It shouldn’t be a surprise that the PM of the day has an advantage.”
Trudeau led in most subgroups of the poll except the energy-rich, typically conservative Prairies, where 35.6 percent said Scheer was the best fit, versus 26.7 percent for the Liberal prime minister. Trudeau led in all other regions with the support of 48.5 percent in Ontario and 43.7 percent in Quebec, the two most populous provinces.
Canadian politics is typically a three-way race between the centrist Liberals, the right-leaning Conservatives and the left-leaning New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh. A former provincial lawmaker, Singh was elected federal leader last year but still doesn’t have a seat in the Ottawa legislature. The Liberals and Conservatives are running neck-and-neck heading into next year’s election campaign.
The poll shows only a two-way race when it comes to dealing with Trump. Just over 1 percent of respondents said Singh would be best-suited for managing the relationship with the U.S. president, while Green Party Leader Elizabeth May -- her party’s only federal lawmaker -- received the support of nearly 3 percent of those polled.
The poll was based on telephone and online responses from 1,000 Canadian adults, and was conducted from June 26 to 28. Canada finalized its retaliatory tariffs on June 29. The results are considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, with a larger margin of error for regional breakdowns or other subgroup results."
754,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>","France, Germany call for stable EU farm budget post-Brexit","PARIS (Reuters) - France and Germany want the European Union's agriculture budget to be maintained at its current level once Britain leaves the bloc, the French and German farm ministers said on Monday.
Rejecting a proposal from the European Commission for a reduction in the budget for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the ministers said in a joint statement they would seek that ""the budget allocated to the CAP be maintained at its current level for the 27 member states.""
Britain's planned withdrawal next year from the 28-country EU will remove a net contributor to the bloc's overall budget, creating pressure to reduce major spending areas like agriculture.
In an effort to cut costs and promote other policies, the European Commission in May proposed to cut farm aid in the 2021-2027 period to 365 billion euros ($438 billion), down 5 percent from the current CAP.
This would represent a share of less than 30 percent of the total budget of 1.28 trillion euros in inflation-adjusted prices, down from more than 45 percent 20 years earlier.
France, by far the largest beneficiary of the CAP, called the Commission proposal ""unacceptable"" and has sought to rally other EU members to defend a stable farm budget.
Paris said in June it had won the support of 19 other countries but not Germany, the EU's biggest economy and main contributor to the bloc's budget.
""I welcome the fact that Germany has (now) joined us in the opposition to the Commission's proposed CAP budget,"" French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said in a statement on the common position found with his counterpart Julia Kloeckner. 

The two ministers also called for more environment-friendly policies, a better targeting of direct subsidies and reinforcing crisis and risk management tools.

755,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Trade War Imperils World Growth as IMF Sees ‘Complacent’ Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Escalating trade tensions are threatening to derail a global upswing that’s already losing momentum amid weaker-than-expected growth in Europe and Japan as financial markets seem complacent to the mounting risks, the International Monetary Fund warned.
The IMF kept is global forecast unchanged Monday in the latest update to its Global Economic Outlook. The world economy will grow 3.9 percent this year and next, said the Washington-based fund. The pace this year would be the fastest since 2011.
But cracks are forming in the growth picture. The global expansion is becoming less balanced, with growth sputtering in the Euro Area and Japan. Growth appears to have peaked in some major economies, and the boost from U.S. tax cuts and spending increases is expected to fade, according to the IMF.
At the same time, downside risks to the global economy are growing, led by the threat of a further ratcheting up of trade tensions, the IMF said.
“The risk that current trade tensions escalate further -- with adverse effects on confidence, asset prices, and investment -- is the greatest near-term threat to global growth,” IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in prepared remarks.
Can Trump Win a China Trade War? We May Soon Find Out: QuickTake
If threatened trade barriers become reality, global output could drop by about 0.5 percent below its projected level by 2020, Obstfeld said. The U.S. economy would be “especially vulnerable,” given it would be the focus of retaliation in a tit-for-tat conflict, Obstfeld said.
The IMF’s warning comes as President Donald Trump considers a range of further tariffs in his mission to level the playing field for U.S. companies and help American workers. The Trump administration this week released a list of $200 billion in Chinese imports -- from televisions to pineapple juice and ski gloves -- that may be targeted for duties, and his officials are also weighing tariffs on foreign cars.
With midterm elections in Congress looming in November, Trump is following through on campaign pledges to revive the nation’s manufacturing sector and cut America’s $552-billion trade deficit. But U.S. business groups have panned the tariffs, saying they’ll increase costs and raise prices for consumers. Countries from China to Canada have already retaliated against U.S. tariffs, raising the risk of a drawn-out global trade war.
Investors ‘Complacent’
The IMF projects the U.S. current-account deficit will widen, thwarting Trump’s plans to shrink it, as tax cuts and government spending increases boost demand for imports.
Obstfeld said investors seem “broadly complacent” about the risks facing the global economy, noting that asset prices remain high in many countries. Other risks include rising political uncertainty in Europe and the unresolved terms for Britain’s exit from the EU.
Financial markets are “susceptible to sudden re-pricing if growth and expected corporate profits stall,” he said.
The IMF left its forecast for the U.S. unchanged, predicting the world’s biggest economy will grow 2.9 percent this year before slowing to 2.7 percent in 2019. That’s short of the sustained 3 percent or more growth Trump has often suggested is on the way, and that officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have forecast will boost government receipts to offset reductions in corporate and personal tax rates.
Why Italian Politics Keep Roiling Financial Markets: QuickTake
The fund cut its growth projection for the euro area, which is now expected to expand 2.2 percent this year, down 0.2 percentage point from the IMF’s previous forecast, in April. The currency bloc will grow 1.9 percent next year, down 0.1 point from April.
Growth in Germany and France came in softer than expected in the first quarter, while political turmoil in Italy is expected to weigh on domestic demand, the fund said.
The fund also downgraded its forecast for Japan by 0.2 point this year to 1 percent growth, based on weak consumption and investment. Japan will grow 0.9 percent next year, unchanged from April, the IMF said.
China’s economy will expand at 6.6 percent in 2018 and 6.4 percent next year, both unchanged from four months ago, according to the fund.
The IMF also cut its forecast for the U.K. to 1.4 percent this year, down 0.2 point. U.K. growth will pick up to 1.5 percent next year, unchanged from April, the IMF said.

756,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 09:59AM ET</span>",There's a glaring problem with Trump's trade war that could drag out the fight indefinitely,"In just over four months, President Donald Trump has managed to  assault the international trading order, kick off  trade battles with key allies, and push  the US into a full-blown trade war with China.
But amid the flurry and sudden rush of trade protectionism, Trump's goal in the end remains a mystery.
""The honest answer is that no one knows,"" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider when asked Trump's end game. ""There appear to be real differences within the administration, and the president has not made his positions clear.""
Trade experts say the lack of a clear objective from Trump risks extending current trade fights indefinitely and causing major harm  to the US economy.
Trump has so far only talked in vague terms about a goal of ""fair"" and ""reciprocal"" trade. Experts told Business Insider that no statement or action has so far given a definitive answer to the question of what the president hope to achieve.
One goal Trump has floated: The elimination of all tariffs and trade barriers around the world. Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, also claims the goal of the tariffs is to eventually open up free trade.
But at the same time, the president has walked away from multilateral trade deals that would have moved the world closer to a such a system, including  the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.
Trump has shunned these multilateral trade deals in  pursuit of bilateral trade deals, but even given this rough goal there's no clear vision for what those deals would aim to achieve. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  offered little clarity when he was asked during a congressional hearing on Thursday what the bilateral deals could look like.
""There is no specific model for other agreements."" Mnuchin said.
This means countries are largely guessing at what exactly they should offer the Trump administration, a process that is likely to end in false starts and frustrating negotiations, said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments.
""I think Trump doesn’t have a clear end game — he wants concessions, he want these countries to sue for peace but his understanding of trade issues is so confused that he's not sure what he wants and that, of course, makes him even more difficult to deal with,"" Valliere told Business Insider.
For instance, the European Union refused to discuss the possibility of a trade deal while Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs were looming. 
Trump has also suggested, especially in relation to China, that he wants to reduce the US's bilateral trade deficits. But Trump's attacks so far have  blown out the deficit with China to a record level, and the US wrecked a proposal from the Chinese that could have reduced the imbalance when Trump moved forward with tariffs.
Simon Lester, the associate director at the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, said the proposed US-China deal is the perfect example of Trump constantly moving the goalposts.
""When the US complains about the trade deficit with China, I think China is genuinely confused about what the US wants,"" Lester told Business Insider. ""One response by China was to offer to buy more of specific US products. Given the US demands, I think this was a reasonable response by China, but it doesn’t seem to have satisfied the Trump administration.""
""There is no clear set of 'asks' the administration is waiting for China to promise to meet, and there is no clear plan have to move China to address them other than turning up the heat and waiting,"" added Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Even Republican lawmakers are getting tired of the haphazard approach.
""To my knowledge, not a single person is able to articulate where this is headed, nor what the plans are, nor what the strategy is,"" GOP Sen. Bob Corker, a longtime critic of Trump's tariffs,  told the Tennessean on Thursday. ""It seems to be a wake up, ready, fire, aim strategy.""
Like a race with no finish line, experts said that Trump's lack of a goal will result in a protracted trade war.
""I do not believe this trade war will end anytime soon,"" Alden said. ""It will have to get much worse before there is a serious effort to reach compromises.""
The longer the trade war drags on, economists say, the more  damage the US will sustain. According to Oxford Economics, Trump's current tariff threats on China would only shave 0.05% off of US GDP growth in 2018, but that would grow to a slowdown of roughly 0.25% in 2020.
Trump's vague messages could also lead other leaders to dig in and worsen the US's trading relationships — rather than remake them.
""I believe that’s a huge miscalculation; other countries have their own internal politics and their leaders will not wish to be seen kowtowing to the American president,"" Alden said.
Kennedy said Trump is taking a huge risk by possibly undermining the international trading order — such as the World Trade Organization — with no clear replacement.
"" It’s amazing that the Trump administration has decided to risk an implosion of the multilateral trading system without have a clear plan of how it should be changed and what China needs to do to return stability to the bilateral relationship,"" Kennedy said."

Ministers of the eurosceptic 5-Star/League government have said Italy would not ratify CETA (the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement), threatening the EU's first major trade deal since an EU-South Korean accord launched in 2011.
However, Agriculture Minister Gian Marco Centinaio told reporters in Brussels: ""Nobody is in a hurry to bring CETA to the chamber.""
Speaking before a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels, he also said no date had been set for a parliamentary debate and that the government had not discussed this.
CETA took effect provisionally in September 2017, with the reduction or removal of tariffs on 98 percent of products, but needs to be ratified by all 28 EU countries. Just one failure to ratify could bring the whole deal down.
According to the EU statistics office Eurostat, Italian goods exports to Canada have increased by 2.1 percent year-on-year in the eight months since CETA provisionally entered into force and its food and animal exports by 11.9 percent.
Asked why Italy would block a deal that boosted exports, Centinaio responded:
""We want to understand with concrete data whether CETA is really advantageous for our country. We have the impression that it is not... We do not have other data. We have assumptions, mostly perceptions from firms, mainly from the agriculture sector.""
The 5-Star/League government, which took office on June 1, has said it will take a hard line on defending Italian speciality foods.
Of the 28 European Union countries, Italy has the most food products with PDO, or Protected Designation of Origin, and PGI, or Protected Geographical Indication, labels.
These include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham. Under CETA, Canada has recognized more than 40 Italian PDO and PGI labels out of a total of over 200.
Centinaio said he wanted to check whether those not covered were exclusively local products that were unlikely to be exported to Canada. If that was not the case, Italy could push to add more.

The United States has raised the stakes in its trade row with China, threatening to slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items.
The fresh threats came only days after both nations slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of each other's goods.
Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau told reporters on Monday the initial tariff list affected around 30 percent of the city's re-exports from China to the United States, totaling HK$83.6 billion.
If the U.S. confirmed the additional list, then HK$130 billion worth of trade would be affected, almost half the re-exports.
""Market sentiment is reversing because exporters are worried about the orders in the second half,"" Yau said. ""Even though we haven't seen a big immediate impact on the corporates yet, we need to be vigilant.""
The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, Dennis Ng, said the biggest concern of its members was a loss of orders, which may become a wider problem in the second half, and some manufacturers may move their factories out of China if necessary.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union told Airbnb on Monday to bring its terms and conditions into line with the bloc's consumer rules or face action by national consumer agencies, after a review of the short-term rental platform found some violations. 
Some of Airbnb's terms and the way it presents its prices breach the bloc's unfair commercial practices directive, the unfair contract terms directive and the regulation on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, the EU executive said.
San Francisco-based Airbnb and similar rental platforms, which help homeowners rent out their homes or rooms for short periods, have grown in popularity in recent years because of their competitive prices in comparison with hotels.
""But popularity cannot be an excuse for not complying with EU consumer rules. Consumers must easily understand ... how much they are expected to pay for the services and have fair rules for example on cancellation of the accommodation by the owner,"" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in a statement.
The company has until the end of August to present its proposals for responding to the criticism which will then be reviewed by the Commission and national consumer authorities. It could face fines if it does not comply with EU rules.
The EU executive said Airbnb should state whether accommodation is offered by a private individual or a professional, provide details of the price in a clear way and modify its terms of service to make them fairer to consumers.
Airbnb did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The issue came to light after national consumer agencies in June examined Airbnb's business practices published in different languages.

Rental platforms have come under fire for driving up property prices and contributing to a housing shortage in Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and other big cities.

The two leaders will have a 90-minute one-on-one meeting, scheduled to start at 1:20PM local time (6:20AM ET), joined only by their interpreters.
They will then be joined by aides for a two-hour expanded meeting and working lunch at the Presidential Palace.
The leaders will cap off their time in Finland with a joint press conference at 4:50PM local time (9:50AM ET).
Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine, while Trump has said he will press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election to the war in Syria. However, neither side expects the one-day summit to yield major policy breakthroughs given the battered state of U.S.-Russia relations.
The meeting will conclude Trump's controversial European visit, during which he harangued NATO allies on their spending commitments and publicly criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy and described the European Union as a ""foe"" of the United States in an interview with CBS News.
2. Bank of America, Netflix Kick Off Busy Week Of Earnings
There are about 60 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, including seven Dow stocks, in what will be the first big week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Analysts have said they are expecting another strong quarter, with earnings growth at around 21%, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, with analysts likely to scrutinize outlook statements to see if companies discuss the impact of Donald Trump's trade policies on future spending plans, input costs and profitability.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are scheduled to report results ahead of today's opening bell. Tech darling Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is on the docket after the close.
3. U.S. Retail Sales In Focus
Monday's calendar features the biggest economic data point of the week.
The Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for June at 8:30AM ET, which should lend further support to the notion that the economy is on solid footing.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.5% last month. Excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.4%.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
A survey on manufacturing activity in New York state and a reading on business inventories in May will fill out the economic data schedule today.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was a shade lower at 94.30.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield inching up to 2.94%.
While no Fed speeches are set to take place today, investors will be gearing up for a testimony Tuesday which will see Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking in front of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee about the state of the economy.
4. Wall Street Set To Open At 5-Month Highs
U.S. stock futures looked set to kick off the week on an upbeat note, with the major indices on track to open at a five-month high, as investors focused on the upcoming corporate earnings season.
At 5:25AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 44 points, or around 0.2%, to 25,047, the S&P 500 futures tacked on 3 points, or roughly 0.1%, to 2,805, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 15 points, or about 0.2%, to 7,408.
U.S. stocks edged higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 hitting a more than five-month high on expectations of solid earnings growth among U.S. firms despite threats of a global trade war.
In Europe, most of the region's major bourses traded slightly above the flatline in quiet mid-morning trade, with the different sectors moving in opposite directions.
Earlier, stocks in Asia fell, following Chinese economic data which suggested that the world’s second largest economy may be losing steam.
China's economy grew 6.7% in the second quarter of the year, a slight slowdown from the first quarter, but in line with analysts’ expectations. There are concerns, however, that upcoming quarters might be impacted by an escalation in a trade war with the U.S.
The Shanghai composite declined around 0.6%.
5. Oil Prices Slip As Markets Eye Supply Increases
Oil prices were lower to start the week, as market focus shifted toward possible supply increases, even as a Norwegian union for workers on offshore oil and gas drilling rigs stepped up a six-day strike.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was down 50 cents, or around 0.7%, at $69.45 a barrel.
Brent crude futures were down 20 cents, or 0.3%, at $75.13 a barrel.
Both benchmarks posted sharp losses last week amid reduced bets on a global crude shortage after Libyan ports resumed export activities. That should allow the return of as much as 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude into international markets.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 05:09AM ET</span>",Race for top ECB supervisor job gets under way,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has advertised for a new bank supervisory chief, looking for an expert to oversee a bloated and inefficient sector that is still weighed down by the legacy of the bloc's debt crisis. 
The job ad https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/careers/vacancies/shared/pdf/ssm.vacnot_ChairSpvBoard.en.pdf?53fe9c2f976c355104f7db5547995f98 published on the ECB website on Monday formally launches the process to replace France's Daniele Nouy, whose five-year term ends on Dec. 31.
Nouy, in the role since 2014, set up the Single Supervisory Mechanism from scratch but struggled at times to push through proposals to clean up the sector in the face of intense lobbying from southern European nations, particularly Italy. 
While no candidate has formally expressed interest, media reports have mentioned European Banking Authority Chair Andrea Enria, ECB supervisor Ignazio Angeloni, Central Bank of Ireland Deputy Governor Sharon Donnery and former Dutch supervisor Jan Sijbrand and potential candidates. 
Although it is up to individuals to make their application, no candidate is likely to succeed without their home government's approval and a direct lobby effort among euro zone members.
In 2017, Nouy's basic salary was 283,488 euros ($331,482), which is the same as the pay of regular ECB board members. 
While Germany could also field a qualified candidate, it is unlikely to do so as that would probably rule out Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann from the race to replace ECB chief Mario Draghi next year since two Germans heading the ECB's two distinct arms would be politically contentious. 
The new supervision chief will have to oversee 118 of the euro zone's biggest lenders with around 21 trillion euros in assets and a still large pool of non-performing loans (NPLs) left from the bloc's debt crisis, which nearly ripped the currency union apart.
Indeed, Nouy has struggled to tackle the problem of soured debt as banks in Italy have pushed back against plans for aggressive action to sell bad loans or build provisions. 
Salvaging a compromise after months of delay, the ECB last week published new guidelines which spelled out that banks with a bigger stock of NPLs would be given more time and no uniform provisioning rules would be imposed.
Bank are also struggling with weak profitability with the sector earning return on equity of just 6 percent in the last quarter of 2017, with many not even earning the cost of their equity. 
Still, lenders have built massive capital buffers, suggesting that they already have adequate reserves to withstand an economic downturn. 
An ECB committee will draw up a shortlist of candidates from the applicants and will make a final proposal to the EU Council in the autumn after consultation with Parliament and the Council, among others.

In an interview with daily La Verita, Savona said Italy should be allowed to spend the equivalent of this year's estimated current account surplus, around 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, on new investments to raise economic growth.
Savona also called for an increase in the powers of the European Central Bank so that it can be ""the lender of last resort"" for the eurozone. He said those who did not agree ""don't want a united Europe.""
Savona said if the EU accepts Italy's proposal to be allowed to spend the 50 billion euros on investments, the boost to growth would generate extra revenues that would allow the government to fund all its main economic reform plans.
He said his proposal had the backing of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the whole government.
Italy's ruling coalition, made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, took office on June 1, promising to slash taxes, increase welfare spending and lower the minimum retirement age.
Savona was the coalition's original pick as economy minister, but was vetoed by the head of state due to Savona's critical views on the euro. In a book published this year he called Italy's entry in the single currency a ""historic mistake.""
Savona said the man who replaced him as Economy Minister, Giovanni Tria, agreed with his proposal.

""The issue is the timing of the operation, not the possibility of activating it,"" Savona said.

The 10 analysts in the Reuters poll gave estimates for June inflation ranging from 0.6 percent to 1.9 percent.
The new government led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, put in office after the May 9 general election, scrapped the 6 percent consumption tax on June 1. It had been in effect for three years.
Economists said the removal of GST likely dampened inflation in June, despite higher transport and food prices during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and subsequent Eid al-Fitr celebrations.
Amid slowing inflation and steady growth, Malaysia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 3.25 percent at a policy meeting on July 11.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 02:43AM ET</span>",EU says China could open its economy if it wishes,"By Christian Shepherd and Michael Martina
BEIJING (Reuters) - China could open its economy if it wishes, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Monday in Beijing, as Beijing comes under growing pressure over its industrial policies amid an escalating trade war with Washington.
Playing host to Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stressed the need to uphold free trade and multilateralism as the United States and China become increasingly mired in a trade dispute, with no sign of negotiations on the horizon. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year – to combat what the U.S says are Beijing's trade abuses.
China has sworn to retaliate at each step.
Long accused of protectionist tactics that make it a difficult place for foreign firms to operate, China is trying to reverse that narrative amid the escalating trade war by approving huge investments, such as a $10 billion petrochemicals project by Germany's BASF (DE:BASFn). 
Juncker, speaking at a joint news briefing with Li and Tusk at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, said that move showed ""if China wishes to open up it can do so. It knows how to open up"". 
Tusk called on China, the United States and other countries, to not start trade wars, and to reform the World Trade Organization so it is equipped to combat forced technology transfers and government subsidies, complaints underpinning Trump's tariffs. 
""We need new rules in the areas of industrial subsidies, intellectual property and forced technology transfers, the reduction of trade costs, as well as a new approach to development and more effective dispute settlement,"" Tusk said. 
""There is still time to prevent conflict and chaos.""
Critics of Beijing's policies say foreign firms are competing with Chinese rivals backed by massive, market-distorting subsidies and government support, issues not sufficiently addressed under WTO rules. 
Both China and Europe have stressed the need for trade differences to be addressed through the WTO, but the United States has said China's unfair policies are too urgent and too big for the trade body to handle. 
""BEST FRIENDS""
The China-EU meeting is expected to produce a modest communique affirming the commitment of both sides to the multilateral trading system. Leaders failed to find sufficient consensus for a joint statement after meetings in 2016 and 2017.
Li said the two sides agreed to exchange market offers for the first time, which could reinvigorate long-running investment treaty talks.
European envoys say they have sensed a greater urgency from China since last year to find like-minded countries willing to stand up against Trump's ""America First"" policies. 
China's ambassador to the EU on Sunday wrote in Chinese state media that the focus of the annual China-EU leaders meeting would be on how the two sides could become a ""standard of stability"" amid the ""din of unilateralism and protectionism"".
Li said China wanted to improve the authority of the WTO, but did not elaborate. He reiterated pledges that China would significantly improve market access for foreign companies, reduce tariffs and seek more balanced trade with the EU.
""Together speaking out to protect free trade will send a positive signal to the world,"" Li said. 
The EU, while sharing Trump's concern over Chinese trade abuses if not his prescription of tariffs, has largely rebuffed efforts by China to pressure it into a strong stance against Trump.
There is deep scepticism in the EU about China's actual commitment to opening its market further, as well as concern that it seeks to divide the world's largest trading bloc with its economic influence in Eastern Europe.
Nonetheless, European officials suggest that Trump, who has also targeted Europe with tariffs, has created a window of opportunity to show that EU-China relations can be a bulwark for global trade.

On the eve of his meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin, Trump on Sunday rattled allies once more by labeling the European Union a ""foe"" with regard to trade. Tusk on Twitter called it ""fake news"", saying America and the EU are ""best friends"".

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is expected to report a modest slowdown in second-quarter economic growth on Monday, as the government's efforts to tackle debt risks crimp activity and a trade war with the United States threatens exports.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect gross domestic product (GDP) to have grown 6.7 percent year-on-year in the April-June period, cooling from the first quarter's 6.8 percent expansion.
The world's second-largest economy has already felt the pinch from a crackdown on riskier lending that has driven up corporate borrowing costs, promoting the central bank to pump out more cash by cutting reserve requirements for lenders.
Recent data have started to show signs of fatigue as credit expansion slowed and domestic demand ranging from government-funded infrastructure investment to consumer spending looked to be softening.
A better-than-expected GDP reading would likely provide some relief for Chinese stocks and the yuan , which have been roiled in recent weeks as the China-U.S. trade tensions intensified. 
Data on Friday showed China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as its overall exports grew at a solid pace, a result that could further inflame the bitter trade dispute with Washington.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the stakes in its trade row with China, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items. The fresh threats came only days after both nations slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of each other's goods.
MODEST SLOWDOWN
Analysts expect the trade tussle between the world's top two economies to take a toll on China's export machine in the second half of 2018, dragging on overall economic growth.
""Looking ahead, we think export growth will cool in the coming months as US tariffs start to bite alongside a broader softening in global demand,"" analysts at Capital Economists said in a note.
""That said, the slowdown may not be abrupt as some fear given that these drags should be partly offset by a weaker renminbi (yuan).""
China's economy is likely to experience a mild slowdown in the second half of the year as financial market risks become ""obvious"" and demand is expected to decline, official think tank State Information Center (SIC) recently said.
Faced with a slowdown in domestic demand and the potential fallout from the trade war, Chinese policymakers are likely to step up policy support for the economy and soften their stance on deleveraging.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), which has cut banks' reserve requirements three times this year, has recently replaced its use of the term ""deleveraging"" with ""structural deleveraging"", a change that suggests less harsh curbs on debt.
""Given that much of the current downward pressure on the economy is coming from tightening financial regulations and credit, especially on local government financing and infrastructure, we think the government will likely adjust the pace of domestic tightening as a first reaction to the now escalating trade war,"" UBS China economist Tao Wang said in a note.
Nomura economists said in a recent note they expected the PBoC to deliver at least one more RRR cut before year-end, likely by 100 basis points and increase direct funding to the real economy via other liquidity injection tools, such as the supplementary lending facility.
China releases second quarter GDP on Monday, along with June industrial output, retail sales, property sales and
investment, and fixed asset investment data.
Economists in the poll estimated GDP grew 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, versus 1.4 percent in the first

quarter.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",SWFs face tougher dealmaking environment as protectionism grows,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign investors are facing a tougher environment for dealmaking as rising protectionism threatens to curb inward investment and stunt trade, suggesting private market activity may have plateaued, a co-author of a report out on Monday said.
In recent years sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have ramped up their exposure to real assets, snapping up iconic skyscrapers in London and Manhattan, luxury hotels and multi-year concessions for Australian ports.
The aim was to tap the ""illiquidity premium"" on offer for investors able to tie up capital for longer as an alternative to low-yielding government bonds.
But Bernardo Bortolotti, director of the sovereign investment lab at Bocconi University and co-author of a report showing a slowdown in SWF real estate and infrastructure investment in 2017, said the high watermark for private dealmaking had passed.
This is partly because some Middle East funds have rebalanced their portfolios towards more liquid assets such as equities to accommodate drawdowns from cash-strapped governments needing to plug budget gaps.
But it's also because the United States is locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with its key trading partners, potentially reducing trade and global economic growth.
Bortolotti warned that if exports fell, SWF growth rates and activity would also slow: ""They still have $6 trillion-plus to deploy but we have a structural break in the accumulation of assets,"" he said.
""We are at a turning point ... Unless Asia can create an area of regional free trade to replace the intercontinental flows then the same issues that are emerging now in the Gulf could also emerge in Asia.""
In July, Singapore's GIC, a big sovereign investor in real assets, said it expected lower long-term returns in an uncertain investment climate. This echoed comments from peer Temasek which is looking to temper the pace of its investments as trade tensions ratchet up. China's CIC also expressed concerns.
According to the SWF investment activity report produced in association with the International Forum of SWFs (IFSWF), the number of property deals fell to 42 in 2017 from 77 a year earlier while infrastructure investments fell to 28 from 33.
Combined deal value fell to $23.2 billion in 2017 from $25 billion.
SWFs are finding it more difficult to find suitable properties in the commercial and office space - traditionally favored targets - as more investors have entered the market, driving up prices.
""There's more competition from Chinese insurers and large Asian institutions looking at core real estate in London and New York,"" said Victoria Barbary, IFSWF director of strategy and communications.
Growing protectionism is also likely to stymie foreign direct investment in strategic sectors, Bortolotti said.
""Investing in U.S. infrastructure will be very difficult now from a political standpoint - any kind of investment from China will be more carefully scrutinized, and that is spilling over into Europe.""
The U.S. wants to beef up the powers of its Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review transactions for national security risks.
As a result, SWFs are turning to Asia and Latin America, often investing through tie-ups with government entities to mitigate risk. In 2017, they completed 17 direct investments in emerging market infrastructure, worth $3.8 billion, versus 11 deals in developed markets, worth $4.2 billion.
""Working with a local partner, which may be a sovereign fund or strategic fund, makes these investments a lot more attractive,"" said Barbary.

771,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Southeast Asia's Growth Could Be the Trade War's Next Casualty,"(Bloomberg) -- For Southeast Asia’s biggest economies, 2018 wasn’t supposed to be like this.
If a widening trade war wasn’t enough to contend with, a global wave of policy tightening, strong oil prices and domestic politics are also weighing on growth prospects for the region. Policy makers are rewriting economic strategies as volatility surges, in some cases putting greater emphasis on currency stability or even structural changes.
“With trade war risks now materializing, this suggests stronger headwinds for exports,” said Tamara Henderson, an economist at Bloomberg Economics in Singapore. “Investment, already buffeted by tighter monetary policy, is also likely to be a casualty.”
Election uncertainty in Indonesia and Thailand, as well as questions around the new Malaysian government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, could add to investor angst in the region for the rest of 2018, said Henderson.
Here’s how the growth outlooks for Southeast Asia’s six biggest economies are being tested:
Indonesia
Policy makers in Indonesia have been working to temper expectations around growth as they’ve turned their focus to promoting financial stability amid a slumping rupiah. A widening current-account deficit and investment outflows are keeping more rate hikes on the cards for 2018, and the government’s pledges for lower spending and import curbs will probably damp growth further. Bank Indonesia’s next decision is on Thursday.
Malaysia
Uncertainty abounds in Malaysia, where a two-month-old government is only starting to give a clearer picture of economic policy. A new sales tax planned for later this year could slow consumer spending, and with more infrastructure projects on ice, investment and government spending outlooks are also clouded.
While Bank Negara Malaysia left its benchmark interest rate on hold last week, analysts have been trimming predictions for an increase amid the limp growth outlook and weak inflation. A more dovish stance from the central bank would buck regional and global trends.
Philippines
Inflation shooting far beyond the ceiling of its target range is giving the Philippines central bank some nerves that overheating might already have set in. The rapid price gains also could take some shine off the otherwise solid economic growth, particularly if the central bank is forced to move faster on raising interest rates.
A third hike for this year now looks more likely for the Aug. 9 decision.
Singapore
While economists see steady growth for Singapore in 2018, the second half may stumble. The city-state’s recent property-market curbs could damp sentiment and translate to crimped consumer spending. Singapore may also struggle to buoy the confidence of manufacturers, whose expectations were already lowered after a stronger-than-expected 2017 for global trade.
“We had projected slower growth in the second half, but the negative trade developments are increasing the downside risks,” economists at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc in Singapore said in a research note last week. “New export orders within the PMI readings have also decelerated.”
Thailand
The Thai economy is something of a regional outlier, with the first quarter’s 4.8 percent annual growth the fastest in five years. Inflation has only recently broken into the lower end of the central bank’s 1-4 percent target band, allowing policy makers some room to hold interest rates near the record low they’ve remained at since 2015.
“Economic growth in Thailand should remain reasonably strong in the near term, but a slowdown in global growth and rising political uncertainty suggest the recent upturn will run out of steam by next year,” economists at Capital Economics Ltd. said in a research note last week.
Thailand, run by a military government since a coup in May 2014, is expected to have an election early next year.
Vietnam
Given that Vietnam’s trade as a share of gross domestic product is about 200 percent, its economy is particularly sensitive to any worsening tensions that threaten global supply chains. The economy will be especially attuned to China’s growth slowdown for knock-on effects in regional trade, and has also felt the weight of rising U.S. interest rates.
Growth eased in the second quarter from the previous three months on reduced mining output and state investment. The government expects a further slowing in the second half and is adding measures to boost business, the General Statistics Office said last month.

772,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Banks Are Facing a Squeeze From Trump's Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- For banks that finance trade in Asia, the tariff war between the U.S. and China couldn’t come at a worse time.
Lenders globally have faced declining revenue from the $9 trillion business of funding cross-border commerce for five years running, thanks to a drop in margins that is persisting in Asia. Now, as the trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies intensifies, the risk is that volumes decline, worsening prospects for the top banks in the region including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc.
“It’s going to be a very challenging story, especially for those in Asia who are trying to grow the business,” said Eric Li, research director at Coalition Development Ltd. in London. “There are a lot of traditional players chasing the shrinking pie.”
The U.S. last week pushed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on a further $200 billion of Chinese products by releasing a list of targeted products, President Donald Trump’s latest salvo in a conflict that China calls the “the largest trade war in economic history.” While some bankers say it’s too early to determine the impact of the dispute on trade flows, the implications for lenders in the industry could be serious if shipments weaken.
Read this timeline of the events leading to a trade war
“As growth prospects for trade finance are inextricably linked to the volume of merchandise trade, the financial implications of an all-out trade war, compared with protectionist bluster, are enormous,” said Olivier Paul, head of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce’s banking commission.
Global revenue for trade finance banking, which includes import and export letters of credit and supply-chain finance, fell in 2017 to $26.6 billion, the lowest level in at least eight years, Coalition data show, and Li expects another decline this year.
Asia is a key market for the industry, accounting for about a third of trade finance revenue worldwide. Yet margins have been shrinking as global banks face growing competition from lenders in Japan, Australia and Singapore, Li said. Rising compliance costs are also hampering margins in the region, which seem to be improving elsewhere, according to a May report by the International Chamber of Commerce.
Lenders across Asia are now talking with clients to assess the implications of the trade spat on their business and wider supply chains and it’s too soon to decide how to react, according to bankers interviewed by Bloomberg. Concerns include whether manufacturers will need to move factories to countries not affected by the tariffs and whether demand for goods will weaken.
A trade war may lead to the redrawing of supply chains that could hurt the credit quality of some borrowers, said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance Management in London. “This would create winners and losers and result in higher potential credit losses in segments of the commercial loan book,” he said, adding that tariffs would increase credit stress on Chinese exporters to the U.S.

Still, the direct hit to bank earnings may be manageable, given that the already low-margin business tends to account for a small portion of their profits. At HSBC -- the industry leader in Asia last year, according to Greenwich Associates -- global trade and receivables finance accounted for about 13 percent of commercial banking operating income in the first quarter of this year.
Despite the escalating dispute, HSBC remains bullish on the outlook for trade.
“It’s too early to predict whether trade tensions will impact client activity and trade flows,” said Ajay Sharma, regional head of global trade and receivables finance for Asia Pacific. “Long-term fundamentals of trade remain strong,” driven by strong economic growth in the region, he said.
Representatives for Standard Chartered weren’t available to comment.
Any realignment of trade ties could present opportunities to banks outside of the U.S., Dyer said. Eleven countries signed up to a trans-Pacific trade deal this year even after the U.S. withdrew, while China is working on another regional agreement.
“The imposition of significant tariffs would likely encourage greater inter-Asia trade integration and increase economic and political cooperation between Asia and Europe,” he said.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used a speech to members of Rouhani's cabinet to call for support for the government and action against alleged financial crime to ease popular concerns fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from world powers' 2015 deal with Iran on its nuclear program.
The likely return of U.S. economic sanctions has triggered a rapid fall of Iran's currency and protests by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers, and a public outcry over alleged price gouging and profiteering.
Khamenei said ""the government's economic team is the axis of all activity in the country, calling all the bodies to coordinate with it,"" the website reported. ""(He) advised state radio and TV to reflect a correct image of government activities."" 
Hardline conservatives close to Khamenei control powerful bodies including state media which has often criticized the government of Rouhani, a pragmatist who has long sought more open economic relations with the outside world. 
""I strongly believe that if the government takes the necessary measures, it will be able to overcome problems and defeat the U.S. conspiracy,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a meeting with Rouhani and his cabinet, according to his website.
Khamenei called for strengthening the private sector while taking ""decisive action"" against economic crime such as money-laundering and smuggling of goods, blamed on those profiteering from the economic crisis in the country.
Separately, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said special prosecutors would swiftly deal with economic crime, including profiteering from foreign exchange and gold dealings, illegal imports of luxury cars and price gouging on imported goods such as mobile phones, state media said.
In late December, demonstrations which began over economic hardship spread to more than 80 Iranian cities and towns. At least 25 people died in the ensuing unrest, the biggest expression of public discontent in almost a decade.

Demonstrators initially vented their anger over high prices and alleged corruption, but the protests took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Khamenei to step down.

The Handelsblatt report came after the central bank, the Bundesbank, last month cut its growth forecast for this year and said trade and political concerns had made the outlook for Germany's still robust economy more uncertain.
In June, the Bundesbank forecast growth of 2.0 percent this year, far lower than the 2.5 percent it expected last December.
Weidmann told the cabinet to prepare for harder times, Handelsblatt reported attendees of the July 6 meeting as saying after the central banker joined the session as a guest.

Weidmann said the government would have to step in when the next downturn hits as it will take so long for the European Central Bank's monetary policy to normalize that it would have little scope to act, the paper cited its sources as saying.

777,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things To Watch This Week,"Investing.com - Geopolitics could hang over the market in the coming week, as investors look ahead to an unprecedented meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.
The week ahead also marks the first big week of the second-quarter earnings season on Wall Street, with names like Netflix, Goldman Sachs,  IBM  and Microsoft set to report.
There will also be important testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who appears Tuesday and Wednesday before congressional panels on the economy and monetary policy.
Several important economic reports also expected, with retail sales on Monday topping the list.
Elsewhere, in Asia, China is slated to release what will be closely watched second-quarter growth data, amid warnings from analysts that the recent trade dispute with the U.S. could drag on economic activity.
Market focus is also largely attuned to the next potential steps of the U.S.-China trade conflict. The U.S. threatened 10% tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports last week. However, a lack of response from China to these levies so far has assuaged some fears of conflict escalation.
Trade-war fears have been simmering for months, keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies having an impact on economic growth.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
1. Trump-Putin Summit 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin hold their first summit in Helsinki, Finland on Monday.
Neither side expects the one-day summit to yield major policy breakthroughs given the battered state of U.S.-Russia relations, which are languishing at their lowest ebb since the Cold War.
Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine, while Trump has said he will press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election to the war in Syria.
On Friday, some lawmakers pressed Trump to cancel the summit after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russians for interfering in the general election.
Meanwhile, European leaders will be watching the outcome closely, especially after Trump called Germany a ""captive"" of Russia at a testy NATO summit in Belgium last week, due to its plans for a major new gas pipeline.
2. U.S. Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Into High Gear
There are about 60 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, including seven Dow stocks, in what will be the first big week of the second-quarter earnings season.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report Monday, along with tech darling Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Tuesday sees Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) post results.
On Wednesday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) report earnings.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are on the docket Thursday.
Finally, corporate results from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) round up the week on Friday.



Analysts have said they are expecting another strong quarter, with earnings growth at around 21%, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, with analysts likely to scrutinize outlook statements to see if companies discuss the impact of Trump's trade policies on future spending plans, input costs and profitability.
3. Fed Chair Powell Testifies
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC.
Powell is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET Tuesday. On Wednesday, he will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10AM ET.
Text of the testimony will be released 90 minutes before he starts speaking.
Powell's comments will be monitored closely for further clues on when and how fast the Fed will raise interest rates.
The Fed's semi-annual report on monetary policy, sent to Congress last Friday, pointed to ""solid"" U.S. economic growth and reiterated its plans to continue raising interest rates gradually.
4. U.S. Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for June at 8:30AM ET Monday.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.4% last month, moderating from a gain of 0.8% in May.
Excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.4%, after a 0.9% rise a month earlier.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
Besides the retail sales report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on building permits, housing starts, industrial production, as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions.
On the central bank front, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book will be in focus.
The U.S. central bank hiked interest rates last month for the second time this year and has projected two more rate increases by year-end.
Traders are currently pricing in around an 85% chance of a rate hike in September, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a fourth rate hike by December was seen at about 55%.
5. China Q2 GDP
China will be the first major economy to report second-quarter growth data when it publishes its GDP numbers at around 0200GMT on Monday (10:00PM ET Sunday).
The report is expected to show the world's second-largest economy grew 6.7% in the April-June period, moderating slightly from growth of 6.8% in the first quarter.
The Asian nation will also publish data on June industrial production, fixed asset investment and retail sales along with the GDP report.
China, the world's largest exporter, has so far escaped any major blow to its foreign trade sector despite rising trade tensions with the U.S.
Washington and Beijing appeared increasingly headed toward open trade conflict after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U.S. complaints over Chinese industrial policies, lack of market access in China and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>","Prepare for no-deal Brexit, German business groups tell members","BERLIN (Reuters) - German business groups have urged their members to step up preparations for a hard Brexit that would see Britain crash out of the European Union next year without negotiating a deal.
British Prime Minister Theresa May secured a cabinet agreement last week for ""a business-friendly"" proposal to leave the EU, aimed at spurring stalled Brexit talks. But the hard-won compromise has come under fire from within her governing Conservative Party and may yet fall flat with EU negotiators.
""Even if the British government is moving now, companies must plan for the scenario in which there is no agreement,"" Joachim Lang, managing director of the BDI, Germany's biggest industry lobby, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
Thilo Brodtmann, managing director of the VDMA engineering association, told the same paper: ""It is urgent to prepare for Brexit and to expect the worst case scenario.""
German industry is concerned about increased friction in trade with Britain after Brexit. Britain is the second-biggest export market for German car manufacturers.
But Lang said some German businesses were only just starting to analyze what Brexit would mean for them, adding: ""At least that has moved us forward from a few months ago.""
Brodtmann warned engineering firms against being lured into a sense of complacency by stable business in Britain now.
""Brexit is such a big nonsense that many companies still hope it will not be that bad because the EU will not allow a hard landing for the economy. But I can only warn against that,"" he said.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Norway renews NATO spending pledge as Trump's defense chief visits,"By Phil Stewart and Alister Doyle
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway, described by U.S. President Donald Trump as NATO's ""eyes and ears"" in the north, recommitted itself to lifting its defense spending to meet NATO targets during talks on Saturday with Trump's defense secretary.
But Norwegian leaders appeared to stop short of setting a new timetable for meeting spending goals, even after Trump's claims to have won assurances from NATO allies during heated discussions this week in Brussels.
""Norway is committed to the two percent goal in NATO,"" Norwegian Defense Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen told reporters in a prepared statement, standing alongside U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who praised Norway's role in the alliance.
Bakke-Jensen added that Norway hiked defense spending by four percent in real terms since 2013 and would ""continue substantial increases in spending also in the coming years.""
Norway is considered one of America's most valuable European allies, helping gather intelligence on Russia's maritime military activities, partnering with U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East and buying advanced U.S. weaponry, including stealth fighter jets.
But the oil-rich nation only spends about $6.5 billion per year on defense, or about 1.6 percent of gross domestic product -- below NATO's two percent target by 2024. 
That earned it a rebuke from Trump, who wrote a letter on June 19 to Norway saying it was the only NATO ally sharing a border with Russia that lacked ""a credible plan"" to spend two percent of its GDP on defense, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. 
""NATO'S SENTINEL"" 
Trump acknowledged political pressures in Norway but warned it would become ""increasingly difficult to justify to American citizens why some countries continue to fail to meet our shared collective security commitments.""
By contrast, Mattis praised Norway after talks with Bakke-Jensen and Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide.
He said Oslo's recommitment to the two percent goal was heartening. ""We are stronger today than we were a month ago or a year ago because of the deliverables that came out of that (NATO) summit,"" he said after meeting Soereide.
And he praised ""Norway's leadership in the Nordic region and especially up in the Arctic where you serve as NATO's sentinel ... You are definitely contributing beyond your weight class,"" he said.
Soereide praised Mattis as a ""star in NATO.""
During closed-door talks at the NATO summit this week, Trump warned that if European governments did not spend more on defense, the United States ""would have to look to go its own way,"" sources told Reuters. Trump has subsequently said he was satisfied with spending commitments made in Brussels.
But the U.S. president, who will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday, says allies must share more of what he calls an unfair burden on U.S. taxpayers in funding an alliance focused on discouraging pressure from a resurgent Moscow.
MORE U.S. MARINES
Norway is a founding member of NATO, which was created in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union. 
Oslo has grown increasingly concerned about Russia since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, while adding that it does not regard its much larger neighbor as a direct threat.
Critics say Trump's laser-focus on allies' spending understates the broader importance of key allies, particularly countries like Norway.
Norway plays a vital role gathering intelligence on Russian submarines and other maritime training activity. Much of Russia's naval training occurs in international waters near Norway, giving it a privileged perch for observation.
Norway will also soon play host to one of NATO's biggest exercises in decades, and possibly Norway's biggest exercise ever, in October and November when some 40,000 forces are expected to arrive in the country. The drill will simulate NATO efforts to help it repel an attacking force.
Mattis said the exercise ""will demonstrate that the U.S. and all of NATO stand with Norway as we seek to maintain peace and stability in Europe.""
Norway, which has a 196-kilometer (122-mile) border with Russia, is also preparing to host up to 700 U.S. Marines starting next year, compared with 330 presently, who carry out harsh winter training. 
The additional numbers will be based closer to the border with Russia in the Inner Troms region in the Norwegian Arctic, rather than in central Norway.
Russia's embassy in Oslo said the additional Marines, who rotate in and out of Norway, ""makes Norway less predictable and could cause growing tensions, triggering an arms race and destabilizing the situation in northern Europe.""

""We see it as clearly unfriendly, and it will not remain free of consequence,"" the embassy said.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>","Fed emphasizes 'solid' U.S economic growth, repeats gradual approach","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Friday pointed to ""solid"" U.S. economic growth during the first half of the year in its semi-annual report to Congress, where it also reiterated that it expected to continue to raise interest rates gradually.
It is the Fed's second submission to lawmakers since Chairman Jerome Powell took the helm of the Fed in early February. He is scheduled to answer questions on it before lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Details of the 63-page report were consistent with the Fed's current outlook detailed at its policy meetings, which is that strong economic growth and low unemployment require rate rises but that a lack of severe inflation pressures means they can remain gradual. Financial markets were little moved following the release of the report.
""Over the first half of this year, overall economic activity appears to have expanded at a solid pace,"" the Fed said, adding that the economy continues to be supported by favorable consumer and business sentiment, past increases in household wealth, solid economic growth abroad, and accommodative domestic financial conditions.
As such the Fed ""expects that further gradual increases"" in interest rates would be appropriate as it strives to continue to nurture an economic expansion that is now the second-longest on record.
The Fed said that the Trump administration's package of tax cuts had likely contributed to a rebound in consumer spending from a sluggish start to the year and will likely provide a moderate boost to economic growth this year.
The relatively rosy picture of the U.S. economy was also referenced by Powell in an interview on Thursday in which he said he believes the U.S. economy remains in a ""really good place"" with recent government tax and spending programs set to boost gross domestic product for perhaps three years.
The Fed has raised interest rates seven times since it began a tightening cycle back in December 2015 and last lifted its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point in mid June. The Fed sees another two rate hikes by year end.
TRADE TENSIONS AFFECTING MARKETS
The central bank barely weighed in on the potential impact of the Trump administration's protectionist trade policies, but noted that the uncertainty around them was a concern to financial markets.
Powell said on Thursday that sustained high tariffs on products and services could hurt the economy and a number of policymakers have fretted that trade disputes with Europe, Canada, Mexico and China could slow business investment.
""What's going on in the short run certainly isn’t positive,"" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in an interview with Reuters on Friday, adding he would need to downgrade his outlook if tensions between the United States and its trade partners escalate.
Trump has imposed or threatened tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and riled key allies by imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Europe, Canada and Mexico. He has also threatened to tax European car imports.
""We don't see anything too surprising,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York, of the report. ""In short, Fed officials anticipate continued gradual tightening, assuming no major fallout from trade tensions."" 
Elsewhere in the report, policymakers once again flagged that wage growth has been weaker than they would have expected given the current unemployment rate of 4 percent.
Wage gains have been ""moderate,"" the report said, likely held down by weak productivity, and it highlighted the possibility that there could still be some further slack in the labor market, with more prime-age workers poised to enter the workforce ""if labor demand remains strong.""
The Fed showed little concern about financial stability, saying Treasury markets were broadly stable and there was minimal evidence of liquidity pressures. However, it noted valuations were elevated for some assets and that an economic slowdown could amplify vulnerabilities for lower-rated corporates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An escalation of U.S. trade tariffs would harm the economy's prospects, according to a Federal Reserve official who is making it his business to raise the alarm with lawmakers and government officials. 
""What's going on in the short-run certainly isn't positive, but for me it isn't sufficient yet – yet – to materially change my outlook,"" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Still, he said, he would need to downgrade his outlook if tensions between the U.S. and its trade partners escalate. Even though the Fed's job is not to set trade policy, it must react to it, he said. 
""I'm not doing my job if we don't call out this trade analysis,"" to the public, Republican and Democratic policymakers, and to appointed and elected officials, he said. ""It is also part of my job to call out relevant issues that affect economic growth in the United States, even if they are not in the purview of the Fed."" (For highlights from the interview see) 
The Trump administration earlier this week again raised the stakes in its tit-for-tat trade war with China, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. U.S. trade disputes are also escalating with Europe, Canada and Mexico that could slow business investment at home. 
Kaplan, whose district heavily relies on exports to Mexico, said this is already having a ""chilling effect"" on capital expenditures plans and is hurting, for example, soybean shipments and companies reliant on aluminum. Longer-term impacts like currency fluctuations and geopolitical instability could be even worse, he said.
For now, Kaplan, who already leans dovish on monetary policy, continues to expect one more interest rate hike this year and a bit more tightening next year. And if tariffs expand to more goods or North American automobiles in particular, he said, ""obviously that would cause me to rethink."" 
The U.S. central bank is careful not to overstep its inflation and employment mandates into fiscal decisions like trade. A Fed report to Congress on Friday barely addressed the impact of the Trump administration's protectionist policies aside from noting that uncertainty was a concern to markets.
Yet a Reuters review of Fed chair Jerome Powell's public calendar showed that in his first four months as head of the U.S. central bank, he spent more time with lawmakers and White House advisers than did his predecessor, Janet Yellen.
In an interview with radio show Marketplace on Thursday, Powell said: ""I'm going to wear the carpets of Capitol Hill out by walking those halls and meeting with members"" to explain Fed decisions and respond to concerns. 

Kaplan said it was yet too soon to predict how trade policy will unfold. ""I still have as a possibility if not a probability that we look back two years from now, we'll look back on this period as rhetoric and some actions but this ultimately won't intensify,"" he said. ""But I don't know.""

782,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 
1/TRADE WAR GAMES 
China releases quarterly GDP data next week and it should make interesting reading now that the first salvos have been exchanged in a trade war with the United States. 
It is expected to show growth easing very marginally to 6.7 percent -- no big deal of course and perhaps even a positive if it is part of China's multi-year drive to rein in over-zealous credit expansion and force discipline in less-regulated parts of the banking industry. 
But the broader backdrop is the simmering trade tensions. Economists suspect the direct impact from the two sets of U.S. tariffs aimed at Beijing -- the $50 bln underway and another set of targeted tariffs on $200 bln of imports -- could drag China’s GDP down by 0.3 percentage points in the longer run.
It comes too after data on Friday showed that China enjoyed its biggest ever trade surplus in dollar terms with the United States last month, and following a 6 percent fall in the yuan since late March. 
(GRAPHIC: China's trade has limited role in GDP - https://reut.rs/2NPd9Ke)
2/FLAT OUT
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on July 17. Powell's testimony will be closely watched as the Fed tries to navigate towards higher interest rates at a pace that keeps inflation under control but without going so far or fast that it slows the economy. 
Already, investors have been raising red flags about the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is at its flattest in nearly 11 years and at risk of inversion. An inverted yield curve involves short-term interest rates rising above long rates, which is typically a precursor of recession as it reflects tightening monetary policy. 
Powell’s last response on the yield curve was: ""It’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles,"" before suggesting that this time was different. Investors will see if he has changed his tune.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. yield curve - https://tmsnrt.rs/2LbMVQJ) 
3/UNFINNISHED BUSINESS
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin hold their first summit in Helsinki on Monday.
Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine, while Trump has said he will press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election to the war in Syria.
European leaders will be watching the outcome closely, especially after Trump called Germany a ""captive"" of Russia at a testy NATO summit in Belgium, due to its plans for a major new gas pipeline.
EU chiefs have their own plans too. Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk head to China on Monday for meetings with its leaders where there might be a show of unity against Trump's trade war maneuvers.
(GRAPHIC: Russian rouble vs the dollar - https://reut.rs/2NMkASB)
4/EUROPE'S FINAL COUNTDOWN
Europe's second-quarter corporate earnings season begins in earnest next week with analysts predicting robust average growth of 8.1 percent year-on-year. 
The figures will be heavily flattered by the energy sector, where profits have been turbo-charged by the near 50 percent leap in oil prices over the last year. 
To show just how good it has been, oil and gas firms are expected to report earnings growth of 72 percent, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Stripping that out would see overall European estimates drop to more modest 2.9 percent. 
The 8.1 percent headline figure is also well below the 20.9 percent growth expected from U.S. earnings season which is already into its stride. But as in the United States, investors will be watching for any signs that trade war worries have dented confidence, particularly if firms delay capital expenditure plans. 
Those that will set the tone next week include industrial firms  Sandvik  (ST:SAND) and SKF (ST:SKFb), tech firms SAP (DE:SAPG) and ASML (AS:ASML) and miners BHP Billiton (L:BLT) and  Anglo American  (L:AAL), which both report sales figures.
(GRAPHIC: Stoxx 600 Q2 earnings IBES - https://reut.rs/2JloG0q)
5/LIRA UNDER PRESSURE
Turkey's new finance minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of the country's President Tayyip Erdogan, is expected to travel to Argentina next week for the G20 finance ministers meeting on Friday.
The trip will be his first international outing since Erdogan gave him the job as one of his first moves when he got his new powers as executive president.
Turkey's lira crashed to a record low after that decision and markets will be watching Albayrak's performance in Buenos Aires closely. Any sign of a slip up likely to crank up the pressure on the lira ahead of Turkey's next central bank meeting on July 24.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>",Italy says it won't ratify EU-Canada trade deal; Canada plays down threat,"By Alberto Sisto and Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Italy will not ratify the European Union's free trade agreement with Canada, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday, although Canadian officials played down the threat to the accord, which mostly took effect last year.
""Soon CETA (the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) will arrive in parliament and this majority will reject it and it will not ratify it,"" Di Maio said at a farmers' association gathering in Rome.
""If so much as one Italian official ... continues to defend treaties like CETA, they will be removed,"" added Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which governs the country with the right-wing League.
The CETA accord has been provisionally in effect since September. It needs to be approved by all 28 EU member states to fully come into force, and can theoretically be scuppered altogether if an EU member country formally notifies Brussels that it has permanently rejected it. 
But Canada says 98 percent of the tariff and trade barrier reductions under the agreement have already taken effect. A Canadian government source played down the Italian remarks, saying they reflected domestic politics and the challenges of managing a coalition of right- and left-wing parties.
""We are engaged but do not plan on escalating in any way an issue that has more to do with ‎(Italian politics) than a fundamental issue with the 2 percent of CETA left to be ratified,"" said the source, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the situation.
The 5-Star/League government, which took office on June 1, vows to take a hard line to defend Italian speciality foods.
Of the 28 European Union countries, Italy has the most food products with PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) labels.
These include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham. Under CETA, Canada has recognized more than 40 Italian PDO and PGI labels out of a total of 292.
CETA has already removed tariffs from a large number of goods and widened access to Canadian beef in Europe and EU cheese and wine in Canada.
""WRONG AND RISKY""
The CETA ratification has not yet been scheduled for debate by the Italian parliament and will certainly not be discussed before the August summer recess.
When giving their backing in October 2016, the EU states said that CETA's provisional application would continue, unless its ratification failed ""permanently and definitively"" because of a constitutional court ruling or after formal notification from an EU government.
Apart from the small fraction of barriers that remain up, an investment dispute settlement mechanism also will not take effect unless the treaty is fully ratified.
Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of trade think-tank ECIPE, said Italy did pose a significant threat to CETA, but the Commission could ultimately take the matter to court, arguing that the EU could continue to apply all parts of the agreement aside from investment dispute settlement.
CETA supporters say it will increase trade between the partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($14 billion) a year and Canada's by C$12 billion ($9 billion).
Some EU farm associations and critics have expressed concerns about the threat of rapidly rising pork and beef imports from Canada. 
Italian agricultural lobby Coldiretti has called CETA ""wrong and risky"" for the country.
CETA is not the first deal Italy has called into question. It delayed the a trade deal with South Korea over concerns it would affect Italy's motor industry. A dispute over Australian duties on Italian tinned tomatoes also undermined initial trade talks between Europe and Australia. However, the country did last week back a planned EU trade deal with Japan.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe sounded a note of caution about raising interest rates on Friday, saying there was limited evidence that wages were rising as fast as the BoE forecast earlier this year.
Weak economic growth in the first three months of 2018 increasingly looked to be down to bad weather and ""very material"" uncertainty about Brexit was not a reason on its own to delay raising rates, Cunliffe said.
Sterling inched higher against the dollar after his remarks.
However, Cunliffe -- who voted against the BoE's last rate rise in November -- said policymakers needed to be wary of ""false dawns"" promising wage growth, which has disappointed before.
Faster increases in pay are central to the BoE's forecast that domestic price pressures will keep inflation above target unless it raises rates.
""Looking to the medium term, there remains a case for a little 'stodginess' yet,"" Cunliffe said in a speech, referring to advice given in 1999 by former U.S. Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder that central banks should be cautious about raising rates at uncertain economic times.
Most economists polled by Reuters expect the BoE to raise rates again after its next meeting in August, for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis.
Cunliffe said the economy seemed to be growing about as fast as the BoE predicted in May. But wages appeared to be rising by about 2.5-3 percent a year, not the 3 percent annual rate the BoE had forecast.
""We may still be underestimating supply in the labor market,"" Cunliffe told an audience of business representatives in Kendal, northwest England.
""(This) implies a bias to needing a little more confirmation at each stage that the supply side is evolving as we have forecast – a somewhat higher burden of proof that I hope will diminish as we learn more,"" he added.
Cunliffe said he would assess the evidence on domestic inflation pressures at August's meeting, and that the central bank had not taken ""a stopped approach"" to raising rates.
However, he said policymakers should not rule out a recovery in weak productivity growth which would take some steam out of inflation pressures, reducing the need for higher rates.
In addition, there was no case for pre-emptive increases in rates to give the BoE greater scope to cut them in a downturn, as unnecessarily high borrowing costs would damage the economy, Cunliffe said.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",China fiscal policy has 'ample room' to support economy: central bank research head,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's fiscal policy has ""ample room"" to support the economy, the central bank's chief researcher said in an opinion column on Friday, adding that the policy has not been active enough.
China's budget deficit goal this year of 2.6 percent indicates a contractionary fiscal policy and this year's actual deficit ratio should be higher than last year's 3 percent, Xu Zhong, the research head at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), wrote for the financial media website Wallstreetcn.com.
Chinese officials have long stated China would maintain a proactive fiscal policy.
The government should use fiscal funds to replenish the capital of state-owned financial institutions and ease the strain in financial market deleveraging, Xu wrote.
The latest comments by Xu echo those from economists that China could deploy a much more active fiscal policy and fine-tune its monetary policy to shore up growth amid a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy as it extends a prolonged crackdown on financial risks and battles a heated trade war with the United States.
""China's fiscal policy cannot be active if it still keeps a lid on local government debt,"" wrote Xu.
Chinese regulators are in the third year of a campaign to clamp down on riskier lending practices. The so-called shadow banking sector has been a particular headache, being a source of off-balance sheet loans for local governments and their financing vehicles (LGFVs).
Local governments have been banned from providing implicit guarantee to LGFVs and some have halted several infrastructure projects.
Xu said that some local governments still have room for ""leveraging"" and could play a key part in ensuring a stable growth rate for the economy.
Policymakers have been trying to strike a delicate balance between the need for tougher supervision and reforms and ensuring the stability of the financial system, while keeping economic growth on track.

Analysts in a Reuters poll have raised their 2018 growth forecasts for China's economy to 6.6 percent, up from an April forecast of 6.5 percent - a surprising result given an escalating trade war with the United States, as they see a deleveraging drive and pollution crackdown having less of an impact than initially expected.

788,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 05:59AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 13:
1. JP Morgan kicks off Q2 earnings season
Wall Street's second-quarter earnings season unofficially kicks off on Friday with  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) releasing its results at approximately 7:00 AM ET (11:00 GMT).
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) will follow up with their own earnings at approximately 8:00 AM (12:00 GMT).
Q2 earnings growth is tipped to be 20.7% according to Thomson Reuters data, moderating slightly from a gain of 26.6% the first-quarter, which was the highest in seven years when results were boosted by tax-cut tailwinds.
However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, with analysts likely to scrutinize outlook statements to see whether to adjust numbers for the rest of 2018.
2. U.S. stocks little changed ahead of bank earnings
U.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Friday as concerns over trade tensions faded to the background and investors looked forward to the start of the second-quarter earnings season.
At 5:55 AM ET (9:55 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures slipped 11 points, or 0.04%, S&P 500 futures dropped 2 points, or 0.08%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 3 points, or 0.03%.
China's vice foreign minister Zhang Jun said on Friday that the U.S.’s accusations against China on trade were groundless and that Washington's actions are not supported by the international community.
His comments came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that he and the administration are “available” for discussion, but China must first agree to deeper economic reforms.
“To the extent that China wants to make structural changes, I and the administration are available,” Mnuchin said on Thursday. “We are not advocating tariffs. We are advocating fair trade.”
China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen also said on Thursday “when we have a trade problem, we should talk about it.”
Elsewhere, European shares moved higher nearing midday trade on Friday, and looked set for a second week of gains as fears of a full-blown trade war were kept in check and optimism about the next corporate earnings season grew.
Earlier, Asian stock markets closed mostly higher on Friday, although China’s Shanghai Composite remained under pressure as the Chinese trade surplus with the U.S. hit a record in June, underlining concerns about how U.S. President Donald Trump will react to the data.
3. Cable falls as Trump Bashes May’s Brexit plan
The pound fell against the dollar on Friday after Trump suggested that UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to exit the European Union would likely make any type of U.S.-British trade deal unfeasible.
""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" Trump said on Friday in an interview with Sun.
GBP/USD fell 0.54% to 1.3133 by 5:57 AM ET (9:57 GMT).
Meanwhile, the dollar continued its bullish run for a fifth consecutive session as investors looked ahead to University of Michigan’s preliminary measure of July consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
At 5:57AM ET (9:57GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, gained 0.29% at 94.84.
4. China trade surplus with U.S. Hits Record
China’s monthly trade surplus with the U.S. rose to a record in June and exports to the nation also soared, underlining the cause of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
Chinese imports to U.S. ports rose more than expected in June, with analysts commenting that buying may have been boosted given the threat of impending tariffs.
The trade surplus with the U.S. was $28.97 billion, a record in data back to 1999. Exports climbed to $42.62 billion, also a historic high.
5. Oil prices head for weekly loss ahead of U.S. production data
Oil prices headed lower in early morning trade on Friday as investors looked ahead to Baker Hughes’ weekly data on U.S. production. The number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by five to 863 last week.
Although that was the first increase in three weeks, the U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 763 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC's past efforts to cut global output over the past year-and-a-half.
U.S. crude oil futures lost 0.44% to $70.02 at 5:58AM ET (9:58GMT), while Brent oil fell 1.17% to $73.58.
Both barrels were on track for weekly losses of more than 4% as investors focused this week on the return of Libyan oil to the market amid concerns about a China-U.S. trade war."
789,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","China June new loans jump to 1.84 trillion yuan, above forecasts","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese banks extended 1.84 trillion yuan ($274.91 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, up considerably from the previous month and beating analysts' expectations, as policymakers step up support for the economy. 
Faced with a slowdown in domestic demand and the potential fallout from a trade war with the United States, Chinese policymakers have recently boosted policy support and softened their stance on deleveraging.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new June yuan loans of 1.6 trillion yuan, significantly higher than May's 1.15 trillion yuan. China's banks extended a record 13.53 trillion yuan in new loans last year.
Broad M2 money supply grew 8.0 percent in June from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Friday, missing forecasts for an expansion of 8.3 percent and compared with 8.3 percent in May.
June's M2 growth was the lowest since at least January 1996, when Reuters data on the series began.
The People's Bank of China has said a slowdown in M2 growth could be a ""new normal"" due to official deleveraging efforts in the financial system.
Outstanding yuan loans in June grew 12.7 percent from a year earlier, faster than an expected 12.5 percent and almost the same as May's 12.6 percent rise.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 707.3 billion yuan in June from 614.3 billion yuan in May, according to the central bank's data.
Household loans accounted for 38.4 percent of total new loans in June, versus 53.4 percent in May.
Corporate loans rose to 981.9 billion yuan in June from 525.5 billion yuan a month earlier.
FEELING THE PINCH
The world's second-largest economy has already felt the pinch from a multi-year campaign to reduce debt risks, especially in the financial system, that has driven up corporate borrowing costs. 
A recent Reuters poll showed China's gross domestic product growth was expected to ease marginally to 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, versus the 6.8 percent seen in the previous three quarters.
Second quarter GDP data will be released on Monday.
Last month, China's central bank announced its third reserve requirement ratio cut this year, releasing 700 billion yuan in liquidity, in an effort to accelerate the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spur lending to smaller firms.
China's financial regulator has told banks to ""significantly cut"" lending rates for small firms in the third quarter in comparison with the first quarter, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
China's total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose sharply to 1.18 trillion yuan ($176.30 billion) in June from 760.8 billion yuan in May, central bank data showed.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.

That can provide hints of activity in China's vast and unregulated shadow banking sector, which authorities have also been targeting in their campaign to reduce systemic risks.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French banks won a landmark court victory against the European Central Bank on Friday, giving them an exemption from holding capital against customer deposits parked with a state-owned fund.
The European Union's top court annulled an ECB decision demanding that the six banks set aside capital against special deposits they have with state investment institution Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC).
The ruling marks the first high-profile success for banks in a case brought against the ECB since the central bank became the industry's main supervisor in 2014 under the lead of France's own former chief regulator, Daniele Nouy.
""The ECB has erred in law and committed manifest errors of assessment,"" the court said
The ruling will lower capital requirements for  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Credit Mutuel, Groupe BPCE and La Banque Postale by billions of euros in total.
French tax-free savings accounts, such as the Livret A, were worth some 386 billion euro at the end of May but their popularity is waning due to the low interest rate they pay.
Banks can deposit up to 60 percent of that cash with the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignation, which uses the funds to invest in public housing and other projects.
La Banque Postale and BPCE, which long had a monopoly on French regulated savings accounts, were likely the main beneficiaries of the verdict. 
Under EU rules, banks must hold capital worth at least 3 percent of their total assets. By stripping out the deposits with the CDC, banks would get a higher leverage ratio for a given amount of capital.
La Banque Postale said in its annual report it had capital worth 4.5 percent of its assets at the end of 2017 but that ratio would come in at even healthier 5.3 percent if its deposits with the CDC had been excluded.
As the bank's assets were worth 205 billion at the end of last year, according to its annual report, that 0.8 percent difference is worth 1.64 billion euros ($1.91 billion).
BPCE and Credit Agricole SA knocked 30 and 15 basis points respectively off their leverage ratios in 2016 to take account of their deposits with the CDC. 
The court accepted that these deposits qualify for an exemption because they are ""deposits that the institution is legally obliged to transfer to (a) public sector entity ... for the purposes of funding general interest investments"". 
In 2013, before moving to the ECB, Daniele Nouy herself said that French banks would be ""strongly impacted"" by new liquidity rules due to their exposure to regulated savings accounts, among other reasons. 
The ECB is facing a number of lawsuits from banks that disagree with its decisions, including BNP Paribas.

792,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Trump's Tariffs Generate Growing Frustration Among GOP Lawmakers,"(Bloomberg) -- There are signs of growing frustration among GOP lawmakers with Donald Trump as he moves forward with new trade tariffs, though they’re not ready to rein in the president’s power.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, who rarely directly criticizes Trump, said tariffs “are not the solution,” and warned that pulling out of trade pacts -- as the president did with the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- threatens the U.S. economy. But the most searing comments came later in the day from Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who isn’t running for re-election and is often critical of the president.
“Protectionism is something he’s come back to like a homing pigeon,” Flake told reporters. “I mean, there are very few principles that he sticks with and that’s one of them.""
The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a symbolic motion backing a role for Congress in requiring tariffs on national security grounds, such as those Trump imposed on steel and aluminum imports and is considering on autos. That came after the administration’s latest threat to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese-made products on top of levies in effect, or soon to be implemented, on $50 billion of goods.
But many Republicans have said they want to give Trump leeway to see if his approach works, or persuade him privately to back down, instead of restricting his power to impose tariffs. Republicans’ desire to act may grow in coming weeks if the tariffs, and retaliatory measures, begin to increase consumer prices ahead of November’s congressional elections that will determine control of the House and Senate.
Flake said he thinks it’ll take another month for GOP lawmakers to approve legislation as Trump’s approach fails.
""Anybody who’s looking for some genius behind this curtain somehow is going to be disappointed,"" Flake said. ""I don’t know why my colleagues think there’s something behind that curtain. There just isn’t.""
Tariffs aren’t taking much of a toll on the economy -- so far. A lull in U.S. consumer inflation in June may prove temporary, as tariffs begin to take effect. The latest round of China tariffs would boost the core Consumer Price Index by as much as 0.6 percent within a year, according to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The impact of earlier tariffs on washing machines is already showing in a pocket of the CPI data. The index for laundry equipment was up 13.1 percent from a year earlier, a record in figures going back to the 1970s, though its effect on the broader CPI is negligible.
Farm Impact
Farm states, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in the 2016 election, are poised to take a hit. China slapped tariffs on a variety of American farm goods that went into effect earlier this month in retaliation for Trump’s duties.
A U.S. Agriculture Department report released Thursday, the first that takes account of recent tariffs on American farm goods forecast that soybean stockpiles will be 51 percent higher next year than had been expected a month earlier as China cuts imports and Brazil gobbles up market share.
The expected drop in the price of soybean, the second-most-valuable U.S. crop, would translate to a loss of almost $3.2 billion for soybean farmers. It could be more if the trade war escalates and addition tariffs are imposed.
Economic concerns are starting to weigh on lawmakers.
No Plan
At a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on tariffs Thursday, Senators said they couldn’t understand the administration’s trade strategy or how it plans to obtain improved trading terms with other countries.
""It is pretty apparent we don’t have a stated plan from a marketing or business standpoint,"" said Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican. ""We are going to be in a terrible situation because we don’t have a plan.""
Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the committee, said tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum on national security grounds are disrupting supply chains and hurting businesses. Trump’s threat to impose similar tariffs on autos would do even more damage, he said.
“I’m very concerned about the president’s trade policies and I think we all should be,” said Corker, who isn’t running for re-election and is often critical of Trump. “Many Americans could and will lose their jobs.”
House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, questioned Trump’s trade policies in an interview on Bloomberg Television. He said the U.S. shouldn’t impose tariffs on auto imports on national security grounds.
""Why are we picking a fight with the whole world?"" Hensarling said
Ryan, speaking Thursday at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., drew a stark difference between his vision for trade and that of Trump.
“We risk having American products locked out of new markets, jobs moved overseas, and a decline in American influence,” said Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. “As our generals will tell you, these agreements are just as important for our national security as they are for our economy.”
A bipartisan bill unveiled this week in the House would require congressional review of any tariffs proposed on national security grounds. Ryan, however, said such legislation isn’t going to pass and that it’s “more effective and constructive” to work with the administration."

794,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:35AM ET</span>",BOJ may project inflation missing its target for three more years: sources,"By Leika Kihara and Sumio Ito
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan this month might concede that inflation could fall short of its 2 percent target for as long as three more years, sources say, in what would be the strongest sign yet of acceptance that its goal cannot be reached quickly.
The view may emerge from the BOJ's July 30-31 policy meeting, which includes a quarterly review of its long-term projections.
Instead of ramping up stimulus to fire up inflation, the BOJ likely will point to structural factors that could weigh on inflation for years, say the sources familiar with its thinking.
Acceptance of not reaching 2 percent for up to three more years would likely reinforce market expectations the central bank is nowhere near an exit from ultra-easy policy.
And such a move would be the latest sign the BOJ is drifting away from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's experiment, launched in 2013, to eradicate Japan's deflationary mindset. This involved a pledge to boost inflation quickly, plus price projections many analysts saw as too optimistic.
A changed view on 2 percent achievability would also underscore the BOJ's wariness to expand stimulus, given its dwindling tool-kit and the growing cost of prolonged easing, such as hitting bank profits.
""It may take longer than expected for inflation to hit the BOJ's target as structural factors may be keeping inflation and wages low,"" said one of the sources.
""But as long as the economy is sustaining momentum to hit the goal, it can stand pat on policy,"" the source said on condition of anonymity.
SIDE-EFFECTS EMERGING
The BOJ has regularly cut its price projections at recent quarterly reviews, but only for the first two of a three-year projection period. It always saw inflation nearing 2 percent in the final year.
The central bank may break from that pattern at the July meeting and consider cutting its projection for the year ending in March 2021, the sources say.
The BOJ now projects inflation of 1.3 percent this fiscal year, followed by 1.8 percent for both fiscal 2019 and 2020.
Earlier, sources told Reuters the BOJ will likely cut the inflation forecast to around 1.0 percent for this fiscal year, and to around 1.5 percent for the one ending in March 2020.
The forecasts are the median from individual projections of nine board members.
At the July review, the BOJ will also look more closely into structural factors affecting the pace of price changes, including the spread of online shopping and companies' efforts to deal with labor shortages via automation rather than wage hikes, the sources say.
By shifting its policy focus away from the price target, the BOJ would give itself more room to whittle down stimulus in future if the cost of easing outweigh the benefits, some analysts say.
Five years of heavy money printing has failed to accelerate inflation to the BOJ's 2 percent target, forcing it to maintain its stimulus program even as other central banks eye an exit from crisis-mode policies.
Subdued inflation forced the BOJ to remove in April any timeframe for hitting its elusive price target.
Some BOJ officials have publicly warned of the rising cost of prolonged easing, which is drying up bond market liquidity and squeezing bank margins. Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya has said the bank could adjust its ultra-easy policy in the future to address the rising cost of easing.
""Many people in the BOJ know well that the current stimulus program is very radical,"" said a person familiar with central bank thinking.

""While it's important to achieve the price target, there will be an increasing focus on the side-effects of the current policy.""

796,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","What's in a name? In Uzbekistan, it signals a reform drive","By Olzhas Auyezov
ALMATY (Reuters) - One evening last December, a crane lifted construction workers to the top of the ornate arched entrance to Uzbekistan's biggest commercial market. Overnight, they replaced the huge letters spelling out its title.
It was more than just a name change. 
The rebranding of Abu Sahiy as Tashkent Silk Road was part of a shake-up at the market that marked a milestone in President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's drive to reform Central Asia's most populous nation.
Mirziyoyev has been moving cautiously since being sworn in on Dec. 14, 2016. But the overhaul of Abu Sahiy sent a signal that change is under way in one of the world's most isolated states, a producer of gold, natural gas and oil.
Autocrat Islam Karimov's 27 years in power had left Uzbekistan's economy stagnant and its consumer market of 32 million largely undeveloped. His family still controlled lucrative businesses when he died in office in September 2016. 
But by the time the workers changed the name above Abu Sahiy on Dec. 21, Karimov's younger daughter had quietly relinquished ownership of it, two sources familiar with the situation said. 
Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva and her husband, Timur Tillyaev, have never said in public who owns the market and controls the logistics companies linked to it. 
But a financier close to the government and an entrepreneur who works with the market confirmed to Reuters the couple had owned Abu Sahiy until late last year.
For Karimova-Tillyaeva, 40, giving up the money-spinning market meant the loss of a prize asset that had helped her afford a lavish lifestyle abroad with her husband and children. 
For Uzbekistan's economy, the change of ownership ended what had been a quasi-monopoly at the market. This opened Uzbekistan's entire consumer goods sector to competition because almost all imported consumer items pass through the market. 
""It was very hard before to import anything, everything was done either through Abu Sahiy or using some crazy smuggling trails,"" said a businessman involved in Uzbek cross-border trade who requested anonymity.
""Now, things have become easier to do... Many people from Tashkent and the nearby area have started actively traveling to Kazakhstan to buy something, from bananas to home appliances, mobile phones and computers."" 
SWEEPING AWAY THE OLD ORDER 
Mirziyoyev, 60, made the first official mention of the changes in a speech on Jan. 5. He did not name the new owners but said monthly tax revenues were flooding in from the market. 
Within 15 days of the reorganization, the market had paid 35 billion sums ($4.2 million) into the budget. Previously it had contributed just 5 billion sums a month, he said.
For Mirziyoyev, the overhaul also had another meaning. It marked the end of the Karimov family's dominance of Uzbekistan. 
Retreating further from public life since then, Karimova-Tillyaeva has resigned as Uzbekistan's representative to UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural agency, and as president of the Uzbek gymnastics federation.
Her older sister, Gulnara Karimova, has not been seen in public for several years and state prosecutors have said she is in custody, being investigated for unspecified crimes. A businesswoman who also recorded pop songs, she was convicted of extortion and embezzlement in 2015. 
The president's office and the government did not respond to questions about the ownership of the market, and Reuters was unable to reach Karimova-Tillyaeva and her husband for comment.
The couple's U.S.-based lawyer, Mark Raymond, said: ""It is my understanding that all of your questions have previously been responded to and reported upon and thus my clients have no further comment."" 
Although state media still avoid criticizing Karimov and his family, there is now some criticism on social media by people emboldened by the dynasty's apparent loss of influence.
BUSTLING MARKET
The bustling Tashkent Silk Road has a reputation for selling anything from food to phones in pavilions along walkways teeming with shoppers. ""Elite perfume"" is on sale next to cheap plastic toys, most of them from China and Turkey.
Some of the buyers are individual shoppers. Others are wholesale merchants who haggle over prices, buy up large quantities of goods and hire a helper with a trolley to load their wares onto trucks parked outside.
The changes at the market are the kind that foreign companies are looking for as they consider whether to invest in mainly Muslim Uzbekistan.
Bordering Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, one of its selling points is its location: although it borders neither China and Russia, it is a potential stepping stone between them. 
""The government should want foreign enterprises to come to Uzbekistan because it's ... treating all companies on the same basis and there is a level playing field,"" said Juha Kahkonen, Deputy Director of the Middle East and Central Asia department at the International Monetary Fund.
Mirziyoyev, a former prime minister who acted as interim leader before being elected president, praised Karimov but also held out the prospect of reform when he succeeded him. 
He inherited a stagnant economy, a closed political system and a repressive security apparatus accused in the West of human rights abuses -- charges Uzbekistan dismisses.
Some investors fear militant Islam could take a hold on the country. The government faced an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s and the impoverished Fergana Valley region remains a fertile recruiting ground for militant groups.
Change is hard to measure in ex-Soviet Uzbekistan because it is secretive. Political and security reforms are proving slow, though the departure of long-time security chief Rustam Inoyatov in January showed Mirziyoyev consolidating power.
Mirziyoyev also held talks in the White House with President Donald Trump in May, raising the prospect of an improvement in ties with the United States, which rented a military base in Uzbekistan until its troops were evicted in 2005.
LIMITS BUT PROGRESS 
There are limits on how far Uzbekistan is ready to go on reforms. A senior Uzbek official said in May that Tashkent was prepared to privatize its state airline but would keep full control of its lucrative gold mines and oil firm.
But the government liberalized foreign exchange rules last September, allowing citizens and companies to buy and sell foreign currency without restrictions at a market rate. 
Uzbekistan was the world's ninth largest gold producer in 2017, with output of about 100 tonnes and it produced 56.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas, official data showed. Oil output was 806,000 tonnes but it remains a net oil importer and in need of investment in its infrastructure. 
Nearly half of the first-quarter investment inflows went into the oil and gas sector, where Russia's Lukoil (MM:LKOH) completed a large project in April, launching a $3.4 billion gas processing plant.
In a less encouraging sign for foreign investors, Uzbekistan has announced that U.S. carmaker GM, a long-term partner, wants to sell its 10 percent stake in the GM Uzbekistan factory. 
It has offered no explanation but Mirziyoyev criticized the factory this year for failing to create jobs despite enjoying tax and other benefits for decades. An Uzbek news website quoted the state auto company chief as saying in May that Uzbekistan planned to buy the GM stake.
So far, foreign money is coming mostly from institutions such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
But official figures show exports rose 59 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2017 and imports increased by 45 percent. 
Even so, foreign direct investment fell 29 percent to $575 million in the same period. The reason for this is not clear but economists say Uzbekistan has adopted more honest reporting standards under Mirziyoyev.

The ratio of domestic bonds with a cross-default covenant, which puts a borrower in default of other debt if it fails payment on one bond, has surged to 82 percent of all company notes sold this year. That’s up from almost zero five years ago. China has been encouraging a market-driven approach to the pricing of risk in its bond market -- the world’s third largest -- and inclusion of the provisions bring onshore practices closer to international ones.
“The proliferation of cross-default clauses is in line with investors’ increasing awareness of credit risk in recent years,” said James Hu, a senior portfolio manager at Income Partners Asset Management (HK) Ltd. “As the onshore bond market opens to foreign investors, the market practice becomes more internationalized and matured.”
Bonds sold offshore typically come with safeguards or covenants that protect investor interest by limiting the amount of debt a firm is allowed to borrow, potentially curbing losses. Over the past few years, more yuan corporate-bond issuers have added debt covenants, but it’s the cross-default clause that’s seen the highest adoption rate.

A recent example of such a clause being activated was the case of Wintime Energy Co. Its default on a 1.5 billion yuan ($220 million) bond on July 5 triggered cross-default on 13 of its bonds, totaling 9.9 billion yuan, according to a public filing. Last year, missed payments by companies such as Dalian Machinery Tools Group Corp. and Yiyang Group Holdings prompted defaults on their other debt.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 03:39PM ET</span>",Fed's escape from crisis holdings could hit dead end,"By Jonathan Spicer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Not long ago the Federal Reserve expected to quietly shed nearly half of its $4.5-trillion portfolio by around 2022, leaving little trace of the extraordinary steps it took to face down the financial crisis. But an unexpected market kink could force the Fed to scrap the plan two or three years early and permanently leave it holding $1 trillion more than it wanted.
The U.S. central bank is making adjustments on the fly and keeping its options open. ""I don't think that's problematic in any way"" to halt the process ""somewhat earlier,"" William Dudley, the former New York Fed president and key architect of the portfolio strategy, told reporters last month.
Yet if the world's largest holder of U.S. bonds tossed out its play book and effectively took on a more accommodative stance, the result could be an across-the-board easing of market borrowing costs, the foreign-exchange value of the dollar, and of the growing strains on emerging markets.
""The evidence that we have suggests that the ultimate size of the balance sheet will be bigger than what people expected,"" said Matthew Luzzetti, senior economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities in New York.
All of this amounts to the final chapter in the Fed's unprecedented decision over the last decade to buy some $3.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury bonds in an effort to boost riskier investments, hiring and economic recovery from recession. In a nod to a stronger U.S. economy, the Fed since 2015 has raised interest rates well above zero and, since October of last year, begun shrinking its balance sheet to a more normal but yet-unspecified size.
The market kink is partly of the Fed's making.
With each dollar worth of bonds it has let run off, the so-called excess reserves it requires private banks to hold have become more scarce. Meanwhile the Trump administration's spending boost this year has sucked up dollar liquidity as the government issued more bonds and deposited more at the central bank.
The result has been a pronounced jump in demand for excess bank reserves, which exploded during the crisis as the Fed ramped up bond-buying, but which have fallen by about $350 billion in the last nine months as it scaled back its portfolio.
That in turn has threatened to push the Fed's key rate above a policy band currently set at 1.75 to 2 percent. In June, the central bank responded with a short-term fix that may only delay a longer-term reckoning.
Some economists are now predicting it will have to stop shedding bonds in one to two years and, when it's done its post-crisis ""balance sheet normalization,"" end up with a roughly $3.5-trillion portfolio.
That's larger than the broad $2.3- to $2.9-trillion range Fed economists projected in September, and well above the $900 billion it had before the 2007-2009 crisis. The September projections saw the process end by 2022 or 2023.
SLIDING FINISH LINE
The looming question is how much excess reserves banks will require in the years ahead, since that represents a big yet shrinking chunk of the Fed's liabilities. After peaking at about $2.8 trillion in 2014, they are down to $1.9 trillion.
Luzzetti at Deutsche Bank predicts excess reserves will fall to an equilibrium around $1.3 trillion, forcing the Fed to stop shedding bonds in the first half of 2020 and leaving it with some $3.7 trillion in total assets.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists on Thursday predicted it would end in September of next year.
That would spell good news for economies that have seen investment flee this year like Argentina, Philippines and India, whose central bank chief in June complained the Fed's bond-shedding is weakening emerging-market currencies. China, locked in a trade war with the United States, could also see relief for its tumbling yuan and equities.
Closer to home, rewriting the play book could keep a lid on longer term U.S. bond yields since the Fed would take on a more accommodative stance, perhaps permanently.
Roberto Perli, partner at Cornerstone Macro and a former Fed economist, predicted the Fed would stop shrinking its balance sheet in the second half of next year. That would mean yields on 10-year Treasuries - which fell as the Fed snapped up bonds over the last decade - would rise by only 0.25 to 0.3 percent, or about two-thirds of what would be expected were it to stick to its original plan, he said.
The so-called yield curve, or the difference between 10- and 2-year Treasury bond yields, should within about a year be completely flat - a historical signal of a pending recession. ""These are not trivial amounts,"" Perli said of the $800 billion to $1 trillion in additional bonds the Fed may end up holding.
To be sure, U.S. central bankers have always said their asset-shedding plan, announced in detail last June, would be flexible and depend on unpredictable Treasury issuance and redemptions of mortgage-backed securities. And the Fed has not yet specified what portion of assets banks must hold as excess reserves, which as a multiple of required reserves are near their lowest levels since the crisis.
The central bank may yet meet its forecasts, especially if the recent jump in demand for bank reserves eases.
""We don't exactly know when we will hit that point"" where excess reserves reach an equilibrium, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said at a forum in Idaho on Thursday, adding it could be between $500 billion and $700 billion.
Yet an analysis of the central bank's annual predictions suggests it has come to terms with a permanently larger balance sheet. The New York Fed's end-point estimates, based in part on the estimates of dealer banks, have risen to $3 trillion from $2 trillion over three years. The portfolio ""normalizes"" sometime between 2020 and 2022, it predicted in April.
On June 15, his last day at the New York Fed, Dudley said: ""I don't think it's a huge problem or issue if banks demand $1 trillion of excess reserves versus $5oo billion of excess reserves, and that were to cause us to stop the balance sheet normalization process somewhat earlier.""

“The economy’s in a really good place,” Powell said Thursday in an interview on American Public Media’s “Marketplace” program, noting that unemployment was at its lowest level in 20 years, while acknowledging the risk posed by escalating trade disputes.
Should those disputes result in “high tariffs on a lot of products and a lot of traded goods and services” that “could be be a negative for our economy,” he said.
Powell, who appears before Congress next week, also said that inflation has gradually moved up.
“It’s now just touching 2 percent. So we’re really close to our target. I wouldn’t say we’ve fully achieved it yet. We’re not declaring victory there.”

801,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico's Bankrupt Utility Is Leaderless After Pay Scandal,"(Bloomberg) -- Most board members of Puerto Rico’s power utility resigned Thursday after a chorus of outrage over pay for its new chief executive officer, who then pulled out of the job. The tumult leaves the troubled agency leaderless at a critical time in its bankruptcy and sale of its assets.
In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello, five members of the panel said they were dismayed by ""petty political interests."" Earlier, Rossello joined politicians and residents in decrying the $750,000 salary pledged to incoming chief executive Rafael Diaz-Granados, which they said was exorbitant in light of the island’s financial crisis and the possibility that public employees may soon face reduced benefits.
""We no longer believe that we have the support to perform the politically unpopular tasks necessary to drive the change from within PREPA,"" the board members wrote in the resignation letter, which was confirmed by a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “When the petty political interests of politicians are put ahead of the needs of the people, the process of transforming the Puerto Rican electricity sector is put at risk.”
Diaz-Granados, himself a board member, quit that position and won’t take the chief executive job, according to the person, who asked not to be named because it wasn’t yet official.
Rich and Poor
Executive pay has turned into a sensitive topic for the U.S. commonwealth. As the entire island wades through bankruptcy proceedings, many regular Puerto Ricans, including low-level public employees, face the prospect of seeing pension payouts, Christmas bonuses and even sick and vacation days slashed. Also under scrutiny is the paycheck for the executive director of the island’s fiscal control board, which the U.S. Congress installed to right the island’s fiscal accounts.
Diaz-Granados was named CEO on Wednesday, just hours after the surprise resignation of Walter Higgins. Higgins quit after the legislature had sought to prevent him from receiving a bonus on top of his $450,000 salary. Diaz-Granados’s higher base salary, which the utility said was in line with industry standards, appeared intended to circumvent the legislature’s anti-bonus measure.
Daunting Task
The Prepa crisis comes at a critical time. It’s navigating bankruptcy court and working with investment bankers to sell generation assets, potentially putting the transmission and distribution business under a private concessionaire. The new leadership also faces the daunting task of addressing decades of ingrained corruption, inefficiency and poorly maintained infrastructure.
In a press release Wednesday, the utility said Diaz-Granados’s pay was in line with industry standards, citing an American Public Power Association formula based on utilities’ revenue.
Diaz-Granados defended his salary in local radio interviews Thursday. He said he was ""sacrificing"" to take the job, and said his previous position at  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. paid more than $2 million a year.
Indeed, Constance Lau, the CEO of Hawaiian Electric Industries, a utility that had comparable annual revenue, made $893,533 in base salary in 2017. CEO Patricia Kampling of Alliant Energy Corp., which also posted similar sales, earned $980,000. But those utilities are investor-owned, and the similarities with Prepa’s financial situation essentially end there.
By comparison, Gil Quiniones, CEO of the state-owned New York Power Authority, makes $235,000 in base annualized salary. And before Higgins and Diaz-Granados, top Prepa executive Ricardo Ramos had a salary of just $142,000.
Livid Residents
Diaz-Granados, a multilingual Harvard University graduate who is originally from Colombia, spent 15 years at GE, including as president and chief executive officer of GE Spain and Portugal and GE Mexico. Higgins arrived on the island from Nevada in March without much Spanish, but brought 40 years of management experience.
Coraly Ortiz, a 43-year-old bank employee in San Juan, said she was furious about Diaz-Granados’s salary.
""It’s completely disproportionate and ridiculous, above all with the situation in Puerto Rico,"" she said. ""They’re creating an elite of overpaid government officials taking advantage of the crisis."""

803,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>","U.S., China Say They Are Open to Talks Amid Escalating Trade War","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China signaled they were open to resuming negotiations over trade after days of exchanging retaliatory threats, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Beijing must commit to deeper economic reforms.
High-level discussions over trade between the world’s two largest economies have stalled since June after a month of talks led by Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday that he and administration officials are “available” for negotiations, as he called U.S. tariffs imposed on China a “modest” step aimed at leveling the playing the field.
“To the extent to that China wants to make structural changes, I and the administration are available,” Mnuchin said on Thursday. “We are not advocating tariffs. We are advocating fair trade.”
Trump upped the stakes on Tuesday by moving forward with plans to impose further tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, which could take effect as early as next month. China hasn’t yet outlined exactly how it will respond. Last week, the administration took its first direct tariff hit against China, slapping duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports with another $16 billion to soon follow, sparking tit-for-tat retaliation from China on U.S. goods.
China made its best efforts to avoid escalation of economic frictions with the U.S. and it’s Washington’s responsibility now that the matter has reached this point, according to a statement from the Commerce Ministry late Thursday in Beijing, adding that it’s been sincere in pushing to settle differences through dialog and consultation.
China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in an interview on Tuesday in Geneva that China and the U.S. “should sit down and try to find a solution to this trade problem.”
During negotiations earlier this year to head off a trade war, China pledged to encourage its companies to import more U.S. goods, after the Trump administration pressed China to take steps to cut the American trade deficit by $200 billion. But in recent weeks, the administration have pushed for deeper changes to China’s economic system. That approach may drag out the trade conflict, given that Beijing has promised to gradually shift toward an economy that relies less on exports and state-driven investment.
The Trump administration is closely monitoring the domestic economic effect of tariffs, including on uncertainty for businesses, and it hasn’t yet found “any negative impact,” said Mnuchin. On the broader U.S. economic outlook, the Treasury secretary said he doesn’t consider the flatter yield curve -- which lately is showing a narrowing in the spread between short- and long-term government debt yields -- as indicative of an impending recession.
Mnuchin dismissed the idea that the U.S. and China are locked in a trade war, and instead described it as a dispute, and said said he’s not concerned that China will bring its holdings of U.S. Treasuries into the fight. “Exports create enormous job opportunities,” he said. “We should be doing things to make sure that our companies can compete fairly.”
Tariff Blowback
A Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis economist warned on Thursday that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods may backfire, causing job cuts and plant shutdowns.
Higher tariffs have affected mostly intermediate goods from China -- supplies used by U.S. manufacturers in producing final products -- so they have the effect of raising costs and resulting in higher prices, economist Fernando Leibovici wrote in a blog post on the bank’s website. That will damage U.S. manufacturers’ international competitiveness, he said.
House Republicans including Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Andy Barr of Kentucky grilled Mnuchin on the negative impact of raising trade barriers at Thursday’s hearing. Their concerns are an indication that China’s and Europe’s retaliatory tariffs against U.S. exports would hit hardest in states that helped propel Trump to the presidency, bringing home the risks of a trade war ahead of November’s midterms. The EU, along with Canada and Mexico, have retaliated against separate tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imposed by Trump.
Of the 10 states that face potential Chinese tariffs on more than $1 billion of their exports, seven backed Trump in 2016, according to a report by the American Action Forum, a Washington-based group that opposes protectionist trade policies.
At Thursday’s hearing, Republican Representative Ann Wagner said constituents in her soybean-producing state of Missouri are feeling the “present-day"" impact of the trade war. Soybean futures have been spiraling lower since late May, just as the trade dispute was gearing up. Mnuchin assured Wagner that he’s following soybean prices daily, calling China’s targeting of the commodity “unfair.”
House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday drew a stark difference between his vision for trade and Trump’s, rejecting tariffs and warning that pulling out of trade agreements is a threat to the U.S. economy. “We risk having American products locked out of new markets, jobs moved overseas, and a decline in American influence,” Ryan said at the Economic Club of Washington.
On Thursday, Mnuchin also repeated the administration’s support for bipartisan legislation to tighten scrutiny over foreign investments in the U.S. and attach it to a must-pass defense spending bill.
Trump last month endorsed expanding the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, for reviewing investments from abroad over national security concerns. He turned to Cfius over an earlier plan to invoke emergency powers to impose sweeping new restrictions on Chinese investments.
Trump has been moving forward with tariffs against China and considering investment restrictions since his administration concluded in March that Beijing violates U.S. intellectual-property rights, such as by forcing American firms to hand over technology.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Turkey's turmoil and how it measures up against other emerging markets,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey's financial markets are being battered. The lira is at a record low after slumping more than 20 percent this year, Istanbul's stock market has just had its worst day in over two years and investors are dumping the country's bonds.
Below are a series of graphics that illustrate the scale of the turmoil and show how Turkish assets now compare to those in other heavyweight emerging markets.
1/CAUTION, FRAGILE!
Fathom Consulting's composite indicator of sovereign financial fragility shows just how bad the situation is getting for Turkey. It is aggregated from the default risk, inflation risk, and the spread between the 10-year government bond yield and the central bank policy rate in each country.
Scores are on a scale between 0 and 10, where scores below 1 indicate that the government debt in question is fundamentally safe and scores above 3 indicate that it is fundamentally unsafe.
(GRAPHIC: Turkey heads EM fragility index - https://reut.rs/2NHj2Jx)
2/LIRA LOSSES
The slump in the lira, after a long-term decline since 2010, is the source of much of the current turmoil.
It does damage in two main ways. Firstly, it drives up inflation, which causes problems because the central bank knows President Tayyip Erdogan doesn't like it when it raises interest rates -- the usual policy response to bring inflation back down.
Secondly, it makes any dollar-denominated debt of the government or Turkish firms or consumers more expensive to repay. Bank for International Settlements data shows Turkey has a lot of dollar debt -- $200 billion in fact, not much below Mexico's $265 billion.
The flip side though is that the lira now looks well undervalued. A purchasing parity valuation model used at State Street Global Advisors' calculates it is now 32 percent undervalued. South Africa's rand is the next most undervalued currency at 25 percent while for Mexico's peso it is 18 percent.
(GRAPHIC: Turkey's lira undervalued by a third after slump - https://reut.rs/2NI2CAG)
3/PAY UP
The sell off in Turkey's bond market has been dramatic. And even though the central bank has hiked interest rates 5 percentage points over recent months, the reality is that the country's 15 percent plus inflation means that bond yields in the high teens are in real terms below 1 percent -- not exactly an attractive proposition for investors.
Comparing Turkey's two-year bond yields (TR2YT=RR) -- which hit an all-time high of almost 20 percent on Thursday -- with those of other big emerging markets also paints the picture.
It is more than double the 8.6 percent yield on Brazil's equivalent bonds (BR2YT=RR) and quadruple those on Bangladesh's (BD2YT=RR) which both carry the same BB-/Ba2 Moody's and Fitch sovereign credit ratings.
(GRAPHIC: 'Real' yields in emerging markets - https://reut.rs/2LfCH1q)
4/CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE
Turkey's high growth rates have been fueled by a credit boom, which can be a risky business. Credit growth is at 20 percent year on year which puts it at number three of all the emerging economies monitored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), behind only the Argentina and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
IIF data shows also shows that the overall loan-to-deposit ratio in Turkey's banking system is over 100 percent, which means that any significant freeze in lending markets would cause major problems. South Africa, Chile, Mexico and Colombia also have the same risk.
On the plus side, Turkey's banking system has a small proportion of non-performing loans at just 3 percent of the overall amount. That compares to 46 percent in Greece and 56 percent in Ukraine.
(GRAPHIC: Turkey credit growth - https://reut.rs/2NLOOW2)
5/GOING CHEAP
One of the main ways financial analysts measure the value of stocks is their price-to-earnings ratios. The lower the number, the cheaper the stock, effectively, and running the numbers on Istanbul's BIST 100 index (XU100) shows that its overall P/E ratio is now well below that of other big EM stock markets.

ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia's run to a first World Cup final has proven an economic win at home with spending reaching near record levels as fans rush out to buy beers, snacks and television sets to follow the action in Russia.
The country's biggest local retail chain, Konzum, said that the sale of crisps was up by 100 percent on Wednesday, compared to a year ago, as fans munched through the 2-1 extra time win over England in the semi-final.
Many will watch Sunday's final against France on new television sets, with some shops reporting a 400 percent rise on sales during the World Cup compared to last year.
Those sales have contributed to a 12.95 billion kuna ($2.05 billion) spend by Croats and tourists since the World Cup began in the middle of June, according to tax office data published by the Vecernji List daily on Thursday.
The three week sales numbers have come close to the 13.8 billion kuna record which was set in December 2017 due to Christmas holiday shopping.

The EU has ""equivalence"" regimes which provide limited access for some of non-EU partners to some areas of EU financial services markets. Gramegna said he supported a study into its workings by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.
""I think that equivalence in the field of financial services could be an interesting idea that we really need to deepen and we need to make sure that we continue to discuss both to find solutions to have smart access on both sides,"" he told reporters before a meeting of euro zone finance ministers, in reply to questions on Britain's regime after Brexit.
His line seemed to be at odds with the position repeatedly taken by EU negotiators on Brexit that Britain should not be offered special conditions after it leaves the EU next year.
""Equivalence is something that has been used with third countries exceptionally and that's why it needs to be widened and enhanced and that's what has been agreed and we think that's a good route... We support that it should be looked at,"" Gramegna said.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has repeatedly said the bloc's existing system of market access for foreign financial firms could work well for Britain, without the need for bespoke treatment.

EU ministers will also call for more global action on tax transparency and against money laundering, and will push for an international digital tax reform by 2020, according to a draft text that will form their mandate at the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Buenos Aires on July 19-22.
""The EU promotes international cooperation to modernize the WTO,"" the EU draft text, seen by Reuters, said citing the World Trade Organisation.
It added that the EU ""rejects WTO-inconsistent unilateral measures by others.""
""In this respect, we regret the recent U.S. decisions to impose import tariffs, which leave the EU no choice but to react in an adequate, proportionate and reasonable manner in full respect of WTO rules,"" the document said.
An EU official said the draft statement is already widely supported by the 28 EU states and will be on the table of EU finance ministers at their regular monthly meeting in Brussels on Friday.
On the taxation of the digital economy, the draft text urge ""ambitious, effective and workable global solutions to be agreed by 2020 at the latest.""
The text underlines however that while a global solution remains the best option, ""many countries are interested in temporary measures"" and recalls the EU commission's plans to introduce a 3 percent tax on the digital turnover of large companies.
To increase tax transparency at global level, the text calls for the updating of an international list of tax havens compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which currently includes only Trinidad and Tobago. 
The EU has adopted its own tax havens blacklist which currently includes seven jurisdictions.

The draft text calls for increasing cooperation and exchange of information at global level to prevent tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.

812,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>","Weekly Comic: Trump Escalates Trade War Against China, Europe","Investing.com - All eyes were on escalating trade rhetoric this week as investors attempted to work out whether a series of tit-for-tat responses between the U.S. and China will end in negotiations or an all-out trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
The Trump administration raised the stakes in its trade dispute with China, threatening 10% tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports late Tuesday, pushing the world's two biggest economies ever closer to a full-scale trade war.
The tariffs will not go into effect immediately but will undergo a two-month review process, with hearings August 20-23.
Washington proposed the extra tariffs after efforts to negotiate a solution to the dispute failed to reach an agreement, senior administration officials said.
China accused the U.S. of bullying and warned it would hit back, but did not immediately say how it would retaliate.
It was the latest development in escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
Last week, Washington imposed 25% tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing responded immediately with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
Investors are worried that threats of higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures by others could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
Meanwhile, in Europe, President Donald Trump participated at a summit of leaders of NATO countries in Brussels, where he reiterated the U.S. commitment to NATO and claimed credit for an agreement that he says will ""significantly"" increase military spending among the 29-member states.
Trump denied reports that he had threatened to pull out of the alliance, but nonetheless said he ""probably could"" withdraw from the treaty without congressional approval. However, he said such a move wasn't necessary given the agreements reached following a two-day summit in Brussels in which he took a ""very firm"" tone with its alliance allies.
The President's comments follow reports that he slammed NATO leaders again Thursday over what he has described as a lack of financial commitment to the military defence of America's European allies.

813,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Powell’s Fed Faces a New Question About Inflation,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Under the leadership of former chair Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve successfully identified 2017’s slowdown in inflation as transitory. Now with tariffs threatening to accelerate inflation, the Fed faces the opposite question: Is faster inflation just another transitory phenomenon? If Yellen’s successor, Jerome Powell, can’t repeat her ability to distinguish between persistent and temporary inflationary forces, then expect the ride to get much bumpier, ending with either a recession or high inflation — or a combination of both.
When inflation rates fell in 2017, the Fed adopted the view that the decline was transitory due in no small part to a drop in mobile-phone service costs. This position allowed central bankers to keep pushing up their target for the federal funds rate throughout the year. That bet paid off, as inflation rates rose as expected and hence the Fed did not overtighten. It was a good call on Yellen’s part.
Now the Fed needs to make another good call. Tariffs threaten to push inflation rates higher than expected over the next year. Should the Fed view the increase as transitory or something more sinister? On the surface, the answer should be straightforward. While tariffs should be seen as a supply-side shock that drives prices higher while pushing output lower, they should result in a level shock to prices, leaving any increase in inflation rates as transitory. Hence, Powell should be able to look through tariffs and follow Yellen’s lead by holding steady with the existing plan for rate hikes.
Moreover, if Powell does conclude a tariff-induced boost to inflation is transitory, he will be primed to meet any slowdown in the economy with a more dovish policy path than currently envisioned. This was my takeaway from the minutes of the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting, in which policy makers bemoaned anecdotal evidence that firms were placing investment projects on hold as a result of the trade disputes.
Still, we should consider the possibility that Powell faces a more difficult challenge than Yellen in differentiating between transitory and persistent increases in inflation rates. Labor markets tightened through 2017, continuing that trend in 2018, and workers have grown increasingly confident in their ability to find new jobs. Private-sector quit rates rose to 2.7 percent in May, surpassing the 2.6 percent peak reached during the last cycle in September 2005. 
If labor costs accelerate further (be on the lookout for the next iteration of the Employment Cost Index at the end of this month), the Fed will begin to worry that the economy has indeed moved well past full employment. This will in turn raise concern that the Phillips curve — the trade-off between unemployment and inflation — is biting harder than expected. In other words, can the Fed distinguish between inflation induced from tariffs versus that stemming from a tight economy? It may be harder for Powell to pull the correct signal from the data than it was for Yellen last year. 
Powell is threading policy through a narrower needle than Yellen. My bet remains that low inflation expectations leave Powell with room to err by looking through any signs of faster inflation as temporary. This allows for some minor overshooting of the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target. In that case, the Fed remains on track to gradually boost policy rates through the rest of this year and into next as it seeks a neutral level of policy accommodation. 
Don’t expect the Fed to let inflation to run wild. If the Fed miscalculates and inflation is more persistent then expected, tracking higher than 2.5 percent over the medium term, it will act to bring it back toward trend before inflation expectations become unanchored. That would be an inflation scare that risks a recessionary inducing policy response.
Of course, if the Fed surprises me by reacting to a tariff-induced inflation boost as a persistent threat because policy makers can’t distinguish its true nature, it will erroneously accelerate the pace of rate hikes, risking recession well before the emergence of any real threat to inflationary expectations. Either way, the more the economy moves past full employment, the more difficult become the challenges facing the Fed. "
814,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",ECB sees rates at record low levels for as long as needed: minutes,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will keep rates at a record low for as long as needed to raise inflation, and its interest rate guidance should be seen as ""open-ended"", policymakers concluded in June, according to minutes of their meeting published on Thursday.
The ECB guided markets for steady rates ""through the summer"" of 2019 at its meeting last month, when it also announced that it would shut a 2.6 trillion euro ($3.04 trillion) bond-buying program in December, ending its unprecedented stimulus scheme.
But policymakers at the meeting felt a need to stress that rates would move only if inflation continued to rise back toward the bank's target of almost 2 percent, the minutes showed.
""It was felt that the open-ended character of the state-contingent component (of the guidance) should be emphasized, with policy rates expected to remain at their present levels for as long as necessary to ensure... a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation,"" the ECB said.
Still, even with such a caveat, policymakers argued that progress in raising inflation has been substantial and they were confident that price growth would continue to move toward the bank's target.
The euro eased a touch on the relatively dovish comments, trading at 1.1655 at 1145 GMT, down from 1.1675 before the minutes were released.
With inflation on the rise and growth appearing to level off, rate-setters decided on June 14 to cut bond buys from October, then shut the scheme in December, satisfied that protracted stimulus is boosting inflation, even if slower than expected.
But they also pushed out expectations for the bank's first interest rate hike, using a relatively vague wording that could include any of the four policy meetings in the second half of the year.
Markets are currently betting on the first move in October but expectations have swung sharply between July and December in the past few weeks, suggesting heightened uncertainly.
(GRAPHIC: ECB policy vs inflation and yields - https://reut.rs/2NJZZOT)
While policymakers said they ""expected"" to end asset buys in December, they also said that given prevailing uncertainty, it was prudent to keep the end of bond buys conditional on incoming data.
""It was widely cautioned that there were signs that the slowdown identified in the first quarter was likely to extend into the second quarter in a number of countries and would imply downside risks regarding the near term,"" the ECB added.
The risk from protectionist trade policies could quickly impact trade and growth but also carried the risk of market volatility.
""In this context, risks associated with heightened volatility in global financial markets were also highlighted more broadly,"" the minutes said.
In the long process of unwinding stimulus, the biggest complication is likely to be a murky economic outlook, muddied by a developing trade war with the United States, a populist challenge from Italy's new government and softening export demand.
Barring a crisis, the ECB is unlikely to walk back its plan to end the bond buys but rising global challenges increase the risk of even more protracted normalization.

815,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",China Braces for More Pain From the Trade War as Economy Slows,"(Bloomberg) -- Further evidence of Donald Trump’s trade war with China is set to show up in economic data due over the next few days, although it will likely just be a taste of things to come.
From exporters of Wi-Fi equipment to households splurging on Maine lobsters and other American goods, China is beginning to adjust to the effect of the current tariffs from both nations, and the possibility of more. Hints at what’s happening will come in June’s trade data on Friday and second quarter gross-domestic product figures due on Monday.
The trade war arrives as the economy is already slowing, adding an external shock to a home-made one. President Xi Jinping may ultimately have to choose between softening his multi-year campaign to control debt levels, or letting growth slow below the target of 6.5 percent.
""There appear to be some risks to the 6.5 percent target, but the government is still committed to it,"" said Chang Jian, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc in Hong Kong. ""As the trade tensions escalate and the data shows more signs of weakness, there will be more policy support and we should see some stabilization.""
The impact is forecast to be moderate for now, with the median estimate of economists for output growth at 6.5 percent this year, in line with the goal. There might even be a temporary boost to second quarter data, as exporters may have attempted to sell more before the imposition of tariffs.
The world’s second largest economy may have expanded 6.7 percent in the second quarter, according to economists Bloomberg surveyed ahead of next week’s data. That’s just a little slower than the 6.8 percent gain in the first three months of the year. Exports probably grew a healthy 9.5 percent from a year earlier in June, before the two nations started to levy an additional 25 percent tariff on more than $30 billion in goods.
Adding duties on another $200 billion in imports from China could meaningfully increase the effect of the trade war. An early gauge of export orders at Chinese factories already tumbled into contraction last month, and a full-blown global trade war would shave 0.4 percentage point off world growth, according to Bloomberg Economics.
Changing Behavior
Trump’s push to ever-higher tariff threats is causing behavior changes more than 8,000 miles from Washington. While the impact is modest still, and companies are wary of divulging their plans publicly, many are reckoning with the new reality.
A Shenzhen-based Wi-Fi equipment maker is looking to divert sales to Southeast Asia to try to maintain its goal of 20 percent growth this year. The company shipped 40 percent of 200 million yuan ($30 million) in total production to the U.S. in 2017, according to Lyu Hui, the sales manager, who asked that the company’s name not be used.
In the same city, Shenzhen BCLH Science & Technology Co. chose to forgo a price rise to cover the tariffs, and effectively cut U.S. profits to near zero, in the hope that the trade war is short. The producer of chemical compounds used in electronics only ships 10 percent of its product to the U.S., but had wanted to expand there, according to Mr. Ma, a sales manager who only gave his last name.
Smaller exporters will be hit particularly hard by the tariffs, according to Cao Yishan, a credit research analyst at PIMCO Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, as they can’t pass on the costs through price rises or by shifting production elsewhere like their bigger counterparts can.
Consumers Hurt
Consumers are also facing a different set of choices. Considering price rises are retailers such as Pinxian Cuisine, which sells imported meats including American beef online, and Carlo Rossi, a dealer of Californian wine.
While summer is usually the peak season to export U.S. lobsters to China, the “crazy” 25 percent tariffs could drive customers to Canadian suppliers, according to Justin Oakes, a business development manager for North America at Gfresh, an online Chinese seafood marketplace.
While the tariffs already implemented will only cost China about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point of economic growth, the potential escalations may deepen the impact to 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point, according to PIMCO’s Cao.
That will be more painful coming on top of the slowdowns in investment, factory output and retail sales. The tight credit tap will also subtract from infrastructure and property investment for the rest of the year, as local governments cut borrowing and property developers have less access to shadow financing channels.
China does have options for stimulus, with monetary easing or a faster pace of fiscal spending this year on the menu. However, those come with risks and costs.
""The tension has turned into an economic conflict and is not bound by trade,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. ""My worry is that the government may shift its policy priority to growth over reform, dragging the pace of China’s structural transformation.""

816,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>","U.S. Yield Curve to Invert in Mid-2019, Morgan Stanley Says","(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve next March will probably map out an end to the contraction in its balance sheet, helping support longer-dated bond yields, which will drop below those on shorter-dated notes by the middle of 2019, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
“Investors are underestimating the size of the SOMA portfolio” that will be needed to keep the benchmark overnight interest rate within the range targeted by the Fed, Morgan Stanley strategists including Sam Elprince wrote in a July 12 note. SOMA refers to the System Open Market Account, the Fed’s name for its pool of assets.
The Fed started shrinking its balance sheet last October, unwinding the unprecedented quantitative easing launched during the financial crisis. The recent phenomenon of the effective federal reserve rate trading toward the upper end of the Fed’s target range has been a sign to some observers that liquidity may already be getting tight.
Some Fed officials have called for a discussion about where to take the balance sheet, with the run-off scheduled to increase by $10 billion a month, to $50 billion, next quarter. Morgan Stanley’s team sees the Fed providing a detailed account of exchanges on the issue in minutes of its December 2018 meeting, expected in early January. In March, they predict an announcement on plans to end balance-sheet normalization in September 2019.
The yield curve has been flattening almost continuously since early 2017 as the Fed kept raising rates, pushing up two-year yields, while 10-year yields rose by less. An inversion has preceded U.S. recessions in the past, and some Fed officials have expressed concern about that happening. Ten-year Treasuries now yield just 27 basis points more than two-year notes.
While a larger end-point for the Fed’s balance sheet than previously anticipated should support risky assets, the help won’t arrive until the contraction ends, Morgan Stanley said. On a 12-month horizon, the strategists recommended being underweight corporate credit relative to benchmark indexes.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","EU too soft on fiscal rules, risks from high-debt states: auditors","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has applied fiscal rules with excessive flexibility, making them ineffective in reducing debt in highly indebted states like Italy, auditors said on Thursday, warning of risks of spillovers from negative market reactions.
To address widespread concerns over the future of the euro, the European Union, in moves led by Germany, tightened its fiscal rules during the peak of the bloc's debt crisis in 2010-2012 and imposed bold economic adjustment targets on member states, triggering criticism by many economists for the resulting austerity.
However those rules were applied with excessive lenience by the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) said in a report on Thursday. 
""The European Commission has extensively used discretionary powers to reduce the adjustment requirements,"" ECA said.
The auditors, who have a mandate to protect the financial interests of the EU citizens, said this excessive flexibility prevented the fiscal targets from being reached ""within a reasonable period"" - a situation that could cause negative market reactions for the whole bloc in a possible future recession, they said.
The EU executive said it ""strongly disagrees with the ECA's conclusion that the Commission used its discretion with a view to reducing adjustment requirements."" 
In replies included in the auditors' report, it added that it had exercised its powers in full respect of the EU legal framework. 
Under EU fiscal rules, states have to aim to reach a balanced structural budget, keep a deficit below 3 percent of their gross domestic product and a public debt below 60 percent. However, many have much higher and growing public debts.
""The flexibility provisions introduced by the Commission are not time-bound to the crisis period and in fact went too far in practice,"" said Neven Mates, the EU auditor responsible for the report and a former staff member of the International Monetary Fund.
""Particularly worrisome is very slow, or even absent adjustment in several member states with high public debt ratio,"" the report said, highlighting Italy, France and Spain.
Italy, which has a debt above 130 percent of its GDP, the EU's highest after bailed-out Greece, has benefited from several waivers from the rules in recent years, as more spending and investment was seen as useful to revamp its sluggish economic growth. 
As a consequence its debt has remained high.

818,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 05:39AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Thursday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 12:
1. World Stocks Rebound After Latest Trade War Jolt
Global stocks recovered, with markets shaking off some of the trade jitters seen in the previous session, when fears of an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war jolted investor sentiment.
In Asia, shares closed mostly in positive territory, with Chinese markets leading gains in the region. Both the Shanghai Composite and the smaller-cap Shenzhen Composite rose more than 2%, largely making up Wednesday’s losses.
Elsewhere, European stock markets were slightly higher in mid-morning trade, with almost all sectors in positive territory. Among national indexes, Germany's export-heavy DAX inched up 0.3%, while Britain's FTSE tacked on 0.6%.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures pointed to a modestly positive opening. The blue-chip Dow futures were up 140 points, or around 0.6% at 5:39AM ET, the S&P 500 futures ticked up 12 points, or roughly 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 30 points, or about 0.4%.
Market focus is largely attuned to the next potential steps in the tit-for-tat trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Investors fear an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
2. Dollar Rises To 6-Month High Vs. Yen
The dollar rose to fresh six-month highs against the yen, amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year.
The greenback was 0.4% higher against the yen at 112.42 (USD/JPY), the strongest level since January 10, after gaining around 1% in the previous session, when upbeat U.S. economic data boosted confidence in the world's top economy.
The dollar's index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies held firm near a one-and-a-half-week high of 94.56 reached overnight, trading at 94.50.
Meanwhile, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield inching up to 2.86%.
Elsewhere, China's yuan had strengthened 0.3% overnight, partially recovering from a big slide the previous day.
3. U.S. Inflation Data Eyed
Thursday's calendar features the biggest economic data point of the week.
The Commerce Department will publish June inflation figures at 8:30AM ET, which should lend further support to the notion that inflation has returned to the Fed’s target.
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.2% last month and 2.9% over the prior year, according to estimates.
Excluding the cost of food and fuel, core inflation is projected to climb 2.3% on a year-over-year basis.
Data released Wednesday showed the biggest annual increase in 6-1/2 years in June U.S. producer prices, thanks to gains in the cost of services and motor vehicles.
The data reinforced expectations for two additional rate hikes by the Fed this year.
4. Oil Recovers After Worst Daily Loss In 2 Years
Brent crude rose more than $1, recouping some ground after its biggest one-day drop in two years in the previous session on news that Libya would resume oil exports.
The rally received an extra boost from the International Energy Agency (IEA), which said the world's oil supply cushion ""might be stretched to the limit"" due to production losses.
Brent crude was up $1.48, or 2%, to $74.87 a barrel, after plunging almost 7% on Wednesday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 64 cents, or 0.9%, to $71.02, after falling 5% the previous session.
5. Trump Continues His European Tour
U.S. President Donald Trump flies into Britain for talks with the leader of the United States' closest ally in Europe, and tea with Queen Elizabeth, set against a backdrop of protests and what he described as the country's turmoil over Brexit.
Fresh from a NATO summit where Trump chided Germany and other European nations for failing to contribute enough to defense spending, British Prime Minister Theresa May is hoping his trip will boost the close ties between their two nations and help forge a future free trade deal.
May will host a black-tie dinner for Trump that will be attended by senior ministers and about 100 business leaders, including the likes of Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Blackrock (NYSE:BLK),  Diageo  (LON:DGE), McLaren and Arup.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 05:22AM ET</span>","U.S. companies in China mostly oppose tariffs, survey shows","By John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Most U.S. businesses operating in China oppose using tariffs as a weapon to solve their problems ranging from market access to poor protection of intellectual property rights, a survey suggested on Thursday.
Nearly 69 percent of the 434 respondents to the annual China Business Climate Survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai opposed tariffs, while 8.5 percent backed them.
The survey, conducted April 10 to May 10, reflects the mix of concerns and realities for American businesses in China at a time of heightened uncertainty as the Trump administration raises the ante in its trade war with Beijing.
President Donald Trump accuses China of unfair trade practices that benefit its firms while hobbling U.S. companies and creating an outsized trade deficit for the United States.
Washington raised the stakes in its trade war with China on Tuesday, proposing 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, from food products to tobacco, chemicals, coal, steel and aluminum.
""One should give the Trump administration credit for getting China's attention because for many years there have been extended discussions about market access issues that plague foreign companies here in China, and the progress has been pretty slow,"" said Ken Jarrett, president of AmCham in Shanghai.
However, extrapolating from the survey findings, Jarrett said multilateral negotiations were a preferable approach.
""Now that the U.S. government has China's attention I think actually there's no alternative but to try to go back to the negotiating table,"" said the former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai.
While U.S. firms still face challenges in China, 34 percent of respondents felt state policies toward foreign firms had improved, up from 28 percent last year, the survey showed.
Those that felt policies had worsened for foreign firms fell to 23 percent from 33 percent last year. Sixty percent said the regulatory environment lacked transparency, on par with 2017.
Protection of intellectual property rights and licensing requirements were the top two regulatory challenges.
The Trump administration has complained that U.S. companies are forced to hand over key technology to access China's market.
Twenty-one percent of firms in the survey said they felt pressure to transfer technology, with aerospace and chemicals firms leading the way at 44 percent and 41 percent respectively.
China's Cybersecurity Law, which took effect last year, had disrupted businesses, the survey said, while VPN policies made work harder for 56 percent of companies.
GUARDED OUTLOOK
While tariffs were not popular, 42 percent of respondents favored investment reciprocity as a way to push for change in market access, up from 40 percent last year.
However, those opposed to reciprocity grew to 16 percent from 9 percent last year, and the number of unsure respondents slipped to 31 percent from 44 percent.
""Despite the relative optimism our members feel guarded about the future,"" AmCham said.
Concern about preferential treatment for Chinese firms and pressure for U.S. technology transfers is ""stoking demand for reciprocity in the U.S.-China trading relationship, even if our members generally oppose the use of retaliatory trade tariffs"".
The biggest operational challenge was rising costs, an issue cited by 95 percent of respondents. More than 85 percent said domestic competition was a challenge.
The proportion of companies expecting to be profitable in China was basically flat at about 77 percent, the survey showed, but firms also signaled a slight pullback in investment.

Fifty-three percent of firms increased investment in 2017, down from 55 percent the year before, highlighting a trend of reduced investment growth since a 2012 peak, when 74 percent of respondents said they had boosted investment in China.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Brexit campaigners seek to harden May's EU plan next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - Several Brexit supporters in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party will seek to harden the government's plan on leaving the European Union by changing her customs legislation in parliament next week.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading Brexit campaigner and the chairman of a group of eurosceptic lawmakers, said he was tabling amendments to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, which will be debated and voted upon next week.
Illustrating the divided nature of May's Conservative Party, rival pro-European lawmakers may also use the debate as a chance to further their push for even closer EU ties.
But as the government finally announces its negotiating stance, which is widely seen as a less radical departure than businesses and pro-EU campaigners had feared, the focus will be on Brexit supporters. 
They have been angered by May's proposal to keep strong trade ties with the EU after Britain leaves in March next year, a departure that marks the biggest foreign and trading policy shift in almost half a century.
The customs bill is a technical piece of legislation creating the legal powers for the government to put in place an as yet undetermined customs policy on imposing duties on goods entering the country. It will also have to be debated by parliament's upper chamber before becoming law.
Rees-Mogg said his amendments would try to force the government to put into law its aim that Northern Ireland could not be treated separately, to stop what some Brexit campaigners see as attempts to divide the United Kingdom to ensure there is no return to a hard border with EU member Ireland.
The amendments would also: ensure ""reciprocity of customs collection"" to treat Britain and the EU as equals; put into law that Britain will not be part of the EU's VAT regime; and require that any customs union would be created by primary legislation.
However, their main effect will be to reveal the extent of the unhappiness within May's party. 
Whilst the Conservative eurosceptic faction is large, without the support of the Labour Party - which looks unlikely - or a change of heart by the government, it will not have enough votes to force a change in policy.

A spokeswoman for May said she could not comment on the amendments without having seen them.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 04:58AM ET</span>",Goodbye inverted yield curve? Fed looks for alternative signals to guide policy,"By Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials are scouring new niches of the financial markets to find signals accurate enough to warn the central bank when it is time to stop hiking interest rates before they risk tipping the economy into a recession.
In the run up to previous downturns, the Fed has jacked interest rates to restrictive levels as it sought to temper inflation. This time, the central bank hopes for a softer landing with rates moving just high enough to avoid overheating without ending a nearly decade long expansion.
It is a tricky exercise that pits standard views about the importance of longer term yield curves as signs of recession risk against new variations that look at shorter term interest rates. But it could influence just how far the Fed goes in its current rate hiking cycle. 
New research from staff economists Eric Engstrom and Steven Sharpe, presented at the Fed's June meeting, suggests that some of the traditional warning signs of recession, such as the gap in interest rates between 10-year and 2-year Treasuries, may not be as powerful as analysis that focuses on shorter term rates. 
In particular, they found that the difference in current interest rates on 3-month Treasury bills and those expected in 18 months served as a stronger predictor of recession in the coming year by capturing the market's conviction that the Fed would need to cut rates soon in response to a slowdown.
Their measure showed little recession risk on the horizon - a green light for continued gradual increases in interest rates at a time when some Fed officials have taken the narrowing spread of long-term yields as a sign the Fed should halt its rate hikes now.
According to the new research, the ""near-term"" yield curve captures well formed market expectations about coming economic conditions, but without some of the longer-term concerns that drive other bond yields. (Graphic : https://tmsnrt.rs/2IPQUjQ)
If short-term rates are expected to be lower in the future, it ""indicates the market expects monetary policy to ease, reflecting market expectations that policy will respond to the likelihood or onset of a recession.""
It is not the only new indicator probed by policymakers as a better real-time warning of coming trouble. 
The Atlanta Fed has been looking at the future Fed policy rate implied by eurodollar contracts, a financial security involving dollar deposits in overseas banks that reflects the interest rates investors anticipate in coming months.
""We are doing a lot of work to see what metrics are there to give us signals about weakness in the marketplace...I want to make sure we do all that we can not to miss something,"" Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Raphael Bostic told reporters recently.
Recent research showed that a decline in the expected future federal funds rate implied by eurodollar contracts foreshadowed the start of the last two recessions about a year in advance, while an increase preceded a return to growth. That analysis currently shows rising interest rates in coming years, and thus little near-term recession risk.
As with the research presented at the Fed board, the eurodollar analysis looks at financial market pricing for clues that investors expect the economy to weaken.
The same principle guides the analysis of longer-term securities: when investors demand more to hold a 2-year note than a 10-year bond, that means they are not confident about upcoming economic conditions. 
The advantage of shorter-term yield curves, researchers argue, is that they seem to provide a sharper and more timely signal that is less influenced by larger forces, such as demographics or changes in people's time preferences, that can impact longer-term yields.
DESPERATELY SEEKING ""NEUTRAL""
The hunt for new signals has gained urgency with the flattening of the long-term yield curve since the Fed began raising interest rates in late 2015. 
The difference in yields between 10 and 2-year Treasuries was at less than 0.3 percentage points this week, the lowest since just before the onset of recession in 2007.
That has prompted some Fed officials to call for a halt to rate hikes. In the past, a rise in the 2-year rate above the 10-year one has dependably preceded recession.
The Fed expects to continue raising rates gradually through 2019 to guard against inflation as an expected rush of economic growth follows the recent fiscal stimulus and tax cuts. 
But the impact of that stimulus may fade, and the Fed is trying to balance its desire to insure against inflation with its concern about raising rates so high that it begins to stifle household or business spending. Its aim is to edge the target interest rate to a ""neutral"" level where the economy is growing in line with its long-run potential and inflation is stable. 
The problem with the neutral rate is that it is a hypothetical construct - an ""unobservable variable"" in central bank speak. No one knows exactly what it is and policymakers' vary widely in their estimates of it. 
A more timely take on recession risk could arguably provide a sort of proxy for neutral. If the short term curve flattens, it means investors, at least, think the Fed is approaching its stopping point. 
Engstrom and Sharpe noted that their take on recession indicators may be less affected by ""many of the factors"" that could cause longer term yield curves to flatten, such as a decline in the reward demanded to invest money over longer periods.
It is those other variables that have led some Fed officials to discount the importance of longer-term bonds as a predictor of a recession this time around. 

Other Fed policymakers, though, still see the flattening of the long-term yield curve as significant, even as real economy indicators like home and auto sales, whose slowing might indicate Fed policy is starting to bite, remain healthy.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Economists raise China's 2018 GDP growth forecast despite trade uncertainty,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Analysts have raised their 2018 growth forecasts for China's economy, a surprising result given an escalating trade war with the United States, as they see a deleveraging drive and pollution crackdown having less of an impact than initially expected.
A Reuters poll of 76 economists now predict gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the world's second-biggest economy at 6.6 percent this year, compared with an April pick for 6.5 percent expansion, with the latest forecasts ranging from 6.3 percent to 6.9 percent.
That would be a slowdown from 6.9 percent last year but easily within the government's target of around 6.5 percent.
Since the last poll, China reported better-than-expected first quarter growth of 6.8 percent, as the property market held up despite restrictions on home purchases in many cities and consumer demand was strong. 
Economists expect broad momentum to ease, albeit at a gradual pace, over the rest of the year, with second quarter growth forecast at 6.7 percent, third quarter at 6.6 percent and 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter. 
China will publish its second-quarter GDP and June activity data on Monday at 0200 GMT. 
While the brighter full-year outlook came despite an escalating trade war with the United States, most forecasts were collected before the United States raised the stakes on Tuesday by announcing plans for 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The escalating trade tussle has raised uncertainty about the outlook, which has roiled Chinese financial markets in recent weeks.
China's economy has started to show signs of fatigue as credit expansion slows and domestic demand ranging from government-funded infrastructure investment to consumer spending looks to be softening. 
And the nation's massive export sector may start to feel a larger impact from tariffs, as Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, drawing rapid retaliatory duties by Beijing on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
Amid the backdrop of the trade uncertainty, and in an effort to cushion the hit to the economy from a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending that has driven up corporate borrowing costs, the central bank has freed up more cash for lending by cutting reserve requirements for lenders three times this year. 
C.BANK SUPPORT
UK-based Fathom Consulting said its China activity indicator dipped to a 15-month low of 6.2 percent in May, with the trend reminiscent of a slowdown in growth from late 2013-2015. 
""Back then, just as they are now, the Chinese authorities used monetary stimulus to support short-term growth, repeatedly cutting banks' reserve ratio requirements while denying that the economy was materially slowing,"" Fathom senior economist Joanna Davies wrote in a note Wednesday. 
Analysts expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by another 100 basis points to 14.50 percent in the fourth quarter from the current 15.50 percent, the poll showed. 
The RRR is likely to be cut further in 2019, ending the year at 13.75 percent from the previous expectation of 16.00 percent at end-2019, according to the poll.
Most economists expect China to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 4.35 percent through at least the end of 2019, as the central bank focuses on other monetary policy levers. The PBOC last moved its benchmark policy in October, 2015, by easing rates.
Growth next year will likely cool further to 6.3 percent, according to the survey, unchanged from the April poll.

Economists also predicted annual consumer inflation to be 2.1 percent this year, down from a forecast of 2.3 percent in April, but within government expectations. Inflation in 2019 is likely to tick up to 2.2 percent, the poll showed.

Jose Manuel Romualdez told reporters the first round of talks will be held in Washington and would likely focus on labor, intellectual property and agriculture as Manila looks to boost exports to foreign markets.
""It's just the start and this will take some time, maybe one or two years,"" Romualdez said, adding the Philippines has a $5.4 billion trade surplus with the United States in 2016, one of the country's top trading partners.
Romualdez said a free trade agreement with the world's largest economy was likely to be approved given that the Philippines is a much smaller U.S. trading partner than China and Europe, which have become targets of the Trump administration's ""America First"" trade agenda.
Trade tensions between Washington and China have escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
Annual two-way trade of goods and services between the Philippines and its long-term ally totaled $27 billion in 2016, according to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. It would be Washington's second FTA with a Southeast Asian country after Singapore.
Initial talks on the Philippines-United States FTA were held in November after President Rodrigo Duterte met with U.S Donald Trump during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Manila.
About 75 percent of Philippine exports to the United States already enter the American market duty-free, but Manila wants to gain market access for its garments and textiles, wristwatches and agricultural products, including top export carrageenan and seaweed.

826,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",U.K. Seeks to Strike Trade Deals for Services in New Brexit Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. seeks to strike new trade deals for services around the world as part of a Brexit plan that will tie its goods to European Union rules in a bid to preserve open customs borders with the bloc.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s government on Thursday will publish the plan in a so-called White Paper spanning more than 100 pages, detailing a “comprehensive” vision for future U.K.-EU economic ties, according to details briefed overnight by the Brexit department. It expands on a three-page taster published by May last Friday after she unified her cabinet behind the plan.
The core of the eagerly-anticipated British proposal is for a free-trade area for goods with the EU. The prize for Brexiteers, who oppose the shared rulebook on goods, is the freedom for Britain to devise its own rules and broker trade deals on services, which account for four-fifths of the economy. That in itself will be a challenge -- services agreements are a rarity in world trade.
The proposal “would give the U.K. the flexibility we need to strike new trade deals around the world, in particular breaking new ground for agreements in services,” Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab -- four days into the job -- will say in the foreword to the White Paper, according to his department. ""It would maintain frictionless trade in goods between the U.K. and the EU through a new free trade area, responding to the needs of business.”
David Lidington, May’s de-facto deputy, on Wednesday explained the rationale for keeping Britain tied to EU rules on goods in order to facilitate trade, but not for services.
“It’s in services where regulatory flexibility matters most for both current and future trading opportunities,” Lidington said. While EU rules, known as acquis, on goods have been “stable for about 30 years,” that isn’t true for services, he said. “The risk of unwelcome EU measures coming into play through the acquis on services is much greater.”
The proposal drops plans for mutual recognition of rules in financial services after the EU rejected the idea, the Financial Times reported Thursday, citing an unidentified person who has read a four-page section on the industry in the white paper. Instead, May will seek to enhance “equivalence’’ arrangements that are currently available for third countries, including the U.S., so that Britain’s EU ties are closer than any other nation, it said.
Frustration
The Brexit department provided little new detail in its overnight briefing, and politicians and companies will be poised to search through the white paper for so far unanswered questions on:
May’s EU counterparts have become frustrated at the lack of detail she’s provided until now, and businesses have been clamoring for the government to spell out its position to provide the certainty they need to invest. May aims to cater to both sets of demands with Thursday’s document.
Rebel Plan
With less than nine months to go until Britain’s scheduled departure, time is short to negotiate a deal. Talks on the divorce deal have been largely stalled since March while May tried to coax her divided cabinet into unifying behind proposals to keep the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland open.
The new proposal was crystallized at an all-day cabinet meeting convened by May on Friday, after which she declared she’d finally unified her top team behind a vision for Brexit. While the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson have taken the shine off that, the premier on Monday defended the plan resolutely in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters in her own Conservative Party.
The European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers plan to use a vote in Parliament try to force May to publish the alternative strategy drawn up by Davis, who resigned Sunday evening. A person familiar with the plan said they believed it would show that other options are plausible.
The Brexit department is seeking to win over the potential rebels by saying the new plan respects the public vote in 2016 by pulling Britain out of the customs union and single market, taking back control of its borders, laws and money.
""It is a vision that respects the result of the referendum, and delivers a principled and practical Brexit,"" said Raab, who himself campaigned for Brexit."

829,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","BOJ Is Nowhere Near Raising Rates, Economic Adviser Says","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan is a long way from dialing back its aggressive monetary easing, given that inflation remains far from its 2 percent goal, according to Motoshige Itoh, a member of the government’s economic and fiscal policy council.
“Raising interest rates is out of the question,” Itoh, professor at Gakushuin University in Tokyo, said in an interview on Tuesday, adding that a change in policy direction in the near future would risk upending markets. “They have to be very careful about the turning point.”
Inflation has slowed this year after briefly reaching the halfway point toward the BOJ’s price goal, casting renewed doubt on the effectiveness of the central bank’s monetary easing in spurring price growth. The slowdown in inflation has also quietened earlier talk among market watchers of a possible rise in the central bank’s yield target for 10-year Japanese government debt.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the bank will stick persistently with its monetary easing.
‘Be Tenacious’
Itoh, 66, also believes this is no time for backing down on the central bank’s easing measures. The next policy meeting is July 30-31.
“The BOJ can’t move,” Itoh said. “They should be tenacious. There’s no reason why they should give up,” he added, while recognizing the side effects of the easing program on the financial sector.
While prices are struggling to rise now, Itoh sees promising signs in the Japanese economy that offer hope of stronger inflation to come. Companies are investing more and the tight labor market is accelerating the pace of wage gains, he said.
The government also needs to ensure the momentum in the economy is maintained when a planned sales tax increase happens in October 2019, though an extra budget won’t be necessary this time round, Itoh said.
Incentives for people to buy big-ticket items such as houses are among options the government should consider to prop up demand, he said.
A previous 3 percentage point increase in 2014 pushed the economy into recession and coincided with a weakening of inflation that wiped out the central bank’s initial progress in boosting prices.
Itoh says the risk of a tax-induced recession is smaller this time because the increment is only 2 percentage points, to 10 percent, and some items will be excluded.
“The negative impact on demand will be very small this time,” he said."

The spread between December 2019 and December 2020 eurodollar contracts fell below zero Wednesday for the first time, suggesting short-end traders don’t expect the central bank to raise interest rates at all after next year. In fact, they’re giving slightly better odds that the Fed eases policy over the span instead of tightening it.
The spread’s dip into negative territory is the culmination of a trend months in the making as investors bring forward their expectations for when America’s economic expansion -- and therefore the Fed’s tightening cycle -- will end. It contrasts with the most recent summary of economic projections, which shows that a majority of officials expect to hike rates once or twice in 2020.
The divergence between trader and policy maker expectations is partly a product of contrasting views on whether productivity gains are set to drive further growth, according to TD Securities rates strategist Gennadiy Goldberg.
“The Fed expects productivity to pick up gradually in the coming years, raising the neutral rate,” said Goldberg. “The market appears to be taking an ‘I’ll believe it when I see it’ approach.”
Fed funds futures suggest about three basis points of policy tightening in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Eurodollar futures imply about 40 more basis points of policy tightening this year, should FRA-OIS remain stable, and 33 more basis points in 2019, the data show. "
831,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 03:22PM ET</span>",China vows to hit back over U.S. proposal for fresh tariffs,"By Tony Munroe and Eric Beech
BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China accused the United States of bullying and warned it would hit back after the Trump administration raised the stakes in their trade dispute, threatening 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and rattling global markets.
China's commerce ministry said on Wednesday it was ""shocked"" and would complain to the World Trade Organisation, but did not immediately say how Beijing would retaliate in the dispute between the world's two biggest economies. In a statement, it called the U.S. actions ""completely unacceptable"".
The Chinese foreign ministry said Washington's threats were ""typical bullying"" and described the dispute as a ""fight between unilateralism and multilateralism"". 
U.S. officials on Tuesday issued a list of thousands of Chinese goods to be hit with the new tariffs. The top items by value were furniture at $29 billion of imports in 2017, network routers worth $23 billion last year and computer components to the value of $20 billion.
The list is subject to a two-month public comment period.
Some U.S. business groups and lawmakers from President Donald Trump's own Republican Party who support free trade were critical of the escalating tariffs. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 88-11 in favor of a non-binding resolution calling for Congress to have a role in implementing such tariffs.
Republican U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the U.S. announcement ""appears reckless and is not a targeted approach."" Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan accused China of unfair trade practices but added, ""I don't think tariffs are the right way to go.""
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has supported Trump's domestic tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulation of businesses, but does not back Trump's aggressive tariff policies.
""Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. Imposing taxes on another $200 billion worth of products will raise the costs of every day goods for American families,"" a Chamber spokeswoman said.
Among the potential ways Beijing could hit back are ""qualitative measures,"" a threat that U.S. businesses in China fear could mean anything from stepped-up inspections to delays in investment approvals and even consumer boycotts.
HOLDING UP LICENSES
The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed Chinese officials, said Beijing was considering holding up licenses for U.S. companies, delaying approvals of mergers involving U.S. firms and stepping up border inspections of American goods.
China could also limit visits to the United States by Chinese tourists, a business that state media said is worth $115 billion, or shed some of its U.S. Treasury holdings, Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.
The $200 billion far exceeds the total value of goods China imports from the United States, which means Beijing may need to think of creative ways to respond to such U.S. measures.
It also highlights how dependent U.S. businesses and consumers are on Chinese goods. In Trump's first round of tariffs, China accounted for 20 percent of total U.S. imports, meaning that substitutes were readily available. In this round, China accounted for more than half of the imports.
There was a price to be paid by American companies as government policies legislated winners and losers. 
Home furnishing retailers are expected to be hit particularly hard because China supplies 65 percent of U.S. furniture imports, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The prospect of a 10 percent tariff on Chinese furniture imports sent shares of online home store WayFair Inc (N:W) down nearly 4 percent, while shares of Restoration Hardware (N:RH) tumbled nearly 6 percent.
Auto parts retailers, which would also be affected by the latest tariff threats the U.S. lobbed at China, fell more steeply than the broader market. Shares of  Advance Auto Parts  Inc (N:AAP) were down 1.6 percent,  Autozone Inc  (N:AZO) fell 1.8 percent and O'Reilly Automotive Inc (O:ORLY) almost 2 percent.
Investors fear an escalating Sino-American trade war could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
By early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 0.72 percent, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 0.65 percent, and the Nasdaq was off 0.62 percent.
The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1.12 percent, while the main indexes in Hong Kong (HSI) and Shanghai (SSEC) recovered somewhat after falling more than 2 percent.
Trump has been following through on pledges he made during his 2016 presidential campaign to get tough on China, which he accuses of unfair trade practices including theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer that have led to a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China.
The U.S. president has said he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
The new list targets many more consumer goods than those covered under the tariffs imposed last week, raising the direct threat to consumers and retail firms and increasing the stakes for Republican U.S. lawmakers facing elections in November.
U.S. financial analysts said Trump appeared to believe there was a political benefit to waging a trade war, although that could change quickly amid economic fallout.

""It is now much more likely that the dispute will continue for a prolonged period of time and that we will see ratcheting up of protectionist measures,"" said Elena Duggar, an associate managing director at Moody's, the credit rating agency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Justice Department officials on Wednesday announced the establishment of an anti-fraud task force intended to deter fraud and coordinate investigations to avoid ""piling on,"" where multiple agencies probe the same alleged misconduct.
The task force brings together the Justice Department and U.S. attorneys offices, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who made the announcement along with the heads of the three agencies.
Rosenstein told reporters at a press conference the task force would focus on procurement and grant fraud, securities and commodities fraud, digital currency fraud, money laundering, healthcare fraud and tax fraud.
""The goal is to discourage 'piling on', and instead coordinate with local, state, federal and foreign authorities to achieve a joint result that imposes appropriate punishment without prolonging investigations,"" he said, noting a policy announced in May to encourage better cooperation among government agencies
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is one company that faced an array of probes following revelations it sold diesel cars equipped with software configured to cheat on emissions tests.
VW agreed to pay up to $10 billion to compensate VW owners as part of an FTC settlement, a $2.8 billion criminal fine and $1.5 billion in civil penalties to the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
In a client note in May, the law firm Davis, Polk and Wardell LLP said avoiding multiple investigations for the same conduct ""will likely prove beneficial to institutional clients in highly regulated industries, many of which frequently face simultaneous investigations by multiple agencies and potentially duplicative penalties.""
Rosenstein also said agencies would try to identify problem areas to better target resources. ""Our goal is not to prosecute fraud; our goal is to deter fraud,"" he added.
The CFPB was conceived after the 2007-09 financial crisis to stamp out abusive lending, while the SEC investigates scams targeting retail investors. The FTC pursues consumer fraud based on its mission to probe ""deceptive acts or practices.""

833,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",U.S.-China Trade Talks Grind to a Halt,"(Bloomberg) -- High-level trade talks between the U.S. and China have ground to a halt as the Trump administration threatens to escalate a trade war that shows little sign of abating, according to five people familiar with the matter.
The countries held three rounds of formal negotiations since May, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Vice Premier Liu He in China. But communications between senior members of the Trump and Xi administrations have petered out, and there’s no immediate plan to restart the formal talks, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations aren’t public.
The diplomatic impasse makes it unlikely the two countries will stand down anytime soon from an intensifying trade war that is roiling financial markets and threatening the broadest global upswing in years. The Trump administration on Tuesday released a proposed list of an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods to be hit with tariffs. China’s Commerce Ministry said the tariffs, which cover everything from refrigerators to handbags, are “totally unacceptable.”
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office didn’t reply to an emailed request for comment and the Commerce Department directed queries to the White House, which didn’t immediately respond. A Treasury Department spokesman said the agency doesn’t comment on the secretary’s engagement with counterparts.
Washington and Beijing now have about seven weeks to strike a deal or dig in for a trade war that could upend corporate supply chains and raise prices for consumers. The tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect after Aug. 30, when the administration’s consultation process ends.
“It’s extremely important that when two governments get into this kind of situation with each other that even if they are fighting on the official front, that they have something going on in the background that enables them at some point to declare a sort of ceasefire,” Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “For the time being the two sides aren’t going to acknowledge that. They’re positioning themselves for the end game.”
While there are no formal talks scheduled, dialogue continues between the two countries among lower-level bureaucrats, according to people familiar with the matter. Even as he has slapped duties on Chinese goods, President Donald Trump has continued to emphasize his personal friendship with President Xi Jinping. The administration has also sent signals it’s willing to re-engage with China at the top level, said a person familiar with the administration’s thinking.
But there are growing signs of frustration on both sides. On a conference call with reporters Tuesday, senior Trump administration officials argued that China started the conflict with unfair trading practices and abuse of U.S. intellectual property. One of the officials said the U.S. has repeatedly made its concerns clear and continues to hope for a negotiated solution, but Beijing hasn’t changed its behavior.
Confusing Signs
Tensions within the Trump administration over trade are also complicating matters, according two people familiar with the matter. As the de facto spokesman on economic matters within the cabinet, Mnuchin took the lead early in the negotiations. But at different points in the talks, other more hawkish members of the administration have taken the helm, such Ross, which has confused the Chinese.
Trump himself is frustrated with Beijing’s reluctance to offer more concessions, especially after the U.S. reversed a decision to slap crippling restrictions on Chinese telecom-equipment maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., according to a White House official who declined to be identified. The U.S. last month agreed to lift the measures after ZTE pays a record fine and consents to management changes. On Wednesday, the Trump administration said ZTE took another step toward ending a U.S. ban after ZTE signed an escrow agreement. The company must now deposit $400 million in escrow.
The president also believes China hasn’t been helpful enough in U.S. efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, said the White House official.
“We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea,” Trump said on Twitter on Monday. “China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!”
Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said he had a “great deal of concern” about the trade spat with China and the level of uncertainty it’s creating among farmers and businesses in his state. Futures for soybeans, a target for China’s retaliation, have fallen about 16 percent since the end of May, as the trade conflict was heating up.
“When you don’t know what’s going to be the outcome, it’s very uncertain, and it’s had a definite impact,” Grassley told Bloomberg TV. “How long is this going to go on? I hope we can settle pretty soon.”"

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank supervisors will give euro zone banks extra time to set cash aside against their bad loans if their pile of soured debt is particularly high, the ECB said on Wednesday.
It was announcing long-delayed guidelines aimed at bringing down a 721 billion euro ($837.01 billion) pile of unpaid debt, mostly inherited from the 2008-12 economic crisis and concentrated in Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Italy.
The guidelines were the result of a compromise among supervisors after an earlier proposal to set the same timeframe for all banks had met with resistance from bankers, lawmakers and even within the ECB itself, as reported by Reuters last month.
Under the new rules, the ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will set ""bank-specific supervisory expectations"" for the provision of non-performing loans (NPLs), while using benchmarks to ensure consistency.
""The bank-specific supervisory expectations are based on a benchmarking of comparable banks and guided by individual banks’ current NPL ratio and main financial features,"" the ECB said.
Its aim ""over the medium term"" is to achieve the same coverage for old non-performing loans as is the case with new ones, for which banks have to provide in full.
No further detail was given.
ENDING THE CRISIS
Wednesday's short announcement was the supervisor's last-ditch effort to salvage the final piece of a three-year effort to draw a line under the euro zone's debt and banking crisis.
The chair of the supervisor, Daniele Nouy, has until the end of the year to establish her legacy before stepping down, followed a month later by her deputy Sabine Lautenschlaeger.
But the issue of unpaid loans has driven a rift between a handful of countries where banks still have a large amount of bad loans such as Italy, which did not bail out its banks during the crisis, and the rest.
This has caused the ECB to delay the publication of the new rules, originally expected in March, and the supervisor said in April it was considering whether further policies were necessary at all.
The SSM has already introduced rules on loans that go unpaid, giving banks seven years to provide for them if they are backed by collateral and two if they are not.
It had initially envisaged applying these rules to the stock of legacy loans.
But an impact-assessment study by staff in the ECB’s monetary policy arm highlighted risks to the financial system because some banks would be forced to set aside billions of euros to provide for their soured credit.
This has proven an elusive feat for weaker banks such as Italy's Monte Paschi, which needed state help in late 2016 after failing to raise money on the market.

The SSM, which is formally separated from the rest of the ECB, had come up with a more benign outcome by assuming banks would continue reducing their stock of bad loans, as they have done for the past two years.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",EU and BoE clash over fate of financial contracts after Brexit,"By Francesco Guarascio and Huw Jones
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday that existing financial contracts, such as derivatives or insurance, are unlikely to be affected by Britain's departure from the European Union - a view the Bank of England described as ""wrong headed"".
The BoE has said 82 billion pounds' ($109 billion) of insurance liabilities involving 48 million policyholders could be disrupted across Britain and the European Economic Area. Derivatives worth a notional 26 trillion pounds are also caught in the Brexit crosshairs.
""Overall, even after Brexit, the performance of existing obligations can generally continue,"" Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference, citing insurance and derivatives contracts as examples.
That appeared to soften the line Dombrovskis took in May, when he declined to offer guarantees on existing contracts in a hearing at the European Parliament.
Britain and the EU have agreed on a ""standstill"" transition period whereby EU rules remain in force in Britain until the end of 2020, which would ensure continuity in cross-border financial contracts such as insurance policies and derivatives.
But this transition is part of a broader divorce settlement that is still being negotiated, and will not be legally watertight until it is finalised before Britain pulls out in March.
Dombrovskis said supervisors and firms needed to look separately at each type of contract, but added that at this stage he did not foresee a general problem. ""It does not appear to be at this juncture an issue of general nature linked to contract continuity,"" he told reporters.
SIMPLY IMPRACTICAL
BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods told British lawmakers on Wednesday that both Britain and the EU needed to act to ensure continuity in derivatives and insurance contracts.
It was ""simply impractical"" to leave it to banks and insurers to move contracts from Britain to hubs in the EU before next March as there won't be enough time, he said.
""I think that's wrong headed, and I think in the end that view will change,"" Woods added.
Banks and insurers are hoping that a joint BoE and European Central Bank working group set up to look at maintaining orderly markets around Brexit Day next March will help to spur the EU to take action.
Britain said last year it would legislate, if need be, to ensure that branches of EU banks in London could continue serving UK customers after next March.
Woods said this commitment was the ""linchpin"" of how the BoE will deal with 160 EU branches, even though the EU reiterated on Wednesday it won't reciprocate for banks in Britain who serve customers in the EU.
The government hopes to publish draft legislation for a ""temporary permissions regime"" for EU branches before the summer parliamentary recess, Woods said.
The regime would last three years from next March, beyond the end of the proposed transition period, giving the BoE time to reauthorize EU branches.
Woods said it was a ""sore point"" that EU banking regulators have stated banks were not ready if Britain crashed out of the EU next March. The BoE has said banks in Britain could cope with a disorderly Brexit.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>",How to shockproof your retirement healthcare costs,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
Financial planner David Haas’ client was traumatized in the dentist chair, but it was not the drill that scared her.
It was the dentist’s bad news: The woman needed thousands of dollars in dental work, and she had never imagined such expenses when she retired a few months earlier. “What if it happens over and over again? Will I run out of money?” she asked Haas, her Franklin Lakes, New Jersey financial planner.
Haas assured her they had added up all her living expenses before she retired at 65, and she would be fine even if she lived to 95.
Other retirees are not as fortunate, however, and they fear a medical shock will drain their savings. In a national survey by Brightwork Partners, four in five baby boomers said they worry but they are too confused to plan for medical costs. 
Tools are on the way. While most retirement healthcare research focuses on broad lifetime numbers, like Fidelity's recent estimate that a couple will spend $280,000 on healthcare costs in retirement, a new study by Mercer Health and Benefits and Vanguard Research broke it down more specifically. 
The goal is to develop a model pre-retirees can use to estimate healthcare spending on an annual basis to allow for basic budgeting. That can help set savings goals and also give people time to delay retirement if needed. Then they can be more prepared for that unexpected $1,500 dental crown. 
MAKE A BUDGET 
The researchers found that the average 65-year-old woman retiring on Medicare in 2018 will start out spending $5,200 in a year to pay for medical expenses - including Medicare, additional health insurance, and out-of-pocket costs that are not covered by insurance. 
By age 85, the cost jumps to $10,100 per year - or $13,900 for a less healthy person. Older people need more care than people in their 60s, and researchers see healthcare inflation starting at 6.6 percent a year, but trending to 4.5 percent over time.    
The researchers came to these numbers by calculating what it costs to be on Medicare, which starts with a monthly fee of $134 a month for Medicare Part B. Then, come extra costs buying Medicare supplemental insurance, or what’s known as Medigap, to pick up doctor and other bills that Medicare does not pay completely. The retiree would also buy drug coverage through Medicare Part D.
Together, all three forms of insurance cost an estimated $3,600 for the year, researchers estimated.  
Dental, vision, some drugs and extras like hearing aids are not covered, so that figures into the average $1,600 spent out of pocket.
Cutting out the supplemental insurance cost is often not a cost-saving move. Early retirees with health problems who do that could spend $7,200, according to the Mercer/Vanguard study. 
    
PREPARE FOR SHOCKS
Before retiring, Vanguard Retirement Strategist Maria Bruno suggested people quiz themselves about their health. If they have conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, heart disease or cancer, they are higher risk and spending will likely be more than the $5,200 per year at age 65.  
The greatest shocks will occur if people need long-term nursing care at over $90,000 a year, but the researchers found only one in seven will face those costs for two years or more.
People may have a family member who can help with care and hold down the cost, said doctor and financial planner Carolyn McClanahan, of Jacksonville, Florida. 
Rather than panicking over possible costs in advance, McClanahan has clients think ahead about lifestyle issues that could affect expenses. For example, as they age they could move close to a family member who could help with care, or they could sell a home and use the proceeds to cover assisted living or a nursing home. 
And always have an emergency fund. McClanahan has clients budget $10,000 to $20,000 a year for all unforeseen costs for the home or health.  
One way to amass a healthcare emergency fund if a person is still working is to pick health insurance with a high deductible. Such plans often let people put up to $6,900 a year into a Health Savings Account that can be saved until needed for retirement and is not taxed.
A one-year health shock often is not repeated, but expect the unexpected.

“You can’t predict 30 years; not even 10,” McClanahan said. “You will never get the money figured out on the nose.”

The tariffs, along with related uncertainty about U.S. trade policy that hangs over Canada's export-driven economy, will subtract about 2/3 percent from GDP by the end of 2020, the central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy report.
""The size and timing of the effects (of the U.S. tariffs) will depend on multiple factors, including the capacity of Canadian exporters to absorb the tariff costs or to pass them on to their U.S. customers,"" the bank said.
The U.S. tariffs on C$16.6 billion of Canadian steel and aluminum imports - about 2.5 percent of total Canadian exports - will cut the level of real Canadian exports by C$3.6 billion, or about 0.6 percent, the bank said.
The 25 percent U.S. steel tariff will reduce exports by about 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, while the 10 percent aluminum tariff will trim Canadian exports by about 0.2 percent, according to estimates by the central bank. 
The impact will be felt mostly in the second half of 2018, but could take longer to materialize, it said.
Separately, Canada's retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6 billion of U.S. imports, mainly steel and aluminum but also consumer products, will cut real imports by C$3.9 billion, or about 0.6 percent, starting in the third quarter, the bank estimated.
""They are also likely to have complex effects on other sectors of the Canadian economy, notably through higher costs for users of steel, iron and aluminum, as well as for firms using other items made from these products,"" it said.
The two sets of tariffs will temporarily boost CPI inflation by about 0.1 percentage point until the third quarter of 2019.
""Consumers' purchasing power would be reduced, which would weigh on household spending,"" the bank said.

The U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs were imposed on June 1, while Canada's countermeasures took effect on July 1.

840,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 10:13AM ET</span>",JPMorgan CEO Dimon issues stark warning about 'catastrophic' events if Italy leaves the euro," JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon has warned Italy's populist government of the likely ""catastrophic"" consequences that would come from attempts to pull the country out of the eurozone.
 Speaking to Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Dimon said that because of the structure of the European Monetary Union — the formal name for the project to converge monetary policy of the eurozone — pulling out would not only be immensely difficult, but also immensely dangerous for the stability of the global financial system.
""Because of the way it has been designed, the European Monetary Union would be hard to reverse without causing catastrophic events,"" Dimon told the paper.
""This does not mean that Europe should not fix itself; there are many regulatory issues that remain to be solved, and the fact that Brexit happened should make the dialogue between European countries easier.""
Dimon's comments come as Italy's populist coalition government, comprised of the Lega Nord and Five Star Movement, repeatedly publicly mentioning pulling out of the euro in the lead up to the creation of that government.
Official policy is that the government backs remaining in the European Union, but Matteo Salvini, the Lega Nord's leader, is an avowed eurosceptic, and is believed to privately back an exit.
In May, a leaked report, published in part by the Huffington Post, showed that both the parties discussed a commitment to leave the euro prior to entering into government, before abandoning that pledge.
Whether or not the parties push for an exit from the euro, the fact that such a proposal almost formed a part of their plan for government marked a huge moment for the eurozone.
Italy is one of the three most crucial members of the eurozone project, alongside France and Germany. Italy is the third biggest economy in the group and the largest in southern Europe. If Italy were to make attempts to withdraw from the EMU, it would undoubtedly be a huge market event.
Elsewhere in his interview with Il Sole 24 Ore, Dimon also warned that Brexit ""could turn out to be tough for the British people.""
""I think Brexit could turn out to be tough for the British people because of its impact on British growth: if there is going to be less growth in the UK, this will have an impact on global growth, and so Brexit could hurt everybody a bit."""
841,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Hikes Rates, Warns of Mounting Trade Tensions","Investing.com - The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, although it warned of volatile growth prospects and uncertainty surrounding trade tensions with the U.S.
The BoC lifted its overnight cash rate to 1.50% from the prior 1.25%.
That’s its fourth rate hike over the past year, in line with the forecast of 14 out of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The BoC noted that Canada’s economy continues to operate close to its capacity and the composition of growth is shifting, although it warned that “temporary factors are causing volatility in quarterly growth rates”.
The central bank forecast that the Canadian economy would grow 2.8% in the second quarter before moderating to 1.5% in the third. Overall, the BOC expects average growth of 2% for this year through 2020.
“Business investment is growing in response to solid demand growth and capacity pressures, although trade tensions are weighing on investment in some sectors,” the BoC noted.
It also projected CPI inflation to edge up further to about 2.5% before settling back to 2% by the second half of 2019.
The central bank said that its projection incorporates an estimate of the impact of trade uncertainty on Canadian investment and exports.
“This effect is now judged to be larger, given mounting trade tensions,” the BoC stated.
Although Wednesday’s rate hike was already priced in, most analysts believe that the BoC will tighten at a gradual pace as the central bank observes developments in trade tensions.
Odds of an additional hike by the end of this year are priced in at around 50%, while economists predict that a further two increases will take place over the next 12 months, bringing rates to 2.0%.
The central bank's governor, Stephen Poloz, will hold a press conference at 11:15 AM ET (15:15 GMT) where he is expected to outline the BoC’s outlook."
842,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>","ECB policymakers split on meaning of `through summer', and on timing of rate hike","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are split over when the ECB might raise interest rates next year, with some saying an increase is possible as early as July 2019 and others ruling out a move until autumn, according to several sources.
The ECB said last month it expected to keep rates at their current, record-low levels ""through the summer"" of 2019, wording vague enough to leave the exact meaning open to debate.
Investors took the phrase to mean rates would not go up until October or even December of next year. But policymakers speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity gave different interpretations.
For some, the guidance explicitly ruled out any move until the summer is over, meaning after Sept. 21 at the earliest.
""That's the only possible interpretation,"" one of the sources said.
That would suggest the Oct. 24 meeting would be the earliest opportunity for a move, some rate-setters argued.
But others saw the wording as vague enough to allow for a rate hike at the July 25 meeting if the outlook for inflation called for it.
""You cannot tie yourself for more than a year,"" another source said. 
The message could be clarified closer to the time in light of economic developments, the source said.
All sources added that policymakers did not debate the meaning of this guidance, a possible reason for the differing interpretations.
Some expressed annoyance with an overly dovish message by ECB President Mario Draghi that pushed rate hike expectations to December, a date hawks consider too late.
A recent rise in oil prices is increasing the risk that inflation could accelerate more than expected, but Draghi warned about the risks to economic growth from increasing trade protectionism around the globe.
The ECB declined to comment. 
French central bank Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Wednesday the ECB could raise rates ""at the earliest through the summer of 2019"", wording slightly different than the ECB's guidance for unchanged rates through the summer. 
Since the June policy meeting, the ECB has even corrected the translations of its statement in several languages, including French and German, to remove a reference to the end of the summer.
Some of the more hawkish members of the policy-making Governing Council saw that as a victory of sort, fearing that the ECB may come to regret pushing out investor expectations too far. 
Pressed about the meaning of ""through the summer"" at his latest press conference, Draghi also declined to pin that to a specific month.
""If it had meant September, we would've said September,"" Draghi said in Riga on June 14. 

The ECB now expects inflation to average 1.7 percent this year and the following two, which some see as compatible with its deliberately vague target of close to but below 2 percent.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",EU Commission to closely monitor Greece after bailout,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission decided on Wednesday on measures to closely monitor Greece's fiscal policy after it concludes a euro zone-funded bailout program next month.
The move follows a deal reached by euro zone finance ministers and Greece in June that included new debt relief for Athens and a strict monitoring of its application of agreed reforms in coming years.
The so-called ""enhanced surveillance"" will allow the European Commission to closely scrutinize Greece's respect of commitments it made in return for billions of euros of loans under the existing bailout program, the third since 2010.
""Enhanced surveillance is not a fourth program: it involves no new commitments or conditions. It is a framework to support the completion and delivery of ongoing reforms,"" European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said, dismissing criticism that the scheme would give euro zone lenders excessive controls over Greece's economy.
Other bailed-out EU countries, like Ireland and Portugal, were subject in past years to monitoring after the end of their financial aid programs, but enhanced surveillance would go beyond the controls applied so far.
Under the scheme, EU officials will visit Athens every three months, instead of annually as in past post-program schemes, to spot early risks and make sure Athens continues applying agreed reforms on tax, pensions and labor market after its bailout ends on August 20.
To provide an incentive for future governments in Athens not to reverse the hard won reforms adopted under the bailouts, euro zone countries have agreed to offer Greece cash payments of 600 million euros every six months until 2022 if it sticks to the economic course agreed with creditors.
The money will come from profits made by euro zone central banks on their holdings of Greek bonds that will gradually mature over the next four years.
Under the deal reached in June by euro zone lenders, before the bailout program ends Greece will receive a last tranche of loans worth 15 billion euros to increase its cash buffer and service its debt.
Euro zone lenders will meet on Friday to ""consider"" this final disbursement, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the bloc's bailout fund, said in a statement.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>",U.S. regulator shelves reform on voting in board fights: sources,"By Liana B. Baker and Michelle Price
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has shelved a proposed Obama-era reform that would have given shareholders in companies more freedom to vote for their preferred candidates during contested board elections, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The proposal made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) two weeks before President Donald Trump's election victory would have changed how shareholders vote during activist investor-led fights for board seats, an issue that has divided companies and investors for years.
SEC officials have said publicly in recent months that the proposed rule-change remains a priority, raising hopes among activist investors who have pushed for changes, including Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management's William Ackman, that the SEC will finalize and implement the rule soon.
However, several people familiar with the matter told Reuters the Commission's new boss Jay Clayton has in fact shelved the proposal, in what will be a disappointment for many investors who say the current system favors company management in board fights.
Right now, shareholders voting remotely have to choose from a full slate of board directors nominated by the management or a competing set of nominees provided by an activist investor. 
Unlike in many countries such as Canada and Australia, U.S. investors cannot mix and match from these competing lists unless they send a representative to vote in person at the annual meeting. 
According to the SEC, the vast majority of votes in the United States are cast remotely, so such constraints can influence who ultimately ends up controlling the board and company strategy.
Activist investors say the present system works against them because shareholders are more likely to play it safe and vote for the management list, even if they like some of the activists' candidates. Companies say changing the rules would spark more disruptive and harmful activist-led fights.
In October 2016, the SEC under Clayton's predecessor Mary Jo White proposed the so-called ""universal proxy"" rule allowing shareholders to remotely vote from a mix-and-match list.
But Trump's victory subsequently saw the Republican party, which is eager to loosen rules it says are deterring firms from going public, take over the SEC with Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar becoming acting chair in January 2017 until Clayton's appointment in May 2017. 
The people, who declined to be named because internal SEC discussions are private, said the ""universal proxy"" proposal was dead for the foreseeable future.
They said it was unlikely Clayton, a political independent who leans toward the right, would support the rule given he has said his priority is to boost company listings. 
While Piwowar, who strongly opposed the rule, finished his term this month, Clayton's vote would likely still be necessary to finalize the changes, one of the people said. 
For a rule change to pass, the majority of commissioners must vote for it. 
Hester Peirce, the other Republican commissioner, told Reuters she had ""not come to any conclusions"" on the issue and would need to review all the industry comments before doing so. 
The proposal is still on the agency's official long-term agenda, but has fallen off a list of its 12-month priorities drawn-up in March. 
While some senior SEC officials would like to reprise the rule, this is unlikely to happen under the current administration, the people said.
Clayton declined to comment.
CORPORATE LOBBY 
Tim Goodman, director at Hermes EOS, the stewardship arm of Hermes Investment Management which advises clients with $464 billion of assets, says the current U.S. system causes ""practical difficulties for shareholders, including ourselves, who have to take account of the time and cost of attending the meeting in person.""
Goodman said that Hermes, which votes on behalf on clients who invests in more than 10,000 companies globally, would vote for different directors in some U.S. board fights if the rules were changed.
Kai Liekefett, head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Sidley Austin LLP, said in several recent proxy fights, including the high profile contests at Automatic Data Processing (O:ADP) in 2017 and DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) in 2015, several large institutional investors were interested in voting for both activist and management candidates, but were not able to do so under the current system.
While investors say they are losing out, business groups, most notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have lobbied to preserve the status quo. The influential group has argued the new rule would increase fights, balkanize boards, and discourage listings, according to a public letter.
But investors and groups representing pension funds cite academic evidence disputing the notion it would favor activist investors and prompt more fights. 
A Harvard Law School study of contests between 2001 and 2016 found that a mix-and-match ballot did not favor special interests or spark more fights. In some cases, it could even favor the management.
For example, New Jersey-based Destination Maternity (O:DEST), which had its entire board ousted after losing a shareholder vote in May, would have seen some management nominees keep their seats had investors been able to choose from both slates of candidates, according to people familiar with the vote. 
In fact, even without an SEC mandate, some companies adopt a universal proxy when they fear activist campaigns to replace their entire board are getting traction, because that way they can try to have some of their nominees voted through.
Investors said they are not giving up. 
Chris Phillips, director of institutional relations at the Washington State Investment Board, said he met Peirce in March to try to persuade her to back the rule change. 

""Requiring physical attendance at many shareholder meetings in order to exercise such votes is impractical and antiquated,"" Phillips told Reuters in an email.

847,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 11:
1. Trump Escalates U.S.-China Trade War With $200B Tariff Threat
The Trump administration raised the stakes in its trade dispute with China, threatening 10% tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports late Tuesday, pushing the world's two biggest economies ever closer to a full-scale trade war.
The tariffs will not go into effect immediately but will undergo a two-month review process, with hearings August 20-23.
Washington proposed the extra tariffs after efforts to negotiate a solution to the dispute failed to reach an agreement, senior administration officials said.
China accused the U.S. of bullying and warned it would hit back, but did not immediately say how it would retaliate.
It was the latest development in escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Last week, Washington imposed 25% tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing responded immediately with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
Investors are worried that threats of higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures by others could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
2. Trump Arrives At NATO Summit; Launches Tirade At Germany
Meanwhile, Trump kicked off his visit to Europe at a summit of leaders of NATO countries in Brussels, where he is expected to hammer home his calls on other countries to spend more on defense.



While not on the summit's official agenda, European leaders will voice their trade concerns to Trump, diplomats said.
Trump has vowed to stick to his promises of protection for U.S. industries against what he says is unfair competition from the European Union.



Speaking at a press conference in front of NATO representatives ahead of the two-day summit, Trump launched a scathing attack on Germany, saying a flurry of oil and gas deals had given Russia far too much influence over the continent’s largest economy.
In particular, he singled out the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project as being especially ""inappropriate.""
“Germany is totally controlled by Russia … They will be getting between 60% and 70% of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that is appropriate because I think it's not,” Trump said, before criticizing Berlin's failure to significantly increase defense spending.
3. Fresh Shots In Trade War Drag World Stocks Lower
Global stocks traded sharply lower, as investors sold off risk-sensitive assets following the latest escalation in trade war rhetoric from the White House.
Stocks in Asia were hit hard on the news, with Chinese markets faring the worst. The Shanghai Composite index lost 1.8%, and the blue-chip CSI300 index dropped around 1.7%.
Elsewhere, European shares were down more than 1% in mid-morning trade, with all sectors in the red. Basic resources and autos, seen among the sectors most at risk of a trade war, led losses. Among national indexes, Germany's export-heavy DAX slumped 1.2%, while Britain's FTSE declined 1.3%.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures pointed to a sharp drop at the open. The blue-chip Dow futures were down 220 points, or around 0.9% at 5:30AM ET, the S&P 500 futures dropped 22 points, or roughly 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline of 69 points, or about 1%.
4. Dollar Edges Higher Against Main Rivals 
Away from equities, the dollar edged higher against a currency basket, as U.S. threats of tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods prompted knee-jerk selling of riskier assets against less vulnerable currencies.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.3% to 94.18.
Meanwhile, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield inching down to 2.84%.
The economic calendar will be light with producer prices for the month of June due at 8:30AM ET the only economic report of note.
5. Oil Prices Sink; Fresh Weekly U.S. Inventory Data Ahead
Oil prices were under pressure, with Brent dropping by more than $1, as investors digested the latest developments in the deepening trade conflict between the U.S. and China and after the U.S. said it would consider requests for waivers from sanctions due to snap back into place on Iranian crude exports.
Brent crude futures were down $1.70, or almost 2.2%, at $77.16 a barrel. U.S. crude was down 56 cents, or 0.8%, at $73.55.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended July 6 at 10:30AM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 4.4 million barrels.
The data will also offer fresh indications on how fast domestic output levels continue to rise. U.S. crude production - driven by shale extraction - is currently at an all-time high of 10.9 million barrels per day (bpd).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 6.8 million barrels last week.

Britain leaves the European Union next March and although a ""standstill"" transition deal has been agreed with Brussels lasting to the end of 2020, it is unclear what sort of trading links Britain will have with Europe after then.
Some UK lawmakers see Brexit as an opportunity to row back on EU rules, but Randell saw no appetite for this among firms themselves.
""I don't think any of the financial firms I meet want to win business through a regulatory race to the bottom,"" Randell told a Reuters Newsmaker event.
Regulators across the world have approved a welter of new rules since banks had to be rescued by taxpayers in the 2007-09 financial crisis.
Randell said there is a consensus among the industry and consumer groups that the volume of regulatory change is unsustainable.
""We need to make sure that the pace of regulatory change is carefully managed, given all the other pressures on firms' business models,"" Randell said in his first major speech since becoming chair of the FCA in April.

There was room to review existing rules for ""unintended consequences"", he said.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",China's June exports seen solid as trade war with U.S. heats up,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports growth is expected to have cooled only slightly in June, possibly further boosting a trade surplus with the United States in a test for Beijing as it tries to weather a volley of U.S. tariffs on its goods that many fear could harm its economy.
The Trump administration on Tuesday raised the stakes in its trade dispute with China, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items.
Washington's latest move came only days after it imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, drawing rapid retaliatory duties by Beijing on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
All the same, given the most recent round of tit-for-tat tariffs went into effect only on Friday, there has been little impact on China's overseas shipments to date.
""All in all, the trade impact of the first round of the tariff should have a very limited impact on China's exports to the U.S., with the maximum loss of $5 billion,"" Alicia Garcia Herrero, Chief Economist at Natixis Asia Research, wrote in a recent note.
That view was backed by the Reuters poll of 39 economists, which forecast Chinese exports growth of 10 percent year-on-year in June, cooling slightly from a 12.6 percent rise in May.
China's Ministry of Commerce said last week it would encourage exporters to develop new export markets, and would also use funds collected from tariffs to ease the impact from U.S. trade actions on companies.
Imports growth was also expected to remain solid at 20.8 percent last month, the third straight month of 20-plus percent growth, albeit slowing again from the 26 percent surge in May.
FOCUS ON CHINA'S US TRADE SURPLUS
There is also likely to be considerable focus on the U.S.-China trade balance as U.S. President Donald Trump has railed against China's sizable surplus with the world's no. 1 economy and has demanded Beijing take measures to cut it.
The poll showed China's overall trade surplus likely widened to $27.61 billion in June from $24.92 billion in May. There was no separate forecast on China's trade surplus with the United States which has continued to grow even as its total surplus has narrowed over the last two years.
China ran a $375 billion goods trade surplus with the United States in 2017.
Worryingly, there have been few signs that either Beijing or Washington are prepared to ratchet down the trade frictions.
China said on Wednesday that the latest U.S. actions were ""completely unacceptable"" and that it would be forced to respond.
While there have been few signs the trade tussle is having a broader impact so far, analysts expect China's export growth to slow in the second half of the year and fear that a prolonged row with the U.S. could put an already slowing economy on the skids.
The commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading shipments to the U.S. to get ahead of expected tariffs - a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward year-end.
""I think Chinese leaders do think they will obviously be hit significantly by all this damage from a trade war but they think they can probably ride it out economically,"" said Louis Kuijs, Hong Kong-based Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.

850,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Mobius Says Trade War Is Just a Warm-Up Act for Financial Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- A U.S.-China trade war and a further 10 percent drop in emerging-market stocks might not be the worst things to happen this year, according to Mark Mobius. The veteran investor in developing nations also sees a worldwide financial crisis on the horizon.
“There’s no question we’ll see a financial crisis sooner or later because we must remember we’re coming off from a period of cheap money,” he said in an interview in Singapore. “There’s going to be a real squeeze for many of these companies that depended upon cheap money to keep on going.”
Tighter liquidity as the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank normalize monetary policy has weighed on emerging markets this year, along with the rising dollar and deteriorating trade backdrop. The dispute between the U.S. and China will probably worsen as President Donald Trump is unlikely to suffer much blow-back from his tariffs, as their inflationary impact will be matched by rising U.S. wages at a time when unemployment is low, Mobius said.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index will likely fall another 10 percent from current levels, predicted Mobius, who left Franklin Templeton Investments earlier this year to set up Mobius Capital Partners LLP. That would tip the gauge, which has fallen around 16 percent from a peak in late January, into a bear market.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index has dropped around 7 percent from a high in late March, forcing central banks from Turkey to Argentina and Indonesia to raise rates to defend their currencies. The rate hikes may be a “short-term fix,” but could be counter-productive for countries with high amounts of debt, Mobius said, adding that governments need to put their finances in order to restore investor confidence.
Despite all the gloom, the 81-year-old investor sees the slump as a buying opportunity and is seeking to raise funds. Here are his predictions for some of the potential winners from a trade war:

""Net asset purchases should end in December; the first interest rate rise could take place at the earliest through the summer of 2019 depending on the inflation outlook,"" Villeroy told a financial conference in Paris.
The ECB said in June it expected its key interest rates to stay unchanged at least ""through"" the summer of 2019, leaving investors guessing whether it could mean a decision during the summer or only later.

Financial markets have since positioned for a first rate move closer toward the end of 2019 despite the ECB's guidance, largely echoed by Villeroy in his comments.

From a year earlier, advance gross domestic product (GDP) was forecast to rise 4.0 percent in April-June, according to the median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Reuters, slower than the 4.4 percent growth posted for January-March.
The government's advance estimate of second-quarter GDP will be released at 0000 GMT on Friday.
""The modest easing is nothing more than a normalization process amid the peaking of the electronics cycle and higher interest rates,"" said Irvin Seah, an economist at DBS Bank.
""(But) clouds on the horizon are gathering. Trade tensions between Singapore's two largest export markets, the U.S. and China, could indirectly affect Singapore,"" he said in a note.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry has forecast full-year growth of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 2018. Manufacturing and exports of electronics were one of Singapore's main drivers of growth last year, leading to a 3.6 percent rise in GDP in 2017, the fastest pace in three years.
""Despite trade war risks and sharper exports deceleration, manufacturing has been fairly resilient; partly boosted by services aspect of manufacturing,"" Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank in Singapore, said in a research note last week.
However, a decline in electronics exports for six consecutive months has raised questions about overall demand in the sector.
GDP is expected to have grown 1.2 percent in April to June from the previous three months in a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis, according to the median of forecasts from nine economists slower than the 1.7 percent expansion in the first quarter.
Earlier this month, the Monetary Authority of Singapore warned risks to the global growth outlook have increased significantly thanks to the intensifying trade row and the rising prospect of a rapid acceleration in inflation.
Krystal Tan at Capital Economics said that, for now, she expected Singapore's central bank to stand pat in its next policy review in October as risks to growth pick up while inflation remains benign.
In April, the central bank tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years. Analysts are split over whether April's move is the start of a longer-term tightening of monetary policy.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",Australia's banking watchdog says crackdown on risky lending largely complete,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog on Wednesday said its intense crackdown on risky mortgage lending was largely complete, as higher lending rates were also helping cool the country's housing market.
""Any tightening from here on is expected to be at the margin as banks seek to get a better handle on borrower expenses, and better visibility of borrower debt commitments,"" said Wayne Byres, Chairman of the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA).
His comments come as the country's scandal-hit banks are expected to hike mortgage rates even as the official rate remains steady, piling pressure on home prices which have already fallen for nine straight months.
Addressing economists in Sydney on the mortgage market and the good health of banks balance sheets, Byres also said 13 of the country's largest banks had passed ""severe but plausible"" stress tests applied by the regulator.
The large banks, which control about 80 percent of the A$1.7 trillion ($1.26 trillion) housing loan market, were expected to continue focusing on developing strong lending policies, including their own internal limits to new risky lending.
A powerful inquiry into misconduct in the sector that uncovered cases of fraud and loose lending standards by the country's largest lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) - has triggered a move to tighten their controls.
""Lending to investors is certainly now growing more slowly compared to three or four years ago. But despite the tightening in lending standards ... lending to owner-occupiers grew at a very healthy 8 per cent over the past year,"" Byres said.
In May, the regulator scrapped a strict cap on lending to property investors introduced four years ago to rein in speculative investments, as high-risk lending had moderated as desired.
Investor loan growth had fallen to close to 2 percent, only a fifth the rate in 2015, according to APRA's records.
Byres said the regulator would ""remain alert to slippage,"" a reference to smaller lenders and non-bank lenders, which according to analysts have grown mortgages at about 12 percent annually.
After the positive stress test results, APRA will put pressure on banks to fine tune their systems to respond to and recover from severe shocks effectively, Byres said.
""Despite significant losses, these (test) results nevertheless provide a degree of reassurance: banks remained above regulatory minimum levels in very severe stress scenarios,"" Byres said.
Regular testing of rescue plans would help build confidence that the governance and escalation procedures were well understood, he added.

856,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",China Has Arsenal of Non-Tariff Weapons to Hit Back at Trump,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of imported Chinese goods could see China retaliate with a wide range of non-tariff barriers.
Because China only imports around $130 billion worth of goods from the U.S., its ability to match the tariffs dollar-for-dollar is limited. The U.S. imported $505 billion of goods from China last year.
While China may jack up existing tariffs beyond the 25 percent level imposed so far, it could also inflict significant pain by increasing regulatory oversight of American companies, slowing down approvals processes, canceling orders for U.S. goods or encouraging consumer boycotts.
Big American companies including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). host large operations in China and have plans for expansion that could be stymied. China has used these tactics before, notably against South Korea and Japan during previous political spats, with carmakers from the two nations among the victims.
One example: Japanese automakers took a major hit in their China sales in 2012 after the fight over disputed islands in the East China Sea worsened. Another: China put a huge a dent in tourism in South Korea by banning package tours in 2017 amid a dispute over a missile shield.
Then there’s the currency. China has pleased trading partners in recent times by allowing greater appreciation of the yuan, but there is no guarantee it will stick to this. The yuan is the worst-performing currency in Asia since mid-June, sliding more than 3 percent
And of course there’s also the ""nuclear option."" While it seems unlikely as China would also suffer greatly, it could offload some of hits huge hoard of U.S. Treasuries.
Unless the U.S. and China reach a compromise, the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies looks to be headed for a new level.

857,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","As China Steps Up, Japan Isn’t Stepping Aside","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China doesn’t quite have the game sewn up.
So bad is the West’s public-relations standing in the era of Trump and Brexit that it’s easy to see Chinese ascendancy as a welcome stabilizer in markets, finance, economics and trade. Awe at President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative is a prime example, conveying the unhealthy notion that democracies can’t do big things anymore and China is sweeping all before it.
The same mythology characterizes China as the only country that matters in Asia. Suddenly in the Western mind, Asia is China and China is Asia. (Never mind that as recently as the 1990s, many people said the same thing about Japan.)
Writing off the rest of Asia overlooks the strength of Japanese companies and steps by Tokyo to steer economic policy — not to mention development aid — toward countering Chinese influence. A secondary theme is the sense that America, Japan’s closest economic and security ally since 1945, is increasingly inward looking and unreliable.
Japan needs to diversify its portfolio. The country wants back in the game and is enlisting partners where it can. India, which feels encircled by China, is eager for an ally. In September, prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Narendra Modi jointly announced plans to build a bullet-train line financed almost entirely by Japan. India gets infrastructure, and Japanese companies like Hitachi and Kawasaki Heavy get contracts. A few months earlier, the two leaders unveiled the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, aimed at joint development in Africa. The contest with China, which has made big inroads into Africa, is impossible to miss.
In Southeast Asia, Japanese companies are also winning the infrastructure race. Not only are they doing more business than Chinese firms among the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, they remain the dominant Asian direct foreign investor. Together with the U.S. and the European Union, Japan accounted for more than half the total in 2015.
Chinese companies may catch up. And the Chinese military may come to dominate Asian security. But Japan isn’t going to acquiesce. Japanese interests haven’t just packed up and headed for their low-growth, low-inflation home turf.
On the contrary, conditions at home are partly responsible for corporate Japan’s renewed interest in the overseas markets. Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda have made concerted efforts to reflate and reinvigorate Japan’s economy. They have met with mixed success. Deflation is no longer pervasive, and capital spending plans look promising, but officials and executives still wrestle with the implications of an aging and dwindling population. Prospects for sustained earnings and revenue growth look stronger away from home.
Japanese companies direct a lot of investment toward China, but here again Japan feels the need to diversify. China’s pace of economic growth is still high by almost any measure, but it’s cooled considerably over the past decade and will probably slow to about 6 percent over the next couple of years.
Japanese companies, like other foreign investors, feel increasingly exposed to diplomatic tensions. Imagine if a Japanese minister makes one offhand remark that displeases Beijing. Next thing you know, that plant in Guangzhou is placed on hold or, as was the case with South Korean conglomerate Lotte, fire safety rules suddenly become an issue.
It was different when China was building its economy and needed to catch up to the major industrial powers. That era is over. “Made in China 2025,” another signature Xi initiative, may offer opportunities for technology investment, but that program is about making China great. Not anyone else.
The idea of a Japanese “southern strategy” has roots in the country’s history. As Corey Wallace writes in International Affairs, the concept has been around since the Meiji era in the late 19th century. Back then it had military as well as commercial components.
However it diversifies its portfolio, Japan is sending one clear message: China hasn’t yet vanquished all competitors."

859,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Moves Forward on Proposed $200 Billion China Tariff List,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration pushed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on additional $200 billion in Chinese products by releasing a list of targets, marking a sharp escalation in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
The tariffs could take effect after public consultations end on Aug. 30, according to a statement from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office Tuesday. The proposed list of goods includes consumer items such as clothing, television components and refrigerators as well as other high-tech items, but it omitted some high-profile products like mobile phones.
The U.S. said it had no choice but to move forward on the new tariffs after China failed to respond to the administration’s concerns over unfair trade practices and Beijing’s abuse of American intellectual property, according to two senior officials who spoke to reporters. High-level talks between the two countries starting in May failed to deliver a breakthrough to head off a trade war.
“For over a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in an emailed statement. “Unfortunately, China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk. Rather than address our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against U.S. products. There is no justification for such action.”
The move drew immediate condemnation from Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, who called it “reckless” and not “targeted.”
The Trump administration on July 6 imposed 25 percent duties on $34 billion in Chinese imports, the first time the president has implemented tariffs directly on Beijing after threatening to do so for months. The first round of tariffs covered Chinese products ranging from farming plows to machine tools and communications satellites.
China immediately retaliated with duties on the same value of U.S. goods, including soybeans and cars.
In addition, the U.S. is considering separate duties on a further $16 billion in Chinese goods, after a public hearing later this month. China has vowed to retaliate dollar-for-dollar to any further U.S. tariffs.
The International Monetary Fund has warned that a full-blown trade war could undermine the broadest global upswing in years. But Trump hasn’t backed down, arguing that China’s unfair trading practices are hurting American workers.
The president last month asked the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to identify $200 billion of Chinese goods that could be hit with 10 percent tariffs. Since then, the president has said his administration could impose duties on virtually all Chinese imports into the U.S.
Trump has been considering tariffs against China since his officials concluded in March that Beijing violates U.S. intellectual-property rights, such as by forcing American firms to hand over technology.

The official said the decision was not final and that the list of Chinese goods would not become final until after the public had a chance to comment.
The move would be the latest in the escalating trade skirmish between the world's two biggest economies.
Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration was planning to release the list, citing two people familiar with the matter. Another source who is familiar with the situation confirmed the Bloomberg report to Reuters.
Trump last week said the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.

862,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Japan Snubs Homegrown Weaponry to Buy From the U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- While there’s little prospect that Japanese consumers will ever buy enough American cars to please Donald Trump, the Abe government’s record spending on defense is shaping up as a bright spot in bilateral trade for the U.S. president.
Japan’s purchases through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program represent 16 percent of all non-personnel costs for the nation’s self defense forces so far this year, more than double the level in 2014, according to calculations by Bloomberg based on government data.
Plans to buy advanced American radars, stealth fighter jets and missile-defense systems in coming years will mean billions of dollars for U.S. weapons makers. Japanese companies, already struggling to compete, don’t stand to benefit as much because economies of scale have made homegrown technology more expensive and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government wants to get more bang for its buck.
During a visit to Tokyo last November, Trump urged Abe to buy “massive amounts of military equipment” from the U.S. Even without the incentive to ease trade friction, Japan was already an enthusiastic consumer as Abe pushed defense spending to a record 5.2 trillion yen ($47 billion) this fiscal year to counter both a nuclear-armed North Korea and a more assertive China.
To Trump’s dismay, Japan bought just $533 million in new passenger vehicles from the U.S. in 2017 while Americans purchased $39.8 billion in Japanese cars and trucks. Outside the military sphere, Japan has looked to boost energy purchases such as liquefied natural gas to placate the U.S. The nation’s biggest imports from the U.S. in 2017 were agricultural products, chemicals and machinery.
Local Jobs
A preference for U.S. equipment helps the two militaries work together more smoothly, but buying complete American weapons systems doesn’t generate jobs for local parts makers and will drive them out of business, according to Naohiko Abe, senior vice president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. It’s Japan’s biggest defense contractor, making fighter planes, helicopters, ships, missiles, and other weapons.
While there is little threat to domestic production of warships, costs are an issue especially for aircraft.
A finance ministry committee has recommended switching to the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT).-made C-130 J30 cargo plane, which although slower and with a shorter range, costs less than half the cost of the domestically produced C-2. Japan will buy two C-2s from Kawasaki Heavy Industries this fiscal year, after buying three last year.
F-35A Fighters
Japan is currently purchasing new F-35A fighters to replace decades-old planes. The next battleground for domestic manufacturers will be who makes the fighter jet to replace the F-2, which is the last domestically produced fighter.
Even before new F-2 production ended in 2011, suppliers were fleeing the defense business. Sumitomo Electric Industries started ending its business with the defense ministry in 2007, citing a poor growth outlook, and in 2010, Yokohama Rubber Co. ceased making airplane tires for the ministry. In 2016, 52 of 72 companies supplying the industry said they’d seen parts makers disappear and supply disruptions, according to a ministry survey.
The F-2 will start to retire from 2030, and companies including Mitsubishi Heavy and IHI Corp. developed the X-2, an advanced technology demonstrator jet, to show that a replacement fighter could be built domestically. “Japan must take the lead of development in order for the domestic industry to survive,” Mitsubishi Heavy’s Abe told the media last month.
The successful 2016 test flight of the jet showed that the domestic industry is fully capable of developing the replacement, he said. But the local Jiji Press reported in March that the defense ministry had ruled out a domestically produced jet, citing high costs.
While Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera has denied those media reports, the ministry is looking to develop the plane jointly with overseas companies. Reuters recently reported that it issued requests for information to manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe.
Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers want defense spending to support domestic companies. Kenji Wakamiya, director of the LDP’s national defense division, said in May that it was important to support domestic companies and help them become competitive against foreign competitors.
Military Exports
An LDP committee also recommended June 1 that Abe increase the defense budget further, as it’s still less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, well below the 2 percent that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has set for its members.
In order to bring down costs, Wakamiya wants Japan to boost exports of its military equipment so that production will increase, but so far, there’s been little success.
On top of cost, strict limits on information disclosure get in the way of making deals, according to Takashi Yoshimura, a director of the industrial technology bureau at Japan’s biggest business lobby.
Defense companies ""are gritting their teeth and getting on with it out of a sense of mission,” he said, adding that “their efforts are reaching the limit.”

Huh Chin-kyu, the 77-year-old founder and chairman of Seoul-based Iljin Group, has become his country’s latest billionaire thanks to increasing demand for the firm’s copper coils, a key component of rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles. The company’s Iljin Materials unit has posted a 15 percent jump in adjusted revenue since adding Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co., China’s biggest electric-carmaker, as a customer in 2015.
“Supplying to the number-one player in China for three years is a premium factor for Iljin,” said Han Byung-hwa, an analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities in Seoul. The company’s market value has quadrupled to about 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) since 2015.
Huh’s net worth, which also includes his family’s stakes in the firm’s other units, has swelled to $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. An Iljin Materials spokesman declined to comment on the valuation.
China became the world’s largest market for electric vehicles in 2015 after sales there more than doubled. Global sales of of new-energy vehicles, or NEVs, are expected to grow to 11 million in 2025 from 1.1 million last year, with China accounting for almost 50 percent of that total, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
The Xi Jinping government will require Chinese automakers to earn NEV credits equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales starting next year, which could mean more business for Iljin.
The company is building a new copper foil plant in Malaysia that will expand its production capacity by 10,000 tons annually and help it supply other Chinese clients, including battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Han said. Before acquiring BYD as a customer, Iljin Materials primarily catered to South Korean firms such as Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co., which supplies batteries to automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and BMW AG.
Huh, who studied metallurgical engineering at Seoul National University, started a small foundry in the front yard of his house in 1968 with 300,000 won investment. The company now has 45 affiliated units and combined revenue of 2.3 trillion won, according to the spokesman.
‘Study Engineering’
“If you want to make a small amount of money, go to medical school or law school,” Huh said at the company’s 50th anniversary celebration in January. “But if you want to make lots of money and contribute to the country’s development, go study engineering.”
Huh was in court last year after he was found to have hidden about $13 million in an offshore shell company, according to local media reports. He was ordered to pay a fine of 700 million won and, according to the company spokesman, doesn’t plan to appeal the verdict.

The central bank will raise rates by a quarter point to 1.5 percent on Wednesday but will refrain from hiking again for the remainder of the year as trade tensions overshadow firming inflation and a stock market that’s trading at record highs, Kurt Reiman said in an interview Tuesday.
“As we enter the second half, portfolios need to have greater resilience to some of these unanticipated potential shocks,” Reiman said. He recommends investors shift some of their money from equities into short-duration fixed income and focus on U.S. and emerging-market technology stocks.
“The positive view on U.S. and emerging markets isn’t so much a negative view on the rest of the world, it’s just a consequence of the fact that that’s where the earnings are strongest,” he said. “The technology sector is by no means cheap but its earnings momentum is very strong and we’re seeing upward revisions, so that’s where we’re recommending that investors spend more of their risk budget.”
In Canada, where tech is a tiny part of the S&P/TSX Composite Index at just 4 percent of the benchmark, Reiman is upbeat on energy stocks, as he sees strong demand and geopolitical tensions continuing to support oil prices. He’s also optimistic on banks.
“The part of the market I still hold out hope for delivering a decent result for the second half is financials,” he added, pointing to a solid economy, strong wage growth and the international exposure of the big banks.
“The flattening yield curve has dented enthusiasm and our view is that the curve is likely to steepen out from here,” he said. “That sets up financials globally to do well, and I think Canadian financials should be able to participate.”

865,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Ukraine's PrivatBank open to settlement with former owners,"By Matthias Williams and Natalia Zinets
KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's biggest bank does not rule out settling a legal dispute with its former main shareholders out of court, the head of PrivatBank's supervisory board said on Tuesday. 
The Ukrainian authorities took PrivatBank into state hands in December 2016 and have spent nearly $6 billion so far to plug a hole in its balance sheet caused by what the government says were fraudulent lending practices and money-laundering. 
The former owners, two of Ukraine's richest men, dispute the authorities' assessment of the bank's health when it was nationalized. The case led to hundreds of lawsuits and the authorities see it as a test of their fight against corruption.
An investigation commissioned by the central bank in January found 95 percent of PrivatBank's corporate loans had gone to companies linked to the former owners or their affiliates. As a result, more than 85 percent of its portfolio is made up of non-performing loans as of June 1, the central bank says.
Engin Akchakocha, head of the PrivatBank's supervisory board, said ""every option is on the table"" when asked if he would consider an out-of-court settlement with the bank's former main shareholders, although he said he did not want to comment directly on the legal cases.
""Resolving a problem peacefully is easier and better than trying to resolve it through a fight,"" he said. 
""It all needs appropriate willpower and goodwill,"" he said when asked about the prospect of the former owners helping tackle PrivatBank's bad loans. 
""As of today, we are not in communication with the former shareholders of the bank on resolving these issues on a voluntary basis,"" he said, but he added that he did not rule out such a route.
Lawyers for Ihor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov, the two former main shareholders, could not immediately be reached for comment.
PREPARING FOR SALE
Akchakocha was appointed chairman of the supervisory board in January 2017, after working as chief banking regulator in Turkey during its financial crisis in 2001. 
Under his guidance, PrivatBank aims to return to profit in 2018 after two years of losses and to find a buyer by 2022.
The bank's strategy includes focusing mostly on retail banking and making only limited forays into corporate lending, said Akchakocha, adding that PrivatBank had implemented a range of changes to its governance since nationalization.
The supervisory board ""started to change the bank's way of doing business, understanding of risk, and implementing controls,"" he said, adding this included re-establishing a risk management unit, an internal audit department and a compliance office.
PrivatBank's non-performing loans needed to be removed from its balance sheet for a successful privatization, he said, adding the bank might need to be split up to make it attractive for a sale due to its size.
The bank had assets of 254.6 billion hryvnias ($9.7 billion) as of end-March 2018. 
Asked if foreign financial institutions could become shareholders before a full privatization, he said: ""If we think that it will add to the value of the final transaction, it may be an option.""

But he said it was still early to consider a potential investors.

Italy's anti-establishment League/5-Star Movement coalition had nominated Savona to be its first economy minister last month, but President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment because of Savona's scepticism about euro zone membership. 
The academic who was eventually named economy minister, Giovanni Tria, has committed Italy to keeping the euro. 
""We may find ourselves in a position where it's not we who decide but others,"" Savona told a panel of senators. ""My position regarding a Plan B ... is that we have to be ready for all eventualities.""
Italian bond yields initially rose after Savona's remarks and Milan's blue-chip share index erased earlier gains, but then yields returned to their previous levels and stocks partially recovered.
""He is a well-known eurosceptic and he seems to be being deliberately provocative,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. 
""To the extent that we knew his views already, the latest comments provide a reminder that there are people in the government with these views and that the Italian government is on a path of confrontation with the European Union,"" he added.
The governing coalition of the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League plans sweeping tax cuts and higher welfare spending, which is likely to lead the government to renegotiate its budget deficit targets with Brussels. 
Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco warned the government on Tuesday to be cautious with public finances to avoid upsetting financial markets and increasing public debt, which is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's. 
Savona, an 81-year-old former university professor, wrote in a book published this year that Italy's entry into the euro zone was a ""historic mistake"". He has a distinguished academic record and also once worked at the Bank of Italy. 
Savona told the senators he would meet with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi ""as soon as this encounter is over,"" but he later told reporters the meeting would not be on Tuesday, as they had assumed.

He said he intended to meet Draghi but the appointment had not yet been arranged.

LONDON (Reuters) - S&P Global is watching Turkey closely, the rating agency said on Tuesday, and it warned that President Tayyip Erdogan's move to install his son-in-law as finance minister showed power in the country was now increasingly centralized.
S&P rates Turkey at BB-, lower than rivals Moody's and Fitch following a downgrade in May, but one of its senior sovereign analysts, Frank Gill, told Reuters the country's political changes were keeping it in focus.
""It is a bit premature to rush to conclusions, but obviously decision making is increasingly centralized,"" Gill said after Erdogan appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as the treasury and finance minister in his new cabinet.
""When institutions are working in sovereigns, you have a strong civil service which can take decisions, technical decisions which often take place at a non-political level,"" but was no longer the case in Turkey, he said.
S&P has a stable outlook on its local and foreign-currency Turkey ratings and has warned its fiscal metrics could sour quickly if the current pressure on its financial markets continues. That is likely to depend on what Erdogan and the government do next.
""We are watching closely what the policy on the state of emergency will be, what the overall fiscal stance is going to be,"" Gill said. ""Will there be further extensions of the credit guarantee scheme? And where is the growth going to come from given that we feel the funding capacity of the banks is close to exhausted?""
He also questioned whether the government would start pumping additional stimulus into the economy to combat the expected hit to growth from recent interest rate hikes. If it does, that could drive up the government's debt levels.
""If you think that Turkey has a very large current account deficit and in the past it was mostly intermediated by the banks essentially leveraging externally, it seems like the last sector that can keep high growth going is the public sector, which would mean more external leverage (debt).
""But we don't know yet whether that is going to be the case.""

869,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",Erdogan's New Dynasty Makes Turkey Uninvestable,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unfortunately is a man of his word. He promised to take greater control of monetary policy during the election campaign, and he has wasted no time in doing so. He has snipped the last threads in Turkey's safety net – and he has made his nation all but uninvestable. 
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, and Finance Minister Naci Agbal have both departed. They were the kinds of officials global investors like to see – committed to sound financial management and standard economic principles. They did a lot to soothe investors’ nervousness as Erdogan tightened his grip on the country. There seems to be no one left to fulfill that role. 
The President said Monday that his son-in-law, , will run a new combined ministry of treasury and finance. This crushes any hopes that sense and responsibility will reign in fiscal matters. Erdogan has also given himself the power to name the central bank governor, and thus the ability to entrench his unorthodox view that higher interest rates cause faster inflation. 
Tuesday’s painful market reaction is probably only the start. The lira weakened versus the dollar, 10-year yields soared to over 17 percent, credit default swaps widened and stocks fell, with a 3.7 percent drop in the banking industry leading the declines. It is hard to see the credit rating companies not taking a dim view of the new political realities and cutting Turkey's ratings deeper into junk.
For investors, the best course is almost certainly to stay away. There is nothing to pin down the value of the currency. Nor is it a prime target to short. It would cost an incredibly steep 17.75 percent – at least – to borrow lira in order to buy it back later at a cheaper price. This is a game for only the extremely brave. 
Is this a currency crisis? That depends on how you define it. There’s very little liquidity and a new normal of 5 lira per dollar looks to be on its way. That kind of fundamental shift in a thin market certainly smells like a crisis, especially given that now it seems only an official intervention can calm investors’ fears.
It’s hard to see that this will be forthcoming. The normal events that investors could look toward for reassurance look hopeless. Any budget announcement will most likely involve Albayrak turning on the fiscal taps to boost spending in electorally-sensitive areas, such as the major cities, where the ruling AK party has less support. The next central bank meeting, on July 24, is an opportunity to tame price gains by raising rates. It is difficult to see Erdogan approving any increase, and demanding a cut can’t be ruled out. Inflation soared to 15.4 percent in June, and government policies, plus a weaker currency, look primed to push this higher. 
The President could yet decide to turn things around. He’d allowed 500 basis points of interest-rate increases since late April – this suggests he’s not immune to the implications of a sliding lira when Turkey’s massive current account deficit leaves it so reliant on dollar funding. But given his ridiculous views on monetary policy, and that he’s shown his true colors, that looks unlikely. 
The weakest link is the banking system. Lenders have been gorging on cheap short-term financing in dollars and euros, and as I’ve written, this has been largely immune to rising rates. Most of the creditors are Western European banks, and any sign that they’re seriously backing away will raise questions about the stability of Turkish financial institutions. Such a shift in sentiment would surely impact big Turkish corporate borrowers, many of which have large redemptions coming due over the next year or so – mostly in dollars. 
The fate of Turkey is entirely in Erdogan’s hands. And that’s what’s worrying investors.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>","Don't take risks with economy, Italy's central bank tells new government","By Giuseppe Fonte and Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - The head of Italy's central bank on Tuesday warned the new anti-establishment government to be cautious with public finances to avoid upsetting financial markets and increasing public debt.
Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco told a gathering of bankers in Rome that Italy's reform effort had petered out and that, if a new financial crisis should hit, it was now ""much more vulnerable than we were 10 years ago"".
The governing coalition of the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League plans sweeping tax cuts and higher welfare spending, but Visco said nervousness on financial markets and Italy's huge public debt argued for a cautious approach.
""Prudence and far-sightedness are needed to avoid (market) tensions and to avoid leaving Italians with a higher debt and lower income in the future,"" he said.
Italy's public debt, at around 132 percent of national output, is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's.
Visco backed a plan to pool together Italy's small mutual banks - which the government has suggested it may suspend - saying the changes will make it easier for them to raise capital and avoid possible crises.
He also called for the completion of a reform passed by the previous government forcing the larger, so-called ""popolari"" or co-operative banks, to become joint stock companies.
Consolidation of the banking sector ""remains the most efficient tool to address inefficiencies and guarantee access to capital"", he said.
MOST SLUGGISH
Visco said the reduction of bad loans at Italy's banks was proceeding well, with the value of soured credit sold through a state guarantee scheme adopted in 2016 amounting to 32 billion euros, and expected to rise ""significantly"" in coming months. 
Italy has been the most sluggish economy in the euro zone since the launch of monetary union in 1999. The coalition that took office last month says it will work to change Europe's fiscal rules to allow it to spend more on public investments, cut taxes and provide income support for the poor.
""There is certainly a need for public investments, to be chosen and implemented with maximum efficiency, just as there is a need for a broad and balanced tax reform,"" Visco said in his first remarks since the government came to power.
However, he added that such measures needed to be ""administered with care"" to avoid an increase in debt, and said ""it would be risky to rely only on them in an effort to get out of the low-growth trap Italy has been in for so long"".
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, an academic who is not a member of either ruling party, has promised the government's program will be implemented gradually, while keeping public accounts in order and reducing the debt burden.
However, speaking at the same conference as Visco, he said boosting growth was ""no less important"" than meeting public finance targets, and promised to fight against any euro zone reforms that penalized Italy.

He said that ""the time is ripe for a sharing of risks"" to strengthen the euro zone's banking system, and that it was a ""mistake"" to subordinate the need for risk-sharing below risk-reduction - a reference to the approach favored by Germany.

The Fed said it was ""concerned that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn."" Economists say if either threat materializes, it will alter the Fed's policy of gradual, incremental interest rate increases.And that, they say, increases the chance that the Fed will either do too much or too little in trying to strike the right balance.

872,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Temasek Can Beat Trump's Trade War,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Temasek Holdings Pte wants to slow down, lest it wander too far from its base just as the skies start to darken. A messy trade war, coupled with rising U.S. interest rates and credit strain in China, could make a last-minute hunt for yield risky.
The state investor of one of the world’s most open economies made S$29 billion ($21.4 billion) in fresh bets last fiscal year to create S$14 billion of wealth for its only shareholder – Singapore’s finance ministry.
The one-year return of 12 percent on its S$308 billion portfolio of everything from Singaporean telecoms firms to Chinese banks, American payment systems and European chemicals companies makes it a good year. However, rolling 20-year returns, which used to be in the 13 percent to 17 percent vicinity until 2013, have halved as Western central banks inflated asset prices.
Now that the easy-money cycle is reversing, Temasek says it will slow the pace of investments over the coming nine to 18 months.
With U.S. President Donald Trump’s late-stage fiscal stimulus forcing the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, the worry for investors is the spillover effect on global growth. Besides, like everyone else, Temasek is becoming increasingly concerned about the Trump administration's hardline approach to trading partners, especially China. Compared with last year, the firm’s returns expectations over the next 20 years are mellower, and more uncertain.
Simulations last year looked something like this:
This year, the bell curve is flatter:
Mind you, Temasek doesn't expect a full-blown tariff war (yet). But the current period of “hyper trade tension,” as Michael Buchanan, head of portfolio strategy and risk, describes it, will be damaging.
Among Temasek’s top investments, DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Singapore’s biggest bank, gave total shareholder returns of 46 percent in the year through March 31. China Construction Bank Corp. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. may have failed to match  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s 60 percent payday, but they still earned Temasek a tidy 26 to 29 percent. Temasek saw a five in six chance last year of its portfolio earning it anything between minus 11 percent to 14 percent. At 12 percent, the return was near the top end of expectations. For the fiscal year that started in April, it anticipates an outcome in the range of negative 17 percent to 24 percent. The uncertainty has worsened.
Investors with more aggressive mandates may want to chase risk, but returns from Temasek (and sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte) are crucial for financing the city-state’s government budget. Doing less may be just the right thing.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Central Bank defended its 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying program before the European Union's top court on Tuesday from accusations it was bankrolling governments and endangering taxpayer money.
The case, brought by a group of eurosceptic politicians and academics from Germany, aims to stop the ECB's current stimulus program, which is nearing its end, and is likely to set a precedent for any future scheme.
It was referred to the Luxembourg-based General Court of the European Union by Germany's constitutional court last year, with a number of questions about whether the ECB broke EU rules with its debt purchases.
The people who brought the case claim the program violates a ban on monetary financing and make the Bundesbank, and with it the German taxpayer, liable for losses suffered by other national central banks under the program.
""The ECB lacks democratic legitimacy,"" Dietrich Murswiek, the lawyer of one of the claimants, told the EU court.
But the ECB said in its own written response that it was respecting the treaties by only buying from investors, rather than directly from governments, and that risks for central banks were limited.
""The examination of the questions referred did not reveal anything that could affect the validity of the decision,"" the ECB's lawyers wrote.
The ECB said last month it expected to end its bond purchases at the end of the year, but it would keep re-investing for a long time the cash it gets from bonds that mature.
The German government and central bank, which expressed their scepticism when the program began in 2015 and for a long time after that, stood behind the ECB on Tuesday. But Berlin made its support conditional on imposing a cap on the potential exposure of its central bank to losses elsewhere.
""The provision should be interpreted as not allowing an unlimited liability on a central bank for the losses of another central bank,"" the German government's lawyer Ulrich Haede told the court.
Under the current scheme, only 20 percent of the bonds bought by euro zone central banks are ""risk-shared"", meaning any loss from them would be spread across the euro zone.
But the German provision was unlikely to be welcome by the ECB, since it might tie the central bank's hands when designing any future program.
""The Court should set strict limits to the bond-buying program for the future, so that the ECB does not completely become a plaything for fiscal policy,"" Friedrich Heinemann, an economist at Germany's ZEW institute, said.

1. U.S. Stock Futures Point To More Gains
U.S. stock futures looked set to open modestly higher, as investors temporarily set aside recent trade-related concerns and instead switched focus to the upcoming corporate earnings season.
At 5:30AM ET, the blue-chip Dow futures were up 45 points, or around 0.2%, the S&P 500 futures tacked on 3 points, or roughly 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 17 points, or about 0.2%.
U.S. stocks enjoyed their best day in over a month on Monday, with the Dow booking a 1.3% gain, helped by bank, industrial and energy shares.
Elsewhere, European shares were a tad higher in mid-morning trade, on course to post a sixth straight advance, as strong commodities sectors continued to support the market.
Earlier, Asian shares closed mostly higher, with Japan's Nikkei leading gainers in the region. China’s Shanghai Composite - which scored its biggest daily jump since August 2016 on Monday - ended 0.4% higher.
2. Pepsi Reports Earnings
PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings of $1.61 per share ahead of the opening bell, beating forecasts for $1.53. Net revenue rose 2.4% to $16.09 billion, due to higher sales growth in its Frito-Lay unit in North America that helped offset weak demand for beverages.
The consumer giant's snack business, the company's largest, grew 4.3%.
Sales in its North America beverage unit fell for the fourth straight quarter, down about 1% to $5.19 billion
Wall Street's second-quarter earnings season kicks off this week, with four of the biggest U.S banks -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) - all reporting Friday.
Q2 earnings growth is tipped to be 20.7% according to Thomson Reuters data, moderating slightly from a gain of 26.6% the first-quarter, which was the highest in seven years, when results were boosted by tax-cut tailwinds.
However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, with analysts likely to scrutinize outlook statements to see whether to adjust numbers for the rest of 2018.
3. Dollar Bounces Back Ahead Of More Jobs Data
Away from equities, the dollar bounced back from three-week lows against a currency basket, as traders looked ahead to a fresh batch of U.S. economic data to gauge the health of the world's largest economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.3% to 94.07, after falling to as low as 93.44 a day earlier, its lowest since mid-June.
Against the yen, the dollar rose above the 111-handle for the first time since last Tuesday, with USD/JPY last up 0.3% at 111.17.
Meanwhile, in the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the 10-year Treasury yield inching up to 2.865%.
Today's economic calendar will bring investors the May report on job openings, which comes after Friday’s strong June jobs report showed the economy created more jobs than expected.
The NFIB’s latest small business optimism report is also out Tuesday morning. Economists predict a drop to 105.6 in June from 107.8 in May.
On the Federal Reserve front, no Fed officials are expected to give speeches on Tuesday.
4. Oil Prices Extend Gains
Oil prices rose again, with Brent crude leading the way amid yet another potential supply disruption scenario, this time in Norway.
Hundreds of workers on Norwegian oil and gas offshore rigs are due to on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, a move which will likely affect the production of at least one field, Shell (LON:RDSa)'s Knarr.
The news comes as traders are already fretting over production disruptions in Libya and Venezuela and expectations for big declines in Iranian exports as a result of U.S. sanctions.
Brent crude jumped $1.07, or roughly 1.4%, to $79.15 per barrel, following a 1.2% climb on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 45 cents, or 0.6%, at $74.31.
The American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report for the week ended July 6 at 4:30PM ET, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 4.2 million barrels.
5. China To Raise Tariff Rates For Some U.S. Optical Fiber Products
China's commerce ministry said earlier it is raising ""anti-dumping tariff rates"" for some optical fiber products originating from the United States, effective on Wednesday, July 11.
The new anti-dumping tariff rates for dispersion unshifted single-mode optical fiber imported from the U.S. range between 33.3% to 78.2%, compared with 4.7% to 18.6% as set in 2011.
U.S. companies including Corning (NYSE:GLW), OFS Fitel, and Draka Communications Americas are among firms affected by the tariff change, the ministry said on its website.
Concerns over the escalation of the U.S.-China trade dispute have eased somewhat this week, despite new trade tariffs that came into effect last Friday.

All but one of the 16 economists in the Reuters poll predicted the Bank of Korea would stay at 1.50 percent , as the sluggish job market and uncertainty from U.S.-China trade friction limits its readiness to raise borrowing costs. 
But 12 of the 16 respondents said that the BOK would raise its policy interest rate before year-end to curb any potential capital outflows as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to raise its rates. 
“The BOK won't be able to raise rates now, given how shockingly bad the May job report was,"" said Kang Seung-won, an economist with NH Investment & Securities.
Kang says a rate hike is likely in August as the BOK will try to stay on course with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which are expected to raises their rates and scale back monetary stimulus measures this year.
""Domestic job market conditions could also improve in the months ahead as the government's extra budget will be spent this month and next,"" Kang said. 
Statistics Korea said South Korea added 72,000 jobs in May from a year earlier, well below the annual 123,000 jobs gained in April, marking the weakest increase in more than eight years. 
That, together with falling exports, cast some doubt on any policy tightening this year. The Bank of Korea's last rate move was a 25 basis point hike to 1.50 percent in November. 
June exports were down 0.1 percent from a year earlier, as shipments of cars and consumer electronics fell sharply, slumping from a 13.2 percent jump in May.
""Barring rising U.S. interest rates, the BOK may not be in rush to raise rates again in the near term,"" said Oh Suk-tae, an economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). 
The BOK will also revise its growth outlook on Thursday as part of a quarterly review. It currently sees the economy growing 3 percent this year. 

After Thursday's meeting the central bank has three more rate reviews this year in August, October and November.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Cuba to prune back private sector as new rules start in December,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba will restrict business licenses to one per person under new private sector regulations which come into force in December amid fears reforms to open up its ailing economy have gone too far and are fuelling inequality.
The long-awaited changes, due to be published on Tuesday, come after the ruling Communist Party admitted errors in its implementation of economic reforms introduced by Raul Castro after he took over from his brother Fidel in 2008.
Many Cubans are frustrated as the pace of reform has slowed in recent years and believe Havana is not truly committed to giving the private sector and foreign investment greater roles.
The economy has struggled to grow with declining subsidies from Venezuela, tighter U.S. trade and travel regulations, lower exports and the impact of various storms.
A person owning several businesses was ""distant from the principles that sustain the approved policy,"" Deputy Labor Minister Marta Elena Feitó Cabrera was quoted as saying by ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma, without elaborating.
Some Cuban entrepreneurs have already signed businesses in name over to relatives or trusted friends in expectation of the rule changes, which the government announced last year.
The new regulations are the first major policy announcement since Miguel Diaz-Canel took office as president in April after his mentor Raul Castro stepped down, although they had been under review since long before that. Reuters reported on a draft similar to the approved regulations in February.
Under the new rules, the number of self-employment categories will be consolidated into fewer ones, according to Granma, in a bid to cut down on bureaucracy.
The number of self-employed has nearly quadrupled to more than 591,000 since 2010, around 13 percent of the overall workforce, the newspaper reported.
The Caribbean island's efforts to cut its bloated state payroll and kick-start growth by fostering private enterprise have sparked a broader debate around wealth accumulation and rising inequality.
The earnings of some private business owners dwarf the modest income of most self-employed and meager Cuban public sector wages.
The government has also complained about entrepreneurs evading taxes and buying goods on the black market. The new rules increase controls to prevent such malpractices.
The official gazette will publish 20 legal norms bundled into several decrees, as well as 14 complementary resolutions, Granma said, breaking down the details that emerged in a briefing with government officials.
The regulations will become effective 150 days after their publication, it wrote, at which point the government will unfreeze the issuance of licenses for the 27 categories of self-employment for which it had suspended new permits last August.
The number of private sector business categories allowed will drop to 123 from 201 previously, Granma said.
Feitó Cabrera said however no activities were being eliminated, they were simply being grouped together into broader categories.

""From Switzerland's point of view, the additional duties, which according to the U.S. have been introduced to protect national security, are unjustified,"" the statement from the Swiss economy ministry said in a statement.
Under WTO rules, the United States has 60 days to settle the issue. After that time, Switzerland could escalate the dispute by asking the WTO to set up a panel of judges to adjudicate.

""It would be very positive for Europe if, at a certain point, pan-European banks would be created,"" Dimon said, adding Europe has been too slow so far in adopting common banking rules to favor the development of larger lenders.
In the interview he also expressed concerns about the effects of Brexit and trade tariffs.
""I think that Brexit will ultimately have very heavy consequences for the British people and for growth in Britain ...and the lower growth in Britain will negatively affect global growth, so Brexit will damage almost everyone,"" Dimon said.
He said the negative impact of trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, might even offset the benefits of tax reform in the United States.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's youngest-ever prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has seen her popularity soar at home and abroad, but now must deal with a growing economic problem as gloomy business confidence heads in the opposite direction.
Companies say measures such as a 5 percent increase in the minimum wage, a looming ban on foreign homebuyers and lingering red tape around immigration in the midst of a skills shortage are increasing costs and forcing delays to investment.
Business confidence is at its lowest in seven years, and has been in free-fall since Ardern won elections in September - a stark contrast to the steady sentiment in Australia. The risk, economists say, is that the mood affects investment plans and, ultimately, economic growth.
""There's been a raft of legislative changes that have moved so rapidly,"" said Adam Cunningham, the director of Village Accommodation, a chain of hotels and hostels. ""The message is pretty disconcerting and demotivating.""

Cunningham said he would have to raise prices and slow hiring to cover NZ$850,000 ($578,510) in extra labor costs over the next few years. The Labour-led government raised the minimum wage to NZ$16.50 from NZ$15.75 per hour in April and plans to increase it to NZ$20 by 2021, which Westpac Bank estimates would raise nationwide labor costs by 1 percent.
""That's a lot of money and I don't think there's anyone out there that thinks we've got that hidden in our back pocket,"" Cunningham said.
New Zealand's Treasury forecasts the economy will average about 3 percent annual growth for the next few years, expanding as much as 3.8 percent in the year ending June 2019. The economy grew 2.9 percent in 2017.
But many economists point out that if investment tapers off, so will growth. The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, which produces the business confidence survey, expects 2.5 percent growth this year, while ANZ and Westpac Banks peg growth at 2.6 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.
The business community's outlook contrasts with the approval ratings of 37-year-old Ardern, whose rapid political rise to end a decade of center-right National Party rule was dubbed ""Jacindamania"" across social media.
Ardern, who gave birth to her first child in June, has a net positive performance rating hovering just below 60 percent, up from around 40 percent during the election. It is the highest rating of a leader from either party in the last four years.
Many of Ardern's plans affecting businesses are the fulfilment of a campaign vow to ""make the economy work for all New Zealanders"" and curb rising inequality.
Little of the country's recent economic boom has trickled through to workers; wage growth has remained sluggish despite soaring housing costs.
""There's a moral issue where if you're working full time you should be able to support yourself and your family,"" said Richard Wagstaff, the president of the Council of Trade Unions, which supports wage increases. ""We’re looking to right that balance.""
The government is also facing growing turbulence as negotiations with public workers increasingly lead to strikes.
Nurses are planning a work stoppage this week for the first time in 30 years after rejecting an NZ$520 million offer that included pay increases.
More than 4,000 public officials from the Inland Revenue Department and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment held a two-hour strike on Monday, and the union representing teachers says primary school educators are planning a strike in August.

FILTERING THROUGH
Signs are emerging that businesses' pessimism is filtering through to actual investment plans and expected profits, which could hamper growth. Just 2 percent of companies surveyed in the quarter that ended in June said they planned investments, down from 17 percent at the start of the year, according to data from the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.
Merv Avery, the head of farm equipment dealer TransAg, said he was struggling to move more than a million dollars' worth of machinery, which he took out a loan to cover. One problem, he said, was that farmers held off on buying items like tractors as they anticipated costly pollution regulations from Ardern's Labour Party and its support partner, the Green Party.
""We're stuck with $1.5 million and repaying interest,"" he said.
Even in the construction sector, which looked set for a windfall - Ardern's hallmark policy was to increase the housing supply - there are grumbles because of delays in permits and a construction worker visas.
""I'm trying to go overseas to bring people over and I can't do that until I've got more certainty,"" said Kevin Everett, the Auckland-based director of Building Recruitment, which sources workers from Britain, South Africa and the Philippines.

Some analysts, such as ASB Bank economists, predicted a central bank rate increase would be pushed from August to November next year and say a cut cannot be ruled out.
To be sure, an independent Parliamentary analysis has shown that business confidence sunk under the previous Labour government despite robust growth.
Economists said the concern, then was that gloomy sentiment would manifest as a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" for companies.
""They may put off investment decisions … they spend less, and then that filters through to lower GDP,"" said Jeremy Couchman, senior economist at Kiwibank.
